# Joe Rogan Experience #1975 - Dan Flores
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeehaw. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  How are you Dan? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8.56s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=14.68s)]
*  Great to see you too, Joe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=15.8s)]
*  Listen, man, I know I've talked to you since I read Coyote America, but God damn, that's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=17.8s)]
*  a good book. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=23.84s)]
*  It's such a good book. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=24.84s)]
*  So I'm very excited about this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=26.1s)]
*  I'm sure this is going to be awesome too. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=27.48s)]
*  Wild New World, the epic story of animals and people in America. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=29.0s)]
*  I've told so many people about coyotes because of you and I seem so smart. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=33.0s)]
*  Oh, I appreciate that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=38.04s)]
*  It's such a crazy animal. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=41.52s)]
*  One of the things that's interesting about coyotes in our area is they don't howl. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=43.84s)]
*  I think they've learned. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=49.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's happening in LA too. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=51.04s)]
*  They've learned not to howl. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=55.92s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=57.36s)]
*  It attracts attention to them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=58.36s)]
*  Well, I used to hear it a lot where I lived. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=59.36s)]
*  I lived in Ventura County and we had real problems with them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  They killed all my chickens. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=63.88s)]
*  They were everywhere. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=65.72s)]
*  But also, fucking cool. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=66.72s)]
*  It's such a conflicted thing because I hated them because they killed my chickens. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=69.8s)]
*  They also honey-potted my dog into killing my chickens. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=75.48s)]
*  Did I tell you that story? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=77.76s)]
*  No, you didn't tell me that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=78.76s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=79.76s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=80.76s)]
*  This is how smart these motherfuckers are. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=81.76s)]
*  I had this dog, rest in peace. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=84.2s)]
*  His name is Johnny Cash. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  He was the best dog. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=87.96s)]
*  I'll get sad. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=89.96s)]
*  But, let me catch my breath here because I really love that dog. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=90.96s)]
*  I understand this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=97.96s)]
*  I just lost a dog last May. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=99.32s)]
*  This dog was just such a sweetheart. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=103.96s)]
*  But he was a big dog. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=106.88s)]
*  He was a mastiff, a regency mastiff. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=107.96s)]
*  His father was actually on fear factor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=110.16s)]
*  His father was this, we put people in these big bite suits and they had to run. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=113.28s)]
*  We did it with Belgian malinois. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=118.0s)]
*  The problem was for really super athletic guys, we had some real high-end athletes on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  the show occasionally. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=128.24s)]
*  Like amateur football players. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=130.2s)]
*  Guys were just stacked and strong as hell. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=131.8s)]
*  A malinois, no matter what, it's still only 60, 70 pounds. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=134.2s)]
*  So we brought in these regency mastiffs because they wanted to figure out a dog that could [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=138.44s)]
*  do bite work but was way stronger. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=142.32s)]
*  This dog was like a buck 60 and built like a brick shithouse. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=144.6s)]
*  His dad, my dog's dad, was actually in the movie The Hulk. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=149.56s)]
*  If you ever saw the movie The Hulk with Eric Bannon when they turned the dogs into Hulk [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=153.92s)]
*  dogs, that was actually that dog. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=158.44s)]
*  So my friend Joe, shout out to Joe who raised these dogs, he raised them for intelligence [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=161.88s)]
*  and temperament and he wouldn't let any dog breed that had any aggression towards other [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=166.76s)]
*  dogs or any aggression towards people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=170.72s)]
*  So they were the best dogs. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  And so this dog was hanging out with all these other dogs that were doing bite work and everything [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=175.1s)]
*  and he was just so chill. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=178.44s)]
*  Just hanging out, go, how does this dog so chill? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  And just like, he goes, he's just fucking smart. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=182.16s)]
*  He's smart, he's well raised and well trained and loved. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  So anyway, I had his son and he was the fucking best. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  But he was in the yard during the day and a coyote would come by the fence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=192.94s)]
*  And the fence was six feet high, like a wrought iron fence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=199.84s)]
*  He couldn't get over this fence. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  He didn't even try to get over it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  It was a nice big yard. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  But the coyotes could get over that fence like it didn't even exist. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  It was wild to watch. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=209.68s)]
*  I watched one with a chicken in his mouth jump and put his feet at the top of that fence [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=210.8s)]
*  and over like a Cirque du Soleil acrobat. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  So we had this large coop where the chickens were that the coyotes couldn't figure out [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=220.84s)]
*  a way to get into. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=227.0s)]
*  And then, have you ever raised chickens before? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=228.44s)]
*  My dad raised chickens. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=231.4s)]
*  They do a thing called brooding. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=233.12s)]
*  And what brooding is, chickens lay an egg almost every day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=235.12s)]
*  But none of them are going to become chicks because there's no rooster. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=240.52s)]
*  So these are unfertilized eggs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  But they don't understand that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=246.44s)]
*  So they decide every now and again that this egg is going to become a chick and they won't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=248.18s)]
*  let anyone near it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=252.56s)]
*  And they pluck their feathers out and they just sit on this egg and they stop making [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=253.88s)]
*  eggs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=259.0s)]
*  And they get real weirded out. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=260.0s)]
*  And the only way to cure them of this is to put them in a smaller pen with a post so that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=261.52s)]
*  they have to hold on to the post to stand. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=267.4s)]
*  They can't sit and squat like over an egg. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=269.36s)]
*  So you put a post in there, put a small coop next to the coop. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=272.56s)]
*  It takes a little, I forget how many days it takes, but they get over it and then you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=275.96s)]
*  can put them back in with the regular hens. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=279.56s)]
*  Well, that little coop, this sneaky ass fucking coyote had figured out that he could get my [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=282.0s)]
*  dog to destroy that little coop because my dog was, he was huge. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=288.8s)]
*  And so somehow or another, this coyote became friends with my dog, just kept hanging around. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=294.48s)]
*  And my dog's like, oh, it's another dog because he has a little dog friend. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=300.94s)]
*  Like, this is my other little dog friend. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey, what's up, buddy? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=305.6s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=306.6s)]
*  He's like, hey, you want to know where the chickens are? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=307.6s)]
*  And my pool guy fucked up and left one of the gates open into where the chickens usually are. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=310.44s)]
*  And I was inside the house with my kids and my wife and we were playing some sort of a game. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=315.92s)]
*  I forget what game it was, but I saw in the background a coyote run across the backyard [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=322.2s)]
*  and hop the fence with the chicken in his mouth. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm like, motherfuckers. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=330.08s)]
*  I thought maybe somebody left the coop open or something happened. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=331.76s)]
*  So I run outside and there's Johnny standing over this destroyed coop that he was so proud [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=334.96s)]
*  that he busted apart. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  The coyote tricked him into smashing that coop and then the coyote grabbed the chicken [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  and ran off with it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  I wish I had known about this story when I was writing Coyote America. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  I want to put it in there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=354.28s)]
*  How amazing is that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=355.76s)]
*  Like there's no doubt in my mind that that coyote tricked that dog into doing that because [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  that dog had never destroyed that coop. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=361.68s)]
*  And then afterwards he realized he's so strong, he can go right through the whole coop. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=364.0s)]
*  So he tore a hole in the mesh, the chicken wire, he just tore it apart. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=369.28s)]
*  He was so big. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=374.68s)]
*  And then he went in and killed nine of them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=375.96s)]
*  Your dog killed nine of them? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=378.68s)]
*  Yeah, he killed nine of them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=379.68s)]
*  I had 22 of them at one point in time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=380.68s)]
*  And he killed nine of them in just as much time as it took for him to get out there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=383.0s)]
*  He fucked up a couple other ones too, but they lived. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=389.08s)]
*  He was just grabbing them and shaking them and grabbing them and shaking. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=391.26s)]
*  He was having a party. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=393.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, he was taught to do that by the fucking coyotes. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=394.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is an example of what one would call animal culture. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=397.78s)]
*  I make an argument for it in Wild New World that this is something that happens fairly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=403.34s)]
*  commonly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=409.38s)]
*  Animals, just like us, have culture and they teach one another things. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=410.38s)]
*  That sounds like a pretty good for instance of it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=414.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, they're so clever. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=417.06s)]
*  They're so clever. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  It's so interesting, our thoughts about intelligence. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=420.58000000000004s)]
*  Because just until recently, we've realized how intelligent ravens and crows are. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=424.26000000000005s)]
*  They can use tools. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  They understand water displacement. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  So if they can't drink out of something, they'll drop rocks into it so the water level raises [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=435.06s)]
*  so they can drink out of it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=439.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's brilliant stuff. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=440.98s)]
*  So I wonder, because we don't have a way of measuring that with coyotes, I wonder how [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=443.62s)]
*  smart those motherfuckers are. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=448.38s)]
*  Well, they are, I think, probably among the smartest of the wild animals, certainly in [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=450.38s)]
*  America. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know, one of the reasons we domesticated wolves and created dogs out of them is because, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=459.34000000000003s)]
*  for one thing, we understood them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=465.90000000000003s)]
*  They live in the same kind of circumstances we do and social groups. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=468.42s)]
*  They have to acculturate their pups just the way we have to do with kids. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=472.22s)]
*  And so I think part of the explanation for why dogs are our oldest domesticate is because [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=477.42s)]
*  of their ability to understand us, to understand human language. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=486.54s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the theories for early domestication of wolves is that there were [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=492.3s)]
*  some of them that were not only hyper social and so amenable to being with humans and hanging [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=496.3s)]
*  out with us, but also because there are some that were gifted word learners. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=504.42s)]
*  We didn't have to learn their language. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=510.3s)]
*  They learned our language. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think that is probably an indication of, you know, coyotes are out of the canid [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=514.52s)]
*  family. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=520.82s)]
*  All these creatures come out of the same family from 5.3 million years back. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think coyotes in some respects may be the shrewdest and cleverest of all those groups [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=528.0600000000001s)]
*  because unlike wolves, they're not the big brawny dogs on the block. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=533.66s)]
*  They're the ones who have to play this game of, man, I can't let this big burly wolf get [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=537.38s)]
*  me. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=542.98s)]
*  I've got to figure out how to elude it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=543.98s)]
*  And that's that's responsible for a lot of their intelligence and cleverness is they [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=545.6999999999999s)]
*  co-evolved alongside wolves for so long. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=550.38s)]
*  They had to learn how to be the little guy who managed to survive by his wits. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=553.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=558.54s)]
*  And also one of the things that I learned from your book that's a good thing to bring [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=559.54s)]
*  up here is that they are not directly related to gray wolves. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=562.5s)]
*  So they didn't interbreed with them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=566.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=568.46s)]
*  Interbreed with red wolves. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=569.46s)]
*  So when the gray wolves were around, the gray wolves just slaughtered them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=570.46s)]
*  And so they had developed this ability to spread their territory, which is what when [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=574.7s)]
*  humans started killing them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=580.98s)]
*  Now they're in every single city in the country. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=582.9s)]
*  And this is like when did that happen? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=585.38s)]
*  It's relatively recent, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=587.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=589.42s)]
*  The mission started really out of two things, two things that took place in the early 20th [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=591.3399999999999s)]
*  century. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=597.42s)]
*  One was the elimination of wolves in the east, which created an open niche for a midsize [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=598.54s)]
*  predator. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=605.54s)]
*  And the other was this campaign that first the states and then the federal government [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=606.54s)]
*  began to launch against against coyotes and wolves in the west. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=610.86s)]
*  The government was the government hunters were pretty successful in taking out wolves [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=616.14s)]
*  because wolves are so attuned to be pack animals that if you kill one wolf in a pack, you could [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=621.34s)]
*  use the scent from that wolf basically to catch, trap, kill every single wolf in the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=628.7800000000001s)]
*  pack. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=635.4200000000001s)]
*  But coyotes responded to that basically by going you probably remember our conversation [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  about this, Joe. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=641.14s)]
*  Back in 2017, they would go into what's known as a fission mode. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=642.66s)]
*  They are coyotes like humans are fission fusion animals. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=647.62s)]
*  And when they're in fusion, they can exist in a pack. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=652.42s)]
*  When they're in fission, they break apart the packs and in singles and pairs, they scatter. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=655.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's what they do when they're pressured. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=661.5799999999999s)]
*  They learned how to do this from wolves. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=663.7199999999999s)]
*  And so when we started trying to take them out with poisons and gunning in the west, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=665.8199999999999s)]
*  they went into this fission mode and it caused them to start spreading across the country. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=671.04s)]
*  And that started in the early 20th century. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=675.92s)]
*  I mean, when I was growing up in Louisiana in the 1960s, coyotes were first beginning [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=678.24s)]
*  to appear in Louisiana, which is how I got fascinated with them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=683.9s)]
*  First beginning. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=688.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, first beginning in the early 1960s. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=689.5999999999999s)]
*  I started seeing them in about 1962 or something, 61 or two. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  Is there a historical record of them ever being on the East Coast previously? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=699.84s)]
*  No, there is not. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=704.12s)]
*  So they really were just a West Coast animal? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=706.44s)]
*  Well, there's an archaeological, a couple of archaeological sites dating from the Pleistocene [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=708.36s)]
*  from 10,000 years ago that appear to show coyotes probably fairly randomly appearing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=715.12s)]
*  in places like Virginia and Pennsylvania. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=723.52s)]
*  In the historical record that we have, they weren't on the East Coast until the middle [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=727.24s)]
*  of the 20th century. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=733.24s)]
*  And they start showing up in northern New York and upstate New York by about the 1920s [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=734.5799999999999s)]
*  or so. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=742.68s)]
*  And they start coming down south from that point until, I mean, they're finally, they're [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=743.68s)]
*  reaching Manhattan, for example, in the 1990s. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=749.8199999999999s)]
*  Had this, had they already, had wolves already been extirpated at this point? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=754.42s)]
*  Yeah, wolves had been taken out. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=758.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the great, you know, and I talk about it in Wild New World, the whole wolf campaign [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=760.14s)]
*  in America. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=766.5s)]
*  But the two guys who put together this classic volume on wolves, the wolves of North America, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=767.5s)]
*  Stanley Young and E.A. Goldman published this work in 1944, they're government hunters. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=775.2199999999999s)]
*  They argued that by 1944, there are no wolves at all left east of the Mississippi River. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=783.76s)]
*  They're all gone. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=793.9s)]
*  There are wolves down in Louisiana. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=795.78s)]
*  In the deep south, there are still some red wolves. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=798.86s)]
*  There's 1,400 or so gray wolves up in the Great Lakes country. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=801.2s)]
*  But even in the West, I mean, in their book in 1944, they claim there are only six wolves [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=805.62s)]
*  remaining in the state of Wyoming. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=811.36s)]
*  Even with all those animals and all that public lands, I mean, the campaign against wolves [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=814.72s)]
*  has been that successful. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=819.24s)]
*  So yeah, by 1950 or so, there are no wolves in the east, and that opens up this niche [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=820.92s)]
*  for coyotes to come in and fill it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=826.98s)]
*  And one of the other things that I learned from you is that coyotes, when they do that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=830.48s)]
*  roll call, when they scream out and howl, if one of them is missing, the females will [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=834.16s)]
*  make more pups. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=839.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they are able to, when they howl, one of the things they do with howls, I mean, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=840.68s)]
*  they're communicating all kinds of things, but one of the things we're pretty certain [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=846.48s)]
*  they do with howls is to take a census of how many coyotes are in the area. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=850.36s)]
*  Because of course, howling is infectious, both for coyotes and wolves. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=857.0799999999999s)]
*  Whenever they hear a howl, they'll respond to it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=861.36s)]
*  And if during the spring mating period, if howling produces fewer responses in a particular [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=864.12s)]
*  area, it can trigger something, not exactly sure, in coyotes that will have the effect [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=873.28s)]
*  of producing larger litters. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=881.96s)]
*  And of course, with fewer other predators in an area, one of the things that happens [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  is the food base is larger. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=889.76s)]
*  So if you've got, if you have a coyote pack as, say, seven pups, if there are fewer coyotes [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=891.78s)]
*  that have been taken out by trapping or poisoning or whatever, it's possible to get more of [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=900.3399999999999s)]
*  the pups up to adulthood because there are more food resources. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=905.86s)]
*  So it's kind of a loop that functions like that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=909.9599999999999s)]
*  The coyotes are certainly playing a role in it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=913.02s)]
*  Of course, our attempts to take them out are producing this feedback that often causes [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=918.1s)]
*  them to have larger litters to be more successful in raising their pups. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=924.68s)]
*  And they will respond by rising to the level of the carrying capacity of the landscape [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=930.56s)]
*  in any case. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=936.62s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=937.62s)]
*  And it's amazing how well they adapt to Los Angeles. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=938.62s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=942.7s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw one. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=944.3s)]
*  It was 1994 and I was, they had these pre furnished apartments that I got one of those [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=946.2s)]
*  when I first moved to LA. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  It's the Oakwood Apartments. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  And it was in Burbank. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=956.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're in the middle of everything. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  It's sort of the tonight show films. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=960.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm driving down the street and I see these two little wolves. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=962.48s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is that? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, it's coyotes. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=968.24s)]
*  Because I had heard, but I was like, what? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=972.0s)]
*  You see coyotes? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=973.88s)]
*  How often? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=975.28s)]
*  How often? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=976.28s)]
*  Like right there, right away. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=977.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, Walt Disney was doing films about coyotes in the Hollywood Hills in the early [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  1960s. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=987.0600000000001s)]
*  But coyotes had been there all along. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=988.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, they were there when LA was founded and they basically never left. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=990.88s)]
*  I mean, there are records back in the 20s and 30s of the local authorities sending people [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=996.24s)]
*  out to try to take out coyotes way back 100 years ago. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1002.1600000000001s)]
*  So they've always been there. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1008.32s)]
*  When I would have talks with friends that lived there that were upset about coyotes, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1009.84s)]
*  I'd say, but you know what's great? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1015.6s)]
*  When was the last time you saw a rat? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1017.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1019.72s)]
*  I mean, like LA, the Hills, like where I used to live in Ventura County, should be littered [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1020.72s)]
*  with rats. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1027.04s)]
*  They should be everywhere. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1028.04s)]
*  There's garbage cans everywhere. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1029.04s)]
*  Where's all the rats? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1030.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1031.04s)]
*  And they're all littered by coyotes and owls. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1033.0s)]
*  Well, that's one of the great things about coyotes being in the East. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1034.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, the whole, all the East Coast cities have huge problems with rats. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1036.44s)]
*  They should let them lose in New York City. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1040.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1042.2s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1043.2s)]
*  I mean, they'll take out your rats. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1044.2s)]
*  I watched a rat trip a mousetrap, a rat trap today. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1045.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen this? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1050.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1051.32s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1052.32s)]
*  Jamie, you're the best. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1053.32s)]
*  How did you do this? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1054.32s)]
*  Man, he was right on top of it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1055.32s)]
*  You're the best. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1056.32s)]
*  So look at this rat. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1057.32s)]
*  This rat goes, he realizes that's a trap. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1058.32s)]
*  He has a nice piece of cheese on it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1061.08s)]
*  So he brings a stick and he trips the fucking trap. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1062.52s)]
*  I mean, come on, man. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1067.32s)]
*  How smart are those little motherfuckers? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1069.76s)]
*  That little tiny ass brain. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1071.48s)]
*  How smart is he? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1073.2s)]
*  He's using tools. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1074.3600000000001s)]
*  He's using a tool. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1076.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's incredible. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's really incredible. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1078.52s)]
*  And he knows what he's doing. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1080.2s)]
*  He didn't even freak out. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1081.2s)]
*  Look, see, see how he reacted? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1082.76s)]
*  No, it didn't startle him at all. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1084.32s)]
*  At all. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1085.84s)]
*  Imagine being a wild animal subject to predators, subject to other territorial rats, and you're [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  not even freaked out by a giant spring snapping down on a board. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1093.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that could break your neck. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1097.0s)]
*  Easily. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1098.52s)]
*  That's supposed to kill you. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1099.52s)]
*  He's got to know probably. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1100.52s)]
*  These things killed my friends. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1102.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1103.8s)]
*  And I mean, that certainly is, you know, it's a trait common to the whole wolf story in [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1104.8s)]
*  America too, because wolves learned all these kinds of techniques. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1112.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't really have a record of a wolf using a tool like that, but they certainly [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1115.84s)]
*  learned and taught one another over many, many generations how to avoid traps, what [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  to do when people were trying to poison them, and how to spit out bait if they smell strychnine [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1129.0s)]
*  in it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1135.04s)]
*  So that kind of thing is a fairly common response of animals that feel as if humans are after [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1136.04s)]
*  them. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1145.2s)]
*  One of the things that I noticed when I rented a house in Encino for a while, and we had [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1146.2s)]
*  a problem with rats in the garage, and one of the things I noticed is rats had realized [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1152.0800000000002s)]
*  that if they get to the garbage in the garage, there's no coyotes and owls. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1157.1200000000001s)]
*  And so the only time I ever saw rats was in my own house, was in my garage. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1161.6200000000001s)]
*  And one time the trap went off, and I heard it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1166.2s)]
*  I was in the kitchen, and I opened the door, and there's a rat like the size of my forearm. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1168.88s)]
*  I mean, it's a huge rat. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1174.6799999999998s)]
*  I was like, look at that sucker. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1178.36s)]
*  But it was late at night. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1179.36s)]
*  I was like, I'll clean this motherfucker up in the morning. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1180.76s)]
*  I'm going to bed. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  I went to bed. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  I got up in the morning. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  There was nothing left but the tail. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1185.8799999999999s)]
*  They had eaten him. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1187.2399999999998s)]
*  That's a hard, hard world. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1190.1999999999998s)]
*  And that world is existing simultaneously with me, a fucking young kid who's on a sitcom, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  who's going to drive his sports car into this studio in Hollywood. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1201.48s)]
*  And at the same time, this cannibalism, fight for survival is going on in my garage. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1207.4s)]
*  But I don't even think that it applies to me. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1215.24s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1218.44s)]
*  I have an agent. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1219.44s)]
*  I have a manager I have to call. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1220.44s)]
*  And a sports car. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1223.92s)]
*  Yeah, I have a sports car. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1224.92s)]
*  I have a Toyota Supra. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1225.92s)]
*  But it was like watching that, seeing that thing take place. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1227.48s)]
*  It was very, I'll never forget it because it made me realize, oh, you coexist with brutality. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1231.4s)]
*  You're just not completely aware of it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1237.96s)]
*  This is real nature. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1239.76s)]
*  It's happening right here. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1241.28s)]
*  Everyone's numbed themselves to it with buildings and fast food. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1244.8400000000001s)]
*  But this is happening right where you are. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1248.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's why coyotes are so fascinating to me. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1251.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, even when I watched that one kill my chicken and hop over the fence with it, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1253.56s)]
*  I was like, respect. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1256.84s)]
*  I got to respect this game. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1257.84s)]
*  Well, you got to respect that kind of athleticism for one thing. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1259.52s)]
*  The athleticism, but also the cleverness. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1262.4399999999998s)]
*  Figure out how to trick the big dog because he couldn't break the coop. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1264.9199999999998s)]
*  He figured out, he figured out, get the dog. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1267.8799999999999s)]
*  He's like, hey, you big motherfucker, go break that thing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  They're amazing animals. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1274.8s)]
*  But you know, fuck, it sucks if they eat your cat. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1277.12s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  I've had a bunch of friends and family members that have, and recently a very good friend [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1281.72s)]
*  of mine out here lost his dog. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1288.16s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1290.44s)]
*  And you know a coyote just tore your fucking little buddy alive? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1292.44s)]
*  Well, I know it does. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1296.08s)]
*  I will admit, I've never had anything like that happen with a dog. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  In part because I always have really big dogs. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1302.72s)]
*  I have Alaskan Malamutes, which, you know, I mean, the dog I lost, as I mentioned last [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1306.68s)]
*  year, last May, I mean, he was 140 pound Alaskan Malamute. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1311.5600000000002s)]
*  And so he would sit on the front porch and a pack of coyotes would trot through the yard [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1315.76s)]
*  in New Mexico. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1319.64s)]
*  And the alpha male of the pack would turn and grimace at him, show his teeth. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  But you know, Cody, which is my dog's name, would just sit there on the porch and kind [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1327.3200000000002s)]
*  of smile. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1332.2s)]
*  I mean, a coyote, you know, even a good sized coyote in New Mexico, a good adult male, is [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1333.44s)]
*  barely going to weigh 35 pounds. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1339.0800000000002s)]
*  So Cody outweighs him five times. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1341.28s)]
*  So I've not had that experience. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1344.44s)]
*  I've lost cats a couple of times because I've always lived in the country. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1346.92s)]
*  I mean, my whole adult life, I've bought places outside town and usually, or built places [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1352.52s)]
*  outside town and lived half an hour away from the city where I was working or where I had [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1360.24s)]
*  to commute to. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1366.24s)]
*  So I always lived around wild animals of all kinds. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1367.72s)]
*  And I've lost cats two or three times, at least one time for some reason I never found. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1373.44s)]
*  The cat just disappeared. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1382.24s)]
*  The other couple of times I lost cats, what I concluded was that it was actually great [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1384.0400000000002s)]
*  horned owls that got them. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1390.4s)]
*  And what I've often told people who've, you know, related to me their stories about coyotes [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1393.0400000000002s)]
*  getting their cats or getting small dogs is that one of the questions I always ask is [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1399.4s)]
*  did you find your pet? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1405.16s)]
*  Was it lying there? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1407.8400000000001s)]
*  Because if it's lying there, that's probably an indication that it may have been a coyote. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1410.0s)]
*  Coyotes often will kill small dogs not because they want to eat them, but because they regard [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1416.6s)]
*  them as inter-gill predators that are invading their territory. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1424.6s)]
*  But if the dog or the cat completely disappears, is gone and you don't find it or you only [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1428.88s)]
*  find it months later, that's usually a great horned owl because they will pluck up a small [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1435.12s)]
*  dog or a cat and they fly away with them to their roosting spot. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean there are instances where great horned owl roosts have yielded 75 cat collars with [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1445.1999999999998s)]
*  Kiki and you know, Mousey and so forth on the names on the collars. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1453.1999999999998s)]
*  But the owls have just snagged them and taken them off and eaten them and the owners never [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1459.12s)]
*  know what happened. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1463.1599999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people because they're aware of coyotes being on the scene, they will assume [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1464.2s)]
*  that it's a coyote that's done it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1469.0800000000002s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1470.96s)]
*  75 collars. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1471.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1472.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1473.96s)]
*  I love owls. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1474.96s)]
*  One of the wildest videos that I ever saw was this night vision video of a nest and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1475.96s)]
*  there's these hawks in the nest and you just see in the distance the eyes of the owl as [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1481.76s)]
*  it swoops in and just snatches a hawk out. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1487.22s)]
*  But the ferocity. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1489.72s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1491.8000000000002s)]
*  The way it hits this hawk. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1493.44s)]
*  Are those baby hawks? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1494.44s)]
*  Bang! [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1496.44s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1497.44s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1498.44s)]
*  And the other one's like, what the fuck happened? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1499.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1500.44s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1501.44s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1502.44s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1503.44s)]
*  I mean, play that again. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1504.44s)]
*  Watch. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1505.44s)]
*  I love the eyes when you see the eyes in the distance. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1506.44s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1507.44s)]
*  Here it comes. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1508.44s)]
*  Bang! [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1509.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1510.44s)]
*  What an amazing predator, right? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1511.44s)]
*  That's what happens to a lot of cats. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1516.44s)]
*  Oh, I'd imagine. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1518.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1519.8s)]
*  I'd imagine. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1520.8s)]
*  I mean, there's a story in the little town near where I live in New Mexico of people [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1521.8s)]
*  sitting out on the front porch of the cafe bar one evening as a cat is walking the railing [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1526.28s)]
*  in front of them. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1534.54s)]
*  And while seven or eight people are sitting there drinking beer and shooting the shit [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1535.54s)]
*  and the cat is walking the railing, just like that scene, suddenly out of nowhere, a great [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1539.6s)]
*  horned owl appears, bang! [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1544.54s)]
*  Hits the cat and they're all sitting there open-eyed watching this owl fly away with [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1546.32s)]
*  the cat squirming in its claws, disappearing into the tree cover down on the river. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1551.2s)]
*  Imagine being a cat and all this, you know, you've been killing birds forever. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1557.16s)]
*  If you're a cat outside, one thing that I found that I actually learned from our good [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1561.24s)]
*  friend Steven Ronella was the sheer numbers of animals that feral cats and wild cats, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1566.28s)]
*  just outdoor cats kill every year. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1575.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1576.88s)]
*  It's an animal holocaust. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1578.68s)]
*  It is billions of animals. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1580.56s)]
*  It is. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1583.72s)]
*  And, you know, there are ornithologists who are great advocates for coyotes appearing [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1584.72s)]
*  on the scene and taking out cats that people, either feral cats that are living outside [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1590.84s)]
*  or cats that people just let sort of roam so they can actually kill birds. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1596.96s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1601.7s)]
*  A recent study by the Smithsonian Institute and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1602.7s)]
*  domestic cats kill about 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion small mammals each year in [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1607.78s)]
*  the lower 48 states alone. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1617.7399999999998s)]
*  That is incredible. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1620.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's incredible. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1621.1799999999998s)]
*  That's how ruthless those little motherfuckers are. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1623.1799999999998s)]
*  Those numbers are hard to wrap your mind around. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1625.82s)]
*  And so, I mean, it's a, you know, it's an argument for people who have cats. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1627.86s)]
*  I mean, don't let your cat do this. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1631.54s)]
*  Yeah, don't let your cat do this or an owl's going to get him. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1634.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1636.94s)]
*  I mean, the owl problem, we see obviously owls eat birds. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1637.94s)]
*  The owl probably also thought of as the cat as a predator, a fellow predator, but also [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1641.86s)]
*  prey. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1645.7s)]
*  Yeah, also prey. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1646.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1647.7s)]
*  Isn't it interesting how there's certain animals that we have anthropomorphized and put these [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1648.7s)]
*  weird characteristics to? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1654.1399999999999s)]
*  And with owls, they're like wise and they give advice. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1656.34s)]
*  They're like, give a hoot, don't pollute. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1659.46s)]
*  Like the owls tricking the candy people. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1662.18s)]
*  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a, what is it, a licorice tootsie [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1665.5s)]
*  roll? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1669.74s)]
*  A tootsie roll pop. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1670.74s)]
*  What's inside? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1671.74s)]
*  A licorice? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1672.74s)]
*  It takes three. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1673.74s)]
*  One, two, and three. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1674.74s)]
*  And he crushes it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1675.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1676.74s)]
*  And he's playing a game. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1677.74s)]
*  Like, they're clever. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1678.74s)]
*  It's interesting that we always think of them as being very wise. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1680.54s)]
*  Like owls, in cartoons, they wear glasses. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1684.06s)]
*  Which is hilarious because they have the greatest vision of all time. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1686.18s)]
*  Like why do they need glasses? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1689.66s)]
*  They have giant fucking eyes that see crystal clear late at night. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1691.5400000000002s)]
*  We give them glasses. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1696.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, it gives them that studious intellectual look. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1697.3000000000002s)]
*  But a bizarre choice. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1700.1000000000001s)]
*  And that's stuck with us. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1701.1000000000001s)]
*  Like if you ask most people about owls, they think of them as, oh, the wise old owl. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1702.94s)]
*  That's a ruthless monster. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1707.5800000000002s)]
*  A raptor that flies down and just swoops shit up and flies away with it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1709.6200000000001s)]
*  And it lives amongst people. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1714.48s)]
*  They do indeed. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1717.18s)]
*  The next time you see one, just sort of make a projection in your head about how many cat [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1719.42s)]
*  collars may be lying at the base of the tree. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1724.5s)]
*  That owl is rooting. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1727.5800000000002s)]
*  I saw one two nights ago. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1728.74s)]
*  I saw one swoop across the road. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1730.38s)]
*  I was like, wow. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1732.18s)]
*  They're cool, man. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1733.5s)]
*  They're so big. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1734.5s)]
*  It's kind of stunning how big they are. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1735.7s)]
*  You think of an owl as being a small bird, but you see their wingspan and their body. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1738.48s)]
*  That's a pretty large, that's why it makes sense they could snatch up a cat. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1742.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1745.98s)]
*  Right on where the hell is in particular. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1746.98s)]
*  They have like a three and a half foot wingspan. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1748.58s)]
*  Three and a half to four foot wingspan. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1750.98s)]
*  They're really big. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1752.66s)]
*  And they sound cool. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1754.14s)]
*  When it's nighttime and you're outside and you hear one bird, and you know that that's [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1756.3s)]
*  a ruthless killer. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1762.02s)]
*  A ruthless all-seeing killer just perched up on things. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1763.66s)]
*  They're so good at killing things you can get a rubber one and it keeps everybody away. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1767.18s)]
*  You know that? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1771.7s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1772.7s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1773.7s)]
*  Have you done it? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1774.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, I have done it. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1775.7s)]
*  It works for a while. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1777.42s)]
*  And then they realize. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1778.42s)]
*  Yeah, and then they realize it's fake. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1779.42s)]
*  But yeah, it works for a while. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1780.66s)]
*  How long does it work for? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1782.3s)]
*  Well, it depends on what you're trying to alarm. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1783.3s)]
*  I mean, some birds are quicker than others. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1786.3s)]
*  I mean, as you mentioned a few minutes ago, a raven is not going to be tricked by something [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1789.02s)]
*  like that for more than a day or so. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1794.82s)]
*  A raven will quickly get it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1798.8600000000001s)]
*  Some birds are not so fast on the uptake. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1800.32s)]
*  Raven will probably start shitting on it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1802.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1804.3400000000001s)]
*  On purpose. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1805.3400000000001s)]
*  I actually have a kind of a wild pet raven at the moment. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1806.98s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1811.86s)]
*  Yeah, and have had since I lost my dog, and I've just got a new dog. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1812.86s)]
*  I just got a new puppy here recently. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1816.8999999999999s)]
*  But I had lost my dog. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1819.34s)]
*  He was sort of my constant companion. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1822.6599999999999s)]
*  And I realized that, I mean, I spend a lot of time, I've raised with animals from being [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1826.8999999999999s)]
*  a little kid. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1832.4599999999998s)]
*  In fact, I'll tell you a story in a minute, sort of how this Wild New World book came [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1835.34s)]
*  to be. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1839.9399999999998s)]
*  It came out of the first animal companion I ever had and what happened to it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1840.9399999999998s)]
*  But this particular raven started hanging around where, I mean, in New Mexico and southwest, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1845.86s)]
*  we have a lot of rats and mice. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1854.34s)]
*  And they'll, of course, what rats and mice do, which is the reason the East Coast cities [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1856.6999999999998s)]
*  have such a problem with rats, is that they're drawn to human inhabitations because we produce [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1860.72s)]
*  excess stuff for them to get into, food in particular. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  So commonly, I'll have a rat zapper or two out and every two or three days, I'll catch [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1869.52s)]
*  a mouse or a rat. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1878.4s)]
*  And so I had this particular spot where I was taking these rats and mice out and dropping [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1880.76s)]
*  them. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1885.24s)]
*  And I noticed that a raven started flying up on a nearby tree and waiting for me to [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1886.76s)]
*  do this. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  And so after this happened four or five times, and I began to look at this raven and I thought [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1892.32s)]
*  the way that raven is lighting on the same spot, this is the same raven, keeps coming [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1898.1200000000001s)]
*  back to this exact branch. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1904.16s)]
*  So I started experimenting with what happens if I drop the rat out and just back up 10 [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1906.58s)]
*  feet. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1913.52s)]
*  And then the raven would wait a minute or so and then fly down and pick up the rat. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1914.8s)]
*  So then I started closing the distance into five feet and then three feet. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1919.08s)]
*  This raven, over time, came to realize I was no threat. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1925.16s)]
*  I was providing a free meal. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1929.8s)]
*  And so since that time, that started happening about six months ago, since that time, I've [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1932.24s)]
*  got this raven that basically, when my new puppy and I go out for walks in the canyon [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  below the house outside Santa Fe, this raven actually flies along with us, lighting from [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1943.12s)]
*  one tree to another, waiting for me, hoping that I'm going to provide him with some sort [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1950.72s)]
*  of free meal. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1956.9199999999998s)]
*  And what I've taken to doing when the dog is not paying attention or asleep and I don't [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1958.3999999999999s)]
*  have a mouse to give him is I'll pull four or five kibbles of dog food out and I can [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1965.3999999999999s)]
*  put those things anywhere and that raven will fly down and pick them up and walk around [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1970.48s)]
*  and talk to me and make these these sounds that I actually haven't quite figured out. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1976.04s)]
*  I haven't understood. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1982.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not as smart as wolves were about human language. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1984.04s)]
*  I haven't figured out raven language yet, but this raven talks to me. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  And so we have conversations. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1990.96s)]
*  I have no idea what he's saying, but he's very vocal and he's very expressive. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1993.48s)]
*  You know, that was that's amazing story. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  And that was one of John Lilly's things that he was working on with dolphins. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2001.32s)]
*  And he was trying to use LSD to better communicate with dolphins and he used sensory deprivation [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2006.24s)]
*  tanks and you know, it's his idea was there's got to be some way to crack that code and [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2011.52s)]
*  to at least intuitively understand what these things are saying. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2017.9599999999998s)]
*  And they even tried to get dolphins to speak human language because they could apparently [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2021.9199999999998s)]
*  understand what we were saying. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  We couldn't understand what they were saying. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  So they were trying to get dolphin, but they just don't have lips. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2029.04s)]
*  They don't have a tongue like ours. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2032.2399999999998s)]
*  Just like they can't make the same noises. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2033.56s)]
*  Their noises are so different. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2035.08s)]
*  But all those people that are studying orcas and dolphins, they've determined that there's [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2036.84s)]
*  dialects, that they sound different in different areas, but they have no idea what they're [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2041.9199999999998s)]
*  saying. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2046.8s)]
*  No idea, which is amazing. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2047.6s)]
*  No, but they they are communicating with one another. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2049.3199999999997s)]
*  They can't communicate with us. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2053.04s)]
*  And the conclusion we draw from that, of course, is that other animals, other creatures in [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2054.48s)]
*  the world are not as intelligent as we are. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2059.2s)]
*  But the truth is all the recent science about animal culture and about animal consciousness [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2062.92s)]
*  is indicating something that I think we sort of as early humans living amongst wild animals [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2071.2s)]
*  in Africa and Europe and Asia and ultimately in the Americas understood is that these are [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2079.52s)]
*  creatures that share with us all the traits that we tend to think make us distinctively [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2086.64s)]
*  human. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2094.64s)]
*  We think that the ability to talk, the ability to transmit culture is what makes us exceptional [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2095.36s)]
*  among all other creatures. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2103.88s)]
*  And yet what we're discovering almost day by day from the scientific literature that's [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2105.36s)]
*  been focused on these things is that animals just like us have culture. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2111.7200000000003s)]
*  As Charles Darwin said, it's just a matter of degree, not kind. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2117.2400000000002s)]
*  They have all the same attributes and all the same abilities. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2124.0s)]
*  They just don't have things like eight billion other members of their species to be thinking [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2128.32s)]
*  up ideas and transmit to one another around the world through things like the Internet [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2136.0400000000004s)]
*  or Twitter or five thousand years ago, written languages. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2141.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, what we've done is we've been able to amplify all those abilities by how many [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2146.44s)]
*  of us there are and our ability to communicate with one another. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2152.1200000000003s)]
*  But so many other creatures. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2155.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there was a declaration on consciousness issued by a bunch of biologists in Europe [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2157.64s)]
*  in 2012 that argued that the higher species in particular, some of the ones that we've [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2166.52s)]
*  been talking about here, share the same level of cultural transmissibility, of the ability [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2172.08s)]
*  to communicate with one another, the ability to plot out strategies for new problems that [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2180.64s)]
*  they confront, just like the ravens we were talking about or about the rat who used a [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2189.56s)]
*  tool to set off that trap. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2195.16s)]
*  So all these kinds of things that we've thought for so long make us exceptional in the world. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2198.3599999999997s)]
*  This comes out of a long Western European tradition of thinking that we're exceptional, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2205.48s)]
*  that we're the only creatures made in the image of God, the only ones with souls and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2211.12s)]
*  all that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2215.88s)]
*  What we're discovering, of course, is that ancient people understood that humans were [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2217.4s)]
*  part of the mix. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2223.32s)]
*  Charles Darwin gave us scientific evidence that this was true. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2224.96s)]
*  And the more we study other creatures, the more we realize that all these animals that [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2229.08s)]
*  we've set aside as things that we regard as expendable, as useful as commodities, domesticated [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2235.4s)]
*  possibilities, they actually have many of the same capabilities we do. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2245.68s)]
*  So I mean, it makes sense if you think about ravens. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2252.4s)]
*  It makes sense if you think about their ability to use tools and their ability to displace [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2256.74s)]
*  water. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2260.22s)]
*  They're obviously thinking. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2261.22s)]
*  And so if they can make noises, of course they would associate those noises with different [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2262.7s)]
*  things. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2267.14s)]
*  Did you see any patterns when he would, like when you put the food down, did he make specific [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2268.3399999999997s)]
*  sounds when you put the food down? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2273.4199999999996s)]
*  Well what he began to do that probably caught my eye more than anything, when he would first [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2275.62s)]
*  take the food and fly off immediately, especially when I was closing the distance between us. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2283.9s)]
*  When I was getting to the point where I was only three or four feet away from where I [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2288.86s)]
*  would put down a mouse or a rat or four or five kibbles of dog food, he would come down [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2292.82s)]
*  and grab the food. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2298.18s)]
*  And once he would, say, go through all six kibbles that I'd put down, he would immediately [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2299.34s)]
*  fly off. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2304.7400000000002s)]
*  But then at some point, when this raven fairly clearly, it seemed to me, as I observed him, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2306.3s)]
*  came to some kind of conscious conclusion that I was not a threat and that the sounds [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2316.1800000000003s)]
*  that I was making, my human voice and the inflections that I was making, were something [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2322.5s)]
*  that were not dangerous to him, then he started hanging around. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2328.26s)]
*  So he would eat the food, eat the kibbles or eat the mouse, and instead of flying away, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2335.56s)]
*  he would waddle around on the ground four or five feet away from me or hop up on a limb. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2342.84s)]
*  And this is when we were having these conversations I was referring to a minute ago, where he [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2349.12s)]
*  would actually respond to my voice as I talked. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2354.04s)]
*  And as I said, the raven is probably better at understanding what I'm saying than I am [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2358.24s)]
*  at understanding what the raven is trying to convey to me. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2363.72s)]
*  But he very clearly is expressing what I sort of intuit as a kind of comfort and, I mean, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2367.52s)]
*  maybe even a thank you. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2378.2599999999998s)]
*  Thanks for the friendship. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2380.52s)]
*  Thanks for the friendship. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2383.0s)]
*  Thanks for all the fish. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2384.52s)]
*  Thanks for the food. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2386.0s)]
*  He's actually somehow come to realize that I'm completely trustworthy and so he can hang [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2388.36s)]
*  out. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2397.52s)]
*  And it's not too long after he began to do that, that he started accompanying me on walks. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2398.52s)]
*  As I would walk around the place and go for hikes, and now doing it with this 16 week [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2404.38s)]
*  old puppy that I have, the raven comes along. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2409.7000000000003s)]
*  He spots us going out the back door into the canyon and flies along from tree to tree and [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2414.4s)]
*  just kind of hangs out with us. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2420.88s)]
*  I mean, it's a really remarkable, I've not ever had another animal do anything like this, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2422.6s)]
*  but it probably means that I've not had an animal quite as smart as a mature raven to [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2427.26s)]
*  deal with. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you miss him when you go on the road? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2434.2000000000003s)]
*  Well I'm talking about him obviously. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2436.0s)]
*  I would imagine I would miss that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2439.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2441.56s)]
*  I would want to go back in the woods and bring him some dog food and hang out with him. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2442.72s)]
*  Oh man, no kidding. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2445.52s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2446.52s)]
*  That is so cool. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2447.52s)]
*  I've taken to putting a few kibbles in my pocket so that when Kiska, the new young puppy, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2448.52s)]
*  goes to sleep, because of course as long as the puppy is awake, he's watching the raven [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2454.92s)]
*  too. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2460.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2461.0s)]
*  I mean this is kind of an ancient relationship between ravens and wolves. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2462.0s)]
*  And I think, I mean I've hiked enough with my Alaskan Malamutes in the mountains in the [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2465.7999999999997s)]
*  west to notice how ravens circle around them in the same kind of approach that ravens do [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2470.64s)]
*  with wolves. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  They'll follow wolves because they know wolves very possibly signal a free meal. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2478.2799999999997s)]
*  So the puppy is watching the raven. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2483.6s)]
*  He's very aware of the raven, but as soon as he goes to sleep, I'll pull my kibbles [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2486.48s)]
*  out and drop him out for the raven again. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2489.8399999999997s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2492.48s)]
*  That's such a cool relationship. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2493.48s)]
*  It's been very fun. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2494.6s)]
*  I've never had anything like it before. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2496.6s)]
*  I mean that's what a great way to test the intelligence of an animal like that. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2498.24s)]
*  The fact that it's recognizing that you're a friend and then communicates with you like [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2501.52s)]
*  a thank you or at least some sort of a gesture of friendship. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2506.12s)]
*  Yes, and I don't have to put the food in the same spot. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2509.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean I was starting out by of course putting everything in the exact same spot that I had [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2512.8799999999997s)]
*  begun, but now I can sort of put it anywhere. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2517.3599999999997s)]
*  And he's watching it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2520.7999999999997s)]
*  He comes and gets his meal. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2521.7999999999997s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2524.12s)]
*  How long do the ravens live? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2525.12s)]
*  They live to about 12, 13, 14 years old. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2526.64s)]
*  And I have no idea how old this raven is. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2529.68s)]
*  There's no way of telling. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2532.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean and ravens kind of tend to all look alike, but this particular bird conveys his [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  presence, his individual presence by, as I mentioned, lighting in exactly the same spot [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2542.44s)]
*  every time. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2549.4s)]
*  So when he sees me come out of the house in the morning, he goes to a particular spot [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2550.4s)]
*  and lands. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2555.3599999999997s)]
*  And I mean there are a lot of other ravens in the neighborhood, but I can always tell [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2556.3599999999997s)]
*  that it's this particular one because he goes and hits a signal to me. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2561.2s)]
*  It's me. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2566.04s)]
*  He goes to a particular spot to land and wait to see what I've got for him on a particular [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2567.04s)]
*  day. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2572.9199999999996s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2573.9199999999996s)]
*  What a great story. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2574.9199999999996s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2576.9199999999996s)]
*  So you live in an area that probably has a lot of wildlife. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2578.02s)]
*  I do live in an area that has a lot of wildlife. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2581.84s)]
*  And I, you know, much of my life I have. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2583.76s)]
*  I lived 22 years in Montana out in the foothills of a mountain range outside Missoula. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2585.52s)]
*  I was teaching at the University of Montana and certainly had, I mean I lived with all [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2591.2400000000002s)]
*  the grand animals that still remain from the historic period in the West in that spot. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2597.4s)]
*  I mean we had, I was there when we reintroduced wolves to Montana in Idaho in 1995 and within [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2604.52s)]
*  about three or four years there was a wolf pack on the slopes right above the house and [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2612.48s)]
*  they began having litters. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2619.0s)]
*  So we began having wolves there. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2620.96s)]
*  Grizzly bears would appear sporadically. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2623.6600000000003s)]
*  They were, their main range was just to the north of where I was, but they were steadily [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2629.32s)]
*  attempting to repopulate the Bitterroot Valley. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2635.02s)]
*  And so about every two years there would be a grizzly in the area. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2638.52s)]
*  I had black bears fairly commonly, lions of course. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2642.04s)]
*  Never saw a lion, but I saw a prince. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2647.36s)]
*  And tons of elk and deer and all that sort of thing. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2649.7599999999998s)]
*  And in New Mexico, not so many where I live, I don't live in the foothills of a mountain [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2654.68s)]
*  range. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2660.04s)]
*  I live out in the Pinyons, Juniper country about 10 miles from the southern Rockies. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2661.04s)]
*  In that zone you have a few mule deer. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2666.4s)]
*  There are pronghorn antelope in the open prairies not too far away. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2669.88s)]
*  But the primary animals that I see all the time, which is why, you know, back seven or [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2675.0400000000004s)]
*  eight years ago I wrote a book about them, or one of the reasons was it's coyotes. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2680.4s)]
*  I mean I'm sort of constantly living with coyotes. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2684.1200000000003s)]
*  Elk have such a distinct language in the way they talk to each other that there's elk calling [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2688.6000000000004s)]
*  championships. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2694.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware of these. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2695.64s)]
*  Jason Phelps, who's a guy that is well known in the elk hunting world, has developed these [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2696.64s)]
*  amazing elk calls to mimic them. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2702.56s)]
*  He knows how to get them upset. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2705.7999999999997s)]
*  He knows how to challenge them. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2709.12s)]
*  It's really interesting when you see a master caller at work, because the elk hunting that [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2710.72s)]
*  I've done, most of it has been ambush, like sneak up on them. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  And I like that. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2720.8799999999997s)]
*  I like the stalking and trying to get close and playing the wind. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2723.16s)]
*  But there's a lot of guys that are so good at getting the elk pissed off that the elk, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2731.04s)]
*  against their better judgment, will come, what the fuck is going on over there? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2736.52s)]
*  And whap! [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2740.48s)]
*  And they get hit. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2741.48s)]
*  Yeah, well they're issuing a challenge, you know? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2742.48s)]
*  And at the time when elk are bugling, I mean what they're bugling for are cows. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2745.2s)]
*  And so yeah, if they sense there's a challenge from another bull, then they're coming to [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2749.52s)]
*  vie for access to the females, and that's how they get lured in. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2756.6s)]
*  They also learn too. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2760.24s)]
*  So when there's heavy pressure areas, they learn that a lot of these calls are bullshit. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2761.74s)]
*  And so they learn to shut up. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2766.48s)]
*  And so in heavily pressured elk areas, sometimes there's elk around you and you don't even [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2768.22s)]
*  know where they are because you don't hear anything. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2771.7s)]
*  One of the best ways to locate elk in the morning, you listen and you hear bugles. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2774.16s)]
*  Well I have not hunted elk. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2779.36s)]
*  And I mean I grew up in Louisiana, rural kid growing up in the south. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2783.0s)]
*  And went to high school. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2792.6400000000003s)]
*  In fact I went to high school with the Duck Dynasty guys. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2793.6400000000003s)]
*  I played football with the Duck Dynasty guys. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2797.92s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2800.56s)]
*  The older guy, Phil, was the quarterback of the high school football team. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2801.88s)]
*  And there was one guy in between us, a guy named Johnny Prudum was the next quarterback [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2809.88s)]
*  after Phil. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2813.74s)]
*  But I succeeded Johnny Prudum as the quarterback of the high school team. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2814.74s)]
*  And I even wore Phil's number, number 10 in high school. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2817.52s)]
*  And I played the younger Robertson, Sy, he and I played when I was a freshman and he [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2821.88s)]
*  was a sophomore. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2827.96s)]
*  And we played in the backfield, or I was a sophomore, he was a junior, we played in the [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2829.36s)]
*  backfield football team. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2832.56s)]
*  So I went to high school with those kind of guys and grew up in that kind of world and [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2833.68s)]
*  hunted and fished. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2840.64s)]
*  But our paths I guess kind of separated at one point. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2844.08s)]
*  They stayed in Louisiana, Sy went off to Vietnam and returned. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2849.6s)]
*  And what I did was I went off to college and other places and ended up getting a PhD and [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2856.3999999999996s)]
*  getting university jobs and going to live in places like Montana. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2863.92s)]
*  So our worlds kind of diverged. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2867.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you still keep in touch with those guys? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2870.0s)]
*  No, I haven't kept in touch with them. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2872.08s)]
*  And I don't know if they're, I'm certainly aware of them because I've watched their show [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2874.7599999999998s)]
*  some, but I don't know if they're aware of anything that I've done. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2878.56s)]
*  I haven't tried to get in touch with them or anything. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2883.7999999999997s)]
*  I loved the success of that show because I knew that there was people, because I did [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2886.0s)]
*  stand-up comedy for 30 years, so I was always on the road. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2892.48s)]
*  I was always traveling to the south, I was traveling to the north, I traveled all over [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2897.04s)]
*  the country telling jokes. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2900.88s)]
*  And you get a way better sense of what the country is actually like than if you only [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2903.08s)]
*  live in these cultural elite cities like Los Angeles. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2908.52s)]
*  In Los Angeles, the idea that a show about a bunch of fucking duck hunters who have a [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2911.8s)]
*  dynasty from duck calls, how is that going to be popular? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2916.96s)]
*  And then it was huge. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2921.0800000000004s)]
*  It was gigantic and people loved it. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2922.6400000000003s)]
*  People in these, what they would call the flyover states, the disrespectfully most of [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2926.48s)]
*  the country, they would call the flyover states. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2931.28s)]
*  That's why I love a show like that that succeeds because those people had no idea. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2933.88s)]
*  They were like, what the hell is going on? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2939.32s)]
*  Like, what is, you know, I want to watch all the stuff that I want to watch. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2941.48s)]
*  How did these people even like this? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2947.0s)]
*  What world do they live in? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2949.56s)]
*  Well I will say that those guys, Phil and Sy both, they were not only really accomplished [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2952.2s)]
*  duck hunters, and I never duck hunted with them, but I did go dove hunting with them [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2959.96s)]
*  one time. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2963.4s)]
*  And of course they didn't, you know, it was on private property for which they had no [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2964.4s)]
*  permission and halfway through the dove hunt we had maybe shot 10 or 15 rounds and here [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2969.2799999999997s)]
*  comes the landowner in a pickup truck driving about 60 miles an hour across rutted fields [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2974.2s)]
*  after us. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2979.4799999999996s)]
*  And so my memory of going hunting with the Robertson boys is running through the Red [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2980.4799999999996s)]
*  River Valley trying to get away from an irate landowner. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2985.06s)]
*  But those guys were funny. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2989.7999999999997s)]
*  They were really funny as hell back in those days. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2992.16s)]
*  It kind of didn't surprise me when they were able to translate that into that show because [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=2996.8s)]
*  I mean we all thought that they were, and they told so many stories. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3003.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean the South of course is storytelling part of the United States and those guys told [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3007.88s)]
*  so many stories that we used to just number them and whenever they would start on a story [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3013.96s)]
*  we would just say, okay, it's number 112 guys. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3019.88s)]
*  So everybody would start laughing because we all knew what 112 was. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3022.7599999999998s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3027.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, didn't even have to listen to the story. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3028.3599999999997s)]
*  It's number 112. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3030.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3031.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe we can reunite you guys. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3035.04s)]
*  Maybe this podcast will reunite you guys. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3039.08s)]
*  Yeah, maybe so. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3040.68s)]
*  It might. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3041.68s)]
*  So this book, this new book that you have written, Wild New World, the epic story of [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3042.68s)]
*  animals and people in America. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3048.16s)]
*  How did you start this? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3052.56s)]
*  Well, it's kind of my pandemic vacation book. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3053.56s)]
*  That's why I asked. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3057.0s)]
*  A lot of people, Joey Diaz wrote this during the pandemic. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3058.36s)]
*  Yeah, I wrote it during the pandemic. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3061.36s)]
*  I mean I'll say, you know, Coyote America and American Serengeti kind of set me up to [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3063.2s)]
*  be able to take a step back, farther back to look at the bigger story of animals in [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3073.92s)]
*  America. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3082.36s)]
*  I mean, I'd focus very specifically on coyotes in the one book and wrote about the animals, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3083.36s)]
*  all these grand animals of the Great Plains. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3089.84s)]
*  This part of North America that once up until about 120 years ago was our version of the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3092.1200000000003s)]
*  Serengeti. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3098.48s)]
*  And somehow while East Africa and Southern Africa managed to get these great game parks [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3100.12s)]
*  preserving their large, charismatic animals here in the United States, we ended up privatizing [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3106.2s)]
*  all the Great Plains, turning it into farms and ranches and losing our ability to do that, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3111.2s)]
*  at least until the present day where we're trying to accomplish something like returning [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3116.6s)]
*  the American Serengeti. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3122.72s)]
*  Those two books kind of set me up for stepping back and looking at the really big picture [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3124.8399999999997s)]
*  of this. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3132.54s)]
*  And so I was inspired, I'll admit, by Yuval Harari's Sapiens, you know, his big history [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3133.54s)]
*  of humans across time. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3141.6s)]
*  So what I was compelled to do with Wild New World was to write a book that was a big history [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3144.04s)]
*  of North America and the relationship that people and animals have had in North America [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3154.28s)]
*  starting from, I mean, the book actually starts with the aftermath of the Chicxulub Impact. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3163.8s)]
*  That's the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs and ushered in the age of mammals. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3170.6800000000003s)]
*  The reason I started there is because that's the moment at which North America starts acquiring [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3176.32s)]
*  its bestiary, its creatures. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3183.16s)]
*  In the aftermath of the dinosaur age, both through continental evolution in North America [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3185.92s)]
*  and through acquiring animals from other parts of the world as they crossed the land bridges [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3192.6800000000003s)]
*  and enter North America, in that, those millions of years after the Chicxulub Impact, Chicxulub, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3198.64s)]
*  by the way, is the name of the little Mayan village on the north coast of the Yucatan [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3206.96s)]
*  near where that asteroid hit 66 million years ago. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3210.76s)]
*  But in the aftermath of it, that's how we acquire our creatures. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3215.96s)]
*  That's how we acquire mammoths and mastodons and saber-toothed cats and buffalo and prong [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3222.1600000000003s)]
*  horns and camels and horses. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3231.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, it happens through continental evolution, as I said, and also through this migration [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3234.92s)]
*  from other parts of the world. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3241.52s)]
*  But what I try to create with that and try to set up with that is this bestiary of creatures [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3243.62s)]
*  that when humans finally get here, and I mean, after all, North and South America are the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3250.54s)]
*  last places on earth humans find, except for a few islands in the Pacific that we get to [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3254.44s)]
*  later, the last grand continents on earth that humans get to are North and South America, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3259.48s)]
*  by which time we have had, well, if you date us back even to Neanderthals, which goes back [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3266.72s)]
*  about 800,000 to a million years, and you assume that we and Neanderthals are obviously [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3274.8s)]
*  close enough to one another that we can hybridize. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3280.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, have you done 23andMe? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3283.92s)]
*  Yeah, I got a lot of it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3285.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so do I. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3286.72s)]
*  And my wife has even more. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3288.68s)]
*  And I think all of us that are from particularly sort of Northwestern European backgrounds [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3290.6s)]
*  have ended up with a lot of Neanderthal, you know, for some people as much as two and a [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3297.6s)]
*  half percent of their genes. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3303.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3305.68s)]
*  And it produces, you know, it makes you different than you would be otherwise. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3307.68s)]
*  According to 23andMe, I have less hair on my back than I would if I didn't have Neanderthal [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3313.2400000000002s)]
*  genes. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3319.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm a little taller because of Neanderthal genes. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3320.7200000000003s)]
*  All kinds of things like that. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3324.84s)]
*  So if you date the human story even back, and I started our story as wild animals in [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3328.28s)]
*  Africa, and I bring us in one of the early chapters, in the first chapter really, up [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3335.84s)]
*  to the point where we're leaving Africa, going into Europe, going into Asia. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3342.92s)]
*  And of course, that process, again, if you start with Neanderthals, it goes back 800,000 [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3349.68s)]
*  years out of Africa and to the rest of the world. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3355.2s)]
*  But the Neanderthals never get to the Americas. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3358.32s)]
*  But when modern humans, we emerge about 315,000 years ago in Africa, and when we spread out [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3363.72s)]
*  of Africa and replace Neanderthals in Europe and Dinosauvans in Asia and finally get to [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3370.8399999999997s)]
*  Siberia about 45,000 years ago, as soon as there's a possibility for getting farther [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3379.04s)]
*  east, in other words, into North America, we take advantage of it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3387.0s)]
*  As I argue in this book, the reason we do this, this is kind of one of the reasons why [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3393.0s)]
*  all of us love to find spots where it's a beautiful morning, I'm out here on this mountain, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3398.76s)]
*  there's not another soul in sight. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3406.72s)]
*  It's just me and the world. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3408.8s)]
*  That compulsion, I think, is really ancient, and it's what drew us out of Africa to other [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3411.24s)]
*  parts of the world to start with. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3416.68s)]
*  Now what we're looking for are animals that have never encountered us before, because [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3418.8s)]
*  they're naive about humans as predators. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3426.1600000000003s)]
*  So this compulsion to travel, finally to get to the great plum of the Americas as the last [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3430.8s)]
*  great spot we get to on Earth, drives us to the point where, I don't know if you caught [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3440.92s)]
*  the news out of White Sands National Park about three or four years ago about the footprints [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3449.32s)]
*  that were discovered there, 23,000 years old. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3456.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's at the height of the glacial maximum, man. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3461.96s)]
*  The ice is at its greatest extent, and somehow people have gotten out of Asia, we think probably [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3466.0s)]
*  along the coastlines, into what is now the United States, and the place that always seemed [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3474.3s)]
*  to draw them is the country south of the Rocky Mountains in what is New Mexico and Arizona. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3480.8s)]
*  And these people managed to get 23,000 years ago into what is now New Mexico and left 79 [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3486.84s)]
*  that have been carbon dated based on seeds that their feet crushed as they walked along [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3495.08s)]
*  the marshy shore of this lake. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3502.0s)]
*  So we know that people probably coming down the coastlines, maybe in some kind of craft, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3504.84s)]
*  managed to get here as long ago as 23,000 years. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3511.56s)]
*  But what really, of course, propels the great human migration into America is when the ice [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3515.72s)]
*  sheets finally open at about 16,000 years ago as the glacial maximum begins to recede, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3522.24s)]
*  there's an ice-free corridor that opens from Alaska down into Alberta and Montana. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3528.2799999999997s)]
*  And at that point, you get this massive migration, probably not massive to start with, maybe [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3534.0s)]
*  not very many people at all, but they encounter a wild new world, a world that is populated [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3539.56s)]
*  by some creatures they recognize, many ground sloths and so forth, humans have never seen [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3547.96s)]
*  before. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3553.92s)]
*  And so we enter this American paradise of animals some 16,000 years ago in large numbers [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3554.96s)]
*  of humans and spread within about three centuries all the way to the tip of South America. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3565.48s)]
*  It's kind of one of the great colonization stories in world history. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3572.8s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3578.6400000000003s)]
*  Now at this point in time, what weapons do we think that they were using to hunt with? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3579.6400000000003s)]
*  Were they using atoll owls? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3583.5600000000004s)]
*  Were they using spears? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3584.5600000000004s)]
*  Were they using, well, a combination of these things? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3585.5600000000004s)]
*  They were definitely using, so the first successful group that sort of spreads coast to coast, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3589.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, our first American culture that spreads from the Pacific to the Atlantic as a consistent [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3597.0s)]
*  culture of people, and I titled this particular chapter in the book, Clovisia the Beautiful, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3603.9199999999996s)]
*  because they establish a world that lasts longer than the United States has lasted so [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3611.0s)]
*  far. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3616.3199999999997s)]
*  Their America the Beautiful, Clovisia the Beautiful, lasts well over 300 years, and [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3617.44s)]
*  They're probably using spears, but they have come up with a great new technology, which [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3624.08s)]
*  is the fluted point. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3632.52s)]
*  They figured out a way, and fluted points aren't found in earlier times, even in Siberia, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3634.92s)]
*  so this was a purely American invention. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3640.68s)]
*  They figured out a way to take flint points and flute the base on either side so that [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3642.8s)]
*  you can solidly and very securely attach a spear to them, and they'll remain in place [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3647.96s)]
*  without flipping off or breaking off. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3654.6s)]
*  So the fluted point is one of their great technological inventions. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3657.48s)]
*  But the other thing that they bring to the game, Joe, is they come out of a tradition [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3663.0s)]
*  of at least 40,000 generations of hunting big animals. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3671.64s)]
*  I mean, they know how to do this at literally a professional level. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3678.64s)]
*  They are extremely good at it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3685.56s)]
*  I mean, one of the stories I tell in this early chapter, Clovisia the Beautiful, which [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3689.24s)]
*  is the second chapter of the book, is of an episode that takes place in southern Arizona, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3695.3199999999997s)]
*  what's now southern Arizona, about 13,000 years ago, when a group of Clovis hunters [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3701.3199999999997s)]
*  surround a herd of mammoths. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3706.8799999999997s)]
*  And in this herd is a bull, a herd bull, a herd cow, and 13 calves and adolescents. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3711.68s)]
*  There are three archaeological sites associated with this particular episode. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3718.68s)]
*  In one site, the most westerly, all 13 calves and adolescents, archaeologists found dead [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3724.6s)]
*  in one spot, each with a single Clovis point in its body. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3733.3199999999997s)]
*  East of there, in two different locations, the herd bull was found. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3741.36s)]
*  He had run about three or four miles. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3746.48s)]
*  He had two Clovis points in him, and he finally bled out and died. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3749.12s)]
*  But they found the cow about eight miles away. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3754.36s)]
*  She had eight Clovis points in her before she died, indicating to the archaeologists [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3758.1800000000003s)]
*  who've studied these sites that the cow, in classic elephant fashion, had fought to defend [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3765.4s)]
*  those calves and those adolescents. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3772.88s)]
*  She had put up a huge fight to try to defend them, and ultimately, she hadn't been successful. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3775.6s)]
*  They had all been killed. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3781.6400000000003s)]
*  She runs away and finally dies with eight Clovis points in her. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3783.5s)]
*  But that's one episode out of, I mean, we have no idea how many. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3787.72s)]
*  There are something like 78 Clovis sites around North America. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3793.08s)]
*  I mean, we don't actually know when the transition to get to your question happened to Adal's, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3799.18s)]
*  But when the Clovis period is over, it's basically when the mammoths are done. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3808.72s)]
*  These people seem to have been fairly specialized as big game hunters. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3814.4399999999996s)]
*  They killed other animals, but they really went after mammoths a lot. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3819.58s)]
*  But they were succeeded by a group known as the Folsom people, and the Folsom people used [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3823.3399999999997s)]
*  Adal's. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3828.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I opened the book with the discovery of the first Folsom site. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3829.2799999999997s)]
*  It's in Folsom, New Mexico, discovered in the year 1908. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3834.68s)]
*  Can we pause this for a second because I have to pee, and this is too fast for me to hold [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3839.48s)]
*  this in. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3842.7599999999998s)]
*  1908 Folsom people. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3843.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we'll come back. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3844.7599999999998s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3846.7599999999998s)]
*  And we're back. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3847.7599999999998s)]
*  So 1908, they discover Folsom sites. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3848.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the first Folsom site. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3850.48s)]
*  And I mean, so, you know, and I don't want to spend too much time on this because this [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3852.6s)]
*  is all basically just the first couple of chapters of Well and the World. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3856.12s)]
*  The rest of it is about subsequent history down to the present. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3861.06s)]
*  But the Folsom discovery is really kind of important in the whole American history story [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3865.38s)]
*  because up until this point, you know, and this is the kind of thing that, you know, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3873.18s)]
*  the Europeans are really good at, of course. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3878.5s)]
*  They sort of cast dispersions on America because their argument was, you know, America is really [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3881.3s)]
*  marginal to world history. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3888.38s)]
*  I mean, you guys, we've had we know that we had people interacting with cave bears and [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3890.06s)]
*  mammoths and, you know, and we have an ancient history going back to Greece and Rome. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3895.5s)]
*  And you Americans, you kind of just, you know, you don't have much going on at all. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3900.06s)]
*  And so what the Folsom site did was to give America an ancient history, a history that [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3904.66s)]
*  made us a major part of this world story that I was kind of alluding to when I was describing [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3917.12s)]
*  people finally discovering the Americas as the last grand continents on Earth. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3923.16s)]
*  And what that what happened with the Folsom story is that there was a there was a flash [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3928.8s)]
*  flood on a river called the Dry Cimarron River in August of 1908. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3934.88s)]
*  And in the aftermath of that flash flood, this African-American cowboy named Charles [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3941.86s)]
*  McJunkin is out riding fence for one of the local ranchers, seeing what he's going to [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3948.58s)]
*  have to repair. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3954.46s)]
*  And as he's riding along, his horse suddenly pitches up and its hooves slide in the mud [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3956.5s)]
*  right to the edge of this freshly cut about 30 foot chasm in the slope that he's riding. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3963.38s)]
*  And when he leans out of his saddle and looks down into this this cut, what he sees are [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3971.7799999999997s)]
*  bones of a gigantic size that he's never seen before. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3978.66s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy who he had been on the buffalo hunting plains back in the 1870s. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3982.2599999999998s)]
*  So he had seen buffalo butcher. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3988.72s)]
*  He knew what bones from big animals look like. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3990.3799999999997s)]
*  But these were giant bones. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3992.7799999999997s)]
*  And so this guy, McJunkin, started trying to call attention to the site. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=3996.04s)]
*  He never was able to do so and get any archaeologists out or paleontologists out to look at it. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4001.76s)]
*  He dies in 1922. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4008.48s)]
*  But about four years after his death, this museum curator from Denver, a guy named Jesse [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4010.26s)]
*  Figgins comes down and brings a crew down. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4016.8s)]
*  And what Figgins is interested in, he's sort of an amateur guy himself. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4019.8s)]
*  He's just interested in some fancy big bones for his museum up in Denver. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4024.22s)]
*  But his crew starts digging into this site and they began uncovering these giant bison, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4030.04s)]
*  what they're finding is a site of bison antiquus, these giant bison that became extinct about [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4038.3799999999997s)]
*  10,000 years ago, the ones that the Folsom people had particularly specialized in hunting. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4043.7799999999997s)]
*  As they're excavating this site in the first summer, they come across just sort of lying [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4050.6s)]
*  in the debris, a couple of points like they've never seen before, which are three or four [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4056.96s)]
*  inches long and have these thin flutes on either side at the base. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4064.64s)]
*  There's one right there. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4071.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's one right there, the Folsom point. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4072.56s)]
*  So what Figgins' guys realize is that the hurdle for convincing the world, the scientific [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4076.64s)]
*  hurdle for convincing the world that humans had been present in America at the time, everybody [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4087.16s)]
*  thought Indians had only been in America for maybe a couple of thousand years before Europeans [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4092.7599999999998s)]
*  got here. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4097.4s)]
*  But the hurdle was finding an extinct animal out of the Pleistocene indicating that it [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4099.68s)]
*  had been killed by human technology while the animal was still alive. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4108.16s)]
*  And the next summer, I mean it happened to be a summer when the Smithsonian had just [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4115.4800000000005s)]
*  published an article by some fancy archaeologist saying, you know, North America has no antiquity [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4120.200000000001s)]
*  in its history. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4128.08s)]
*  Indians have only been here for at most 2,000 years, probably less than that. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4129.4s)]
*  And within about two months of that article coming out, this crew finds the scapula of [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4133.72s)]
*  one of these bison they're excavating with one of these Clovis points embedded three [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4142.66s)]
*  quarters of the way into the bone. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4147.24s)]
*  And at that point, they stop digging. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4150.08s)]
*  They call on all the famous archaeologists in the United States. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4152.84s)]
*  A guy named Alfred Kidder was the most famous archaeologist in America at the time. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4157.799999999999s)]
*  And he comes, takes a look and proclaims this one of the greatest discoveries in American [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4161.5199999999995s)]
*  history. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4169.04s)]
*  So they don't have radiocarbon dating yet. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4170.28s)]
*  And nobody knows how old this is. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4172.639999999999s)]
*  All they know is that that particular bison species has been extinct for quite a while. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4174.28s)]
*  Figen says this site is 400,000 years old. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4180.16s)]
*  But when we finally do get radiocarbon dating about two decades later, it looks as if a [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4186.32s)]
*  band of fulsome hunters using addaddles, using spear throwers, had killed 32 bison antiques [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4191.4s)]
*  in what had once been a box canyon on the southern plains 12,450 years ago. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4201.96s)]
*  And so suddenly that discovery in the early 20th century in the 1920s gives America a [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4210.28s)]
*  kind of an antiquity that it had never had before. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4217.28s)]
*  And within a decade, we discover the Clovis site, which is out on the Texas-New Mexico [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4220.84s)]
*  border. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4227.04s)]
*  And the Clovis site is of these elephant hunters who are actually even older than the fulsome [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4228.44s)]
*  people. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4233.679999999999s)]
*  This pushes when they're finally radiocarbon dated, that site pushes the dates back to [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4235.12s)]
*  the 13,000 year range. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4241.8s)]
*  So what these discoveries in the 20s and 30s are finally indicating that, contrary to [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4245.4s)]
*  what most Americans of the 20th century think, America is a brand new place. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4250.84s)]
*  History dates to the time Europeans got here in the 1600s. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4256.16s)]
*  Indian people have only been here a couple thousand years. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4263.08s)]
*  Suddenly we realize America is this really vastly old place. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4265.56s)]
*  And that sets up the subsequent story that I mean, I try to, what I try to do, I mean, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4270.28s)]
*  I was an English major as an undergraduate, so I'm kind of drawn to narrative storytelling, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4276.4s)]
*  telling a lot of stories. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4282.8s)]
*  And when you write a book with about 66 million years of history, you obviously have a lot [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4283.8s)]
*  of opportunity to tell stories because there are a lot of stories in a span of time like [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4288.08s)]
*  that. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4291.84s)]
*  What, when you say that the Clovis points and the fulsome points with the fluted part [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4292.84s)]
*  of it were so you could attach a stick to it. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4300.24s)]
*  There's no people in Europe that figured this out? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4303.4400000000005s)]
*  No, this was an American invention. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4306.64s)]
*  What did they use in Europe? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4309.4400000000005s)]
*  They were just using blade points sometimes with the ears at the bottom. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4312.28s)]
*  So that ears. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4319.400000000001s)]
*  So you have a triangular point and it has two ears coming out and you attach, you use [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4320.96s)]
*  the ears as a place to attach the rawhide. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4326.599999999999s)]
*  And so this was metal? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4330.5599999999995s)]
*  No, not metal. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4331.5599999999995s)]
*  What were they using? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4332.5599999999995s)]
*  Flint. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4333.5599999999995s)]
*  They were using Flint as well. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4334.5599999999995s)]
*  So when they were making these points, they were just doing it in a different way. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4336.599999999999s)]
*  They were doing it in a different way. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4339.94s)]
*  So they'd figured out the same sort of technology, kind of, attaching a stick, but they had different [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4341.2s)]
*  methods that seemed to just be human ingenuity. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4345.679999999999s)]
*  When did they figure that out? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4349.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, they certainly figured it out by what's called the Solutrian culture, which is a sort [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4351.08s)]
*  of a contemporary with Clovis. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4356.919999999999s)]
*  They're hunting big animals. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4358.759999999999s)]
*  They're hunting mammoths and rhinos and things like that in Europe. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4361.759999999999s)]
*  So that's in the 16,000, 17,000 year range. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4365.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so this this fluted idea is a distinctive North American invention. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4370.32s)]
*  Is there any difference in the quality of the type of the stone that was accessible [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4378.1s)]
*  to people in North America versus Europe? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4382.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, both places had outcrops of Flint and Flint and Obsidian were the two [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4384.700000000001s)]
*  types of stone you went for. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4391.3s)]
*  But North America had some really great Flint and Obsidian outcrops. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4393.46s)]
*  One of the things that's really pretty fascinating about these Clovis people, about Clovisia [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4403.74s)]
*  the Beautiful, and they were all over America, by the way, there are more of their points [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4408.94s)]
*  discovered in the southeast and in New England than there are in many places in the west. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4414.58s)]
*  So this is not just a Western phenomenon. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4421.46s)]
*  This just happens to be where we discovered them first. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4424.179999999999s)]
*  But they were all over America. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4427.4s)]
*  What they went for, they seem to be making pilgrimages to four or five locations that [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4430.0s)]
*  had the absolute best, sharpest, hardest Flint in America. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4437.04s)]
*  And they would go back to those spots again and again and again, kind of had a in their [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4442.8s)]
*  minds a mental geography of where these locations were. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4447.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4451.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4452.6s)]
*  So they one of the great things about the whole Clovis period, to a little lesser extent, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4453.6s)]
*  is that there are these spectacular blades that they did. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4458.84s)]
*  And sometimes they would do blades that were like eight or nine or 10 inches long. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4465.12s)]
*  And there are some of them, caches of some of these blades of that size, that indicate [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4470.92s)]
*  they were never used. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4475.76s)]
*  They basically were kind of ceremonial objects. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4477.12s)]
*  I mean, I kind of argue in the book, I mean, it's pretty much speculation because we don't [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4480.4800000000005s)]
*  know a huge amount about these people. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4486.8s)]
*  But one of the things I argue is that unlike in Western Europe, they didn't leave us grand [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4489.72s)]
*  cave art of these animals that they were hunting. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4496.8s)]
*  It's almost as if their tools were their art. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4501.72s)]
*  It was their tools kind of represented this ultimate technology, this sublime technology [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4508.8s)]
*  that they would actually create in some form in blades that they never really used to hunt, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4520.28s)]
*  just to have as ceremonial objects. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4527.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4529.96s)]
*  So it's a, I mean, it's a really fascinating story. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4531.48s)]
*  I mean, we've known about the Clovis people, obviously, for a long time. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4535.76s)]
*  We've been trying to figure out, of course, other explanations for what happened to the [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4539.96s)]
*  animals of the Pleistocene because we lost a lot of them during the Pleistocene. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4544.24s)]
*  And people have proposed all sorts of other theories. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4548.4s)]
*  But one of the strange things about this story, I mean, I tried to do a book that's based [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4552.88s)]
*  on all the latest science I could find and all the best people who are doing archaeology [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4557.5199999999995s)]
*  and paleontology and genomic science. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4563.36s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the possibilities these days. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4566.28s)]
*  We have genomic science that's able to tell us things now that we've never known, even [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4569.08s)]
*  over the last 15 or 20 years. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4574.0s)]
*  And one of the fascinating things about it is that it's almost like climate change. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4577.04s)]
*  We've tried to come up with every other possible explanation to let ourselves off the hook [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4584.839999999999s)]
*  for climate change. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4590.64s)]
*  But it almost looks like this is an old attribute of human self-interest and human nature. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4592.68s)]
*  We tend to not want to blame ourselves for very much at all. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4600.4800000000005s)]
*  We tend to look for other excuses for things. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4605.200000000001s)]
*  And none of the other suggestions about what might have happened, other than humans probably [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4607.84s)]
*  entered a continent with animals that were completely naive about us. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4615.68s)]
*  And in the time that it took them to smarten up and confront us, we were able to scatter [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4620.4400000000005s)]
*  them enough that what we kind of think now is that we may have gotten like populations [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4627.240000000001s)]
*  of mammoths so separated from one another that they couldn't exchange their genes. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4634.54s)]
*  And they may have succumbed to, I don't know if you've probably heard of what happened [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4640.56s)]
*  to the mammoths on Wrangell Island. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4645.12s)]
*  There was a group of mammoths out on an island in the sea off the coast of Alaska that were [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4646.96s)]
*  caught by rising waters in the Bering Sea and were isolated and survived down to about [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4655.599999999999s)]
*  4,000 years ago. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4662.32s)]
*  But even though humans never found them, even though the climate changed, the animals were [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4664.24s)]
*  fine until they finally reached a point where they had a small enough genetic diversity [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4669.64s)]
*  that as they interbred with one another over and over again, mistakes began to build into [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4676.04s)]
*  their genome to the point where they finally became unable to reproduce. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4682.96s)]
*  And 4,000 years ago, without any other effect being present, they died out. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4689.4800000000005s)]
*  Do we have biological remains or skeletal remains of Clovis people and people from that [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4695.84s)]
*  time period? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4704.08s)]
*  Yeah, we do. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4705.08s)]
*  There's actually a Clovis burial site in Montana of two infants, a young child and an infant. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4706.08s)]
*  And they were buried with ceremonial Clovis points, several inches long, covered in sacred [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4719.84s)]
*  what we think was sacred red ochre. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4728.84s)]
*  And that particular site in 2014, the local native people in Montana is near Bozeman, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4732.84s)]
*  and the local native people and archaeologists went out to the Shields River, the nearby [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4741.64s)]
*  Shields River, and after studying these young skeletons, they reburied them in the Shields [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4748.679999999999s)]
*  River, so they returned them to the earth in 2014. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4757.599999999999s)]
*  So they reburied them in the same site where they found them? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4761.44s)]
*  Near the same site. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4763.88s)]
*  Yeah, they were found on the banks of the Shields River. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4764.88s)]
*  That's interesting that they chose to do that, because I could understand why they would [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4768.96s)]
*  think to respect the bodies and bury them, but I could also understand like for science, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4772.5199999999995s)]
*  what an incredible discovery. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4777.92s)]
*  Yeah, well they did do science on them. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4778.92s)]
*  Was there genetic material? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4783.200000000001s)]
*  There was no physical tissue, no marrow or anything? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4785.040000000001s)]
*  Not that I'm aware, and I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4788.56s)]
*  Do they have an understanding of where these people might have come from originally? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4792.68s)]
*  They seem to have come, and again, because we do have some sites, I mean the Clovis people [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4798.92s)]
*  ended up all the way down into South America, and we do have genomic evidence from some [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4806.48s)]
*  of the sites that have preserved enough DNA to make educated guesses about this, that [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4812.28s)]
*  their origin was probably the Lake Baikal region in Siberia, and that they probably, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4819.32s)]
*  when the ice sheets opened, they probably came down in two different migrations, a kind [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4827.24s)]
*  of a northern Native American and a southern Native American migration they're often called, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4832.76s)]
*  even though both groups ended up with genetic markers as far south as Colombia and Brazil [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4839.24s)]
*  and places like that. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4845.92s)]
*  But yeah, so we've got enough genetic material that we are able to do that kind of thing. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4847.6s)]
*  I don't think that burial site in Montana yielded any, but there were other sites that [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4854.16s)]
*  did. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4859.4800000000005s)]
*  When did archery make its way to North America? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4860.36s)]
*  Well that was the next great, obviously the next great innovation, and the reason these [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4863.68s)]
*  innovations were important, by the way, and to answer your question, it was about 2,000 [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4869.599999999999s)]
*  years ago, and it seemed to come from the late arrival of Inuit people, the ancestors [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4875.28s)]
*  of folks who are sometimes called Eskimo. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4880.48s)]
*  The Inuit people seemed to either adapt or bring archery with them when they got to North [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4884.12s)]
*  America, and the idea for that then diffused, spread through all of North America within [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4889.68s)]
*  about five or six hundred years. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4895.88s)]
*  So we know that archery absolutely existed 2,000 years ago in Africa and some other places. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4898.16s)]
*  When did archery first, when did they believe archery was first invented? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4904.56s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4909.8s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4911.4800000000005s)]
*  So just 2,000 years of archery, which is incredible. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4913.0s)]
*  And what it meant was each one of these developments, particularly ad adels and archery and bows, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4917.36s)]
*  meant that you didn't have to do what Neanderthals had done, which is engage in sort of hand [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4925.839999999999s)]
*  to hand combat with large, strong, and sometimes really resilient creatures like wild horses [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4934.5599999999995s)]
*  or mammoths at close range. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4944.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, some of these Neanderthal sites, for example, I mean, the guys were just beaten [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4947.0s)]
*  to hell, man. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4955.64s)]
*  I mean, they had their cheeks caved in. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4956.84s)]
*  They had broken, I mean, thigh bones broken. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4959.52s)]
*  They had amputated arms, all kinds of really severe injuries from taking on animals. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4963.76s)]
*  But Neanderthals, one of the things we know from nitrogen isotope studies of their bones [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4972.8s)]
*  is Neanderthals were more carnivorous than wolves were. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4978.24s)]
*  I mean, they were eating a higher percentage of meat diet than even gray wolves in Europe. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4982.8s)]
*  So each one of these kind of innovations, adadels, of course, by extending the human [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4990.88s)]
*  arm, you're able to stand back 30, 40 yards from an animal and throw a dart and kill it. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=4996.28s)]
*  With bows, you're able to get back even farther. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5003.44s)]
*  I mean, they rescue you from sort of doing hand to hand combat with an animal that can [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5005.719999999999s)]
*  easily kill you or crush you. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5011.679999999999s)]
*  What were Neanderthals using for weapons? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  They were primarily using wooden spears. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5015.82s)]
*  They didn't have flint points. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5018.639999999999s)]
*  They were using spears that with points that had been hardened in fires. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5020.3s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5025.96s)]
*  The oldest arrow is here, like 72,000. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5026.96s)]
*  72,000 years ago. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5029.88s)]
*  The oldest bow is only like 8,000. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5031.88s)]
*  So they didn't find a bow. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5033.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5035.88s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5037.88s)]
*  72 to 60,000 years ago. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5039.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5041.88s)]
*  Some of which poisons may have been used. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5042.88s)]
*  Likely, arrowheads were reported in 2020 by Fa Hin Cave in Sri Lanka, dated to 48,000 years ago. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5044.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5054.92s)]
*  Bow and arrow hunting in Sri Lankan site likely focused on monkeys and smaller animals such [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5055.92s)]
*  as squirrels. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5061.16s)]
*  Remains of these creatures are found in the same sediment as the bone points. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5062.16s)]
*  Oh, they used bone points. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5065.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5068.24s)]
*  In 2022, arrowheads were reported from the Grotte, how do you say that? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5069.24s)]
*  Mandarin cave in France, dating to around 54,000 years ago. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5073.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5078.84s)]
*  You can get an idea of, and this is important to this whole story, of the isolation of North [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5080.8s)]
*  America once people get there. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5087.360000000001s)]
*  The glacial maximum recedes and the climate begins to warm enough to break apart the corridor [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5091.4400000000005s)]
*  that links Asia and North America. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5098.96s)]
*  Then North America is completely isolated, except for the South American connection through [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5102.64s)]
*  Panama, is completely isolated from the rest of the world. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5107.88s)]
*  It's isolated not only from innovations like the use of bows in the old world, but, and [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5112.04s)]
*  this becomes, of course, a major part of the story when Europeans arrive, with domesticated [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5121.320000000001s)]
*  animals from which they, for eight or nine or 10,000 years, have been contracting spillover [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5126.4400000000005s)]
*  diseases, creating a European population that, of course, has now been winnowed by things [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5134.48s)]
*  like measles and smallpox and plague and all kinds of diseases that had spread across Eurasia, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5141.599999999999s)]
*  but never got to isolate in North and South America. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5150.5599999999995s)]
*  And so when Europeans arrive with domesticated animals and animal diseases, they confront [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5154.08s)]
*  an American population of native people who have never been exposed to any of them. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5164.4s)]
*  And that results in one of the great, possibly the greatest catastrophe in human history. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5168.879999999999s)]
*  It's the term that people have been using these days is the great dying. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5175.12s)]
*  I mean, we think by the time Europeans got here, and I don't want to, by the way, admit [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5180.16s)]
*  the fact I do a whole chapter called Ravens and Coyotes America that is about the 10,000 [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5185.759999999999s)]
*  years after the Pleistocene, because native people are here for 10,000 years and managed [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5191.84s)]
*  to preserve almost all the biological diversity, at least what's left after the Pleistocene, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5199.84s)]
*  for 10,000 years. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5205.04s)]
*  There's only one extinction that I was able to find during that time. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5206.16s)]
*  A flightless sea duck became extinct in that 10,000 year period. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5210.56s)]
*  But I mean, they managed to preserve almost all of North America's biodiversity across [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5215.4400000000005s)]
*  that time span. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5220.48s)]
*  And then Europeans arrive with all these old world diseases. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5222.24s)]
*  And in a blink of an eye, what had at one point been, and to be sure most of this population [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5226.879999999999s)]
*  is in South America, 56 million people in the two Americas, something like 80 to 85% [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5234.32s)]
*  of that population is taken out in a few decades by old world diseases. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5242.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's, as I said, it may be the greatest human catastrophe. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5250.959999999999s)]
*  That's the speculation for what happened to the Mayans and the Aztecs and a lot of these [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5255.759999999999s)]
*  amazing structures that they're now finding in the Amazon jungle. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5261.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5264.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they were taken. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5265.44s)]
*  I mean, you know, some of these civilizations, like, you know, in North America, we had the [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5266.4s)]
*  great Chacoan civilization that was our version of the Mayan or Aztec or Toltec groups down [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5271.04s)]
*  in Central America. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5283.92s)]
*  I mean, we had this great civilization in the American Southwest centered around what [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5285.12s)]
*  are today the Chacoan National Park ruins with a civilization that spread over probably [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5290.8s)]
*  50,000 square miles and included hundreds of small hamlets and a central city, Chaco, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5297.92s)]
*  that was sort of like the Vatican. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5305.76s)]
*  I mean, there were priests who lived there most of the year, priests who, through the [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5307.92s)]
*  history of Chaco, inherited generation after generation their position. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5312.96s)]
*  I mean, there's a fascinating archaeological site at Chaco that shows 14 burials in one room [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5318.72s)]
*  in Chaco. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5328.08s)]
*  Nine of those burials span the entire history, the 300 year history of Chaco. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5330.0s)]
*  Every one of those nine is related to one another through a female line, the mitochondrial [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5338.08s)]
*  line, and each of the nine present from the start of Chaco to the end of it, from about [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5346.56s)]
*  1200, has a genetic abnormality, a sixth toe on one foot. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5354.96s)]
*  So these were the people who were regarded as the priests of the place. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5365.2s)]
*  And so a couple of times a year, usually at the solstices, they would have these big [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5370.4800000000005s)]
*  celebrations and 40,000 people would flock into Chaco and observe the solstices and do [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5375.2s)]
*  ceremonies and, you know, no doubt engage in all sorts of epic nightlife too. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5383.12s)]
*  But over time, over 300 years of time, drought and a local overuse of resources. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5387.92s)]
*  And also, I mean, this is kind of the famous story of Chaco. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5396.96s)]
*  What really sort of happened to Chaco is that the priests were promising all of their [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5401.68s)]
*  followers that they could make it rain in the desert because this was an agricultural, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5407.84s)]
*  agriculture had finally come to North America. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5413.2s)]
*  And we reached a point when droughts began to strike and the priests couldn't make it rain, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5416.88s)]
*  at which point all their followers basically abandoned their religion. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5423.76s)]
*  And the archaeologists who have gone in have sort of pointed out that so it kind of looks as if [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5431.28s)]
*  a disparity in lifestyle must have contributed because the priests and the priestly class, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5437.52s)]
*  they were the ones that were getting to eat all the protein from the deer and the antelope. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5447.200000000001s)]
*  As a result, they were their skeletons are three or four inches taller than all the peasants. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5453.200000000001s)]
*  They lived longer, their children got past the age of five much more easily. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5460.32s)]
*  And so there is speculation about Chaco that the disparity and wealth [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5467.679999999999s)]
*  followed by the inability of the priests to deliver and make it rain is what caused this [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5474.5599999999995s)]
*  civilization to collapse when the peasant class basically rose up and overthrew it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5482.639999999999s)]
*  Wow, that's so fascinating because that seems like that just happens with humans. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5487.92s)]
*  When humans get into a position of power, they want to maintain it and tighten up the [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5492.88s)]
*  grips on everybody else. They want rules for them, but not for everyone else. They want to [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5496.96s)]
*  have different privileges. We're dealing with this like literally right now. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5502.16s)]
*  Well, sure. I mean, you know, it shouldn't surprise us, I guess. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5506.4800000000005s)]
*  Shouldn't surprise us. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5509.6s)]
*  Human nature has been the same. Yeah, it's probably been the same for three million years. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5510.24s)]
*  But it's just so fascinating when you see it manifesting in this ancient culture and the [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5514.88s)]
*  people wise up and go, you can't make it rain. And then they eventually get sick of giving these [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5519.2s)]
*  people all their deer. Are there images of this particular site that Jamie could find? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5524.8s)]
*  We could see what it looks like. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5530.24s)]
*  Yeah. If you just punch up Chaco Canyon Historic National Park, you'll find the major site, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5531.6s)]
*  and I've got, of course, photographs of all this in the book, but the major site is called Pueblo [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5540.96s)]
*  Benito. B-O-N-I-T-O. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5545.44s)]
*  And so how long did their civilization thrive for? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5548.4s)]
*  For about 300 years. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5551.68s)]
*  Just like us. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5553.84s)]
*  Yeah, just like us. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5554.56s)]
*  It's a cycle. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5558.24s)]
*  With a disparity of wealth that produced. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5558.96s)]
*  Unless you have authoritarian dictatorship. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5563.68s)]
*  Yeah, here you go. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5566.0s)]
*  You can get people to do whatever the fuck you want and you keep things going. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5566.72s)]
*  So that's Pueblo Benito. And so you'll notice this, the caption there, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5569.52s)]
*  did women control the bloodline, which speaks to what I was just telling you a minute ago. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5573.84s)]
*  Out of those burials in this central room, in this structure, they all, nine of the 14 buried there, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5578.64s)]
*  were all related to a single woman who was at Chaco at the founding of this civilization. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5588.88s)]
*  Wow. Now, is there an artist's rendering or representation of what it must have? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5595.84s)]
*  Look at that. That looks incredible. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5601.6s)]
*  Yeah, there is. The National Park Service, I know, has done one on some of their brochures [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5603.360000000001s)]
*  of what it looked like originally. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5608.16s)]
*  See if you can find anything like that, Jamie, an artist's rendering of what it looked like. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5610.08s)]
*  That's wild stuff. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5616.16s)]
*  And so what years was this again? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5620.56s)]
*  Basically 900 to 1200. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5622.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow. Look at that. That's incredible. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5625.679999999999s)]
*  They built 400 miles of roads, by the way, and they built their roads straight arrow across [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5630.799999999999s)]
*  the landscape. I mean, they didn't swerve around mesas or buttes or so. Yeah, this would [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5639.839999999999s)]
*  have been what Pueblo Benito looked like. And as you see, AD 1100. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5645.599999999999s)]
*  As you see, AD 1100. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5650.48s)]
*  Oh, look how they have that one tree. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5652.08s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. That's amazing. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5653.599999999999s)]
*  When they first settled the area, it was covered in a pinyon juniper vegetation, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5659.36s)]
*  but almost all those trees disappeared over the life of Chaco because these people were [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5667.839999999999s)]
*  farming the classic Mexican cultivar complex, corn, beans, and squash, all of which require [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5674.96s)]
*  fires to prepare. And so when you have a food dish that requires you to build a fire [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5681.36s)]
*  to prepare it, and you're in an area with a limited resource of possible wood, over time, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5689.76s)]
*  a civilization of that size almost completely obliterated all the surrounding vegetation. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5698.4s)]
*  No. The stone axes. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5703.84s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I mean, it's yet another example of human nature that's always been in place. And [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5706.88s)]
*  we tend to be so self-centered or living in our own heads that we think all these things, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5713.12s)]
*  this just applies to us. But these kind of things, living for status, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5719.6s)]
*  acting in a way that separates you from the lowly peasants of the world, this is ancient. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5726.16s)]
*  We have always figured out ways to do it, ways to distinguish ourselves, and those kinds of things [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5734.56s)]
*  have often led to serious problems in human history. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5741.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's just so fascinating to see that this has always been the case. People have always been [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5745.12s)]
*  very short-sighted in terms of allocation of resources and preservation of resources. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5751.4400000000005s)]
*  We always have, and we have another instinct too. We tend to, whenever things start, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5757.04s)]
*  we start growing short of things, we always blame somebody else. This is the classic way. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5761.36s)]
*  Bad spirits, enemies. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5767.04s)]
*  Yeah, enemies, some other group. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5769.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5771.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, in subsequent European history, and so I will say what we've been [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5771.599999999999s)]
*  talking about, it's primarily the first three chapters of this book, and the last seven [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5777.839999999999s)]
*  chapters, plus the epilogue, is all about the period from the time Europeans arrived up to [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5783.12s)]
*  the present, up to really last year. But I mean, all these same things play out in the story. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5787.84s)]
*  I mean, Europeans, unlike native people, I mean, and I make an argument for why native people, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5798.88s)]
*  I think, preserve that biodiversity for so long. I mean, despite examples like Chaco, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5806.72s)]
*  you still have virtually all the animals, all the birds, all the reptiles that had survived [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5813.4400000000005s)]
*  the Pleistocene, 10,000 years of human occupation later, they're all still here when Europeans get [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5819.28s)]
*  here. And I think, I mean, I explain it several ways, one of which is the population of North [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5825.2s)]
*  America, north of the Rio Grande River, never rises above five million. These people understand [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5831.12s)]
*  that you've got to keep your population in check, or you will use up the world. And so they [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5837.2s)]
*  consciously do it. How do they consciously do that? Do we know? Well, they do it primarily by [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5844.24s)]
*  various techniques of holding birth rates down. And one way of doing it is birth spacing. You [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5849.679999999999s)]
*  nurse children, say, until they're five or six years old. And as long as women are nursing, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5857.36s)]
*  they don't go through another chance to get pregnant. So that spaces births out. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5864.24s)]
*  And the other thing they do is, frankly, they engage in abortion. I mean, they very actively [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5872.8s)]
*  decide, in some instances, that we don't have the resources to support this infant. Do we know how [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5878.24s)]
*  they did that? Well, they did it by by various herbal means. And they also sometimes engage from, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5887.68s)]
*  you know, this is pretty draconian, but they sometimes engaged in killing infants after they [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5894.96s)]
*  were born. Infanticide is, I mean, it wasn't hugely common. And I'll say this also about infanticide. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5901.92s)]
*  After a woman would carry a baby to term and then have it killed, it created the impulse that [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5910.72s)]
*  probably helped lead to the development of agriculture. I mean, agriculture is the next [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5921.84s)]
*  great economy and innovation in the way humans live. And what it enables you to do, I mean, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5929.68s)]
*  one of the things that seems to prompt it is that you've lowered the possible animal life around you [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5939.04s)]
*  to the degree that you can't really keep going as hunters and gatherers. So you have to come up with [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5947.68s)]
*  something else. And in North America, native people do this several thousand years, they go to [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5953.4400000000005s)]
*  agriculture several thousand years later than Europe does. I mean, Europe has been continuously [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5959.280000000001s)]
*  occupied for 55, 60,000 years. So they reach a point where the animal populations have been [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5963.84s)]
*  reduced earlier by eight or nine or 10,000 years ago, and have to go to agriculture and domestication. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5970.24s)]
*  In North America, we don't really do it until about four or 5,000 years ago. And in what is now the [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5976.88s)]
*  United States only really about 1500, 2000 years ago, do you have the first evidence of [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5982.64s)]
*  going to agriculture, but people are anxious to come up with a new economy [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5989.68s)]
*  that doesn't require you to be so draconian about population suppression. So they just thought of [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=5996.32s)]
*  any new baby as a threat to the food source. Well, some new babies, not everyone. Yeah, but some [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6002.72s)]
*  new babies had a number. They had a number they're very clear. They mean, they had really short [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6008.32s)]
*  feedback loops, and they understood their local ecologies really well. And one of the things you [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6012.8s)]
*  knew is that you couldn't base your population on the best years you experienced. You had to [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6017.92s)]
*  base your population usually on the worst years. Because if you went for the best years, whenever [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6024.56s)]
*  the worst ones came along, you were going to end up really hit hard. Starving to death was a real [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6030.4800000000005s)]
*  possibility. A real possibility. So you're cautious and you base what you think the carrying capacity [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6036.16s)]
*  of your resource base is on the worst years you're going to face. And this is speculation? Is this [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6043.12s)]
*  educated guess? How do we know this? Well, it's beyond speculation. I mean, we know this is a [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6050.24s)]
*  principle of sort of hunter gatherer life ways around the world, even still among some hunter [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6056.08s)]
*  gatherers that exist today. They still employ those kind of techniques. But they're always looking for [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6061.2s)]
*  the opportunity to escape that. And for people in Europe 10,000 years ago, and for people in North [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6070.4s)]
*  America, you know, between five and 2000 years ago, the opportunity to escape it somewhat was [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6078.5599999999995s)]
*  agriculture. Because that produced, if you specialize in a few food crops. And by the way, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6086.719999999999s)]
*  one of the differences in agriculture and the Neolithic Revolution in the old world and the [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6096.4s)]
*  Americas is in the old world, obviously, much of it depends on domesticating animals. The animals [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6101.679999999999s)]
*  that are left after the end of the Pleistocene in Europe, horses, camels, goats, sheep, hogs, cows, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6106.719999999999s)]
*  wild oryx, are almost all domesticated. I mean, in some cases, in the case of wild horses, it's [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6116.639999999999s)]
*  probably what saved them is that they got domesticated. In North America, though, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6122.88s)]
*  there were almost no domestications. Wild turkeys were domesticated, some groups domesticated ducks, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6129.12s)]
*  but there weren't any mammals. Nobody domesticated bison or bighorn sheep or pronghorns. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6136.56s)]
*  And one of the things that does when Europeans arrive is that, I mean, Europeans come out of this [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6145.84s)]
*  ancient 8,000 year old herding culture. They've been herding goats and sheep, and they've developed [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6153.84s)]
*  a religious tradition. Ultimately, the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is probably [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6163.52s)]
*  based on earlier things, to be sure, that is basically a herder's religion, where what that [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6170.48s)]
*  religion teaches you is that not only are humans exceptional, but it teaches you that [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6178.24s)]
*  predators are the enemy. Any animal that preys on your sheep or your goats has to be eliminated. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6188.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, in North America, where you don't have domestications of animals, predators are [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6196.88s)]
*  regarded as these prized, sacred creatures who keep the world functioning the way it's supposed [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6203.52s)]
*  to function. And people look for a predator as a totem animal in a vision quest, or they name their [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6211.28s)]
*  clan the wolf clan or the panther clan. So it produces a world when the two groups come together. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6221.36s)]
*  Here are these native people who still have the ancient human idea that we are part of everything [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6233.12s)]
*  around us. Other animals are just like us. They have societies. They can actually intermarry with [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6242.5599999999995s)]
*  us. I mean, many native ceremonies, and I described several of them in the book, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6253.12s)]
*  are about whenever you confront the idea of animals are becoming scarce, you do ceremonies that are [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6258.32s)]
*  designed to not only make the animals reappear for you, but the way you do that is to convince [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6265.68s)]
*  them that you still regard them as kin. You're still willing to, you're going to do a ceremony [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6272.56s)]
*  where you go through a kind of a faux series of marriages between humans and bison. And so [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6277.92s)]
*  this kind of, we're all part of a kinship web. I mean, it's what Charles Darwin finally [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6287.280000000001s)]
*  provides the scientific evidence for and, you know, and on the origin of species in 1859. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6294.4800000000005s)]
*  We're out of the same evolutionary stream. Europeans have meanwhile, old worlders have come up with a [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6301.280000000001s)]
*  completely different idea. This herding religion they have is that posits that, well, I'll tell you [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6307.52s)]
*  the story that sort of launched me writing this book. This is a kind of a good way to say this, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6314.72s)]
*  I guess. My oldest memory is from when I was four years old. I mean, psychologists say a lot of us, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6320.08s)]
*  our oldest memory is from the age of four. This is the only one I really remember from the age of [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6327.6s)]
*  four. And I think the reason I remember is because it's, you know, sort of laden in emotional content. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6332.32s)]
*  So it's really engraved in my system. And here's what happened when I was four years old. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6339.44s)]
*  I had the first little animal companion I ever had, and it was a little chicken, a little, you know, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6346.4s)]
*  few weeks old chicken, still yellow. And, you know, I'm not very imaginative as a four-year-old, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6352.799999999999s)]
*  so I name it Chicky. And so Chicky and I, my first great friend and buddy, spend our time dashing [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6359.12s)]
*  through my parents' house in Louisiana in a game of chase. And I'm chasing Chicky underneath the [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6368.799999999999s)]
*  sewing machine, underneath the couch, and underneath the dining table. And one day, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6375.04s)]
*  you know, as a little clumsy four-year-old, I miscalculate and I step on my little chicken and [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6379.92s)]
*  I kill it. So I'm four years old, I'm confronting mortality and loss for the first time. My mom and [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6384.64s)]
*  I go out in the backyard, and I mean, we're both crying and we bury Chicky. And as we're standing [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6394.32s)]
*  there and I've, you know, shoveled dirt over Chicky and sobbing away the whole time, and I [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6400.08s)]
*  turn to my mother and I say, so, Mom, just sort of one last plead, Mom, I get to have Chicky again [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6406.72s)]
*  in heaven, don't I? And my mother, who is this good southern Methodist and has absorbed the [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6416.5599999999995s)]
*  western worldview in its entirety, and who's also kind of known all her life for giving you [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6426.88s)]
*  the unpainted version of things anyway, even if you're four years old, I guess, she looks down [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6433.76s)]
*  at me and although she's crying and feels compassion for me, she says, she's got to tell [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6439.04s)]
*  me the truth. Why, no, honey, you're made in the image of God and you have an everlasting soul. So [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6446.4800000000005s)]
*  when you die, you get to go to heaven. Chicky is just an animal. Chickies don't get to do anything [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6454.32s)]
*  like that. So I'm afraid Chicky is just dead. So it was my instruction in the European worldview. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6462.08s)]
*  Other creatures are something completely different. There in the Judeo-Christian tradition, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6472.799999999999s)]
*  other animals are made for our use. They're made, as Genesis puts it, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6481.68s)]
*  unto your hand. Are they delivered? You can basically do anything you want with them. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6490.88s)]
*  And with this idea of humans as exceptional and everything else out there, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6499.84s)]
*  as just sort of for utility purposes to make the lives of humans better. I mean, we arrive in North [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6506.48s)]
*  America with this idea, very different from what native people with their kinship notions have, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6515.68s)]
*  and also with burgeoning capitalism, the beginnings of the global market economy, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6522.16s)]
*  economy. And with so many native people dying, North America is undergoing this huge ecological [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6529.679999999999s)]
*  release of wildlife. It's the origin of our Virgin America stories where North America is just [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6539.2s)]
*  teeming with everything under the sun. And we look on animals then as just being like gold, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6546.5599999999995s)]
*  trees, grass, whatever we want to exploit, we turn them into commodities. And it's sort of the [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6555.12s)]
*  explanation for the global North American fur trade, beavers as an object of pursuit, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6561.919999999999s)]
*  white-tailed deer as an object of pursuit for leather. We should tell people that beaver were [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6570.879999999999s)]
*  so in pursuit that at one time the richest man in the world was a beaver furrier. Yes. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6576.32s)]
*  The richest man in the world sold beaver pelts. John Jacob Astor, yeah. And the first great [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6584.5599999999995s)]
*  American corporation was a fur trading corporation to exploit the beaver populations of North America. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6589.28s)]
*  How wild is that? Yeah. So this is the story then that starts unfolding. And it's amplified by the [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6595.28s)]
*  fact that all these Europeans who have come over, especially the ones from England and France, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6604.08s)]
*  they've gone through centuries of the feudal economy where these lords of the manor and kings [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6610.08s)]
*  control access not just to landscapes but to animals. So, I mean, it's the origin of the Robin [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6621.36s)]
*  Hood story. Robin Hood is a deer poacher who represents the peasant population that the king's [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6628.24s)]
*  forest and the sheriff of Nottingham as the game warden won't let him at. So suddenly this population [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6635.04s)]
*  of people who have been resentful about the fact that they can't hunt, that they can't enjoy the [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6643.2s)]
*  bounty of the forests in Europe arrive in North America. And even though the native people try to [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6649.44s)]
*  convince Europeans, the deer are like our cattle. You have to understand they belong to us. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6656.48s)]
*  Europeans, of course, don't acknowledge that. And suddenly here are all these animals, all this [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6662.400000000001s)]
*  wildlife, I mean, in super abundance. And nobody is telling you that you can't go after it. And [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6668.08s)]
*  then there's market hunting. And then there's and so yeah, and so a lot of them, I mean, this is how [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6675.04s)]
*  rural and lower class people basically rise to the middle class as you exploit animal populations [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6680.8s)]
*  and sell them. And that gets you into the currency economy. It's so fortunate that they figured this [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6687.04s)]
*  out somewhere early in the 20th century, and started instituting wildlife conservation and, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6697.92s)]
*  you know, reintroducing animals and things along those lines. It's just well, I, yeah, and I, of [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6705.2s)]
*  course, I track the story all the way through and I won't, you know, elaborate on how it goes. I will [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6711.84s)]
*  say that, you know, there have been a couple of reviews on like Goodreads and Amazon of this book [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6718.8s)]
*  where people say, well, this is an anti-hunting book. I mean, which is kind of, you know, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6725.68s)]
*  it caused me a certain amount of chagrin because of how I grew up. I mean, I grew up hunting. I mean, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6733.84s)]
*  I stopped hunting in my 20s, but when I was in Montana, at least three times in the last [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6738.88s)]
*  decade, I was there, I would buy a deer license and shoot a mule deer out in the pasture in order to [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6745.84s)]
*  stock my freezer with venison. And in some ways, I mean, I look at this book as this is probably the [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6750.4800000000005s)]
*  most comprehensive story of the human relationship with animals, which obviously involves hunting that [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6756.08s)]
*  anybody has told at least about North America. You can't read reviews [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6762.16s)]
*  because there's always going to be someone that has a ridiculous take on things. Then you have to [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6766.56s)]
*  argue that ridiculous take because it doesn't make any sense to you. And then you're wasting [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6771.280000000001s)]
*  time on some fool's ideas. Yeah, you're wasting time. And you know, what a lot of people do is [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6774.4800000000005s)]
*  if they already think what you're saying, I mean, you get five star reviews. If you say something [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6779.360000000001s)]
*  that is not part of their, the package that they bring to the game. Right. Yeah, of course. Yeah, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6786.160000000001s)]
*  yeah, that the anti hunting notion is an interesting one. I mean, it's just reality, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6792.24s)]
*  the reality of North America to say that that's anti hunting. That's ridiculous. That's just [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6797.28s)]
*  reality. It's just the market hunting thing is well documented, particularly in regards to the [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6801.84s)]
*  buffalo. When you see bison skulls stacked on top of each other, anybody that doesn't think that [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6807.759999999999s)]
*  that looks absolutely hideous and horrific, like how did they get so far gone that they thought [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6812.32s)]
*  that was okay? Yeah, I mean, and at the same time that was happening, I mean, we were taking out, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6818.08s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the ones that stuns me passenger pigeons, the most numerous bird, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6823.28s)]
*  not just in North America, but in the world, we think there may have been 10 billion of them at [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6828.8s)]
*  one point, had been in North America for 15 million years. Those birds couldn't survive 400 [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6832.88s)]
*  years of our presence. It's amazing. Once we arrive, they can't last. I mean, they actually, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6841.44s)]
*  they only last about 300 years after we arrived. How did they kill so many of them before they had [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6848.16s)]
*  firearms? With passenger pigeons, I mean, it was very much like the industrial hunt for bison. I [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6853.44s)]
*  mean, you had to use firearms, obviously, for that. But for passenger pigeons, the commercial [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6860.639999999999s)]
*  hunt, the market hunt was basically done with nets. You spread nets across the forest and they [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6866.4s)]
*  were spring loaded and were released. And what they would do is they use live passenger pigeon decoys [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6872.96s)]
*  that were placed on the end of a pedestal that rocked back and forth. They were called [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6883.759999999999s)]
*  stools. And so the passenger pigeon decoy was referred to as a stool pigeon. Wow. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6890.24s)]
*  So that's where that comes from. That's where it comes from. What did that look like? Can you see [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6900.24s)]
*  if you can find an image of what that looked like? So, you know, we get stool pigeon from, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6904.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, the gangster movies about the 1920s, 1930s. And what they're referring to is stool [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6910.5599999999995s)]
*  pigeon is basically a trader. The stool pigeon rats you out. Wow. And so this was all market [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6915.76s)]
*  hunting as well. The pasture pigeon. Yeah, it was market. I mean, people don't think of pigeons as [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6925.2s)]
*  being a food source, but that is really what they were. Yeah. So this pigeon is secured in place [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6930.88s)]
*  somehow. Yeah, its feet are attached to the stool. Wow. And the live ones, the live birds that you [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6937.44s)]
*  did this with, when you rocked the stool back and forth, it would flap its wings as if it were landing [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6945.759999999999s)]
*  and that would then bring down. Wow. Then they would spring load the nets and capture them all. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6954.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they wiped out the entire population that way. That's incredible. And one of the reasons [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6960.879999999999s)]
*  they wiped the population out was because, I mean, in the last hunts which were taking place [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6966.08s)]
*  in the upper Midwest and Wisconsin in particular, I mean, they went after them while they were on [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6973.28s)]
*  their nests. So why were they surprised? I mean, the whole idea is as when the last pasture pigeon [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6980.72s)]
*  died, for example, in 1914, you know, a famous story, it dies in the Cincinnati Zoo, Martha, [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6991.6s)]
*  it's called after Martha Washington. Martha dies in 1914. Okay, so that's the beginning of World War [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=6996.400000000001s)]
*  I, the Great War, to be sure lots of newspapers were focused on other things. But I could hardly [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7003.360000000001s)]
*  find any newspapers in America that wrote an obituary about the last passenger pigeon, what had [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7009.52s)]
*  been the most numerous bird, the most charismatic bird and the emblem bird, our symbol of avian [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7017.44s)]
*  America. I could find one newspaper that wrote an obituary. Wow. And that newspaper said, [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7026.24s)]
*  you know, we guess we should feel bad about the loss of the passenger pigeons. But on the other [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7033.2s)]
*  hand, maybe it's a good thing that they're not going to be like grasshoppers and stick around [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7039.759999999999s)]
*  with us. So that was kind of the extent. Anyway, I use a lot of this as essentially argue that, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7046.88s)]
*  you know, I mean, I do this, this theme of first contact a lot. And I mentioned the first contact [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7058.24s)]
*  between humans and animals that they had never seen. Talk about first contact in the book between [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7064.400000000001s)]
*  Europeans and native people. And the whole idea of first contact theory is that the only way you can [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7069.12s)]
*  really relate to something brand new that you've never seen is through what's already in your head. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7074.4s)]
*  You already have some notions, and that's how you understand the new. And then after you've had some [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7080.4s)]
*  some familiarity with it, you can develop new notions. But one of the themes I do in the book [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7086.4s)]
*  is essentially continental first contact. And what I'm arguing with it is that what we bring [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7092.4s)]
*  out of the old world to America is the conviction that we're going to recreate [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7099.84s)]
*  North America, the United States in the image or as clones of England, France, Germany. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7105.04s)]
*  Because that's all we know. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7112.8s)]
*  It's all we know. And these are places, of course, that in the previous several hundred years before [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7113.68s)]
*  colonization in North America had wiped out all their big animals. I mean, all you've got left in [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7119.12s)]
*  England has any wolves since the 1400s. They got partridges. And so people come to North America, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7124.56s)]
*  and immediately the idea is whatever is really wild. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7132.0s)]
*  We really need to get rid of it. Passenger pigeons, bison, grizzly bears, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7139.92s)]
*  wolves. Those are not the earmarks of a civilized society. England doesn't have those kinds of things. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7147.360000000001s)]
*  And so, I mean, it kind of takes the heroes of this book, I think are probably the ecologists [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7156.4800000000005s)]
*  of the 20th century, who began to realize, so North America is really old. It's had all these [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7162.88s)]
*  animals for a really long time. And all these ideas out of Europe, actually, they're not based on [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7170.72s)]
*  science. They're based on just old folk traditions out of this herding kind of culture. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7177.92s)]
*  So we've got a chance to do something new here. And we've created this vast public land system [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7185.04s)]
*  in North America. So we actually are able to get to have all these big, charismatic animals. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7192.4800000000005s)]
*  If we just wake up in time, I mean, it's Aldo Leopold, really, who sort of is the advocate for [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7199.92s)]
*  this more than anybody else by the middle of the 20th century. He's arguing that we need to do an [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7207.04s)]
*  American thing, not just try to make the United States into some version of England. Because, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7213.2s)]
*  as Henry David Thoreau had famously said back in the middle of the 19th century, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7219.84s)]
*  he was reading the accounts of the first Europeans to get to Massachusetts, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7225.12s)]
*  seeing all these creatures in huge abundance. 200 years later, 1857, he's sitting there in his study [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7229.04s)]
*  and realizing, I don't get to see any of this, really. And he writes this incredible passage [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7237.839999999999s)]
*  in his journal in March of 1857, where he says, I realize it's like [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7244.72s)]
*  going to a symphony. And midway through the first movement, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7253.04s)]
*  it suddenly occurs to me, wow, there are no strings. There are no, wow, there are no woodwinds. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7260.08s)]
*  There's no percussion. That's all gone. And then he goes further and he says, it's like looking up [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7266.0s)]
*  at the stars at night and realizing that some demigod has come before you and plucked all the [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7271.92s)]
*  best of the constellations out of the sky, and you're not getting to see the full night sky. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7279.92s)]
*  And he says, you know, I realize somebody has come along and emasculated America before I could live [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7286.88s)]
*  in it quickly. And then he has this great line, and I use it as the title of one of the chapters [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7296.24s)]
*  in here. I wish to know an entire heaven and an entire earth, he says. I want to know the full [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7303.92s)]
*  thing. I don't want to think that somebody has come before me and selfishly robbed me of all these [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7313.28s)]
*  experiences. It's just so bizarre that human beings repeat these same patterns over and over [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7320.8s)]
*  and over again. And with the invention of firearms, they were able to do it so effectively. And with [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7328.88s)]
*  those traps they use for the stool pigeons, use it so effectively that they could completely change [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7335.679999999999s)]
*  the landscape in a relatively short amount of time. In a short amount of time, you know, and I mean, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7342.16s)]
*  it takes until... So this year, 2023, is the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act of [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7347.76s)]
*  1973. I mean, this was kind of the Hail Mary. Now, to be sure, back at the beginning of the 20th [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7355.360000000001s)]
*  century when Teddy Roosevelt is president, I mean, we come up with the game laws for most of the [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7362.56s)]
*  states, which are all aimed, of course, at what we're trying to preserve are the things that people [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7368.56s)]
*  want to hunt. And we have the idea that we're going to get rid of all the predators and we're [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7373.52s)]
*  going to substitute human sport hunters for predation. This is how we're going to... Because [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7378.8s)]
*  one of the things they're confronting in the early 20th century is what's called, as they remove [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7384.56s)]
*  predators from various regions, the ungulate populations, deer and elk and moose, start going [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7390.160000000001s)]
*  through eruptions. Their population starts just booming and then they'll eat all the forage and [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7396.8s)]
*  die. Elder Leopold studied this and said before 1900, he could find mentions of only two eruptions [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7404.400000000001s)]
*  like this that had happened in America. After 1900, and we started the predator war, he found 42 [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7413.68s)]
*  of them. So the idea was we're going to use human hunters as the substitute for the predators that [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7421.52s)]
*  we're taking out. And of course, that enabled us to preserve a lot of animals that people want to [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7429.28s)]
*  hunt, elk and deer and pronghorns and so forth, even though we've gotten pronghorns from 35 million [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7435.92s)]
*  down to 5,000 by this point. They're the most ancient of the North American animals, right? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7442.16s)]
*  Yeah, and they're distinctively North American too. It's so weird, such a strange animal. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7447.2s)]
*  Strange and beautiful. When you see them in comparison to everything else. Are they an [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7452.4s)]
*  actual antelope? What are they? Well, they're an antelope goat. Antelope capra de is the [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7456.24s)]
*  family name, which had to be created for them. And actually, it looks like maybe their closest [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7467.76s)]
*  relatives are giraffes. Whoa, they kind of look like giraffes. Yeah, they're their legs in particular. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7473.44s)]
*  Their eyes too. Yeah, and the great big eyes that are man on the sides of the head. Yeah, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7479.679999999999s)]
*  look at that guy. Yeah. What a cool animal that is. Yeah, and they, you know, one of the great [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7483.839999999999s)]
*  things about them too is that, okay, so they can run, the females in particular can run 60, 65 miles [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7488.16s)]
*  an hour, which puzzled biologists for a while because the only predators they have possibly [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7494.88s)]
*  are wolves and coyotes, neither of which can run over about 42 or 43 miles an hour. So the question [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7503.68s)]
*  for a while was, so why the speed overkill? Until we began to realize these guys developed their [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7510.0s)]
*  ability to run back during the Pleistocene when they were being pursued by American cheetahs. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7517.52s)]
*  And they still, the females still select for the fastest males to breed with in order to preserve [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7523.2s)]
*  this high speed. So the result is pronghorns only have predators when they're fawns. They don't have [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7534.4s)]
*  predators as adults because nothing that's alive now can catch them. At one time a cheetah could [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7542.96s)]
*  catch them, but nothing can catch them now. And since they are preyed on only as fawns, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7549.360000000001s)]
*  one of the adaptations that pronghorns have made to predation is they have two fawns. You have two [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7555.76s)]
*  fawns, a spare and an heir with the idea that the spare is likely to be taken out as a fawn, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7563.4400000000005s)]
*  but at least you're going to preserve your genetic line with... Is it mostly coyotes? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7571.84s)]
*  Primarily coyotes. Coyotes are able to find them. I mean, we don't have enough wolves out in the [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7577.52s)]
*  prairie country anymore to have any impact on pronghorns, but coyotes certainly look for the [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7582.64s)]
*  fawns. Yeah, there's some in California still, and they used to have a larger population up until, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7588.4800000000005s)]
*  I think, 20 or 30 years ago. And then the coyotes started taking them out with such regularity that [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7593.84s)]
*  they're reduced to just a very small number now. Yeah, there's another spot or two where coyotes [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7599.92s)]
*  have had an impact on them. But I mean, this adaptation of two fawns is evidently very old, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7606.4s)]
*  and obviously it's allowed them to survive. One of the more fascinating things that I learned [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7612.0s)]
*  from you also is the subject of bison and the enormous populations of bison that were witnessed [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7618.24s)]
*  at one point in history, and that it coincided with the European spread of diseases. Yeah, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7626.24s)]
*  and the spread of bison out of the Great Plains. Yeah, the bison story, and obviously I [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7632.8s)]
*  tell it in several places, sort of the advent of the bison story early in Well and the World, and [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7639.76s)]
*  then the sort of the day new maw in a later chapter. But the modern bison is actually a [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7644.96s)]
*  dwarfed animal compared to the bison of the Pleistocene that succeeded those earlier larger [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7657.84s)]
*  forms about 8,000 years ago and very likely became dwarfed because of anthropogenic selection, [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7666.4800000000005s)]
*  human hunting pressure, because only wolves and humans really are effective predators of bison. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7678.48s)]
*  And what you get by becoming smaller is a quicker emergence as fertile. So bison that are smaller [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7690.4s)]
*  can have calves at an earlier age. When the cows are two years old or three years old, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7704.88s)]
*  they can begin having calves. The gestation period is not as long for smaller animals, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7710.4800000000005s)]
*  and so you're able to, in other words, these are advantages for reproduction. And this new bison [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7716.8s)]
*  8,000 years ago essentially inherits the grazing niche on the American Great Plains that had [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7724.4800000000005s)]
*  formerly been occupied by all kinds of creatures that are now gone, including things like mammoths [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7731.92s)]
*  that are grazers just like modern African elephants are. And so as a result of inheriting [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7737.76s)]
*  a grazing niche now depopulated with no horses to compete with, with no mammoths to compete with, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7746.24s)]
*  they become this huge mass. I mean, this is why bison multiply into the millions on the Great [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7753.68s)]
*  Plains. And in fact, they probably become so numerous, like passenger pigeons, this is one [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7762.8s)]
*  of the arguments for why passenger pigeons survive so long. They're so numerous that they saturate [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7767.92s)]
*  the predator possibilities. Predators just can't take enough of them to ever actually reduce their [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7774.8s)]
*  numbers. And so what happens, I mean, native people hunt bison for, modern bison for 8,000 years, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7781.5199999999995s)]
*  that's the longest economic life way in North American history. But just about the time that [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7790.88s)]
*  Europeans are arriving and very likely contributed to by the arrival of Europeans in the disease [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7798.0s)]
*  epidemics that wipe out so many native people, bison populations began to expand out of the Great [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7806.48s)]
*  Plains, west of the Rocky Mountains. I mean, they get all the way to places like Oregon, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7812.5599999999995s)]
*  Arizona, and east of the Great Plains when they get to places like Georgia and Florida and Virginia [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7818.32s)]
*  and West Virginia and possibly even Western Pennsylvania. And the argument about this is [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7828.88s)]
*  when Europeans arrive and out of a hemispheric population, or I should rephrase that, out of [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7837.92s)]
*  North America and South America having a native population as high as maybe 56, 57 million people, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7848.0s)]
*  most of which indeed are from Mexico South into South America where agriculture has prevailed. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7856.0s)]
*  So many people like that taken out, which is more than 10% of the global population when the Great [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7862.8s)]
*  Dying happens, people who have been cutting down forests and building fires and using fires as [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7871.12s)]
*  their primary method of heating and cooking and everything else. When that ends, the recent idea [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7877.92s)]
*  advanced is that that enables a reduction of carbon in the atmosphere, formally put into the [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7885.599999999999s)]
*  atmosphere by all these burning fires of all these millions of people. And when that happens, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7896.48s)]
*  it produces an effect called the Little Ice Age. And the Little Ice Age, which lasts for about 300 [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7902.96s)]
*  years from about 1450, 1550 or so, somewhere in that range, around 1500 to 1800 or maybe 1830 or [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7909.44s)]
*  so, produces cooler, moister weather in the Northern Hemisphere and that grows more grass [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7920.08s)]
*  and that expands the bison population over a lot of North America. So when Europeans get here, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7927.599999999999s)]
*  you know, as a consequence of all these factors, nobody really understands. I mean, nobody knows [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7935.6s)]
*  anything about disease transmission. Nobody suspects that your breath can kill people. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7941.44s)]
*  I mean, there's an early European who I quote in the book who says, boy, we just experienced the [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7949.12s)]
*  strangest thing. We went ashore for a couple of weeks and when we came back on board our ship, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7955.28s)]
*  word came that every village, every Indian village that we went to, within two, three days of us [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7961.6s)]
*  being there, almost all the people in the village fell sick and they're dying. And it seems to have [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7968.320000000001s)]
*  happened only where we went. Nowhere else is reporting this, but I mean, so it happens like [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7975.76s)]
*  that. I mean, just almost instantaneously. They don't understand why it's happening. The European [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7983.280000000001s)]
*  idea is, well, God has, he's killing them to enable us to settle the place. And they certainly [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7988.88s)]
*  don't understand what's causing, you know, the little ice age. But what they're reaping the [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=7995.04s)]
*  benefit of is this explosion of animals that even brings Buffalo all the way almost to the East Coast. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8001.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, it's another one of these amazing stories that, I mean, we've only been figuring [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8009.04s)]
*  this kind of stuff out, you know, for the last 20 or 30 years. Some of it even more recently than [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8015.52s)]
*  that. It's got to be so rewarding as a person who studies that though, that this information is being [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8022.4800000000005s)]
*  discovered in new revelations and new understanding. Yeah, it's really fun, you know, I mean, I had a [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8028.0s)]
*  tremendous amount of fun doing this book, you know, I mean, I was, there were parts of it that [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8033.280000000001s)]
*  certainly surprised me, you know, I mean, I kind of knew this story. I mean, what I was trying to do [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8039.52s)]
*  was to tell in one book, this whole North American story of humans and people in under 400 pages. I [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8044.0s)]
*  mean, I managed to do it at 398 pages. So thick. Yeah, it's 398. So it's got a lot of information [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8052.4s)]
*  in it. But I mean, it is an audio version too. So can you do it? No, I didn't do it. The other press [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8059.28s)]
*  I was with, uh, WW Norton, uh, retained the rights to the audio book. I mean, with Coyote America, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8067.6s)]
*  my agency, my literary agency retained the rights and I got to select who read it for the audio [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8075.6s)]
*  book. But in this case, uh, Norton retained the rights and I had no say. You would be so good at [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8082.72s)]
*  it. Yeah, well, I've offered myself a couple of times. Nobody's ever taken me up on it. Why are [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8089.200000000001s)]
*  they so dumb about that kind of stuff? They did that with Ronella as well with his book, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8093.52s)]
*  the American Bison. I know. And Stephen would be a fantastic reader. Well, he did read it. He [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8097.84s)]
*  eventually gained the right to read it and it's amazing. Yeah. Well, maybe, maybe at some point I [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8102.080000000001s)]
*  can get the rights to do it, but I've offered myself more than once and, uh, I never had anybody [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8108.160000000001s)]
*  take me up on it. They have their stable of people. They want to use, you know, they're silly, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8114.080000000001s)]
*  like, especially a guy like you has been on this podcast a couple of times. You have such a great [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8119.120000000001s)]
*  voice and such a passion for this stuff. That's so, so tangible when you talk about it. Well, [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8123.44s)]
*  I'd love to be able to do it. Well, hopefully the guy did a great job. Um, one of the things that I'd [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8129.12s)]
*  be amiss if I didn't talk to you about is, uh, I want to get you together with Randall Carlson [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8133.919999999999s)]
*  because Randall Carlson is a big proponent of the younger dryest impact for being a leading factor [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8139.04s)]
*  in the extinction of North American animals. What do you think about that? Have you looked into it? [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8144.48s)]
*  Yeah, I have. And so, I mean, here's, here's my deal. You know, I mean, I'm a historian, [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8150.16s)]
*  um, as I said, an English major really, and kind of an environmental writer or writer about this [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8156.88s)]
*  stuff. So I'm not an archeologist or a paleontologist. I mean, my approach to doing [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8163.68s)]
*  this kind of stuff, doing archeology and paleontology is I go to the, what I consider to [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8168.64s)]
*  be the best people and other folks consider the best people out there, you know, Ross McPhee, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8173.92s)]
*  from the American Museum of Natural History, uh, Donald Grayson, uh, certainly Paul Martin, [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8179.52s)]
*  you know, who is the, he's kind of the Einstein of all this. And what I always look for the people [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8185.68s)]
*  who are publishing in the peer review journals, who are, uh, doing work that like Paul Martin's, [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8193.6s)]
*  uh, Paul Martin is like Einstein. I mean, his work has survived for decades because nobody has been [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8201.68s)]
*  able to shoot it down. I mean, he's that sort of bulletproof in his arguments. So I'm relying on [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8208.800000000001s)]
*  all of those guys, the people who are spending all their time, you know, using science-based research [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8216.0s)]
*  to study this. And what they, when I look at, uh, their work, Ross McPhee, for example, about the [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8222.24s)]
*  younger dryness, uh, period, which is, uh, for your listeners, that's a period at about 11,500, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8230.96s)]
*  12,000 years ago when there was a sudden really cold pulse in North America that, uh, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8238.24s)]
*  that amounted to essentially kind of a climate change. It didn't last a very long time, [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8246.4s)]
*  but it certainly was a change from what was happened, what had happened before and after. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8251.36s)]
*  And there is a, a corollary argument called the fireball hypothesis that came from an [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8256.8s)]
*  article that was in Science Magazine in about 2005 or six that argued that sort of in the tradition [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8267.039999999999s)]
*  of the Chicxulub asteroid, there may have been a comet or possibly an asteroid or a meteorite [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8273.76s)]
*  that struck, that set off the younger dryness period. And that also resulted in a kind of a [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8282.64s)]
*  scorched earth, at least in sort of the Northern climes in Alaska. I mean, I know you've had on the [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8291.92s)]
*  John Reeves guy, the bone yard Alaska guy. How amazing is his place? Yeah. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8297.84s)]
*  It's less than five acres, two acres. And then there's another, another site that's, [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8305.76s)]
*  have you been there? No, I have not, but I really desperately want to. John's a fascinating guy. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8310.32s)]
*  The fact that he has complete control over this is so interesting. Yeah. And I can tell you some [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8315.68s)]
*  more stuff off the air. Yeah. But he's just, I mean, you know, what's going on in the East [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8321.6s)]
*  river right now. Are you aware of this? I don't know. There's a bone rush in the East river. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8326.32s)]
*  Cause he talked about in the early 1900s, um, the museum in New York city had so much property from [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8330.48s)]
*  his or so many artifacts, so much, so many mammoth tusks and so many, uh, step bison jaw bones and [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8338.8s)]
*  things that they dumped them in the East river. And he hadn't heard this. He found the exact [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8345.519999999999s)]
*  location. He told people where it is and they've already started discovering things. They've [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8351.599999999999s)]
*  discovered a step bison jaw bone. And then they recently discovered a fragment of a mammoth tusk. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8356.64s)]
*  So there's these guys, um, dirty water, Dawn, and that's a piece of the mammoth tusk they found. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8362.24s)]
*  See if you could find also the bison skull. The bison skull was maybe even more compelling, [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8368.08s)]
*  but in the, in the area where this guy told them to look, they've started to find things. Um, [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8373.6s)]
*  he's got so much on his property. It's so incredible. I think it's a little further up Jamie. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8379.28s)]
*  These look, these look older. So these bison, a bison Priscus, huh? Yeah. Bison jawbone. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8384.48s)]
*  Is that it right there? That's it right there. Like right here. It's not, um, well, we can, [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8391.28s)]
*  you can find it if you just Google it. Um, bison jaw. What year were you looking at? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8396.8s)]
*  How far away is this? April? When was he here? So this is probably, okay. So these are pretty [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8402.24s)]
*  recent photos. This is, we're still in March. I think was when they discovered it, if I remember [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8406.16s)]
*  correctly. So this is the one you did with John, huh? Yes. This is a, and they look at that. They [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8412.32s)]
*  found cats and things and cave bears that they didn't think were native to that area. They didn't [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8418.0s)]
*  even think they were in that area. So they're making, they're making these significant [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8423.84s)]
*  discoveries in this piece of property that he has that, you know, really kind of changes [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8427.6s)]
*  that his, there it is right there, right below that. That's, that's the piece. That's the piece [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8432.960000000001s)]
*  where he's pulling it out of the water. Oh boy. Yeah. Isn't that amazing? And then right below [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8436.4s)]
*  that, you could see the actual piece itself. We could see it's 10 inches, really amazing stuff, [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8440.8s)]
*  a chunk of a jawbone of a step bison that they found in the East river. And there's a lot more [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8447.68s)]
*  out there apparently. And, but you know, you got to, you're dealing with almost a hundred years [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8453.76s)]
*  of it sitting there, but just the fact that they could still find some pieces is really encouraging. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8458.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a hundred years of silt, a moving river, who knows how much pollution and garbage. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8462.800000000001s)]
*  But they're, they're finding things, which is pretty damn cool. Well, it's exciting to do it. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8468.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, I found at one point when I was living on the Great Plains back in the 1980s, I found a, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8473.6s)]
*  a bison skull eroding out of a stream bank. And I have no idea how old it was, but it was of a [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8480.24s)]
*  calf. It was a fairly small skull, but the horn cores were there. And yeah, it was very exciting to [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8487.84s)]
*  find something like that. One of the things that John has found, one of the things that's very [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8495.36s)]
*  extraordinary is it seemed like these animals all died together and there's a very distinct [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8498.800000000001s)]
*  layer of scorched earth that coincides with that. I remember seeing that. Yeah, I remember seeing [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8504.64s)]
*  that. And the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, what's fascinating about it, it's not one event. It's [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8509.12s)]
*  multiple events that take place over thousands of years. And there's a lot of physical evidence of [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8514.0s)]
*  it. Iridium in particular, which is common in space and rare on earth, and also nanodiamonds, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8518.72s)]
*  these, these impact diamonds, these micro diamonds that get created upon impact of these, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8523.92s)]
*  these, whether it's comets or asteroids, whatever it is, they think that there was [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8528.8s)]
*  multiple ones of these. This also coincides with the time period in which, you know, if you, we [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8533.2s)]
*  apparently pass through this every, I think it's every June and every November, is that correct? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8539.44s)]
*  This asteroid, this shower that we see, this meteor shower. And that also coincides with the [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8544.560000000001s)]
*  Tunguska Explosion, which they believe is an asteroid that blew up right above the surface of [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8552.240000000002s)]
*  the Siberian forest and to this day is like flattened, like this enormous area. The photographs [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8560.16s)]
*  are extraordinary of the post-impact discovery of the site. And, you know, for a long time, [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8566.4s)]
*  they're trying to figure out when, but this coincides exactly when earth passes through this, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8571.84s)]
*  this meteor shower, which is really, really interesting stuff. And I think the two of you [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8578.0s)]
*  together might be able to, like, if you have a conversation, it would be very fascinating. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8583.2s)]
*  He's incredibly impressive, this guy. And I know he's heterodox in his sort of ideas and, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8587.2s)]
*  but brilliantly researched. I mean, and has had debates with scientists over this, even on my [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8593.28s)]
*  podcast, they were talking about this evidence and they put it together with Graham Hancock's work. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8598.560000000001s)]
*  And Graham Hancock, who has ancient apocalypse, right? Angel apocalypse on Netflix, which is [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8605.28s)]
*  basically all about that. It's all about the evidence of the sophisticated cultures [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8613.039999999999s)]
*  that existed 11,000, 12,000 years ago that we really didn't know were around until they [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8617.84s)]
*  started discovering Gobekli Tepe and all these things that they can carbon date to that time [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8623.52s)]
*  period where we thought at one point in time, they were just hunters and gatherers. Now we know [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8627.52s)]
*  they were, they were capable of very sophisticated stonework in Turkey. And there's only to this day, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8631.84s)]
*  I think less than 10% of them has been uncovered. They use LIDAR and they found more of them. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8637.039999999999s)]
*  The surrounding hills, but he believes that this coincides with these meteor impacts and that there [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8642.24s)]
*  was probably a huge disruption of human civilization and a restart of it. And it coincides with the end [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8650.8s)]
*  of the ice age. And there's some really fascinating erosion data and data of massive amounts of water [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8657.199999999999s)]
*  that happened very quickly. And he believes what happened was something hit the actual ice cap [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8663.76s)]
*  that was over North America. This guy's very well researched in this. It's a really fascinating [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8668.64s)]
*  conversation, I think, with the two of you together. And I would love to have it if you're [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8674.32s)]
*  interested in that. Yeah, I mean, I'm certainly intrigued by it. And I always like to see people [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8677.279999999999s)]
*  whenever they have some, you know, some dramatic new argument or claim for something that has other [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8683.279999999999s)]
*  explanations, come up with something like a scientific article that you submit to a peer [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8691.039999999999s)]
*  review journal. Yeah, see what, you know, what the Ross McPhee's of the world think of it. I would [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8696.96s)]
*  like to see that too. But I do think that people do preserve their initial notions, especially if [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8702.08s)]
*  they've been teaching that and writing books on that. And they've proclaimed that to be the exact [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8706.72s)]
*  history of how things went down. I would like just to see you have a conversation with this guy, [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8712.32s)]
*  because like, again, he's very impressive. His ability to describe these things and his recall [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8717.759999999998s)]
*  of the information is second to none. Well, what I would say to the younger dry us so far, and [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8724.32s)]
*  certainly the Fireball article, you know, published back in 2005 or six, had some currency for quite a [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8731.92s)]
*  number of years. I obviously when I was working on these initial chapters, or particularly on that [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8737.92s)]
*  Clovisia, the beautiful chapter for a while new world, I mean, I looked at what scientific [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8744.32s)]
*  literature I could find in the journals, and they weren't really citing it anymore. And I think the [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8749.84s)]
*  reason was basically this, the argument goes as a kind of a test for something that could cause a [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8756.4s)]
*  major extinction is, okay, so the younger dry has produced a cold pulse, to be sure. But it's going [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8764.960000000001s)]
*  to be difficult to argue that these animals are going to expire in a cold pulse when they survive [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8773.2s)]
*  the glacial maximum. That's not his argument. His argument is massive devastation. His argument is [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8779.04s)]
*  instant flooding, the creation of the Great Lakes almost instantaneously. It's a wild argument. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8785.44s)]
*  Well, the wild conversation. So here are the other two arguments then. The other two arguments are, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8790.880000000001s)]
*  if you have an extinction, like the five that we've had before, I mean, I argue that, you know, [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8796.400000000001s)]
*  we're all talking about the sixth extinction when we're in. My argument, sort of following an [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8803.36s)]
*  article that was published in the National Academy of Sciences in 2018, is that the sixth extinction [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8808.960000000001s)]
*  that we think of today has actually, unlike all the previous five, the fifth one being Chicxulub, [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8816.16s)]
*  the sixth one has actually been happening in slow motion for 30,000 years. It's not just started. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8822.720000000001s)]
*  It's happening, as the people in the National Academy of Sciences piece put it, [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8830.64s)]
*  when humans spread out of Africa, took out more than 300 mammal species as they spread across the [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8835.2s)]
*  earth over the subsequent several thousand years, and cost us in what they called in this 2018 [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8842.08s)]
*  article, almost a worst case scenario, cost us like two and a half billion years of specially [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8850.8s)]
*  evolved genetics. So the reason I have been following that argument, and that's kind of the [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8857.76s)]
*  one I do, is that when the younger, driest thing comes up, what people point out is that [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8864.72s)]
*  in all the extinctions before the Pleistocene one, those extinctions took out everything. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8871.44s)]
*  They took out life in the oceans. They took out small creatures. They took out amphibians, reptiles, [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8878.880000000001s)]
*  birds, but the Pleistocene seems to just be mammals, and often just big mammals. And so there's this [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8884.96s)]
*  sort of logical attempt to try to come up with what would explain an extinction scenario that [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8895.359999999999s)]
*  doesn't take out things in the ocean, that doesn't take out little creatures, but just focuses on big [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8902.88s)]
*  mammals, which is why sort of the consensus is going towards this human spread. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8909.84s)]
*  Dan, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I think you probably have both things working in [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8916.08s)]
*  conjunction, and I think the good explanation for why it only kills things that are on earth and not [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8920.56s)]
*  in the ocean is that it impacts the ice shell, impacts these ice sheets, and causes this almost [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8925.12s)]
*  instantaneous melting of the ice caps in a catastrophic way, and not everything is affected [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8932.24s)]
*  by it, only the things that get impacted by the water and get impacted by this melting of the caps. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8938.8s)]
*  I don't know enough about it to have this conversation with you, but I'm blown away by [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8945.119999999999s)]
*  this guy, Randall Carlson, and his descriptions of it and his understanding of it. I just think it [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8949.359999999999s)]
*  would be an amazing thing to get together with you. There's no doubt human beings had a massive [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8954.32s)]
*  effect on it, and I think that all these things that you're pointing out are really fascinating, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8959.599999999999s)]
*  and pretty tragic too that human beings did. I mean, the one thing that's interesting is [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8963.6s)]
*  the gestation period of these mammoths, right? Like they had to carry their, because they were so big, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8969.36s)]
*  you alluded to this when you were talking about the bison. So if you wiped out a clan of them, [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8973.6s)]
*  you're making a significant impact. It's not like rabbits or like coyotes. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8979.12s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. Biologists call those case species, which have these really long [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8984.4s)]
*  gestation periods. So they would make them more vulnerable to human predation. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8989.84s)]
*  Yeah. And they also were ignorant to us until we came here. They evolved for who knows how many [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=8994.480000000001s)]
*  years before we got here. Yeah. Well, one of the things I have always loved about you and your [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9000.16s)]
*  podcast is your wonderful openness to people, everybody. I mean, I think it's one of the [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9006.720000000001s)]
*  explanations for why the Joe Rogan experience is such a global hit, man. I mean, you come across as [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9015.6s)]
*  telling me your shit, and I bet I'm going to love it. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9025.6s)]
*  Well, with your case, it's easy. Your shit is amazing. And one of the big successes is the [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9030.56s)]
*  fact that people like you are willing to come on. So I really appreciate that. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9036.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, hell, man. I love it. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9039.68s)]
*  It was really entertaining. I can't wait to listen to this one again. It was so good. There's so much [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9040.48s)]
*  information and I can't wait. Even though somebody else is reading this book, I'll get it on audio [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9044.56s)]
*  anyway, but it's a wild new world, the epic story of animals and people in America. Dan Flores, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9048.8s)]
*  and I can't recommend enough his other book, Coyote America that I've read. And then there's the [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9054.24s)]
*  Serengeti. Dan, you're the man. I appreciate you very much. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9059.279999999999s)]
*  Let's do this again. We'll do it with Randall. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9062.64s)]
*  Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Bye, everybody. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9064.24s)]
*  Bye. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGH6cHufJbo&t=9074.56s)]
