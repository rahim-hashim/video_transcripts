*  Yeah, I try. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I try. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  I try. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  I try. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I try, man. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  I really do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  You never know. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  A lot of, I don't know, I guess you always have doubts. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=32.8s)]
*  That comes with, at least I do, constantly like, is this good enough or is it country [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=36.4s)]
*  enough or is it, I don't know, it's just always. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=44.2s)]
*  I'd be lying if I said I didn't have. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=46.72s)]
*  I think that's what makes you great. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=49.3s)]
*  I think you have to have those doubts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=51.04s)]
*  I think every artist is always self-analyzing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=53.84s)]
*  Always. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=56.4s)]
*  You have to be. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=58.46s)]
*  You have to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=59.46s)]
*  I mean, or else you're just, you know, my biggest fear is like making the same record [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=60.46s)]
*  a hundred times, you know? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=64.34s)]
*  Yeah, because we all know people who've done that before. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=65.94s)]
*  And when you're a fan of someone and they do that, that's one of the things I love about [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=68.86s)]
*  Sturgill is like every album, it's like he's a new artist. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=73.62s)]
*  It's like, who are you? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=77.78s)]
*  Yeah, everything's way different with him, man. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=79.34s)]
*  I remember Turtles all the way down coming out and I was like, man, this is just such [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=81.7s)]
*  a departure from the last thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=86.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=88.36s)]
*  And that can be scary as an artist, too, because you're like, well, all my fans that I have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=89.36s)]
*  were the fan of this previous thing, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=95.24s)]
*  So it's the new thing, alienate those people. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  It's just tough, man. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=102.4s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=103.4s)]
*  I think people have to do that, though, if you, you know, that's what you feel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=104.4s)]
*  I think they go along with you, especially today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  I think people are more willing than ever to let people take chances. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=111.96s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  And I mean, I think that comes with the artist now has the power in a lot of ways, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  With the rise of the Internet. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=121.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=122.56s)]
*  I think I was really kind of one of the first people who was able to bring something to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=123.56s)]
*  like when I got my first deal, it was like, well, I already had a built in fan base. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=130.72s)]
*  And that wasn't really ever happening at that time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=135.72s)]
*  Like as I was on this social media app called Vine, do you remember that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=138.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=142.44s)]
*  I mean, I wasn't like, you know, mega big on there or anything, but I had enough fans, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=143.62s)]
*  I guess, where I was selling music that and I didn't realize that that was weird. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=149.26s)]
*  So I got to Nashville and they're like, wait, you're selling how much? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=152.5s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I thought that was that's low, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=155.94s)]
*  And they're like, not really. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=158.18s)]
*  It's not really that low at all. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=160.14s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's cool. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=161.46s)]
*  You know, so then you got some negotiating power to when you were one of the first artists [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=162.78s)]
*  that in the country scene that kind of made it off of social media. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=167.74s)]
*  I would. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=171.62s)]
*  I would say me and came around, probably were like the first two and he we both got signed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  at Sony. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=178.84s)]
*  And I think that's to credit to, you know, I mean, Randy Goodman, who still runs Sony [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=179.84s)]
*  Nashville, has always been forward thinking in that, like at least before, in my opinion, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=184.12s)]
*  all the other labels in Nashville were thinking about that stuff. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=189.72s)]
*  He was always thinking about what's the next thing or like, how do we stay ahead of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=193.0s)]
*  trend or whatever? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=198.12s)]
*  And other other labels weren't doing that at that time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=199.12s)]
*  And when you first started doing it on Vine, we just doing it because it was just a thing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  that you could put your shit on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=206.94s)]
*  I mean, you obviously didn't think that it would take off the way it did. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=208.1s)]
*  It just made sense, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=211.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=212.54s)]
*  It was like, it was like, OK, well, this is a tool. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=213.54s)]
*  And all I was doing on there was I mean, the content on that app was six seconds long. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  It was like it was like TikTok, but six seconds. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  And so it was like you would have to pick out what's the most impactful section of a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  George Strait song or of a Waylon Jennings song or anything I can sing or of something [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=229.62s)]
*  that's on the radio, a Lee Brice song or whatever it was. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=234.36s)]
*  You know, what's the singingist as part of the song? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=236.84s)]
*  And I would get on there and just sing that six seconds of on my guitar and then put it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=241.12s)]
*  on there and people were sharing and sharing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=246.52s)]
*  And then when I put my own music out, I'm like, well, obviously, I'm going to market [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=249.0s)]
*  to these people that are already like my voice and stuff. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=253.52s)]
*  And it just worked out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=257.04s)]
*  It was never a master plan. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=258.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=260.46s)]
*  You know, I wasn't like I would love to say, man, I had this big scheme and I had it all [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=261.46s)]
*  planned out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=266.38s)]
*  It just like it was this these like logical steps that just made sense to me. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=267.38s)]
*  I think it's kind of better that it's not a master plan that just just followed your [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=271.98s)]
*  instincts. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=276.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was I always tell I mean, there is so much luck involved. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=277.3s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=281.62s)]
*  I mean, anybody that has success, obviously, you have to be able to sing and you have to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=282.62s)]
*  have songs that people like. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=287.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  Those things are, you know, that's a given. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  But there's a lot of people that I know in town that I would argue are a lot more talented [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=293.0s)]
*  than me. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  Singers, songwriters that went for the artist thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  And it was just it wasn't the right time or their music didn't connect at that time with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  whatever the mainstream kind of fan base was. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=307.4s)]
*  Yeah. And now they're just they'll just they're songwriters instead because now they're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=310.52s)]
*  they might be 40 something, you know, and they're like, well, I don't want to I'm not going [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=315.38s)]
*  to get a deal and go on a radio tour. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=319.1s)]
*  I got three kids, you know, make, you know, half a million dollars a year writing songs. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=321.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=324.74s)]
*  Yeah, but that would suck. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=326.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  Listen to somebody else belting out your hits. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but there's also a contingency of guys that like like I have some friends that went [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=332.66s)]
*  the route like they had the deal. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  They had the songs. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=339.94s)]
*  It wasn't the right time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  But then the artist thing just wasn't for them either. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  Like going around and doing PR stuff like that gave them anxiety. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Having fans that gave them anxiety. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=351.12s)]
*  And that's like I think there's people that lean more into they would rather just do the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=354.44000000000005s)]
*  creative stuff and and hope. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=358.48s)]
*  OK, I hope I can write I hope you dance for Lee Ann Womack instead of being Lee Ann Womack [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  and sing and I hope you dance. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, that I get. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=369.58s)]

*  But it is like the sickest drive, like 20 minutes out of Calgary. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=580.74s)]
*  It turns into like the most Rocky Mountain thing you've ever seen. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=585.46s)]
*  And it's I mean, it's out of control, man. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=590.5400000000001s)]

*  1889. How did they even get there? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=630.44s)]
*  Like we're talking pre automobile. Yeah. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=632.66s)]
*  Well, so I grew up in Asheville and I always think about the Biltmore House. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=635.16s)]
*  Have you ever been to the Biltmore House? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=639.4s)]
*  Asheville. I've never. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=640.62s)]
*  No, I've seen the bill of the Biltmore House. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=642.36s)]
*  This place is staggering, dude. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=644.16s)]
*  I mean, it is like you can't even. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=646.12s)]
*  So if you sit on to kind of sits on this hill, right. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=648.74s)]
*  So the Vanderbilts built it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=651.5s)]
*  So it was the largest. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=654.88s)]
*  Yeah. Large in Asheville. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=656.54s)]
*  Mm hmm. Holy shit. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=658.08s)]
*  So if you stand on top of that building, they owned everything [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=659.46s)]
*  you can see from the top of that building, which is like hundreds [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=663.68s)]
*  and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres. Wow. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=667.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is unbelievable. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=671.02s)]
*  It was the largest residents, private residents in the United States [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=672.44s)]
*  for a long, long, long, long time. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=675.02s)]
*  They have the chess set in there that Napoleon's heart was put on after he died. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=677.8s)]
*  Just crazy. They cut his heart off and put it on. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=682.9399999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. They put it on a chess set. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=685.48s)]
*  But that's the kind of stuff they have in that house. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=687.68s)]
*  Is there still a bloodstain? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=691.02s)]
*  I don't know. I can't attest to that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=692.6s)]
*  I can't but I used to go. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=695.06s)]
*  I mean, I've been that place four or five times. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=696.52s)]
*  I mean, and it's just staggering. Do you stay there? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=698.68s)]
*  Can you stay there? You can't stay there. It's tours. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=700.98s)]

*  You don't stay in there. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=706.48s)]
*  They had a swimming pool, bowling alleys. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=707.74s)]
*  I mean, it was like decked out the biggest mansion you've ever seen, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=710.98s)]
*  but it was built in. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=713.7s)]
*  I can't attest to the date that that one was built in. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=715.1600000000001s)]
*  But eighteen hundreds, no doubt. Wow. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=717.4000000000001s)]
*  I wonder why they built such a big place in Asheville. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  Why would you know? I don't know. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=722.0s)]
*  So they have they built a whole town around it. Right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  It's called Biltmore Village. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=727.34s)]
*  And I actually sang in a choir at the All Souls Cathedral there in high school, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=729.9599999999999s)]
*  which was built by the Vanderbilt's as well. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=734.0s)]
*  And so it's like super old Episcopalian Church. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=736.3s)]

*  Staggering. Again, pre automobile. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=753.36s)]
*  These people are riding horses to this house. Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=755.48s)]
*  Dude, they imported and someone's definitely going to fact check me on this, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  but I believe they imported everything from overseas on this whole place. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=762.5400000000001s)]
*  The marble, the stone. Wow. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=766.46s)]
*  Look at the ceiling in that place. Yeah, that's incredible. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  Wow. 250 rooms, dude, in that place. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=774.84s)]
*  Jesus Christ. What a fucking place. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=778.84s)]
*  Some people just have too much money. That's too much money. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=782.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you should. You should. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=784.98s)]
*  If you're ever in Asheville, you got to go toward that place, man. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=786.32s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=788.82s)]
*  My buddy Duncan grew up in Asheville and he lived there before he moved back here [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=789.7800000000001s)]
*  to Austin. But he he grew up there and they used to [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=793.24s)]
*  give the cows like a special anti-fungal feed [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=798.5400000000001s)]
*  because they were growing mushrooms so much that all these kids are going out [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=802.5s)]
*  to the fields. Sounds very Asheville. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=806.58s)]
*  And it's funny growing up in Asheville, like I heard about that. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=808.74s)]
*  Like I heard it would be like, oh, if you go under the cow paddies, man, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=812.1400000000001s)]
*  there's mushrooms under there. Yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=815.34s)]
*  And I always thought it was like, man, that's a total lie. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=817.2s)]
*  But it's not. No, apparently those spores are just in the hills. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=819.7s)]
*  He said, like on any given day, you go out there and there's mushrooms everywhere. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=824.5400000000001s)]
*  That's wild. Yeah, there were so many that, again, they were giving these cows [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=829.22s)]
*  some sort of feed to discourage the mushroom from growing in their shit. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=832.72s)]
*  I believe it. That sounds seems like a crime against humanity. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=836.4200000000001s)]
*  Why the fuck would you do that? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=840.12s)]
*  Well, it's like why mess with it, right? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=842.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Just let the kids pick them. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=843.78s)]
*  Yeah. Let them do what they're dying from mushrooms. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=846.52s)]
*  Let them do what they're going to do. Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=849.36s)]
*  I'm in agreeance with that. Also, it's awesome. Yes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=850.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's Asheville is a special place. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=856.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a very interesting place. It is. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=859.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I moved there. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=861.24s)]
*  Me and my parents moved there when I was eight from Charlotte. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=862.4s)]
*  I was born in Charlotte and moved there and we lived there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=864.98s)]
*  I mean, I went to Appalachian State University, which is out and a half away [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=868.58s)]
*  from Asheville. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=872.3399999999999s)]
*  My parents actually just moved two months ago to Nashville [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=873.48s)]
*  because we had you know, I just had my first son. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=877.6999999999999s)]
*  And so they wanted to be close to the grandkid. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=879.98s)]
*  And it was wild as like they didn't want to. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=883.18s)]
*  They wanted to move, but they were really torn because they they've loved that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=885.92s)]
*  We've been they've been in that same house since I was eight, you know. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  And so it's tough. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=892.26s)]
*  I mean, we still have the house at the moment and stuff. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=893.3199999999999s)]
*  Trying to figure out like if we want to keep it or, you know, sell it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=896.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's a it's tough, you know. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=900.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard when you have roots in a place. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=902.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. My dad, you know, my dad's sixty nine and his two best friends live in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=905.04s)]
*  in Asheville and, you know, they drink beer every Friday and for twenty five years. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=910.24s)]
*  You know, and it's like he moved to Nashville. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=917.42s)]
*  It's like he doesn't know anybody. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=920.28s)]
*  And it's like so I think he struggles with that a lot, which I, you know, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=922.06s)]
*  it's tough for me, too, because I don't want him to like not be living [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=926.0s)]
*  his best life either. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=930.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like I love that he's close to, you know, my son [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=931.8199999999999s)]
*  and my son's close to his grandparents, but I also want them to like enjoy their [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=935.16s)]

*  Tell his friends to move. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=941.56s)]
*  I know. Right. You got to do. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=943.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Get them to move to Nashville. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=944.4s)]
*  All right. All right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=946.54s)]
*  Yeah. You just got to talk everybody into moving. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  Get that mass exodus going. Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=950.0999999999999s)]
*  It's a dude. Nashville's like it's it's a hot, hot market. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=952.3s)]
*  It is. It's well, it's like in Austin. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=955.9799999999999s)]
*  It's like Austin in a lot of ways where the pandemic opened it up. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=958.3399999999999s)]
*  A lot of people are like, I'm getting the fuck out of wherever I am. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  It sucks. And I'm going to go somewhere that's a little freer. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  And yeah, that's a little less stringent. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=967.62s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Nashville is a good place, man. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=970.26s)]
*  But it is. It's a great place. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=972.56s)]
*  It's changed a lot. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=974.06s)]
*  Even since I've been there, I don't want to act like I've been there, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=975.8s)]
*  you know, 30 years, you know, because I'm probably considered a new [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=977.8599999999999s)]
*  Nashvilleian myself. How long? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=981.24s)]
*  So maybe there in 2014. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=984.0s)]
*  So nine years. So not that long. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=985.4s)]
*  Yeah. I think you need like 10 years. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=987.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. 10 years. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=988.5999999999999s)]
*  Before you can be like, yeah, it's changed. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=990.52s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=992.56s)]
*  We ran into this guy the other day that was talking about Austin. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=994.26s)]
*  He's like, man, Austin's just not the same. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=997.4s)]
*  And Tony goes, how long you been here? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=999.84s)]
*  And the guy goes, five years. He goes, shut the fuck up. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1001.9s)]
*  He goes, bitch, you just got here. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1006.48s)]
*  I'm that guy. I'm that Nashville guy. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1008.54s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, it used to just be so, so different. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1010.68s)]
*  People love to say things like that, though. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1013.32s)]
*  They do. It makes them feel like I feel like it's almost like [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1015.58s)]
*  if you're saying that you're taking ownership, that that's your home. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1018.62s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  Like whether you've been there five years or 50 years. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1023.12s)]
*  When you say things like that, it really shows that you feel some sort of [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1026.42s)]
*  ownership to that place. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1029.96s)]
*  And that's the place that you want to be or you feel like is home. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1031.3s)]
*  So maybe it's a good thing. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1034.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pride thing. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1036.44s)]
*  It's it's better than like shitting on it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1037.74s)]
*  Yeah. It's like you just want it to stay good. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1040.44s)]
*  But, you know, things change and evolve. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1043.54s)]
*  And it's not that it's not as good. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1045.62s)]
*  It's just different. Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1048.3s)]
*  I mean, I can imagine, you know, some of the some of the guys that, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1050.02s)]
*  you know, I love listening to that, you know, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1053.6999999999998s)]
*  we're in Nashville in the 60s and 70s. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1056.7399999999998s)]
*  Like, what would they think of it now? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1059.1599999999999s)]
*  Is the scene in Nashville, the music scene, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1061.34s)]
*  is it Hollywoodized in any way or is it still gritty? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, what is it? What's like? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1068.9799999999998s)]
*  There's like two sects of it, right? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1071.2399999999998s)]
*  Like there's there is still a very gritty scene [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1073.52s)]
*  and there always has been. Right. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1078.58s)]
*  So you've got, you know, you've got like Black Keys type kind of thing, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1079.92s)]
*  you know, going on in East Nashville. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1085.02s)]
*  Like, there's so many bands that have come out of East [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  Nashville that are not part of kind of the mainstream Nashville thing. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1090.52s)]
*  And that community still really exists. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1094.56s)]
*  And a lot of I think artists, country artists that people love [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1096.84s)]
*  that would kind of even two or three years ago have been considered like [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1101.08s)]
*  Americana, like that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1106.78s)]
*  I'm not even sure what that means. Right. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1108.9199999999998s)]
*  Like to me, that's just like country music that, you know, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1111.36s)]
*  there's all these people on the Internet that are like, well, it ain't, you know, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1114.6799999999998s)]
*  Luke Combs, he ain't a real country singer. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1117.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? Because he's not you know what I mean? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1120.1s)]
*  Because he's not Sturgill Simpson or whatever it is. Right. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1122.5s)]
*  Like there's always these people who are trying to discredit you. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1125.1s)]
*  But there's these definitely these two different sects of like [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1128.52s)]
*  mainstream and non mainstream that exist in Nashville. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1131.8s)]
*  And there's people that are trying to chase kind of those those things separately. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1135.6s)]
*  And sometimes when popularity on the not chasing that goes through the roof, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1141.94s)]
*  then it kind of can transition into the major labels like, well, maybe, you know, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1147.42s)]
*  we should sniff around this guy, you know. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1151.62s)]
*  And I was always I didn't move to Nashville to like be necessarily [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1154.42s)]
*  be like, I'm going to be a country artist. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1159.62s)]
*  I just wanted to do music for a living in any way. Right. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1162.32s)]
*  Like I worked, you know, a bunch of jobs in high school and college and. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1165.26s)]
*  And, you know, I went to college for five years, didn't graduate, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1170.8s)]
*  which I'm sure my parents loved. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1173.54s)]
*  You know, I was 21 hours away from getting my degree. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1175.2s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to do music, you know, and it was whatever that was. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1178.24s)]
*  Sweeping floors in a studio would have been great to me [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1182.48s)]
*  because I would be around music. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1187.28s)]
*  I'd be trying to write music, publishing. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1188.82s)]
*  I mean, realistically, I thought to myself, especially at the time [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1191.78s)]
*  I moved to town, is like, dude, everybody that was doing music [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1194.72s)]
*  when I moved to town was hot, dude. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1198.42s)]
*  Six, five abs, dude. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1201.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't have a chance, bro. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1204.2s)]
*  You know, I didn't have a chance. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1207.46s)]
*  And so I'm going, well, cool. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1209.7s)]
*  I'll just write songs for these handsome cats and whatever. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1211.06s)]
*  That'd be fine with me, you know? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1214.46s)]
*  But I just I really like again, back to the luck thing, man. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1216.76s)]
*  Like I stumbled into it at the right time. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1220.12s)]
*  I think Chris Stapleton singing Tennessee Whiskey with Justin Timberlake [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1222.3s)]
*  at the CMAs was a earth shattering moment for country music. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1225.44s)]
*  And that opened the door up for guys like myself [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1230.6799999999998s)]
*  to pursue a career like somebody who didn't look like every other guy in town. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1233.8s)]
*  And everyone knew about Chris Stapleton in town. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1239.18s)]
*  That guy was a legend in town. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1241.34s)]
*  Had been there for 12, 13, 14 something years at that time. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  He had 250 cuts as a songwriter when that performance happened. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1248.58s)]
*  Wow. So it was it was just no one gave him a chance [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1252.76s)]
*  because he was a husky guy with a beard. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1255.52s)]
*  Yeah. And God damn that voice. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1257.82s)]
*  Oh, man, he's unbelievable. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1259.8s)]
*  That national anthem at the Super Bowl, dude, was amazing. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1261.06s)]
*  How does that say it's that and Whitney Houston, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1264.4s)]
*  two best national anthems ever, in my opinion, at the Super Bowl ever. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1267.0600000000002s)]
*  He's got some fucking bangers. That guy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1270.76s)]
*  I was sitting in a box with Adele at the Super Bowl [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1272.8600000000001s)]
*  and he sang that thing and she was watching and like [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1277.74s)]
*  like two lines and she just goes, holy shit. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1281.94s)]
*  You like she's just was losing her mind. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1286.44s)]
*  It was that. Can you find that? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1289.3400000000001s)]
*  It was unbelievable. Listen to it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1291.38s)]
*  I mean, I mean, he's unbelievable. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1292.88s)]
*  He's a good dude, too. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1294.64s)]
*  I had him on a couple of years back. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1295.76s)]
*  It's fun to hang with. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1297.56s)]
*  He's a very, very genuine person. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1299.32s)]
*  It's quiet. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1301.3s)]
*  It's always nice when you meet someone that you really admire [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1303.86s)]
*  and they're just cool as fuck. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1307.06s)]
*  Oh, is this it? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1308.7s)]
*  To honor America with the performance of the national anthem. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1310.04s)]
*  Eight time Grammy Award winner. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1314.7s)]
*  Dude, Chris Staple. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1317.02s)]
*  When Nick Sirianni cries in this thing, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1318.68s)]
*  I felt like a bald eagle was going to fly over the stadium. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1321.8s)]
*  It was the most American thing I've ever seen in my entire life. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1325.98s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1330.74s)]
*  He's unreal. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1381.74s)]
*  Wow. That got me, dude. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1399.48s)]
*  And withight. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1411.32s)]
*  God dang. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1441.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1448.32s)]
*  That was electric, dude. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1449.32s)]
*  I can't even explain to you what being there in person was like for that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1457.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1461.56s)]
*  It was unbelievable, man. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1462.56s)]
*  But I remember when Sirianni came on, on the big jumbo screen in there with the tears coming [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1463.56s)]
*  down. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  This is like, this will never be a moment like this again. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1470.1200000000001s)]
*  Like I'll never be present for a moment like that again. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  And like felt the gravity of it in the moment too. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  It wasn't just like when you saw it on TV, it was cool. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1480.4s)]
*  You know, it was like they were showing that same feed in the stadium and it was that like [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1483.5600000000002s)]
*  even more impact. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  I'd never been to the Super Bowl before. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1488.8400000000001s)]
*  So it was like, I was already soaking it in, you know. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1490.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1493.48s)]
*  There's already something about a big event like that, but to have him sing it like that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1494.48s)]
*  Man. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1498.8s)]
*  Yeah, it was unreal, man. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1499.8s)]
*  It really was. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1502.4399999999998s)]
*  That guy's an incredible, generational talent. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1507.12s)]
*  I mean, just no doubt about it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1508.12s)]
*  No, he's incredible. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1509.12s)]
*  That's pretty fucking badass. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1510.9199999999998s)]
*  When did you first think that you wanted to do music? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it honestly wasn't until I was, so I'm 33. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1517.1999999999998s)]
*  It was when I was 22 probably. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1522.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1524.4399999999998s)]
*  It was when I was really like, I could do this. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1525.4399999999998s)]
*  Did you enjoy it before? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  You just, I guess, a hobby? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1529.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1531.6399999999999s)]
*  It was beyond a hobby for me, but I didn't even realize that. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, so in sixth grade, right? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1536.52s)]
*  So I'll paint to kind of how these things happen is like in sixth grade, the first year [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1539.52s)]
*  of middle school, right? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1545.72s)]
*  What they did in my middle school was it was like these six week grading periods. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1547.48s)]
*  And so in the first year of middle school, they made you take every elective. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1552.44s)]
*  So you would take gym class for six weeks and chorus for six weeks and band for six [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1556.86s)]
*  weeks. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1562.8999999999999s)]
*  Actually, I think you got to choose chorus or band, but you had to do one music and then [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1563.8999999999999s)]
*  you took art and you took home ec. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1567.4599999999998s)]
*  And so during that sixth grade year, you try out every elective they have in the school. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1569.6599999999999s)]
*  And then seventh grade, you pick what elective you want to take for like, so you get one [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1574.9199999999998s)]
*  elective per semester. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1581.36s)]
*  So you could have two electives in your seventh grade year. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1583.4199999999998s)]
*  So there was an option for chorus that was a one semester of chorus, or you could try [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1586.46s)]
*  out for like the advanced course, which would be both semesters. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1591.48s)]
*  So I liked chorus a lot. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1595.98s)]
*  And so I was like, well, I'll do I'll do the one semester chorus and then I'll do gym or [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1598.42s)]
*  whatever, you know, because like I like it, but I don't want to take it that serious. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1602.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1606.02s)]
*  So I do my first semester in chorus and my teacher, Miss Rayburn, she comes up to me [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1607.02s)]
*  like last week of school and she's like, will you please change your elective and be an [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1613.08s)]
*  advanced chorus with me? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1618.68s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I mean, if you really want me to, like I liked it a lot. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1620.44s)]
*  And I was like, man, I wish I could do that in gym or whatever, you know. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1624.48s)]
*  And so I did. I switched it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1628.48s)]
*  And so from seventh grade until I graduated high school, I was in chorus class every day [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  of school for six years, you know. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1637.12s)]
*  And then I got to high school, I get to high school. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1642.26s)]
*  My course teacher, Miss Bryant, was like, I mean, she was like my mom at school. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1645.4599999999998s)]
*  She was like my school mom. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1649.62s)]
*  Me and her became super tight. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1651.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I was her teacher assistant my senior year. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1652.82s)]
*  I was in her class. A fourth of my entire high school career was spent in her classroom. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1654.9399999999998s)]
*  And I was in every musical every year. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1659.74s)]
*  So after school for half the year, I was doing the musical. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1661.82s)]
*  And I just I just liked it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1666.6999999999998s)]
*  And I didn't realize I was even any good until like ninth grade when Miss Bryant was like, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1668.2s)]
*  hey, you're like you're like good. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1672.3600000000001s)]
*  You're really good. And I was like, oh, cool. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1675.6000000000001s)]
*  That's nice. You know, because I like doing this. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1678.24s)]
*  That's fun. And I remember I was transitioning to go to college and she said, I asked her, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1680.44s)]
*  I said, hey, should I do music in college? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1685.28s)]
*  You know, and I remember her telling me, don't do music in college if you can see yourself [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1687.44s)]
*  doing anything else. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1694.0s)]
*  Well, so if you can imagine yourself doing anything else other than music, you shouldn't [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1695.82s)]
*  pursue music in college. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1699.58s)]
*  So in my brain, I'm thinking, OK, well, I only thought the only option was to be a music [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1701.86s)]
*  teacher. In my head, I'm going, well, that's the only option is to be a music teacher. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1706.94s)]
*  And I don't want to be a music teacher because I'm really bad. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1711.74s)]
*  Like, I can't read music. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1715.9s)]
*  I like I'm like I can't do math. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1717.94s)]
*  Like I have some sort of like I just can't. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1720.58s)]
*  You can't read music. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1724.2s)]
*  Not at all. And like, like it's probably some sort of form of like dyslexia, probably to [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1726.2s)]
*  truest extent, like barely pass math. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1733.04s)]
*  I tried to read music. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1736.6399999999999s)]
*  And what happened? I was in so her so her husband was actually the band teacher. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1737.52s)]
*  He taught advanced placement music theory, which was a new class my senior year. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  I took that class and got like a D. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  Because it was like all these the kids that were the best at band and the best at chorus [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1749.62s)]
*  were who was in that class, only like eight students in the class. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1753.3s)]
*  And all it is was advanced. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1756.62s)]
*  Like, here's the notes. Here's this. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1758.54s)]
*  I tried out for Allstate Chorus three years in high school and didn't make it because you [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1760.6599999999999s)]
*  had to be able to read. You had to do a sight singing audition, which is where they would [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1764.62s)]
*  hand you a piece of sheet music and you had to sing it just by reading the notes on [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1768.86s)]
*  there. Right. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1775.34s)]
*  So it's a combination of what your voice sounded like and your ability to keep up with [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1776.72s)]
*  the Allstate choir teacher, whoever that was picked out to be. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1781.32s)]
*  And I never made it because I couldn't read the music. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1785.1599999999999s)]
*  I just couldn't do it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1788.84s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1790.2s)]
*  Did you get coaching on it? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1791.24s)]
*  Did you get like? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1792.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I try. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1793.36s)]
*  I mean, I busted to try to. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  It's just something about it doesn't doesn't make sense to me, like to my brain. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1797.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, I get it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1801.84s)]
*  Like, if I sit there and like, plink it out really, really slow, I mean, I could figure [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1803.1s)]
*  it out. Right. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1806.6999999999998s)]
*  But it just doesn't. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1808.06s)]
*  It's just such to me. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1809.6999999999998s)]
*  It's such an instinctual thing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1810.74s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  You know. And so I was in an acapella group my freshman year of college for a year. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1813.1799999999998s)]
*  I enjoyed that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1820.06s)]
*  But again, it was just like an after school kind of activity thing with other people in [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1821.06s)]
*  college. You know, excuse to have people to drink with. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1825.78s)]
*  Really. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1829.34s)]
*  You know, people with common ground or whatever. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1830.4399999999998s)]
*  And gave that up my beginning of my sophomore year, really. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1832.9199999999998s)]
*  And then didn't do music. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1839.1599999999999s)]
*  I played rugby. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1840.1599999999999s)]
*  I got into playing rugby in college. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1841.1599999999999s)]
*  I did that. Loved that. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1843.08s)]
*  And I was just the guy that would like sing at parties or whatever. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1844.8s)]
*  Like my buddies that played rugby with knew I sang. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1847.56s)]
*  Like, dude, sing for these chicks or whatever. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1850.72s)]
*  You know, it was kind of like I was like party trick guy. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1853.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1856.76s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not going to do that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1857.76s)]
*  I'm not going to do that. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1858.76s)]
*  And then after my junior year, I moved home to Asheville and I'd always moved home every [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1860.26s)]
*  summer up to that point. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1865.78s)]
*  And then my mom goes because I was sulking because all my buddies that year, they all [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1867.54s)]
*  stayed in their college town for the summer. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1874.02s)]
*  I was the only guy that moved back. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1875.62s)]
*  So all my friends are gone. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1877.82s)]
*  They're in Raleigh. They're in Charlotte. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1879.14s)]
*  They're in Chapel Hill. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1880.98s)]
*  They're in Boone. They're in, you know, Callaway and all these different schools. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1882.3s)]
*  So I'm working at the same job I have when I was 16 at a go-kart place with a bunch of [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1887.28s)]
*  high school kids. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1891.96s)]
*  I'm 21 years old. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1893.2s)]
*  I got nobody to hang out with. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1895.32s)]
*  I'm living in my parents' house. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1896.72s)]
*  I'm not doing well in school. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1898.12s)]
*  I don't know what I want to do with my life at all. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1900.28s)]
*  And I'm sitting on the porch. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1903.4s)]
*  I remember sitting on my parents' carport and it was like my mom come out and she was [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1904.68s)]
*  like, what's wrong with you? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1909.04s)]
*  Like, what's what's I'm an only child, too. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1910.08s)]
*  So she's like, what's what's going on? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1912.52s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know, mom, I don't have any friends here. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1914.86s)]
*  Like, I'm working at fucking go-karts, you know, like, what am I doing? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1917.06s)]
*  And she's like, well, you know, you know what, Luke, Kenny Chesney and Tim McGraw, they [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1922.54s)]
*  didn't even learn to play guitar till they were 21 years old. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1926.3799999999999s)]
*  And I was 21. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1929.8999999999999s)]
*  Right. And so my parents had bought me a guitar in seventh grade that I never played. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1931.22s)]
*  I did two guitar lessons and hated it because my parents wanted me to do it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1936.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like anything your parents want you to do, you don't want to do [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1940.6599999999999s)]
*  really. And so I went in the closet and I got this old like Ibanez, like $50 acoustic [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1943.58s)]
*  guitar, you know, just horrendous condition. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1950.04s)]
*  But I didn't know that. Didn't know anything about guitar. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1952.9199999999998s)]
*  Didn't know what a good guitar was. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1955.6799999999998s)]
*  Didn't know nice guitars even existed. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1957.04s)]
*  So I taught myself all summer. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1959.24s)]
*  I just sat on the porch when I wasn't at work playing, playing, playing because I know I [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1960.84s)]
*  love to sing. And I was like, well, I'll just learn how to play and then I can sing at [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1965.12s)]
*  like parties for my buddies or whatever. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1968.96s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to play guitar and taught myself all year and then just kind of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1970.82s)]
*  became obsessed with like learning how to play. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1974.58s)]
*  And by the time I was 22, I'm back in school. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1977.18s)]
*  I'm in Boone, hanging out with my buddies. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1980.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm starting to dabble around with like writing my own songs because I was like, well, I [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1982.02s)]
*  could, you know, this would be cool. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1986.18s)]
*  I like this. And then I wrote my first two or three songs and I booked a gig down the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1988.1s)]
*  street just like at this bar my rugby team always hung out at because I figured that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1992.62s)]
*  guy would, you know, he was like coke head, like wild card, like he'd give me a show or [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=1997.28s)]
*  whatever, you know, guy was awesome. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2001.52s)]
*  You know, I was like, this guy will give me a show if I want to do a show. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2003.56s)]
*  So I borrowed my neighbor's guitar because mine wasn't even acoustic electric. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2007.32s)]
*  It was just a straight up acoustic and sat on a stool. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2011.04s)]
*  My other buddy let me borrow his PA speakers and 200 of my friends came out and paid a [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2014.72s)]
*  dollar to see me. I made 200 bucks that night. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2020.52s)]
*  That was more than I made at both my jobs that week. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  And I was hooked, man. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2026.14s)]
*  I was like, dude, this is awesome. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2028.14s)]
*  Like, I love doing this stuff. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2030.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, I love doing this anyways. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2032.66s)]
*  And I'm having a great time. I'm like having drinks with my friends. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2035.3s)]
*  Everybody's psyched to see me here and stuff. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2038.5s)]
*  And I was like, it just made sense, man. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2041.66s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't one ounce of hard work in my mind after that point. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2043.3s)]
*  It was just always fun, man. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2047.6200000000001s)]
*  And I always loved it. Wow. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2049.34s)]
*  So it's like a door opened up. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2051.18s)]
*  You walk through it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2052.82s)]
*  Yeah. And your life changed forever. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2054.08s)]
*  It just made sense, dude. Yeah. It was like a true like aha moment. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2055.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. Like you hear about those from people. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2060.28s)]
*  Oh, I think I'm gonna flip the top. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2063.48s)]
*  Yeah. And you hear about those things, but it truly was that it was truly an aha [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2065.2400000000002s)]
*  moment. And it was life is a life changing man. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2070.08s)]
*  I don't know what I'd be doing if I hadn't done that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2072.96s)]
*  That's so awesome. I love those kind of stories. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2074.84s)]
*  I really do. I love those stories because it gives other people hope to. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2078.44s)]
*  Like, yeah, I guarantee you, there's someone listening out there that's in that [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2082.9399999999996s)]
*  same state that you were in when you were 21. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2086.4599999999996s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck am I doing? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2088.7799999999997s)]
*  And everybody has that feeling. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2091.1s)]
*  I feel like most people, right? Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2092.62s)]
*  Most people are like and you're in your graduate college. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2094.74s)]
*  I think about myself at, you know, if I graduated on time, 22, I didn't graduate. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2098.06s)]
*  But if I would have graduated on time, I've been 22 years old. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2102.18s)]
*  And at 22, it's like I just by the hair of my chin figured out what I was going to [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2105.2999999999997s)]
*  do. And that's got to be kind of abnormal, right? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2110.0s)]
*  Even like you go to college and it's like, okay, I'm a business major. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2112.76s)]
*  Right. And then I get out and then I realize I hate business because I'm only 22 [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2116.4s)]
*  years old and I don't know anything. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2120.6s)]
*  Really. All I know is like getting drunk and like smoking weed and stuff, you [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2122.92s)]
*  know, hanging out and going to class. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2127.88s)]
*  Well, for most people, too, you're looking for something that you could do or you [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2130.52s)]
*  can survive. You're just looking for a living. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2135.4s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and if you can find something that's not a living but as a [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2137.9s)]
*  passion, something that you really enjoy, you're already way ahead of the game. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2141.7s)]
*  I always think to myself, man, don't make a living, make a life. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2146.98s)]
*  Right. It's like, and that's, I wish I would have known that at the time. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2149.7s)]
*  Yeah. But now you can't know it. You're too young. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2154.62s)]
*  Yeah. And people tell you those things and it doesn't, it just doesn't register. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2157.7s)]
*  No. It's like when we were having this kid, it's like people tell you, well, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2162.02s)]
*  you're going to think this and this and this. And I've heard it all. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2165.2999999999997s)]
*  And it's all true, Joe. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2167.98s)]
*  Every single bit of it is true, but it's like, you don't believe it until it [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2169.62s)]
*  happens. You know, you just, you just can't, like you have to experience it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2173.98s)]
*  Yeah. When my friends who don't have kids ask me, I'm like, I can't even tell you. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2177.7s)]
*  There's nothing I can tell you. It's it'll change everything about who you are. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2181.7799999999997s)]
*  It does, man. It's, it's definitely like earth shattering thing, but it's, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2186.02s)]
*  and there's never that right time, right? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2192.3399999999997s)]
*  There's always could be an excuse to be like, well, we'll wait a couple of years [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2194.24s)]
*  till we're this. And then you get there and it's like, well, we'll get a bigger, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2197.72s)]
*  we need to get a bigger place. And by that time you're 40 or something, you know, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2200.96s)]
*  when you're at a time it's hard to get pregnant. Yeah. If you're set up, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2205.2799999999997s)]
*  if you're set up in the, in the bunker that you want to have with, you know, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2208.52s)]
*  $10 million in the bank, you might be 50 something years old at that time. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2212.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, yeah, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2216.44s)]
*  that's the theory behind population collapse is that people start getting into [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2217.44s)]
*  their careers and women want to have children older and they want to have less [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2221.76s)]
*  children and they're, you know, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2226.0600000000004s)]
*  it's I didn't even realize that was a thing until Musk started talking about it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2228.34s)]
*  Well, Japan is apparently in dire straits because the way it works is you always [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2234.34s)]
*  have to look 18 to 20 years out from now, you know, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2239.2200000000003s)]
*  and when people are looking at life now, you're like, Oh, there's so many people, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2242.94s)]
*  there's no population collapse. Right. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2246.7000000000003s)]
*  But when no one is having kids and you realize when these people die, that's it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2248.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Cause the mainstream belief is that the world's overpopulated, right? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2252.7999999999997s)]
*  Essentially. That's what I always remembered here and growing up is there was too [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2256.08s)]
*  many people. Well, there's, the real problem is not too many people. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2259.52s)]
*  The real problem is lack of economic opportunity. And, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2263.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, this, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2268.3599999999997s)]
*  these places where people are starving and poor, right? They, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2271.0s)]
*  those are the people that ironically are having the most children. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2275.4s)]
*  Yeah. Which is crazy. Yeah. It's nuts, man. I mean, it's, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2278.3599999999997s)]
*  I remember thinking like my grandmother, you know, she's one of 12 or 14. Right. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2282.12s)]
*  And then my other, my, my dad's dad, he was one of, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2287.12s)]
*  I mean 10. Yeah. Right. And it's like, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2291.8799999999997s)]
*  my dad's best friend born in Ohio. He's one of a ton, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2295.68s)]
*  but they, it's like, they all grew up on farms. So it's like, you're having, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2300.8399999999997s)]
*  essentially the kids are had to like help with the farm, right? Like, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2305.74s)]
*  that was the idea at that time for those people. It's like, well, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2308.7s)]
*  if I got more kids, I got more people to help. Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2312.1s)]
*  Raising a staff. Right. It's, which is wild. And that's just not happening, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2315.1s)]
*  you know, and not that obviously that's the reason no one should be having [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2318.86s)]
*  children to have people to work at their home, you know? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2322.02s)]
*  But it was a necessity at that time. Yeah. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2325.46s)]
*  It's a, it's always fascinating to me the roots of the kind of music that you [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2329.54s)]
*  enjoy country music, because it's country is so, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2333.78s)]
*  it's so ingrained in struggle and in life and hardship and heartbreak and, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2337.84s)]
*  you know, it's, it's such a, it, it, that, that music resonates with people. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2346.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there's a thing about, you know, that, that, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2351.6400000000003s)]
*  that kind of life that comes through in that music, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  that's so appealing to people. Yeah. I remember, you know, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2359.8s)]
*  I mean, I think back to, you know, my, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2363.66s)]
*  my grandfather's favorite artist was Chet Atkins and when he passed away in [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2366.34s)]
*  2015, the thing that he, you know, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2370.66s)]
*  gave me was every Chet Atkins record ever on vinyl. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2374.52s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, what a cool thing, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2378.94s)]
*  Like he loved that guy so much. I mean, one of the best guitar players ever, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2381.78s)]
*  not to mention, but he loved that guy so much that he bought every, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2386.3s)]
*  and I'm talking, it's, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2391.96s)]
*  those guys were putting fucking records out back then. I mean, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2393.1200000000003s)]
*  they might put out two albums a year. Wow. I mean, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2397.5600000000004s)]
*  go look how many Merle Haggard records there are, or Waylon Jennings records. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2400.48s)]
*  There's a bunch dude. Willie Nelson records. There's 90. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2404.36s)]
*  Willie Nelson records. It's really 60 or 90. Wow. So either way, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2409.28s)]
*  it's not a low number, right? But like crazy, because those guys would, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2413.84s)]
*  they just went, they just lived in the studio, man. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2418.2000000000003s)]
*  And they wrote and they cut their buddies songs that they loved. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2421.3s)]
*  And it was like, it was quick cause it was all one take. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2424.6000000000004s)]
*  We're going with the band, get a take. We like the take done, print it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2427.76s)]
*  Now it's go in, do the thing, record the songs, get every part, right? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  Comp the vocals, comp the guitar parts, comp the drums. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2437.0800000000004s)]
*  Like it could take days and days and weeks to get one song right now, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2440.0800000000004s)]
*  because everything has to be perfect in everyone's mind. Right. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2446.02s)]
*  And I think that's the uniqueness of, I mean, Stapleton, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2450.78s)]
*  he goes in and cuts records with a band. Yeah. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2454.1000000000004s)]
*  And they cut it live to tape. And it's like, that's why it's different. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2457.5s)]
*  Yeah. It's, it's interesting what resonates too. You know, uh, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2463.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm a big culture wall fan and uh, sleeping on the blacktop. Oh my God. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2467.42s)]

*  He sounds like a cowboy from 1860. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2478.26s)]
*  Dude has been smoking four packs of camels a day. Canadian guy, right? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2481.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Have you had him on? No, man. He doesn't do interviews. Really? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2487.32s)]
*  Yeah. He works on a ranch. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2491.92s)]
*  That's super cool. Dude, that guy's so much cooler than me. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2494.5200000000004s)]
*  Damn it. So much cooler than me. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  I've been trying to get him on for like a year and a half, two years. He's like, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  he just doesn't do interviews. He's just a musician. He's just an artist. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2506.54s)]
*  So like he's pure in the strangest way. I just love to hang with him. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2510.46s)]
*  I just want to meet him. I'm like, I just want to tell him like, Hey man, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2514.38s)]
*  like even if you don't want to do a interview, let's just talk. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2517.38s)]
*  I just want to see what you're all about. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2520.06s)]
*  If he works on a ranch, dude, he hunts right. You would think so. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2521.22s)]
*  I mean that's the pitch. Yeah. I mean, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2525.74s)]
*  there's so many people from Canada that hunt too. Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2527.3s)]
*  It's a different world up there. It really is, man. It's wild. Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2530.22s)]
*  It's wild place up there. How did you meet Ronella? Okay. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2534.28s)]
*  So I'm Ronella a stand dude. I'm a Ronella stand meat eater. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2537.8s)]
*  I've been watching it for years, man. And it's just like, I've, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2542.7200000000003s)]
*  and you probably feel the same way, man. Like there's a lot of like machismo, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2546.48s)]
*  bravado stuff and like the hunting like industry. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2552.04s)]
*  That really like turns me off to it because I feel like [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2557.32s)]
*  it's why so many people like have a disdain for hunting. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2561.76s)]
*  It's not necessarily, obviously there's people that go, you shouldn't kill animals. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2567.2200000000003s)]
*  You shouldn't do this. You shouldn't do that. Right. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2570.88s)]
*  There's always going to be those people, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2572.46s)]
*  but there's the people that go the type of people that hunt. Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2574.3s)]
*  It's almost a stereotype. Right. Yeah. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2577.82s)]
*  And I didn't get into hunting till I was, till I moved to Nashville, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2580.46s)]
*  but I didn't grow up hunting. My dad's from the rust belt in Ohio, like steel mill. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2584.3s)]
*  His dad was a truck driver, like they didn't own land, kind of thing. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2589.44s)]
*  So he didn't hunt. That was just not a part of my upbringing. Right. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2593.08s)]
*  I used hunting and like inherently the guys I started writing songs with and the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2597.2s)]
*  guys I connected with all love to hunt. Right. So started out as like, okay, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2602.12s)]
*  well cool. These guys will take me out. That'll be super fun. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2606.52s)]
*  And as I fell in love with it as my Chris, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2609.8s)]
*  because my career was taken off at the same time. Right. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2613.08s)]
*  And so life became more and more and more hectic and it became this cathartic [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2615.98s)]
*  experience of like being able to process some of what was happening to me and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2620.58s)]
*  just enjoying that hunting was the opposite of everything else I was doing in [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2625.66s)]
*  my life. Right. It was like this pursuit of this thing that was so like pure. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2630.2599999999998s)]
*  It's calm. Like it's like, I can, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2635.66s)]
*  I'm in control of like what's going on out here. And it's like, you know, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2638.22s)]
*  obviously not the animal, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2642.72s)]
*  but just being here and being like present and not having my phone and not [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2643.7999999999997s)]
*  worrying about posting a Instagram or whatever it is. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2647.8399999999997s)]
*  And I fell in love with that rapidly. And so as I begin to go, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2651.9199999999996s)]
*  well dude, I want to watch this on television. You know, I want to see this. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2657.08s)]
*  So I start watching stuff and I'm like, dude, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2661.2s)]
*  some of these guys are brutal on here. Like it's just not for me. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2663.3199999999997s)]
*  Like just hunting like, oh, we're going, if it's brown, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2667.56s)]
*  it's down and fucking kill it. You know? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2670.92s)]
*  And it's like this whole thing about it to me was odd. Yeah. Right. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2673.3s)]
*  Like it felt like this fake, it felt fake to me. Right. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2678.14s)]
*  So then I turn on, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2683.1800000000003s)]
*  I see this show me major on outdoor channel and I'm watching it and it's like, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2684.82s)]
*  and I see the intro where it's like, I'm Steven Ronella and hunting's not just [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2689.34s)]
*  about the pursuit of an animal and all that. And I was like, okay, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2693.46s)]
*  that's different than all the other shows that I've seen. You know, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2696.38s)]
*  and so I watched it and then there's this mega intelligent cat on there and he's [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2699.96s)]
*  cooking dude and he's taught and he's like a wealth of knowledge. Right. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2705.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's the thing that like, that gets me like, my dad's a big like thinker, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2709.88s)]
*  you know? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2714.16s)]
*  And he's always been interested in just learning about new stuff. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2715.6s)]
*  Like he's always just taking in information and learning things. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2718.8s)]
*  And so I think I kind of inherited that from him. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2722.52s)]
*  And so then I became kind of obsessed with like this show, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2725.5s)]
*  this media show. So I started watching an outdoor channel and then it comes on [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2729.86s)]
*  Netflix. This new, the new kind of version that comes on Netflix. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2732.94s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, this is, this is like earth shattering for me. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2736.26s)]
*  This is like, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2740.7000000000003s)]
*  it's marrying the intelligence of what this is and it's exposing people to, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2741.2200000000003s)]
*  in my opinion, what's the right side of hunting to be on. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2749.1400000000003s)]
*  But the thing that I love about it so much and I just for you. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2753.48s)]
*  So then my career is starting to go and go and go. I saw you on there. You know, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2757.84s)]
*  I was like, man, that's cool. He's having guests on, you know, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2761.6s)]
*  that's pretty sick, you know, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2764.08s)]
*  and all his buddies were like wicked smart and like knew everything and they do [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2765.2s)]
*  all this to go to Alaska and they go to these incredible places, dude. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2769.6s)]
*  And so I just had my PR team. I was like, just reach out to this guy. Like, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2773.48s)]
*  please get me like, how do I get on this show? Like, I want to be on this. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  I want to meet this guy and like be buddies with him and stuff. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2781.16s)]
*  And it took like two years to finally get like, okay, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2784.06s)]
*  we got a time he wants to do it. And what was it like when you first met? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2788.18s)]
*  Well, I met him when he didn't have meat either. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2793.18s)]
*  I met him when he was doing a show called the wild within. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2795.74s)]
*  There was a show that was on, I forget what network it was on, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2798.62s)]
*  but it was a show where he was kind of recreating how, um, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2801.72s)]
*  like the, the people that traveled across the West for the first time, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2806.62s)]
*  the early settlers, how they hunted and you know, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2810.5s)]
*  like he shot a moose with a musket and turned it's, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2813.84s)]
*  it's a Cape into like a raft and was drifting with it. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2816.96s)]
*  And I was like, what an interesting guy. Like really the whole thing behind it was, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2822.8s)]
*  you could tell his, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2827.76s)]
*  his integrity and his, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2829.84s)]
*  his true appreciation for the outdoors and for wild animals and conservation. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2831.96s)]
*  It feels very pure. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2837.34s)]
*  And he's so well read. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2838.18s)]
*  I'm like, this is different than every other hunting show that I'd ever seen. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2839.38s)]
*  The same thing to me. And then I met, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2842.54s)]
*  he didn't even know what a podcast was. But to his defense, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2845.18s)]
*  nobody did back then. It was very early. And, um, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2848.98s)]
*  I think I met him in 2011. And then, uh, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2852.94s)]
*  he said he was doing a new show and he asked me if I wanted to hunt. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2856.3s)]
*  And I said, I've always wanted to hunt and I never really knew how to get [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2859.38s)]
*  started. And I was like, I'm not going to do that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2862.5s)]
*  And I never really knew how to get started. Right. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2865.14s)]
*  And so intimidating dude. It's a hard thing to get into, man. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2867.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a big learning curve. There's a lot. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2870.2799999999997s)]
*  And then to try to figure out what to do and how to do it. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2872.2s)]
*  And there's so much to learn and there's so, there's so much involved in it. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  And so he took me and my friend, Brian Cowan to Montana and we went mule deer [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2879.4s)]
*  hunting. And from then on, I've never stopped hunting. Yeah. That was 2012. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2883.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I was hooked. What was it like? Okay. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2888.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm curious to know what it was like, like, so when you, like you've got his first [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2891.7s)]
*  meet, was he like a little cold when you first met him? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2896.3399999999997s)]
*  A little standoffish. Yeah. Because, you know, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2899.14s)]
*  he thinks everyone's a douche bag because a lot of people are douche bags. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2901.2999999999997s)]
*  And it was, it was the same thing for me. It was like, it was like, we got there. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2904.18s)]
*  We hunted in Wyoming and you guys hunted pronghorn, right? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2908.1s)]
*  And had never, I had never done that. Um, you know, so it's all new. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2912.1s)]
*  Yeah. It's amazing, dude. That's a ancient, ancient animal. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2916.94s)]
*  Yeah, it is. That's the, one of the animals that survived the, uh, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2921.4399999999996s)]
*  mass extinction of megafauna 12,000 years ago. Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2925.0s)]
*  It's because it doesn't have any known really relatives, right? It also, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2927.9199999999996s)]
*  it has speed that rivals like fucking cheetahs. Yeah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2932.2s)]
*  Because they used to run from cheetahs. That's, that's the animal. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2936.64s)]
*  It's such a fucking ancient animal. It's so cool looking, man. Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2939.56s)]
*  Cause it's not a cervid. No. Yeah. No. That's what I was so interested. Did you, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2943.2s)]
*  have you, have you hunted these? No, I have not. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2947.8799999999997s)]
*  Dude, have you, so I didn't, and Reneal told me this in the episode when we, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2950.06s)]
*  he was like, smell it. It smells like Fritos. It does. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2954.5s)]
*  It smells like Fritos, man. It's so, so strange. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2958.62s)]
*  And I didn't realize their hair was hollow. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2962.14s)]
*  So he's like, if you shoot one and it gets in the water, you're screwed, dude. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2965.46s)]
*  Cause it weighs like three times as much because it's hair absorbs all the water. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2969.22s)]
*  So it just sinks. So it's just like, well, if you got to get it out, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2973.9s)]
*  and you got to drag it, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2977.68s)]
*  it weighs three times as much as it did before you shot it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2979.28s)]
*  Cause then the entire thing is just saturated with water. That's interesting. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2983.08s)]
*  Which I thought was crazy. I wonder why. I don't know. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2987.08s)]
*  It's got to serve some sort of purpose. Some ancient evolutionary purpose. Yeah. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2990.8s)]
*  But I thought Steve was, he was like, it was crazy. It was like, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=2995.64s)]

*  when he chilled out is we went and shot that night. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3037.08s)]
*  Cause we got those six, five, 300 weather bees that the meat eater gun that they [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3040.6s)]
*  made with weather bee. And we went and shot that night and cited them in. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3045.12s)]

*  He knew we weren't like bozos who were just out there and like, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3060.46s)]
*  didn't know at all what we were doing. Like we were going to in some way be [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3063.1s)]
*  dangerous like to him or to his crew or whatever. It was like immediately, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3066.6600000000003s)]
*  it was like, he was a completely different guy. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3071.02s)]
*  I didn't know anything. I didn't own a rifle at the time. I, you know, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3073.38s)]

*  Cause he's, he's the kind of guy that's so well read and so articulate that he [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3138.58s)]
*  can have a conversation with someone who has a completely opposite opinion of [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3142.22s)]
*  what hunting is. And at the end of it, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3147.0s)]
*  they come away with just a much more comprehensive perspective [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3148.8399999999997s)]
*  of what it's about and what conservation is about and why, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3154.3999999999996s)]

*  He is man. He's cool. Yeah. Have you ever rattled in bucks before? I haven't. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3175.86s)]
*  I haven't. God. We rattled in a whitetails down in South Texas. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3180.1s)]
*  It's the most fun shit ever. Cause you, you basically set up, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3183.62s)]
*  you have to have an arrow knocked and you're fucking right. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3187.14s)]
*  You're release on the click cause they come running in, right? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3189.98s)]
*  He's sprint cause it was in the middle of the rut. So you just clack, clack, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3193.1s)]
*  you take the, the, the fake annulars and you rack them. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3196.26s)]
*  And then these deer just come sprinting in full clip, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3199.44s)]
*  looking to fight and fuck. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3203.96s)]
*  I've tried it a million times, right? It just, that's never worked. You know, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3206.72s)]
*  like Tennessee is not exactly a hotbed for rattling in bucks. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3210.48s)]
*  You know? I mean, I can't say it doesn't work for some of my buddies, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3215.2999999999997s)]
*  but it's never worked for me. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3218.58s)]
*  It works amazing in South Texas. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3219.8799999999997s)]
*  He said it works there better than anywhere he's ever been. And he doesn't, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3221.56s)]
*  no one knows why, you know, but it's, uh, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3224.8799999999997s)]
*  I think you just gotta catch it at the right time. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3227.98s)]
*  You gotta catch it right at the time when they're fucking and fighting. Right. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3230.06s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a week or two week max where it really, really works. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3233.26s)]
*  And otherwise they're like, why is that going on? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3238.02s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I'm not going out there. That's weird. You know, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3239.86s)]
*  deer interesting, man. They're interesting animals, man. The more you watch them, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3244.22s)]
*  they just, nothing makes sense to me with it. The more I watch them, you know, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3248.14s)]
*  the things that are supposed to happen often don't, I find, you know, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3252.58s)]
*  like you're thinking this is going to be, you know, I'm hunting the wind. I'm, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3257.0s)]
*  I got the stand. I got the access. I got the wind. I got the spot. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3260.56s)]
*  I got the stand. I got the food plot. You know, like in Tennessee, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3263.6s)]
*  you can't hunt over bait. So it's like you plant the food plot, you know, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3267.36s)]
*  it's knee high by July and the corn and it's like, you got it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3270.76s)]
*  It's everything's right. And then it's like, it's rut, you know, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3273.84s)]
*  it's like, and it's just nothing. You know, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3278.6s)]
*  sometimes you go out there and you're like, what is, how is this possible? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3281.64s)]
*  Well, I have friends that are absolutely obsessed with whitetail, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3285.02s)]
*  especially my friend John Dudley. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3288.74s)]
*  He has an enormous plot of land that he has dedicated just to bow hunting. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3290.3s)]
*  And that guy cultivates it all year round. He works on the food plots. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3295.94s)]
*  He has stands set up specifically in areas so that he knows which way the wind [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3300.5s)]
*  is blowing. He's going to go to that stand. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3305.7s)]
*  He goes to the stand on an electric bike so he doesn't leave behind any trace of [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3308.14s)]
*  smell. So his feet never touch the ground. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3312.7599999999998s)]
*  I do the same thing. It sounds like it works for him. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3315.6s)]
*  It works for him. Well, he's a master. I mean, John, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3319.56s)]
*  John's like one of the best archers and best archery coaches in the space. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3322.2s)]
*  And he's, he's, he's an amazing guy, but man, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3327.68s)]
*  that guy is obsessed and whitetails the most hunted big game animal in North [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3330.3599999999997s)]

*  I went to Oklahoma for a week and it was like, it was jam up, man. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3339.5s)]
*  It was like, there's going to be deer. Like, you know, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3344.22s)]
*  it just felt everything's right. Right? We got this guy taking us out. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3347.3s)]
*  He was awesome, man. He was stuff like killer guy, you know, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3350.9s)]
*  and it's like we're like, we're going in, me and my buddies were going in. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3355.42s)]
*  So as I went with Dana Reed, same guys I did meet here with, we went, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3358.26s)]

*  more and it's for reason. This is so it's archery only, you know, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3377.16s)]
*  Oklahoma's only got like two week rifle season, I think. So we're doing archery. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3380.52s)]
*  Morning comes nothing. I'm like, man, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3386.28s)]
*  like not really seeing like a ton of deer and stuff. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3389.04s)]
*  And we're still like, we're getting tonight's tonight. You know, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3392.44s)]
*  we got five days to be out there and we were thinking we're going to be going [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3394.36s)]
*  home early, dude. Like we're going to be here. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3397.76s)]
*  The first night we're going to tag out and be like trying to spend two days just [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3399.9s)]
*  hanging out, you know, or something. And so about the third day we're like, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3403.82s)]
*  well, let's all switch. We'd all been in the same spots, you know, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3408.34s)]
*  different stance because they had a few different leases kind of around this area [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3410.96s)]
*  of Oklahoma. So we were all going to different spots and like, well, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3415.3s)]
*  it's all switch up. Right. So I get in this tree in the afternoon, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3418.42s)]
*  sitting there and my buddy Dan, he's like, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3422.8s)]
*  he's probably 500 yards away from me in another tree. And the, the, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3425.96s)]
*  the grant is kind of like really soft rolling Hills. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3430.6s)]
*  Like it looks flat almost if you're in the car and then you realize there's a [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3434.44s)]
*  little bit of elevation change going on. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3437.84s)]
*  So there's like this draw in between me and Dan I'm there and it's freezing, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3440.44s)]
*  dude. Wind's blowing 25 miles an hour. I mean, just hammering, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3445.3s)]
*  but the wind's perfect for where I'm hunting at. Right. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3448.76s)]
*  Cause it's kind of like this, this grove of like Cedars, you know, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3450.92s)]
*  and that's where all the deer are. Cause everything else is just ag fields around [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3455.34s)]
*  sitting there. I got these three does. I watch them come like off this Hill. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3459.78s)]
*  They come through the Cedars hop this fence, dude, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3464.2200000000003s)]
*  they're 25 yards in me, like right on me, dude, you know, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3467.38s)]
*  so I'm already like kind of standing up cause I'm, I'm not, you know, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3472.9s)]
*  we're not even hunting a doe at this point, you know, and all of a sudden, man, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3475.7400000000002s)]
*  behind this kind of berm over to my left, there's like a little pond [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3480.36s)]
*  behind this berm walks out, dude. I'm talking, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3485.52s)]
*  you're going to think I'm lying. 230 inch deer, man. No lie. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3489.0s)]
*  Everybody watching this is going to be like, you're lying. There's no, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3494.0800000000004s)]
*  you didn't see a 230 inch deer, 230 inch deer comes out. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3496.6800000000003s)]
*  He's at 60 yards broadside. I've got my arrow. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3500.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm on the D loop. I'm, I'm up, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3505.1200000000003s)]
*  but I'm not drawing on him because he's broadside at 60. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3509.42s)]
*  The wind's good. 25 miles an hour. Right. So it's, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3512.66s)]
*  so it's like that arrow is going to go right. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3515.5s)]
*  I'm not good enough to compensate for that kind of wind. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3518.7s)]
*  I've also got does at 25 yards underneath my feet. And I'm going, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3521.46s)]
*  this box coming in, dude, he's walking right into this thing. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3526.16s)]
*  There's no chance he doesn't walk in here. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3530.06s)]
*  There's does in here feeding underneath my feet and he's looking right at him [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3532.04s)]
*  broadside like this. So I'm hooked up. He kind of looks over. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3535.6400000000003s)]
*  He's looking at the does and then he looks back really quick and he takes off [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3539.52s)]
*  like dead sprint, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3545.0s)]
*  just stays at 60 and goes all the watch him go all the way into the Cedars. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3546.92s)]
*  Did the wind swirl? No, the wind didn't swirl. And I'm going, what is going on? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3551.6s)]
*  I called Dan and I'm like shaking at this point. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3556.44s)]
*  I've got my bow back on the thing because the, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3559.0s)]
*  the does spooked out and they followed him when they saw they look back at him. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3560.92s)]
*  And when he took off, they took off. I called Dan. I was like, dude, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3564.6s)]
*  I saw just once in 10 lifetime deer just come out and spooked at 60 [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3568.7s)]
*  yards. Like it can't be me. If the wind's great, like nothing saw me, dude, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3573.42s)]
*  it wasn't me. And then he's like, he's on the phone with me. He goes, dude, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3578.62s)]
*  there's coyotes running through the draw right now. I can see them. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3582.14s)]
*  And I'm like, Oh gosh. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3585.54s)]
*  So I said in that stand for the next three days, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3587.46s)]
*  just every morning, three hours, night, three hours. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3590.52s)]
*  So last morning I'm up there. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3596.04s)]
*  I look up back to where Dan was sitting at. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3599.28s)]
*  There's kind of a another ag fence into a cut. It's like a cut cotton field. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3601.08s)]
*  So it's not even like, even though it's cut, there's not even food in it, right? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3606.12s)]
*  There's not beans in it or corn in it. It's a cut cotton field. So really, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3610.0s)]
*  in theory, nothing that these deer would be eating in this field really. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3613.76s)]
*  So Dan's hunting somewhere else. So I call our guy, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3617.82s)]
*  I see all these deer and I'm glassing probably like I said, 500 ish yards out. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3622.9s)]
*  I'm glassing and I see all these does all these does. And I see him dude, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3627.94s)]
*  just, I mean, you could see from 500 yards. He's a giant without binoculars. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3633.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like just no doubt that this is the same deer and he's [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3638.18s)]
*  cruising and there's like, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3643.18s)]
*  if you can imagine there's this wheat grass on the fence row right there that's [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3644.7599999999998s)]
*  grown up probably four foot, five foot maybe. And there's a, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3649.04s)]
*  there's a gap in it where there's a fence and probably six feet. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3653.96s)]
*  There's another gap where there's a fence. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3657.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's all grass the whole way around except for where those two fences are. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3659.44s)]
*  So I watch every doe pile past the first fence, past the second fence. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3663.92s)]
*  He's behind him. He comes past the first fence, never goes past the second fence. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3668.48s)]
*  And I go, I call my guy, I said, dude, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3674.66s)]
*  come get me this deer is bedded in this little tiny spot. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3676.44s)]
*  I know exactly where he is. And he goes, all right. He said, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3680.8399999999997s)]
*  we're going back tonight because this deer is not going to move. He said, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3684.64s)]
*  we're going to do spot and stock up to this spot. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3687.8399999999997s)]
*  Cause I know he's laying right there. Stock up, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3690.8399999999997s)]
*  get probably 75 yards from that spot. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3695.2s)]
*  And we, we pretty good feeling he's going to jump this fence and come right [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3699.96s)]
*  across this field to where we're at. And we're just going to be right there. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3703.84s)]
*  You know, I'm sitting crisscross applesauce like ready. He goes, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3707.1400000000003s)]
*  if we got 15 minutes of light left, he's like, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3711.42s)]
*  we're going to creep up there and see if we can spook him up kind of thing. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3713.9s)]
*  We get up there, dude, my heart is going a million miles an hour. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3720.2200000000003s)]
*  It probably is right now just from being fat, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3722.9s)]
*  but it was really going at that time, dude. You know what I mean? Like, I'm like, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3724.82s)]
*  I'm one blood pressure point away from a stroke at this point, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3729.24s)]
*  like hiking up this thing. We get up there and we're like, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3733.08s)]
*  nothing's out there. I'm like, how can he not be there? So we're looking, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3737.72s)]
*  we looked down the fence and this property line right there is like, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3742.3599999999997s)]
*  so it's like this fence, we have access to this fence here. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3746.96s)]
*  There's an adjacent fence right here. That's not that they don't have access on. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3750.8399999999997s)]
*  So we hop, look, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3755.84s)]
*  he's a hundred yards in the cut cotton field, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3758.6600000000003s)]
*  just standing out in the cotton field. This is our last night. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3761.6600000000003s)]
*  We're going to the plane after the hunt and it was over, man, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3765.06s)]
*  turning 30 inch deer. I'll never see him again. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3769.54s)]
*  Never see anything like it. Wow. This is not high fence. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3774.06s)]
*  This is not a pin pay to play like pick your dear thing. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3776.58s)]
*  Like I was Pope Bill, been excited to shoot a 145 on this trip. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? Biggest I've ever killed is 155, you know? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3787.12s)]
*  And so I'm like, I got pictures of him somewhere. Yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3790.56s)]
*  He's nuts. Let me see if I can find him on here. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3795.52s)]
*  It's fascinating how the appeal of those old mature bucks, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3797.88s)]
*  cause you know, they're so smart. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3802.44s)]
*  They don't get to be that big unless they make all the right moves for five or [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3804.02s)]
*  six years. Forever. They make it forever, dude. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3808.2s)]
*  And it's just, let me see if I can find this thing, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3811.44s)]
*  but that's how they get to be that big by just doing weird shit. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3813.54s)]
*  Just being smart. Not being predictable. Where's this guy at, man? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3817.94s)]
*  I got him in my text messages. If I don't have him here. Yeah, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3823.58s)]
*  I got him in my text messages. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3826.7000000000003s)]
*  Dead air. You ever watch Always Sunny? I don't worry about Dead Air. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3833.62s)]
*  I remember the scene in Always Sunny where they, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3837.08s)]
*  they're trying to do a podcast and nobody's saying anything. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3840.7200000000003s)]
*  Danny DeVito just goes, dead air. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3843.32s)]
*  That always rings in my head when I'm doing an interview for some reason. Okay. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3847.48s)]
*  So I'm close here. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3852.08s)]
*  I don't think people are ever going to appreciate that don't hunt what it means to [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3853.84s)]
*  see an animal that's that unusual. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3858.32s)]
*  Holy fuck. Yeah. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3863.28s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. That's not a joke. Yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3865.82s)]
*  That's a gigantic deer. Wow. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3870.06s)]
*  Wow. This is that this year? So he's still alive you think? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3875.6600000000003s)]
*  Do they have any trail cam photos of him? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3880.62s)]
*  Yeah, this is from, that's from a few weeks before we were out there. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3883.1s)]
*  This is where, this is where I was. Right? So this is my kind of spot here. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3887.1s)]
*  What time of year were you there? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3890.7000000000003s)]
*  We were there December, like second week of December. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3891.96s)]
*  Yeah. You going back? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3895.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I'm gonna have to. They said, here's the thing with this deer, right? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3897.64s)]
*  Here's another angle of them. They go, here's the thing with this deer. They go, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3901.04s)]
*  even if he loses 20 inches, he's a 210 inch deer, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3905.6s)]
*  but there's a potential that he could be a 250 inch deer next year. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3909.52s)]
*  Right. If he's only five. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3914.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3915.7599999999998s)]
*  This deer, this deer breaks the county record [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3917.54s)]
*  by 60 inches and it's a top 10 archery deer in the history of Oklahoma. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3922.3399999999997s)]
*  If it goes down. What's the number one? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3927.22s)]
*  Number one, I could look it up. It's in the two, like forties range, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3929.86s)]
*  like two 45 range of all time archery deer in the state of Oklahoma. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3934.86s)]
*  I didn't know Oklahoma deer that were that big. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3939.42s)]
*  I don't think anybody does. So let's edit this part out. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3941.2599999999998s)]
*  Don't go to Oklahoma. It stinks to hunt in Northern Oklahoma. It stinks. Yeah. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3944.4s)]
*  Dudley has a spot in Oklahoma. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3948.68s)]
*  It's dude. I didn't know about it until this year. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3950.44s)]
*  Yeah. He's got a lease in Oklahoma. He's got some big fucking deer on that lease too. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3952.44s)]
*  We just had a friend that, that put us onto this guy and he was like, man, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3956.4s)]
*  this guy's great. And he's, you know, knows his stuff and he's eager and, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3959.96s)]
*  you know, he's excited to have y'all down. And I was like, cool, man. Like, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3964.64s)]
*  you gotta think man, where I'm hunting Tennessee, dude, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3967.72s)]
*  a big deer in Tennessee is 140 inch deer. Right. You know? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3970.6600000000003s)]
*  So like I killed a one 55 in Mississippi and thought I killed a [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3975.26s)]
*  Tyrannosaurus Rex dude. You know? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3979.9s)]
*  So like when you're going out West and seeing these deer, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3982.1400000000003s)]
*  it's unbelievable to a guy like myself to even see that, you know, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3984.6600000000003s)]
*  and growing a one 45 on my own place would be deer of a lifetime for most guys [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3989.3s)]
*  in Southeast North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia. Like that's [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3994.42s)]
*  the biggest deer you'll ever see. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=3999.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. The, the obsession that people have with cultivating land developed [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4000.84s)]
*  specifically to encourage white tail deer to move there. I mean, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4006.2s)]
*  there's a whole industry behind it where people buy enormous plots of land and [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4009.36s)]
*  hire people to do land management just to set it up for deer. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4014.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I can't say I don't do it myself. It's like, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4018.2s)]
*  it's just so intoxicating of like not. And it's like, man, the high fence thing, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4022.8s)]
*  it just doesn't do anything for me. I've never done it. I don't want to do it. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4027.32s)]
*  It just doesn't. It's just not the same. It's a different thing. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4030.7000000000003s)]
*  It's just not even comparable. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4034.78s)]
*  It's like not knowing what's going to walk out as the almost the exciting part [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4037.5800000000004s)]
*  for sure. Yeah. It's the wildest. The fact that you're, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4041.54s)]
*  you're engaging with a wild animal. Yeah. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4045.6200000000003s)]
*  The people that they feed them with feeders and they have a high fence and [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4048.42s)]
*  it's only 500 acres, you know, where they all are. They can't get out. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4053.0s)]
*  Right. It's like, do you want to shoot Ricky or Johnny or Bobby or Greg or [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4057.3199999999997s)]
*  which one? And they just go, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4062.2s)]
*  no, like that's Greg's whistle. He'll come out on that one. You know, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4064.92s)]
*  well they literally hear the feeders going off and they come in, which is, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4067.6s)]
*  yup. It's, there's a lot of that in Texas. Yeah. Tennessee. There's no, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4071.2s)]
*  you can have, you can feed them like not. It's two weeks before season. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4075.08s)]
*  You have to have all feed, uh, like you can't have a grain of corn on the ground. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4079.6s)]
*  That's not in a food plot. You know, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4083.48s)]
*  you can hunt our food plot if you plan it and cultivate it and stuff and you can [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4085.82s)]
*  feed, you know, you can do protein corn stuff. Like obviously you can't do it [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4089.6200000000003s)]
*  during turkey season either. So you have to have it up for that as well. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4093.6200000000003s)]
*  But through the winter you can supplement. Well, not even winter. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4098.02s)]
*  Cause that's season. Yeah. Our season ends like first week of January in Tennessee. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4101.06s)]
*  So after that you could have, you could have stuff out. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4108.3s)]
*  So you really you're feeding through the spring and summer. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4111.66s)]
*  Have you ever done any, uh, out west hunting like elk hunting? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4114.12s)]
*  No, I want to real bad though. Like real bad. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4117.92s)]
*  If you think you get obsessed with white tail, I keep hearing about it. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4120.48s)]
*  Wait till you see a 400 inch bull raking its way through the trees. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4124.16s)]
*  Looking like a fucking dinosaur. Yeah. And then you hear them scream. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4129.12s)]
*  I can't even imagine your blood boils. It's the, it's the wildest feeling. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4138.28s)]
*  And you know, I was, we were talking before the Derek Wolf who, you know, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4142.740000000001s)]
*  was in the fucking super bowl and they asked him, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4146.7s)]
*  what is better sacking Tom Brady or shooting an elk? And he's like, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4151.26s)]
*  sack it. Tom Brady's pretty fucking cool, but it's not even close. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4155.34s)]
*  It's not even close. There's something about those animals, man. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4158.38s)]
*  What's a turkey hunting. They call it poor man's elk hunting. Right. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4162.38s)]
*  Cause there's the call and response thing. And yeah, you know, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4165.9800000000005s)]
*  I've shot a turkey. It's not, it's not the same thing. Turkeys are cool. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4169.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They're delicious. It's great. It's fun. They are delicious. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4172.76s)]
*  It's not the same thing. Yeah. Not by any stretch of the imagination. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4176.04s)]
*  That's why they call it the poor man's elk hunting. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4179.200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's just cause you call them in. That's all. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4182.04s)]
*  That's where the interactive nature of it, I think is what people get addicted to. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4184.400000000001s)]
*  And that can be similar to the elk hunting experience too. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4187.96s)]
*  Well, I think it's just elk is just a majestic animal too. When you see them, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4190.6s)]
*  just the fucking antlers are insane. Yeah. And they're just massive. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4194.56s)]
*  And it's just so delicious too. The meat is so good. Yeah. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4199.06s)]
*  I've had some buddies, you know, cook for me that have got one and it's, yeah, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4204.5s)]
*  I'd love to get one of my own for sure. Yeah. Real nice. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4208.14s)]
*  The problem with elk hunting is it's in the mountains and it's a lot of hoofing. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4210.78s)]
*  Yeah. And not a lot of 300 pound guys elk hunting. You know what I mean? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4216.98s)]
*  I can't imagine. Unless they're six, eight or something. You know what I mean? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4220.02s)]
*  Right. Like Derek. Yeah. It's, uh, it's not easy. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4223.78s)]
*  It's the hardest in terms of like just a physical workload. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4228.639999999999s)]
*  It's also part of it though, right? It's part of like how much work you put into [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4232.599999999999s)]
*  it to get this thing out of it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4235.599999999999s)]
*  When I became friends with cam Hanes, that's where I was so baffled. It's like, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4237.48s)]
*  why does this guy running all the time? Yeah. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4240.36s)]
*  Tells me he runs all the time for hunting. I'm like, what? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4242.5599999999995s)]
*  Like how does that make any sense? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4244.92s)]
*  And then you go hunting for the first time in the mountains. You're like, Oh, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4246.44s)]
*  this is why. Oh, and I thought I was in pretty good shape. Yeah. I was like, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4250.04s)]
*  Oh my God, this is crazy. It's like Steve, dude. That guy can just go. Yeah. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4253.32s)]
*  I mean, he just can just mountain go. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4257.52s)]
*  He's been doing that his whole life too. Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4260.46s)]
*  Puts in so many hours a year in the mountains. Yeah. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4262.740000000001s)]
*  That Buffalo book he wrote some believe it was very good. Yeah. So good. Yeah. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4266.38s)]
*  He got the rights to that luckily. And now really re released it with his audio. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4270.14s)]
*  Cause when he first sold it, um, they had an actor read it, you know, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4275.34s)]
*  like some worse over actor was terrible. Yeah. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4279.740000000001s)]
*  So he re recorded it in his own voice, which is amazing. Yeah. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4282.660000000001s)]
*  But that's a thing that happens with a lot of like the first time authors is [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4286.74s)]
*  they don't trust you to read it. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4291.5599999999995s)]
*  They want to get someone who's some sort of a professional. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4293.66s)]
*  He lost that argument and then as time went on and he became more prominent and [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4296.92s)]
*  famous, then he was able to acquire the rights through meat eater and then [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4300.36s)]
*  re release it, which is excellent. Yeah. That's, that's awesome. Man. That guy, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4304.5199999999995s)]
*  that, um, that, that, I don't know if it was like a book, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4308.36s)]
*  like that close encounters thing. Have you listened to that? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4312.16s)]
*  Dude, that is chilling. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4317.2s)]
*  That guy that goes through the like hypothermia thing, dude, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4319.12s)]
*  is one of the most intense things I've ever listened to, man. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4323.08s)]
*  The one of the most intense stories he's ever told me was when they were on a [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4326.24s)]
*  Fog Knack Island. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4329.76s)]
*  That is the grizzly bear grizzly bear attack. Yeah. Man. Yeah. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4331.48s)]
*  I was like on the edge of my seat when they were telling us that's foot bear [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4335.679999999999s)]
*  running through their camp. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4339.719999999999s)]
*  I can't even claim their elk and they didn't know yet. Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4342.2s)]
*  They shot it the day before they came back to pack it out. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4346.14s)]
*  And they're sitting there eating sandwiches. Yeah. Yeah. No one has a gun on them. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4350.22s)]
*  Yeah. And this thing just comes running through the camp. What'd they say? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4353.18s)]
*  Yannis like hit it with a like walking stick from like five feet away. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4356.06s)]
*  Yeah. It was like, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4360.58s)]
*  he said he could like feel the jaws snapping as it ran past him. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4361.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. That freaked me out. Dirt myth was on its back. Yeah. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4366.78s)]
*  Something happened and like he got knocked onto the back of this thing and [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4370.66s)]
*  rode it for like 10 yards. They ran like intersecting paths. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4375.66s)]
*  Like he was running away from the bear. The bear was running away from them. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=4380.08s)]

*  cause the Columbia people traveled separate from us, right? So we're like, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5043.1s)]
*  we're just hoping that this guy's like taking us to the right place. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5047.740000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, like we pull into this, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5051.22s)]
*  just like town along the coast. And when I say town, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5052.860000000001s)]

*  It's like, there's the beat, there's the house and there's like the dunes. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5071.58s)]
*  And then like you walk through the dunes and there's the beach. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5075.22s)]
*  These houses were on the beach, bro. Like they were on the sand, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5077.86s)]
*  like all the furniture in the house was poured concrete with cushions on it. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5081.82s)]
*  So if like the hurricane were to come, it would just, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5086.38s)]
*  you'd just put new cushions on it. The house would still be there. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5089.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? It was like, and we walk in and it's like, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5091.94s)]

*  there and they're whipping up, like they're making homemade tortilla chips. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5099.58s)]
*  They're cutting the tortillas and like dropping them in the oil, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5102.68s)]
*  chopping up, like making homemade guac and stuff. I'm like, Whoa, this is sick. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5106.16s)]

*  There's houses kind of along the beach, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5129.76s)]
*  but you can tell that not all of them are like occupied all the time. Right. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5132.22s)]
*  And it's not like these houses you think of in the States, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5136.06s)]
*  like they're not these big palatial like beach homes like we have. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5139.1s)]

*  Which is why I named the podcast that Joe Rogan experience. Okay. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5767.8s)]
*  So Hendrix would have to be on the list because it's just something about the [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5772.72s)]
*  Hendrix to me has always been like a magical figure. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5776.04s)]
*  There's something about him that just embodied the spirit of the rebelliousness [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5779.24s)]
*  of the 1960s. This shift from the fifties to the sixties. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5784.42s)]
*  And the ex army guy, I mean, that was the whole, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5788.179999999999s)]
*  he was like a micro cause like a, you know, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5791.9s)]
*  he was like a synopsis of the whole era like embodied in like a human being. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5794.34s)]
*  Also unparalleled genius on the guitar. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5798.7s)]
*  No one had ever seen anything like that before. Yeah. Without a doubt. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5802.86s)]
*  Like Eric Clapton famously talked about the first time he saw Jimi Hendrix play [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5805.98s)]
*  and he's just wanting to throw his guitar into the fire. Like what the fuck am I [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5810.0599999999995s)]
*  going to do? Right? Yeah. Jesus Christ. You know, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5814.04s)]
*  I used to do a news radio, the sitcom with Phil Hartman. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5816.96s)]
*  And when Phil Hartman was young, he worked as like, um, like a roadie. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5820.16s)]
*  And you know, he worked for, I think it was the whiskey, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5824.88s)]
*  pretty sure it was the whiskey. And so he was there, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5827.5599999999995s)]
*  I believe he was 18 when Hendrix was playing and his job was to make sure that [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5829.92s)]
*  the speakers didn't fall into the audience, like the way it was set up. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5836.24s)]
*  So he had a stand there like right by the stage while Hendrix was right there [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5840.5s)]
*  playing in front of him. That's wild. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5846.54s)]
*  He said it was the most fucking surreal experience of his life. Just see, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5848.86s)]
*  oh, I can't imagine. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5852.78s)]
*  Whale at the whiskey on sunset. Just crushing. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5853.94s)]
*  He's a kid just like standing there like just with his hands on the speaker, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5858.3s)]
*  making sure it doesn't fall over. That's just, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5862.1s)]
*  it's just hard to even fathom that. Hard to fathom. Yeah. So Hendrix, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5864.98s)]
*  Hendrix for sure. Um, my God, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5869.82s)]
*  it's tough. It's a tough question. You only have five. It's hard. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5876.36s)]
*  I'm a giant fan of classic rock. You know, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5879.92s)]
*  I really love Zeppelin and Pink Floyd and there's something about, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5882.0s)]
*  there's something about the music for me that is of that era of the [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5886.92s)]
*  1960s. Like I'm obsessed with 1960s cars. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5891.2s)]
*  I have a bunch of 60s muscle cars. They're my favorite. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5895.44s)]
*  I just, sometimes I go in my garage and just stare at them. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5899.1s)]
*  I just sit there for like an hour and just stare at them. I'll just pull up a [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5901.74s)]
*  folding chair and just stare at the car. There's just something about those things. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5905.3s)]
*  I mean, that's when I was born too. I was born in 67 and I feel like there's [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5909.42s)]
*  something about that, about going to high school, like when those cars had, [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5913.18s)]
*  you know, like you could kind of acquire those cars when you're 18. And it was, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5917.58s)]
*  you know, cause they weren't really that valuable back then, oddly enough. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5922.26s)]
*  Right. They were just kind of like the cars people had. Yeah. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5925.18s)]
*  You could get like a 1968 olds for like two grand, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5927.98s)]
*  like a really mint one. That's wild. Yeah. And it was just, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5933.16s)]
*  there's something about that era that to me symbolizes the shift in American [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5936.639999999999s)]
*  culture, the American culture that shifted from the, you know, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5940.759999999999s)]
*  the music and the culture of the 1950s to the 1960s, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5944.5199999999995s)]
*  the Vietnam war and the, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5947.66s)]
*  just a change of the society of the zeitgeist shifted and the drugs and the [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5948.98s)]
*  rebelliousness and the hippie movement and the anti-war movement and just the [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5954.44s)]
*  rock and roll was undeniable, you know? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5958.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, definitely doors. Yeah. It had that, it had, it had balls behind it, man. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5962.86s)]
*  It was like, and it was like, the music was made, you know, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5968.2s)]
*  it wasn't this commercialized thing, right? Like it wasn't like, [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5972.879999999999s)]
*  no one was thinking about it in that sense at that time. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5976.919999999999s)]
*  And maybe I'm insane for thinking that, but it just, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5979.5599999999995s)]
*  it feels like that someone who wasn't even born then who goes back and listens [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5982.14s)]
*  to that music, it has this like grit to it that just doesn't exist. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5985.68s)]
*  Go from Buddy Holly to Jimi Hendrix. Just do that. That's not that much time. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5991.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, you're talking about like the difference between like 2013 and today, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=5996.5s)]
*  the difference between 2013 music wise and today is not that much of a [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6000.78s)]
*  difference. It's just music. But country music it is. Is it? It is. Yeah. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6004.46s)]
*  I mean, you think about, Hey, I got a piss. Yeah, come back. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6009.68s)]
*  And we'll talk about the difference. I can imagine it gets wild. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6012.16s)]
*  Dude, I get, I'll get twisted dude on it. I get, I get, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6020.76s)]
*  I get mega anxiety guy, dude. Yeah. I get like, here's my thing. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6024.08s)]
*  Man, I used to love it, dude. And when I, when it's good, it can't be beat. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6028.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. Right. But I feel like as I got, so like it starts out, right? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6033.16s)]
*  Like you're in college. It's like, okay, 10 out of 10 times I'm loving this. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6036.820000000001s)]
*  Right. And then the years kind of went on and it was like, okay, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6042.22s)]
*  like one out of every 10 times it's not great for me. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6045.46s)]
*  And then like the years went on and it was like three times out of 10. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6048.66s)]
*  And now it's kind of this point where it's like nine times out of 10, dude, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6052.900000000001s)]
*  I'm like thinking I'm dying. I'm having a panic attack, dude. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6055.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's like, I just, dude, it, and I hate that cause it is like the, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6060.46s)]
*  in my opinion, one of the best things in the world. Yeah. And, but like, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6065.8s)]
*  for me, it's like, it is somehow like my brain has changed where it's like, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6069.16s)]
*  doesn't. Well, you have responsibilities now. Yeah. But it's like, I, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6074.04s)]
*  even then, I guess I don't even think it's that it's like, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6077.92s)]
*  it's almost like it's a chemical thing for me. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6080.08s)]
*  And like, I hate that so much because I, I did enjoy it so much. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6083.639999999999s)]
*  And it was like, it was such a great thing for me. Like when, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6087.4s)]
*  like creatively or like it just to relax, dude, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6091.9800000000005s)]
*  or like have a great time with my buddies, dude. And it's like, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6096.18s)]
*  I hate that I can't enjoy it anymore. And because I see other people enjoy it, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6098.9400000000005s)]
*  you just gotta power through. I know, but it's like, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6102.46s)]
*  it gets to this point where like be around the right people. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6105.02s)]
*  Even if I'm with the right people though, it's like, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6109.34s)]
*  it becomes like this thing or it's like, I suffer from like really bad, like, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6111.2s)]
*  really, really, really bad OCD, like horrible. Like in what way? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6115.900000000001s)]
*  Okay. So it's like this weird, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6120.719999999999s)]
*  almost like not even like necessarily probably considered like a legit, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6123.5599999999995s)]
*  like I would guess newer would be considered form and newer in medical terms [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6129.08s)]
*  because like the eighties is when like the first people were kind of exploring [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6134.04s)]
*  this type. It would be called like purely obsessional OCD, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6137.099999999999s)]
*  which is like, okay, so you think when I say OCD, what do you think of? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6141.959999999999s)]
*  Washing your hands too many times, touching things before you, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6146.04s)]
*  you have to touch things three times. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6149.06s)]
*  Or like straighten in the Howard Stern style OCD. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6150.34s)]
*  Right. Like you're like, everything's gotta be like this straight or like, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6153.82s)]
*  where everything's gonna be right. Right. So my thing is pure OCD is right. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6157.14s)]
*  Where there's these unanswered questions in your mind that can never be [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6162.42s)]
*  answered. And the ritual is trying to find an answer. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6167.74s)]
*  Like what kind of questions? Okay. So it could be like, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6173.42s)]
*  let's say you are super religious, right? And you love like at your core, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6175.82s)]
*  like your belief in God and Jesus or any religion really is the centered part of [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6180.74s)]
*  your life. Right. So one theme of it can be, you have a thought, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6187.48s)]
*  everybody has crazy thoughts that slip through their head every day and they [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6192.42s)]
*  come and go. It's like somebody walking by you on the street, right? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6195.44s)]
*  They walk by and they go, Oh, that was weird. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6198.639999999999s)]
*  I just had a thought about jumping into traffic. I don't want to. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6200.759999999999s)]
*  I don't even, that thought doesn't even affect me in any way. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6205.84s)]
*  It just comes and goes. It's like a weird thought. That's a symptom of my brain. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6209.04s)]
*  People like me become obsessed with the meaning of those thoughts and why they [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6212.799999999999s)]
*  entered our brain when really they don't mean anything. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6217.28s)]
*  So like someone that really loves God and that's a core part of their being is [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6220.16s)]
*  they would go, well, what if I hate God? And that thought just, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6224.32s)]
*  it's just a comes and it's gone as far as it can. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6228.08s)]
*  That thought in your brain triggers a flight or fight response. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6232.46s)]
*  So you get this mega adrenaline dump panic attack moment. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6238.26s)]
*  So then that gives it validity to your brain. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6242.54s)]
*  It says that this is something we need to be concerned about. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6245.740000000001s)]
*  So it starts sending that thought more and more and more. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6248.66s)]
*  And the obsession becomes, why did I have that thought? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6251.860000000001s)]
*  What does it mean? Do I really hate this thing? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6256.26s)]
*  And it essentially attacks the things that are [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6260.74s)]
*  essentially the antithesis of who you actually are. Right? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6265.0s)]
*  So a lot of people have like violent obsessions where they would [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6269.36s)]
*  have a thought of stabbing somebody. They don't want to stab anybody. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6274.2s)]
*  Really at the core of their being, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6278.2s)]
*  they're probably the most gentle soul in the world, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6279.5199999999995s)]
*  which is why the thought causes them anxiety. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6282.36s)]
*  And so then they become obsessed. Like they get on their phone and they're like, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6285.28s)]
*  why did I have this? Like, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6288.1s)]
*  what are the symptoms of being a psychopath or why am I like this or what did I [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6289.26s)]
*  do this? Like, and so these themes, when you have them, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6292.86s)]
*  they shift over time, but that period could be three, four, five, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6296.86s)]
*  six months at a time. And then you have another thought that's different, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6300.74s)]
*  a different theme, and it just switches like that. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6305.46s)]
*  And then you think back on the other one and you're like, that was so dumb. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6308.86s)]
*  I can't believe I worried about that. Now I'm worried about, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6311.4s)]
*  what if I'm schizophrenic and I don't know? [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6314.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6317.36s)]
*  And you're obsessed with this thing. And I've, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6318.2s)]
*  all my buddies know this about me and I'm not afraid to talk about it or anything, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6321.56s)]
*  but it's like, people ask me sometimes, like my buddies would ask me, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6325.56s)]
*  especially in high school is when it really kind of started for me. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6329.76s)]
*  And I think they would go, you know, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6332.72s)]
*  try to explain it to me. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6335.84s)]
*  And the only way I could explain to you how truly bad it is, right, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6336.92s)]
*  is if like, if someone like murdered my whole family, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6341.72s)]
*  I would rather than be free and live with what I had than go to jail. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6346.72s)]
*  That's how bad it is. Whoa. And that's like, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6352.8s)]
*  it's not an exaggeration in any way, shape or form. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6355.56s)]
*  I wouldn't wish it on anybody in the entire world. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6359.08s)]
*  So it just comes in waves and you can't control it. Yeah, pretty much. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6361.68s)]
*  I had a friend who was, he had that and he would get these thoughts that he [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6365.52s)]
*  couldn't stop and he didn't know why. And he would have panic attacks. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6370.54s)]
*  And he's a comic and he was doing warmup for the Cosby show. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6374.1s)]
*  You know, warmup is you kind of like telling kind of mild jokes and you're [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6379.46s)]
*  explaining the scene and you're just keeping everybody engaged because the [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6383.400000000001s)]
*  process of filming a television show is pretty, it's pretty arduous. Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6387.580000000001s)]
*  There's a lot going on, you know, and sometimes there's downtime. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6391.900000000001s)]
*  And during that downtime, he would, you know, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6395.14s)]
*  do kind of stand up for the crowd and work. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6397.38s)]
*  And he gets this thought in his head that says, don't say the N word. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6399.92s)]
*  That would be exactly the same thing. Like that would be exactly the same. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6405.16s)]
*  He gets this thought and it's paralyzing. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6409.28s)]
*  He's terrified he's going to say it. And he can't talk. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6412.84s)]
*  So his, his mouth is quivering. He's trying to tell his jokes, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6419.48s)]
*  but he's not thinking at all about what he's saying. So now he's bombing. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6423.16s)]
*  So he's bombing and the entire time his mind is screaming at him, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6427.02s)]
*  you're going to say it, you're going to say it. Don't say it. Don't say it. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6432.54s)]
*  And he just has a full on panic attack while he's doing. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6436.54s)]
*  So that would be, that would be like a, I've never had that particular theme. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6441.22s)]
*  Like there is a theme of that. Like people who, like your brain's like, [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6445.18s)]
*  you're about to say this thing, don't say it. And then you're like, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6448.900000000001s)]
*  why would I think that? I don't want to say that. Or I don't think that way. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6451.9400000000005s)]
*  That's not who I am. And like that makes your brain send it more. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6454.88s)]
*  So it's like a broken circuit. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6458.44s)]
*  It's a broken circuit for sure. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6460.4s)]
*  And you like being afraid of it is what perpetuates it. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6462.2s)]
*  So like the only answer to it is living with the uncertainty. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6467.84s)]
*  Like let's say I'm your friend in that moment. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6473.0s)]
*  The only way you can talk yourself out of it is you go, you know what? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6475.72s)]
*  I might say it. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6480.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6482.32s)]
*  That's how you talk yourself out. Like I might, I might jump in front of this truck. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6483.94s)]
*  For sure. I'm like, you know what? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6487.0199999999995s)]
*  I could jump in that front of that truck if I want to. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6488.5s)]
*  And that's how you know I'm okay with it. I'm okay with that. I'm not going to, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6491.58s)]
*  but if I wanted to, I could, and I might, and that's okay. And like, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6495.0199999999995s)]
*  but you like, I can't even explain to people. It's like, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6498.38s)]
*  because it's so weird to imagine like having, like, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6501.46s)]
*  if you had a thought of like, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6505.26s)]
*  I'm going to reach across this table and just deck you one and I don't want to. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6506.34s)]
*  And I'm afraid of that. But if I go, you know what? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6510.76s)]
*  I could, and I have to be okay with that. Wow. Like it's almost like a paradox, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6514.360000000001s)]
*  right? You're almost tricking the disorder because then if you don't care about [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6519.02s)]
*  it anymore, then your brain stops sending the thoughts. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6523.8s)]
*  Cause the thoughts are what's distressing. Yeah. Right. The, I, like, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6526.06s)]
*  the thoughts coming in continually are what stresses you out. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6529.56s)]
*  Cause the more you have them, you're thinking, well, that must be who I am. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6532.8s)]
*  I must be this violent criminal or I must be this. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6536.360000000001s)]
*  Must be that or whatever. I must not love my wife or it's all these things that [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6540.22s)]
*  can never be answered. Right. It's not like what's two plus two. Well, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6546.280000000001s)]
*  we all know that's four. These are all questions that really can, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6550.04s)]
*  there is no answer to them at all. And marijuana triggers those? No, not, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6553.84s)]
*  not really. I just think, I just think that like, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6558.320000000001s)]
*  it can't be something that's like, no. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6562.12s)]
*  And that's the thing is I'm not afraid of those thoughts at all. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6564.240000000001s)]
*  Like they don't bother me. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6567.2s)]
*  Because you become comfortable with the idea. Like it took me a decade to get. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6568.34s)]
*  Did you get counseling? Did you talk to people? [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6573.14s)]
*  A few times, not routinely, you know, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6576.14s)]
*  but I think counseling is almost paradoxical, right? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6579.0199999999995s)]
*  Cause the more you focus on it. Oh boy. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6581.54s)]
*  So it can become a weird slope because reassurance seeking from other people. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6585.58s)]
*  Like if I told my best friend, dude, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6591.74s)]
*  I just had this thought about shooting this guy, like tell me, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6592.98s)]
*  I don't want to shoot this guy. And then he goes, dude, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6596.0s)]
*  you're not going to shoot that guy. And I go, Oh God, thank God. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6598.5599999999995s)]
*  Then that you get addicted to the reassurance seeking, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6602.2s)]
*  which then makes the thoughts come more and more and more and more and more. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6604.679999999999s)]
*  Cause you're giving them attention. You're giving them attention. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6607.44s)]
*  You're giving them attention. And it's so strange, dude. And it's like, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6610.16s)]
*  I know dude, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6614.04s)]
*  that there's so many people that struggle with it and no one would ever know. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6615.48s)]
*  I could be having them right now and you'd have no clue. Wow. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6620.24s)]
*  I could be totally checked out of this conversation. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6623.8s)]
*  And it's almost like you're living two lives at the same time. It's freaky, dude. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6626.02s)]
*  And it's like, I wouldn't wish it on anybody, dude. I wouldn't. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6630.18s)]
*  And it's terrible. How often does it happen? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6633.52s)]
*  Now? Yeah. Almost never. Oh, but back then, I mean, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6638.18s)]
*  I would attribute it to par. I mean, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6642.860000000001s)]
*  majority I would attribute it to like me failing out of college probably. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6646.78s)]
*  Like it's like, don't even think you're going to be a loser. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6650.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't even want, no, no, no, no. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6652.94s)]
*  Like you don't even want to go out of the house cause you're on the bus to [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6654.48s)]
*  school and you're thinking about killing people. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6657.74s)]
*  So that's why you dropped out of college. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6659.599999999999s)]
*  I mean it attributed to my horrible grades without a doubt because it was like, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6662.0s)]
*  it was all like, I remember the new, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6666.36s)]
*  the new scream movie had come out like when I was like 21, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6668.879999999999s)]
*  this is around the time I started playing guitar and I was at my obsessions at [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6672.54s)]
*  that time were like violent obsessions and I would like the scream commercial [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6676.7s)]
*  would come on like to promote the movie and I would turn it off because I [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6682.179999999999s)]
*  didn't even want to see like anything like I wouldn't even play like violent [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6685.5s)]
*  video games, which is the wrong way. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6688.84s)]
*  That's the wrong thing because then avoidance and reassurance seeking are what [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6692.12s)]
*  make the thoughts more prevalent. It's such a paradoxical thing. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6696.08s)]
*  It's so strange, man. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6700.2s)]
*  Does anything help it? Like if you go for Ike or if you, you know, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6701.66s)]
*  it would. Yeah. I mean, the more you can go out and not just, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6705.38s)]
*  the more you hide from it, but do you get paralyzed by it? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6708.78s)]
*  Sometimes you can't go and do for sure. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6712.06s)]
*  But then it's the thing is like that you have to now, like if, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6715.3s)]
*  if I were to have it now, you just have to continue on. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6718.3s)]
*  And I just know now that if I have it, like it will end. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6721.38s)]
*  Do you have you ever got it when you're on stage? [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6725.14s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Oh yeah. No doubt. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6729.1s)]
*  And it's like you feel so trapped, man. You want to talk about feeling trapped. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6732.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're in an arena with 20,000 people in there and you're like having a [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6737.78s)]
*  full blown like, and you're singing this song. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6741.5s)]
*  And it's like, nobody would even know that. Wow. You know, but like that's, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6745.3s)]
*  yeah, that's a lonely feeling, dude. You know what I mean? But it's, I, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6750.14s)]
*  you know, I, I, I, if anything, I want to, you know, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6754.7s)]
*  I know that there's kids that are at home, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6757.94s)]
*  like dealing with this right now. And like, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6761.22s)]
*  I didn't even know what it was till I was probably 19 or 20 years old. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6765.86s)]
*  And I'd had it since I was probably 12. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6771.0199999999995s)]
*  And so you're just afraid, dude, you just don't, you can't explain to your parents. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6774.54s)]
*  They don't know what to do. They're like, I don't know what to do. Like, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6778.98s)]
*  it's just, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6783.0199999999995s)]
*  I can't imagine some kid at home going through this right now, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6783.74s)]
*  going through that right now. And like, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6786.74s)]
*  it's just so sad dude to me to know that there's people that deal with it. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6789.5s)]
*  And it's like that. It's such a, it's, and it's kind of obscure, right? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6793.86s)]
*  So it's not like this, it's not depression. Right. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6797.14s)]
*  It's not like the hyped up like, Oh, I have, you know, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6800.14s)]
*  I have depression or anxiety or whatever. It's like, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6805.14s)]
*  I always wonder with people that have things like that, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6809.0199999999995s)]
*  that are also great artists. I always wonder, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6813.18s)]
*  they run hand in hand. There's something about, yeah, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6816.34s)]
*  that like contributes to the depth of your art. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6818.9s)]
*  I think it's creativity, right? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6821.7s)]
*  So creativity can be a really great thing and a really bad thing in my opinion, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6824.02s)]
*  because I think the creative side of my brain that can create a song and a story [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6828.14s)]
*  from nothing, right? Like I could write a song about this, you know, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6833.46s)]
*  bronze skull you have here if I really had to. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6838.06s)]
*  And I could create a story that was at least mildly compelling about it, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6841.46s)]
*  but I can also do that with the thought of stabbing somebody that I don't want [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6846.18s)]
*  to have. Right. And my brain just runs with it. It's the same circuit, right? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6850.14s)]
*  Like my brain runs with that creativeness and that can be a really detrimental [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6854.740000000001s)]
*  thing to your mental health too. You know, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6858.780000000001s)]
*  did they ever try to give you medication for this in high school? Yeah. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6862.900000000001s)]
*  What'd they give you? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6867.06s)]
*  It would probably be now like, I guess like maybe he's like Zoloft maybe. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6869.42s)]
*  I'm not sure what the generic of that would be. So it's a SSRI. Yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6876.02s)]
*  It's an SSRI of some sort. And that, that, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6879.86s)]
*  it just didn't hit it for me, you know, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6886.46s)]
*  and that probably does work for a lot of people. It just never hit it for me. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6888.54s)]
*  Did it stop the thoughts? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6892.179999999999s)]
*  No. That's the thing. I don't know. Like I wasn't on it long enough. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6894.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, I was on it for a month and really then the terms of SSRIs, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6900.099999999999s)]
*  that's not even long enough for them to take effect, right? Like really, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6903.86s)]
*  you have to take them for what? Two or three months, I think, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6906.98s)]
*  for them to be fully going. Right? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6908.98s)]
*  So there is some sort of like serotonin dopamine imbalance thing going on [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6911.66s)]
*  associated with it. And I just choose to not go that route. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6916.0199999999995s)]
*  But I think if that route works for people, then they should do that. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6920.36s)]
*  But that just wasn't something that I was interested in because I feel like it [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6923.139999999999s)]
*  would have numbed like the creative aspect, the positive. Yeah. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6927.259999999999s)]
*  Or like anything that was left of like my positive life at that point. Yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6931.9s)]
*  I've heard people talk about Zoloft specifically in that regard where they're [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6936.5s)]
*  just like, it numbs them or nothing bothers them, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6941.62s)]
*  but nothing excites them either. They just flat. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6944.86s)]
*  It's just kind of, yeah, I wouldn't want to do that. And you know, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6947.54s)]
*  and I think, I think in some ways, I mean, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6951.54s)]
*  it's something probably sound nuts to say this, but I think in some ways, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6953.62s)]
*  my brain is kind of like that anyways now. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6956.74s)]
*  And I think that may be an effect of the disorder that I've had. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6960.26s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6963.86s)]
*  Like nothing really gets me through the roof excited or down in the, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6965.099999999999s)]
*  through the roofs, like in the dumps either. And I think, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6970.099999999999s)]
*  so you've like managed your mind to keep it in like a certain frequency. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6972.82s)]
*  I think, and I feel like it's a subconscious, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6976.46s)]
*  like almost defense mechanism of like having gone through like just these [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6979.46s)]
*  different things of that. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6983.74s)]
*  And that's bothered me a lot over the course of my career too, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6986.16s)]
*  because I, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6990.02s)]
*  sometimes I feel really guilty about not feeling the way I feel like I should [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6991.780000000001s)]
*  feel about certain things. Like in what way? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6996.34s)]
*  Like if I win a big award or if I get a number one song or like those things are [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=6999.3s)]
*  incredible and that's what I want to be doing. Like, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7006.620000000001s)]
*  that's why I started doing this, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7009.34s)]
*  but like I don't get that serotonin like dopamine hit off of those things. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7010.5s)]
*  Like I feel like, do you get that? I watch my colleagues do, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7015.1s)]
*  and I wonder when I watch it, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7018.26s)]
*  like I watched someone win an award, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7021.34s)]
*  like male vocalist of the year or at the CMAs or whatever, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7022.9400000000005s)]
*  and go up and accept the award. And they're like almost in tears. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7026.38s)]
*  Like I don't feel that way. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7030.46s)]
*  And that makes me feel really guilty and like that something's like wrong with [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7034.14s)]
*  me, you know, as is that makes sense? What I'm saying? You know, like, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7039.38s)]
*  like I think you watch movies your whole life and you feel like this is the way [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7044.34s)]
*  that people are supposed to feel about things. And like, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7048.26s)]
*  like sometimes I've, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7052.34s)]
*  and like I appreciate the scope of what's going on and what it means to me and my [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7053.26s)]
*  team. And like, I'm so like insanely proud of all those accomplishments, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7057.900000000001s)]
*  like insanely, like this is why I like do this. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7062.900000000001s)]
*  It's like to have achieved all of these great things, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7066.26s)]
*  but in that moment, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7069.3s)]
*  like it's not this like overflow of like joy and like tears and like, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7070.900000000001s)]
*  there's a few times in my life I felt that's when I got married to my wife. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7078.26s)]
*  So when my son was born, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7082.900000000001s)]
*  that's it dude. Like, and that's, I, and like, I felt no, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7090.14s)]
*  and like I feel like I miss out on a lot because of this disorder, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7095.18s)]
*  like because of the way my brain works or the way that it's [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7099.3s)]
*  defended itself or something. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7104.26s)]
*  And there's probably a bunch of science that says I'm dumb or that I'm just like [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7105.58s)]
*  emotionless weirdo. But like, I, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7108.62s)]
*  like I feel like I've been robbed of that, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7111.94s)]
*  of all these things like, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7115.38s)]
*  and maybe they all just seem trivial because of all the shit that I dealt with [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7117.26s)]
*  for so long with it. Like the battles I fought inside my own head. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7120.86s)]
*  I don't know. It's hard to really explain. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7126.34s)]
*  Like it's hard to explain because the only way I would know [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7128.46s)]
*  is if I could somehow or another be in your brain. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7133.46s)]
*  So like I'm trying to imagine that I can imagine it, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7136.14s)]
*  but I can't imagine living with it. Like you've lived with it and what you've, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7140.18s)]
*  the steps you've taken to sort of get your place, your mind into this place. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7143.54s)]
*  Yeah. Like I just, I'm just, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7148.34s)]
*  it's like I'm so thankful dude to just not be living in that [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7151.22s)]
*  mindset. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7155.82s)]
*  Do you have those positive thoughts when you create a new song? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7156.86s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But it's, and I love writing songs, man. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7161.219999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7165.74s)]
*  But maybe, I mean, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7166.58s)]
*  I don't get those feelings either for big things. It's very odd. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7169.7s)]
*  Okay. That makes me feel better. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7173.74s)]
*  Yeah. Like it's very odd. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7175.139999999999s)]
*  Does that ever bother you in the sense of like, do you, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7178.299999999999s)]
*  do you watch people go up? Like, let's say there's, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7181.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm not super familiar with the like comedic. We're like, is there an award? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7184.86s)]
*  No, no. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7189.06s)]
*  They ain't like, it doesn't seem like it. Right. But like, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7189.900000000001s)]
*  let's say there was, right? Let's, in a, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7193.9400000000005s)]
*  let's do like in the next reality over, right? Like, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7196.26s)]
*  let's say there's the Oscars for comedy, comedy Oscars, right? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7199.820000000001s)]
*  And you go up and it's like funniest son of a bitch in the world award. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7203.660000000001s)]
*  And that's the biggest thing in comedy, dude. You know what I mean? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7208.02s)]
*  Like all your heroes won it. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7211.02s)]
*  Yeah. I wouldn't be excited about that. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7212.780000000001s)]
*  Right. But, but imagine being in the crowd, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7215.06s)]
*  let's say you want it, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7218.379999999999s)]
*  let's say you want it, right? And let's say you want it last year. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7222.66s)]
*  And you're like, man, it just didn't feel like it was supposed to. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7226.339999999999s)]
*  And you're like, I love that I won that because I worked really hard and I want, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7229.339999999999s)]
*  that's something I want to achieve in your brain. You know that. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7233.82s)]
*  And you appreciate the shit of it. You have it in your house. It's awesome. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7236.98s)]
*  You're really proud of it. And the next year, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7240.5s)]
*  somebody else wins it and they get up, dude, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7243.9s)]
*  and they're pouring the tears, dude. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7246.0199999999995s)]
*  And they're like having this big, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7248.98s)]
*  like emotional outburst about winning this thing and how much it means to them. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7251.419999999999s)]
*  And then you're going, why didn't I do that? Why, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7257.0199999999995s)]
*  why didn't I feel that like rush? Like, was I robbed of that rush of emotion? [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7260.74s)]
*  Like I often wonder that about myself. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7265.98s)]
*  Like when I see my colleagues win things that I've even won and they can barely [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7268.7s)]
*  even talk to get through the tears. And I'm up there like, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7273.179999999999s)]
*  Hey man, this is so great. Like I love my wife and my team and like, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7276.139999999999s)]
*  everything's great. Thank you. Is that just me? I'm a different guy. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7280.54s)]
*  Yeah, you're just a different guy. I don't, [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7284.099999999999s)]
*  but that's the things I wonder dude about, about that. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7285.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, I don't get excited about things like that. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7290.259999999999s)]
*  I don't get excited about winning things. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7293.7s)]
*  I don't get excited about that kind of stuff. Like a great show, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7295.219999999999s)]
*  like even though like a sellout Madison square garden, standing ovation. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7299.7s)]
*  I'm like, that's great. Right. I'm not thinking, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7303.740000000001s)]
*  I don't think about it like these emotional big moments. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7306.38s)]
*  My focus is always on the thing I'm doing and that's what's important. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7310.820000000001s)]
*  And it worked. It's supposed to work. You worked hard to make it work. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7315.22s)]
*  Then you did it. Good. Get back to work. That's my mind. My mind is like, don't, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7318.46s)]
*  don't get all fucking excited about the fact that this was great. Right. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7323.3s)]
*  Don't get stupid. Go right back to work. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7327.26s)]
*  So my mind is always no matter what happens, whatever accomplishments, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7329.22s)]
*  my mind is always focused only on the work and very similar then man. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7333.26s)]
*  Yeah. Then that's, but I think it's a creative thing. I think so too. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7338.42s)]
*  Because what I get excited about, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7341.740000000001s)]
*  like I have this new bit that I wrote yesterday and I did it last night and it [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7343.14s)]
*  killed and I'm like, Oh, I got something. I got something. I got like a seed. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7346.66s)]
*  So for me, like, uh, bits are seeds and those seeds are like a divine [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7351.46s)]
*  gift of the universe. Right. Like whatever it is that creates creativity, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7356.3s)]
*  whatever it is, it creates an idea that, [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7361.54s)]
*  that enters into your mind and now you can give life to, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7363.3s)]
*  and then you become obsessed with it. That's what I get excited about. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7366.3s)]
*  I get excited about these moments and I get excited about when they work. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7369.22s)]
*  I get excited about making, but I know it's never excited for me. It's never, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7372.46s)]
*  I'm never like, I'm the man. I did it. It is never, [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7377.1s)]
*  never feel that. Yeah. And I feel like that because that's wasted energy. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7381.58s)]
*  And I feel like that kind of celebrating is like, come on, man, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7385.38s)]
*  you know what the fuck you're doing. You've been doing this forever. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7389.06s)]
*  Like this is what you do. Like you, yeah, it's a great show. That's fun. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7391.26s)]
*  It's nice to have a great show, but that's not what's important. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7395.18s)]
*  What's important is the thing. This fucking untold, how many people, [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7398.02s)]
*  million people that are into what you're doing, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7402.66s)]
*  like what you got to do is get back to work. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7405.06s)]
*  Like I have a massive responsibility can continue to create and to do the best [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7407.5s)]
*  I can, whether it's with podcasting or whether it's with, uh, [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7412.26s)]
*  doing standup or whether it's doing UFC commentary. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7416.780000000001s)]
*  I have like this massive responsibility to just do the best I can. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7419.42s)]
*  So that's all I think about is like the thing that I can control. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7424.1s)]
*  You become obsessed with the result as in the sense of like the process and the [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7427.5s)]
*  result. Right. And I'm the same way, dude. Like I, I just, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7432.02s)]
*  okay, so let me ask you this. I'm, I'm interested. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7438.22s)]
*  So you're obsessed with the result, right? So you go up, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7440.74s)]
*  you do your bit last night and it fucking crushes, dude, it slams. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7444.64s)]
*  You love it. Right. Everybody loves it. And you're like, I got some, [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7448.5s)]
*  are you in, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7454.74s)]
*  so after that ends and you're sitting in the green room and let's say, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7457.06s)]
*  or you finally get home and you're by yourself, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7460.66s)]
*  what is the thing that, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7464.06s)]
*  that keeps you shoving the shoving the needle in your arm, dude? [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7466.02s)]
*  Like what is it? The reaction and knowing that I've done it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7471.02s)]
*  I did it again. I did the joke. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7475.42s)]
*  I got the joke. That's the joke. No, it's not. It's almost not me. Right. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7477.58s)]
*  It's the thing. It's like, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7482.26s)]
*  I know that I'm the person who's in front of the keyboard who came up with these [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7484.26s)]
*  ideas and who write it down, wrote it on my phone. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7489.3s)]
*  And I'm the dude who's pacing around the green room, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7493.0199999999995s)]
*  trying to figure out which way to set it up. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7495.1s)]
*  And should I chop this part out or let me just get the bullet points and then [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7496.86s)]
*  just talk to these people and tell them what I think about this thing. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7501.42s)]
*  And the comedy is going to come out of that. Yeah. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7504.7s)]
*  It's just that it's never like me. It's always, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7506.86s)]
*  it's always focused on the thing. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7511.38s)]
*  And it's res but it's the fact that it resonates with someone else. Yes. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7513.98s)]
*  On, on such a grand scale. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7517.86s)]
*  If it resonates with me, it'll resonate with someone else. That's, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7519.62s)]
*  that's what I found. If I, as long as I'm honest about my approach, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7522.179999999999s)]
*  and as long as I'm like, what the fuck? Like if I think it's funny, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7525.7s)]
*  and I start thinking like about what's funny about it, right. Then I, [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7529.099999999999s)]
*  then the thing is just figuring out a way to get that into people's minds, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7533.98s)]
*  the smoothest, cleanest, funniest, sneakiest way. Right. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7538.74s)]
*  You know, and it's a process. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7544.0199999999995s)]
*  So the process is what's very exciting because the beginning is usually a little [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7545.38s)]
*  clunky because you're not exactly sure how you're going to say it. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7549.7s)]
*  And maybe I said it right last night, but I forgot how to say it right tonight. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7553.0599999999995s)]
*  And I fucked it up. And then I have to live with that. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7556.7s)]
*  And then the next day I have to start all over again. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7559.54s)]
*  And then I go over the notes and I go over the fucking recordings and I try to [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7562.3s)]
*  figure, but it's always the thing. It's never, it's never like, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7566.26s)]
*  look what I did. I fucking did it. I'm crying. Right. Zero. Right. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7570.74s)]
*  It's zero. Right. Yeah. Like even when I film specials, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7574.66s)]
*  even if I film a Netflix special and fucking kills, I'm like, okay, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7577.9400000000005s)]
*  we did it. And then when I put it out, I stay offline. I don't read reviews. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7582.06s)]
*  I'm like, I just gotta keep moving. Yeah. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7586.820000000001s)]
*  I'm concentrating on this thing that I'm doing. Yeah. That makes, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7588.66s)]
*  that makes me feel great. Cause I, I feel, I feel that same way, man. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7591.5s)]
*  But there's nothing wrong with freaking out too. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7596.18s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with going up there and crying. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7597.82s)]
*  And this is an amazing moment for you. And you've worked so hard for that. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7599.74s)]
*  I just think every individual creative person has a unique way of addressing [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7602.5s)]
*  ideas and the thing that you're in love with. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7608.02s)]
*  And with you, the thing you're in love with is music and you address that music [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7610.66s)]
*  and clearly it's working. Like your process creates amazing songs. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7614.66s)]
*  So there's something about this way you think where you don't get excited about [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7618.82s)]
*  things that keeps you in that moment. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7624.34s)]
*  And I think you're thinking about it as a negative, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7626.5s)]
*  but I think it's a superpower. I really do. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7628.34s)]
*  And I think it's one of the reasons why your songs are so good. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7630.9400000000005s)]
*  I think it's a part of your mind and it's, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7633.38s)]
*  it's just like you have this unique gift of your mind. It's a unique mind. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7635.38s)]
*  There's no one else like you. You are you. And that, that's, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7639.58s)]
*  that's what's coming out. And that's why, that's why, like the, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7642.74s)]
*  the award shows are bullshit. All these people clapping on cue and like, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7646.5s)]
*  why would I get excited about it? It's the same thing has already happened. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7650.54s)]
*  The music is affected when people are listening to one of your songs in their [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7653.9400000000005s)]
*  car and they start crying. That's what's up. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7658.26s)]
*  That's the award. That's the fucking award, man. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7662.38s)]
*  And you're not going to be there for that. You're not even going to be there for that. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7665.34s)]
*  The beauty of it is when you are there for that is, is that a show, right? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7669.38s)]
*  Like if you get that one person out of 60,000 or whatever now that we're doing [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7673.219999999999s)]
*  these stadiums, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7679.099999999999s)]
*  it's like that makes it to the front row and they want to hear this one song [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7680.34s)]
*  because it means so much to them and you play it and you see them, dude, [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7685.26s)]
*  I've had many, many, many nights where it's like, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7691.179999999999s)]
*  I have one song in particular that's called, even though I'm leaving, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7694.62s)]
*  and it's a song that essentially starts out with like a dad talking to his [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7697.74s)]
*  son saying like, Oh man, like you're scared of the, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7702.94s)]
*  I know there's not any monsters under the bed kind of thing. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7706.0599999999995s)]
*  And like I'm just down the hall, you know, and I'm leaving, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7708.7s)]
*  I'm not going nowhere. Right. And next verse is, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7711.7s)]
*  then it's the son and he's going off to war. Right. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7714.62s)]
*  And the hook changes to, you know, even though you're leaving, [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7718.46s)]
*  I'm not going nowhere. You know, I'll be here when you get back kind of thing. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7722.86s)]
*  And then the last verse is the dad passing away. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7726.179999999999s)]
*  And it's like, Hey man, like even though I'm leaving, I'm not going anywhere. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7730.74s)]
*  You know, and like, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7734.74s)]
*  there's been many nights where like I used to see that person that's connected [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7736.78s)]
*  with that, like that's lost their dad. Right. And they're there. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7740.74s)]
*  And you're there right in your face, man. And they're just like, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7744.14s)]
*  there's three or four people on them. Just, you know, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7747.02s)]
*  and they're just weeping dude uncontrollably. And it's like, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7750.94s)]
*  it's powerful, dude. I mean, that stuff is like, they're, I mean, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7756.18s)]
*  that's powerful stuff, man. And that's, that's, that's the reason you do it. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7760.26s)]
*  That's it. That's why you do it. That's why I get excited about awards, man. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7763.9800000000005s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with you because there's nothing that's, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7767.780000000001s)]
*  there's nothing that speaks to me like that does. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7770.54s)]
*  That's also why it's so good, man. That's why it's so good. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7774.5s)]
*  The reason why you have this thought process behind it is like the end result. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7778.1s)]
*  Yeah. It's just, you want to make people feel something. Yeah. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7783.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, you want to make them feel this, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7787.7s)]
*  whether it's a cathartic thing or it's like, you know, [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7792.5s)]
*  like even songs that maybe are mega sad, it's like, [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7795.74s)]
*  there's something cathartic about like basking in sadness. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7800.62s)]
*  I think too, sometimes like very, something very attractive, right? Like, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7804.179999999999s)]
*  like people, it's like, sometimes you hear like, well, you know, you know, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7808.46s)]
*  pull yourself out of it kind of thing. But like, I think there's an, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7811.46s)]
*  that's an important part of the, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7814.26s)]
*  some sort of process of life is if you get your heart broken or a loved one [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7816.38s)]
*  passes away, like that. Yeah. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7820.820000000001s)]
*  Inherent sadness is like part of the process, right? And it's like, [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7823.18s)]
*  that's such a powerful like human emotion to me. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7827.780000000001s)]
*  Like it's just- To everyone. Yeah. Yeah. To all the people who feel. Yeah. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7832.66s)]
*  It's that's why people love those sad songs. I mean, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7836.14s)]
*  it's not that they want to be sad. They don't want to listen to some, [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7839.18s)]
*  Oh, I'm too happy today. Let me listen to Luke Combs and get, start crying. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7842.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. But it's like, they want to hear this, put this song on. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7846.179999999999s)]
*  That's almost like reaffirming this feeling. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7849.62s)]
*  It just resonates with human emotion and feeling and thought and the [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7852.7s)]
*  appreciation of people when they are there. You know, [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7857.46s)]
*  that's part of the sorrow is the backside of it is the appreciation of the people [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7860.0599999999995s)]
*  that are in your life that you love. Yeah. It's like, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7864.78s)]
*  you don't feel one without the other. It's like the two of them, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7866.78s)]
*  they go hand in hand at the end of the yang of the world. You know, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7869.86s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with your thought process in regards to that [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7874.0199999999995s)]
*  at all. I really don't. I don't think you're robbing yourself of anything. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7876.5s)]
*  I don't. I think you're, you're getting the juice out of the right spots. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7879.86s)]
*  That's good. That's what I feel good, man. Cause I, I worry about that. I, I, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7884.42s)]
*  you know, I think about that a lot and that's not, you know, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7888.299999999999s)]
*  that's not something I brought up to, to a lot of folks really almost ever, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7890.139999999999s)]
*  you know, but I often, I wonder that a lot, you know, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7894.099999999999s)]
*  I spent a lot of time worrying about that. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7897.0199999999995s)]
*  The more crazy things happened to me, the more they're like steady, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7898.82s)]
*  like a normal thing. It's a base level. It's like everything stays normal, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7902.459999999999s)]
*  but it's not that then it's like, I worry, it's just like, well, it's not, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7906.66s)]
*  I don't want this to be expected either. It's not expected. It's just, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7909.379999999999s)]
*  you're like, you're comfortable with it, right? Yeah. Just like, all right. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7913.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. This is what I'm doing. Like this is the kind of level of stuff I'm doing, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7917.86s)]
*  like talking about planning a stadium tour is like a normal thing. Yeah. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7921.139999999999s)]
*  It's normal, but it is normal. It's normal for you. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7925.18s)]
*  What's normal for you is like mind blowing for 21 year old Boog to imagine that [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7928.18s)]
*  one day you'd be that guy. Yeah, no doubt. Doing a fucking stadium tour. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7932.780000000001s)]
*  It's like, it's crazy, man. It's like not even like, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7937.26s)]
*  just doesn't even seem like possible. Right. Right. Yeah. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7942.820000000001s)]
*  Cause it's not normally, you know, that's why it's so crazy to you, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7946.22s)]
*  but that's you have the right approach. Cause if you were like, yeah, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7950.34s)]
*  I'm the fucking man, I'm out here doing a fucking stadium tour. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7953.06s)]
*  I'm the fucking man. Right. That's like the, [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7956.620000000001s)]
*  that's the opposite of your creative process. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7959.740000000001s)]
*  That's the opposite of the frequency that your mind is on when it's making these [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7962.540000000001s)]
*  things that resonate with people's real feelings. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7967.38s)]
*  I just try to stay so rooted in like humility. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7970.620000000001s)]
*  Like that's been such a huge part of like, I think like, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7973.780000000001s)]
*  like how me and my whole team have like gotten where we are is like, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7978.38s)]
*  like I just want people to know like how like grateful I am for all of it. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7984.02s)]
*  Right. It's like, it's not like I am 1% of the, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7990.46s)]
*  of the puzzle, dude. You know what I mean? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7995.620000000001s)]
*  Like I'm the guy that gets to sit in here and talk with you, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=7997.820000000001s)]
*  but the 99% of everything else that's going on is like work that's done by [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8002.1s)]
*  someone else other than me, dude. Like, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8006.34s)]
*  and I feel like that whole part of the process is like lost in like the idea of [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8009.1s)]
*  like celebrity, right? It's like me and you are just, we're one guy, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8013.42s)]
*  but we're a co we're, we may be, maybe we're a bigger cog in the wheel, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8018.14s)]
*  right? But you take that one cog out or any cog out and it doesn't work. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8023.34s)]
*  Yes. Right. It's like, there's a team and I'm sure you have a team of folks that [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8030.54s)]
*  propel your success because there's not enough time in 10 lives to do all the [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8035.58s)]
*  things that's necessary for your stuff to go on or my stuff to go on. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8042.660000000001s)]
*  Like there's so many folks involved in that, you know, and like, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8046.740000000001s)]

*  with that, like, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8057.46s)]
*  don't just tell me yes to everything and like that are willing to challenge me [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8059.14s)]
*  on things and like say, Hey man, is this the right decision? [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8062.82s)]
*  Or I don't love this song or like, why would we do this thing? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8065.86s)]
*  Or like, why don't we think about this? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8070.7s)]
*  Like I've always tried to keep it this open thing of like me and like people [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8072.219999999999s)]

*  people, I think sometimes lose that they become so shielded in the idea of [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8084.799999999999s)]
*  celebrity, which is like, they got a security guy, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8090.68s)]
*  so nobody on their team, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8094.2s)]
*  like they might not even know this guy that works for them at all. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8095.7s)]
*  They don't even know that guy's name and he's worked for him for five or six [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8099.76s)]
*  years at all. Doesn't even know him, you know? And like, to me, it's like, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8103.360000000001s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8114.0s)]
*  But like I'm friendly with everybody that's out on the road with me and like I [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8115.12s)]
*  want people to know that like I'm approachable, you know, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8119.32s)]
*  like we can talk about something. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8123.2s)]
*  Like I think that's so crucially important to like the overall success of the [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8124.92s)]
*  thing, because if I show up at a venue, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8129.5199999999995s)]
*  the only impression that 99% of the people working in that venue will get to me [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8133.04s)]
*  is someone that works for me. Right? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8137.719999999999s)]
*  So if everyone on my team is rude, then what are they going to think about me? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8140.92s)]
*  Of course they're going to go, well, this guy must be a jerk. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8145.5599999999995s)]
*  Dude, this attitude that you have though is why you're, why people love you. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8149.24s)]
*  I mean, it's why it resonates like this, [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8154.04s)]
*  the to keep from being captured by celebrity and [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8155.599999999999s)]
*  stardom because a lot of people do because it's a shield. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8160.0s)]
*  You put that shield up to shield you from the thoughts of [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8163.48s)]
*  uncertainty and insecurity and whether or not you're worthy and whether or not [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8168.08s)]
*  you can keep doing it. You know, with a lot of people, it's like, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8172.44s)]
*  you start doing, but can I keep doing it? Do I still have it? Like, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8175.08s)]
*  are my new songs any good? Am I new jokes? Any good? It's the same kind of thing. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8179.12s)]
*  And it's, you're just thinking about it the right way, [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8182.599999999999s)]
*  but it's not something that anybody could teach you because nobody gets to be [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8185.24s)]
*  famous. It's a small, tiny sliver of the population. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8188.44s)]
*  And then to be famous for doing something that resonates with people and like [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8192.56s)]
*  they worship you, they're fucking listen to your song a hundred times in a row. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8197.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's a thing that no one is going to be able to explain to you [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8200.72s)]
*  because they, like you could talk to a psychologist about it and they're [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8205.44s)]
*  dealing with, you know, theory. They don't, right. They have never experienced that. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8207.960000000001s)]
*  They don't know what it's like to stand on stage in front of 60,000 people and [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8211.76s)]
*  only you do very few people do. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8214.720000000001s)]
*  And it's up to you because you are the guy that's holding the microphone and [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8217.36s)]
*  playing the music. You are the guy that has to navigate that road and you're [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8222.12s)]
*  doing it. I think the right way, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8226.4s)]
*  the way you're handling it with humility and the way you're handling it with [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8227.880000000001s)]
*  genuine appreciation and just being a real person, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8230.960000000001s)]
*  you can keep that going. Guys have kept that going. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8234.480000000001s)]
*  And that's actually something that's rewarded in country music, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8237.08s)]
*  which I think is great because in some, some styles of music, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8240.0s)]
*  it's like rewarded that you become untouchable. You become sure that you become [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8244.08s)]
*  this unapproachable, untouchable, don't make eye contact. He's a genius. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8249.12s)]
*  He's going to walk into the room and everybody get out of the way. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8253.08s)]
*  And if he picks up the guitar, everybody stopped talking, you know, like that, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8255.6s)]
*  that kind of psycho thinking like that can, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8259.36s)]
*  that can pollute your mind and people get very [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8262.880000000001s)]
*  captured by that. And we've seen it many, many, many, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8267.880000000001s)]
*  many times with rock stars, with movie stars. It's just the, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8271.400000000001s)]
*  the thing that you have given into is so overwhelmingly odd [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8276.04s)]
*  and so few people experience. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8281.320000000002s)]
*  And it just does not resonate with any normal human emotions. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8282.76s)]
*  It's so strange that everybody knows who you are and you don't know who they are. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8287.039999999999s)]
*  And you just, this is the life you live, but it's up to you, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8291.119999999999s)]
*  because you're the rare traveler that's gone down that road that far, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8294.519999999999s)]
*  the rare one, it's up to you to navigate that road. And if you can do it, [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8298.68s)]
*  a young artist can also see you do it for sure. And they can go, Oh, [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8303.199999999999s)]
*  look, well look how fucking Sturgill Simpson. So cool. He's fucking huge. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8307.439999999999s)]
*  Like, how do I stay cool? Like I got, that's what I aspire to. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8311.32s)]
*  I don't aspire to be in a Diva and have everybody throw rose petal petals at my [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8314.6s)]
*  feet. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8318.92s)]
*  I aspire to be that cool motherfucker that can hang out with the sound guy and [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8319.4s)]
*  it is cracking jokes with the bus driver, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8323.56s)]
*  someone who's just a normal person who just by some strange circumstance, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8327.56s)]
*  the rarest of rare moments in life, you wind up being that person. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8332.2s)]
*  Yeah. I just think about it's like, [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8337.0s)]
*  I can't tell you like how many beers I shotgunned in college. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8339.68s)]
*  And like now I can shotgun a beer and like 50, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8344.76s)]
*  60,000 people are like stoked about it. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8348.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's awesome. Like pretty awesome. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8352.84s)]
*  I did seven or eight of these a night for years, dude. Years. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8355.16s)]
*  I might do what I heard. We were talking, you went to the bathroom. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8359.6s)]
*  I was talking about it. That's what got me thinking of my shotgun. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8361.800000000001s)]
*  I might do one. I might do one. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8364.640000000001s)]
*  We get the fucking, the freedom funnels here. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8366.2s)]
*  I might just do one out straight out of the can. I might just go to your knife. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8368.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do it. I'll start it though. This way. Oh, you with teeth? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8371.84s)]

*  It's not a speed. This is not a speed thing. Right. It's like, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8390.52s)]
*  it is with the funnel, the freedom funnel. It goes right to your brain. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8393.640000000001s)]

*  I wouldn't bet a lot of money on that. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8402.28s)]
*  I mean, it's possible. I think for sure. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8404.84s)]
*  There's only one way to find out, sir. That's true. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8407.48s)]

*  star for him, because he was such a destroyer, he had just like seek and destroy [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8563.759999999998s)]
*  style. Yeah. He was so exciting. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8568.439999999999s)]
*  When he every one of his fights was a fucking chaotic experience. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8571.08s)]
*  It was man. I just hit like hit the him and Randy trilogy, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8574.64s)]
*  dude. The him and Tito thing. It was like, those were the, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8579.119999999999s)]
*  and I remember watching like like Stefan Bonner, Forrest Griffin, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8583.199999999999s)]
*  like that was just a war bloodbath. Like, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8587.08s)]
*  and I just became like obsessed obsessed with it, dude. Like it's so, [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8590.119999999999s)]
*  it's just so primal dude that I, I couldn't love it anymore, man. Like I, [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8595.08s)]
*  I'm just been to a live event. I have not. Oh, you got to go. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8599.6s)]
*  To so bad. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8603.64s)]
*  Tell me when, tell me where you want to go. We'll hook it up. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8604.4s)]
*  So bad, dude. Okay. Like, okay. So here's me out. What? Okay. What's the, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8606.64s)]
*  what's the next title fight that I, you think I should see in person? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8610.8s)]
*  Well, I would say this weekend, but it's in London, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8613.96s)]
*  Leon Edwards versus Kamaru Usman. The rematch. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8616.96s)]
*  That fight was crazy, dude. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8620.119999999999s)]
*  One minute to go. Leon launches the greatest head kick of all time. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8623.32s)]
*  It dude, that he, the way he fainted that punch, dude, to get him to duck into it. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8627.48s)]
*  Dude, I remember screaming. We were at, I was at, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8632.56s)]
*  look at this fight card to Justin Gagey versus Rafael Fazeev. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8636.08s)]
*  Rafael Fazeev is a fucking assassin. That is going to be a wild fight. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8640.04s)]
*  That is going to be a wild fight. Oh man. I'm just eat up dude. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8645.16s)]
*  That fight Leon Edwards and Kamaru Usman though. That's, that's like, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8651.880000000001s)]
*  that's for legacy. I mean, Usman is in my mind up into that fight is the greatest [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8655.800000000001s)]
*  welterweight of all time. And Leon Edwards lands that one head kick. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8660.08s)]
*  You're going over GSP. Yeah. I think, I think if they fight, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8664.039999999999s)]
*  that crushes me. I just think the level of competition he faces higher. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8667.88s)]
*  You think so? Yeah. But it's just because GSP was so good. He raised the bar. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8673.56s)]
*  He raised it to the level it's at now. Yes. Right. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8678.72s)]
*  But I think if you look at GSP's victories, I mean, he beat some very good guys, [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8681.68s)]
*  but I think the guys, Kamaru Usman beat Colby Covington. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8685.88s)]
*  You know, Jorge Masvidal, Tyron Woodley. I think they're better. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8689.960000000001s)]
*  I think Masvidal's GSP level. Yeah. Really? Yeah. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8694.28s)]
*  I think if Masvidal was around during that time, [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8698.4s)]
*  he would be dangerous for everybody. I think he's on another level, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8701.720000000001s)]
*  but I think everyone's on another level now. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8705.08s)]
*  I think like the Masvidal that knocked out Ben Askren, [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8707.6s)]
*  but that was one of the craftiest fucking moves everyone's ever done. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8710.24s)]
*  He ran out, he went sideways and then ran straight out of me. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8713.48s)]
*  Askren's instincts kicked in and he kneed him into the dark lands. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8717.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, man. Just one shot. Boom. Into the shadow realm. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8721.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's Masvidal. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8726.28s)]
*  I mean, he knocked out Eve Edwards with a fucking head kick back when, [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8728.36s)]
*  back in the day. He's a killer, dude. No doubt. He's a fucking assassin. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8732.48s)]
*  He's a killer, dude. No doubt. He's an assassin. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8735.4s)]
*  He had bare knuckle fights in the Kimbo slice days. The Kimbo slice area. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8737.640000000001s)]
*  The YouTube video area. Masvidal's a gangster. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8741.720000000001s)]
*  And you know, he got, he lost to Kobe Covington, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8745.52s)]
*  but I feel like Kobe Covington, if it wasn't for Kamaru Usman, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8748.48s)]
*  would be the welterweight champion in the world. I think Kobe's that fucking good. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8751.92s)]
*  He's like, just Usman was so good. Up into that Leon Edwards head kick. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8755.52s)]
*  He, dude, he, it was like, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8760.48s)]
*  and I can agree with you watching like, and watching those later, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8763.84s)]
*  like after like, so the last fight, GSP lost, right? That's Sarah, right? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8768.92s)]
*  So he lost Sarah and then avenges the Sarah. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8775.4s)]
*  He should have lost to Johnny Hendrix in a lot of people's eyes. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8778.28s)]
*  You think so? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8781.56s)]
*  Yeah. Before he retired, a lot of people thought that was not a just decision. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8782.16s)]
*  I'd have to go back and rewatch it to see if I agree. But you know, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8786.12s)]
*  it was like the amount of fights that he had, the stress, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8790.6s)]
*  now don't get me wrong. He's absolutely one of the all time grades. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8795.12s)]
*  One of the all time grades. It's not, [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8799.56s)]
*  I'm not looking at it like saying like he wasn't as good as Kamaru Usman. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8801.720000000001s)]
*  I'm saying what he did was not as impressive as what Usman did. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8806.52s)]
*  If you look at him. Yes. If you look at the fact that, you know, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8812.84s)]
*  he got arm barred by Matt Hughes and Matt was in his prime. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8816.720000000001s)]
*  He got knocked out by Matt, Sarah, you know, it's, it's, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8820.960000000001s)]
*  and those are, those are, you know, [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8825.24s)]
*  Matt, Sarah was a murderous puncher and he, he took that guy for granted. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8828.04s)]
*  And Matt, Matt fucking caught him and Matt could do that to anybody. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8832.08s)]
*  And then eventually they had a rematch and he beat Matt up in front of the fans [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8835.2s)]
*  in Canada. And it was an insane event. Like he's an all time grade. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8840.12s)]
*  And I love him to death. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8843.68s)]
*  But I feel like if I look at the level of competition he faced and the level of [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8845.24s)]
*  competition Kamaru faced and what Kamaru did to those people, [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8849.76s)]
*  you got to understand Kamaru when he was coming up, [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8853.28s)]
*  no one would speak his name. He was the boogeyman. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8855.56s)]
*  Cause nobody wanted to fight him. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8860.8s)]
*  Nobody wanted to fight him when he was coming up. Everybody would say, you know, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8861.8s)]
*  give me this guy and give me that guy. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8865.199999999999s)]
*  And they were saying Kamaru Usman cause he was smashing [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8867.359999999999s)]
*  people and he was doing it with destroyed knees. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8872.279999999999s)]
*  That guy's mind is so strong. His fucking knees are so bad. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8876.64s)]
*  He goes downstairs backwards. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8881.72s)]
*  Let me, let me ask you something that is, has been intriguing to me. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8884.24s)]
*  And this is a fan who I like, [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8887.519999999999s)]
*  I would say I'm above casual fan, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8890.839999999998s)]
*  but below expert knowledge fan. Right. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8894.119999999999s)]
*  So I'm not a guy that watches every five pay per view. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8898.72s)]
*  I'm a guy that buys every pay per view. I watch a lot of the, you know, [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8903.24s)]
*  in between deals cause I enjoy it. Right. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8907.24s)]
*  But I'm not a guy who's like, Oh dude, he's, you know, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8911.32s)]
*  the way he got into that Doris is like, I can do some of that stuff, [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8914.4s)]
*  but I'm not expert level. So, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8918.08s)]
*  and I'm interested to hear your take. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8920.8s)]
*  And this is as a fan who doesn't know these guys at all and has nothing against [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8922.119999999999s)]
*  them. But I remember, [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8926.24s)]
*  I think in my mind is undeniably the goat as again, [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8929.16s)]
*  just above casual fan, John Jones. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8932.76s)]
*  John Jones is the goat. Now it's undeniable. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8934.64s)]
*  There was all this debate until he submitted serial gone and became the [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8938.0s)]
*  heavyweight champion. No one can fuck with that. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8941.32s)]
*  And serial looked kind of unbeatable up until the Francis fight. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8945.04s)]
*  Well, the Francis fight exposed one aspect of his game that you're never going to [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8949.640000000001s)]
*  beat John in. And that's the wrestling. And then everybody said, well, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8954.04s)]
*  he didn't know that Francis was going to wrestle him given Francis is not the [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8957.52s)]
*  caliber wrestler or even in the realm of John Jones. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8961.24s)]
*  John Jones been wrestling since he was 12 years old. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8964.6s)]
*  He took down Daniel Cormier, who's an Olympic level wrestler. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8966.960000000001s)]
*  There is not a guy in the world that can say [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8971.0s)]
*  that you could start wrestling at 29 years old. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8976.04s)]
*  I mean, [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8981.24s)]
*  you'd have to be the freakiest of freak athletes to be able to compete with that [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8981.84s)]
*  guy, to start wrestling when serial gone started wrestling. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8985.880000000001s)]
*  The gap is just too wide to cross. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8989.72s)]
*  So I think what I, what I'm, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8992.84s)]
*  what I was thinking is, and when I bring up John Jones, [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8994.12s)]
*  is I remember the first John Jones fight I watched was when he got [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=8996.44s)]
*  DQ'd against Matt Hamill. Okay. From the 12 to six. Yeah. Right. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9002.36s)]
*  That was my first experience with him. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9007.52s)]
*  The next thing I feel like I remember, [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9009.92s)]
*  and I may have seen some of his fights in between then, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9012.400000000001s)]
*  but is when he like beat up this guy [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9015.400000000001s)]
*  that was like trying to rob this lady, like the night of a fight. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9020.12s)]
*  That was the day he fought for the title. Right. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9023.12s)]
*  The day he fought for the title, [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9025.480000000001s)]
*  he chased down a guy who robbed someone and tackled him and held him until the [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9026.960000000001s)]
*  cops came. And then when he fought Shogun, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9031.560000000001s)]
*  it became the youngest ever UFC champion. Yep. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9034.720000000001s)]
*  So here's where I'm getting at is I remember, and I, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9037.720000000001s)]
*  and this is going to be an, just kind of, [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9040.28s)]
*  I'm interested in your take on this because I watched it happen with John [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9042.640000000001s)]
*  Jones. And I feel like I watched it happen with Komaru as well, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9046.0s)]
*  where it was like John and Komaru as they came up, right? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9049.56s)]
*  It's like John does this thing where he stops this robber and he wins the [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9053.96s)]
*  belt. He beats Shogun, who is this kind of like, you know, [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9058.84s)]
*  him and Leota were these kind of like, [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9061.8s)]
*  unfigurable guys to me as a fan at that time, right? Like guys, [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9063.56s)]
*  like how do you beat Leota Machida? You can't, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9068.08s)]
*  because you can't even touch the guy right at that time. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9070.16s)]
*  And they were like inherently these like good guys that [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9073.48s)]
*  everybody was rooting for. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9078.160000000002s)]
*  And then both of them became these like epically long [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9080.400000000001s)]
*  reign champions that then became sort of like villains. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9084.84s)]
*  Komaru was never a villain. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9089.76s)]
*  I feel like he is really to me as a fan again, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9091.52s)]
*  who doesn't know anything. And maybe it's the, the, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9095.720000000001s)]
*  it comes back to maybe the celebrity, like ego thing, [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9099.92s)]
*  like to the camera as a fan. Again, I've never met the guy. He's probably great. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9103.92s)]
*  But just as a cash watcher, I went from going, [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9108.36s)]
*  I'm rooting for this guy to then it be like the way he talks about [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9112.160000000002s)]
*  himself. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9116.68s)]
*  And I feel like John Jones was the same way to me is they became this like [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9117.6s)]
*  really like, [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9122.480000000001s)]
*  and then John got in all this kind of like turmoil-y stuff. Like, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9123.960000000001s)]
*  well, [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9127.880000000001s)]
*  I don't think you can compare the two and here's two reasons why one, [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9128.08s)]
*  have you ever seen Komaru talk? Like you ever seen Komaru on my podcast? [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9132.04s)]
*  He's one of the nicest, most down to earth, friendly, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9135.92s)]
*  smiley fun guys. There's what you're seeing is [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9139.8s)]
*  Komaru the destroyer, the dog, the dog is ready to go to war. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9145.119999999999s)]
*  That's the difference. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9149.6s)]
*  And that's what I was trying to ask is like signaling to all the other people, [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9150.44s)]
*  I'm going to smash you. Right. And that's what he's signaling. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9154.72s)]
*  And that's what I think I was asking is like, [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9158.0s)]
*  is that all just perceived by me or is that? [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9160.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9165.04s)]
*  I mean, it's part of the fun of being a fan, you know, [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9165.880000000001s)]
*  deciding what you like and what you don't like and personalities that you root [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9168.52s)]
*  for and personalities you root against. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9171.880000000001s)]
*  And sometimes you root against a guy and he wins you over cause he's so goddamn [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9173.68s)]
*  good. You're like, I wanted that motherfucker to lose, [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9177.0s)]
*  but he's the fucking greatest. Yeah. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9179.12s)]
*  John is very different than Komaru. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9181.0s)]
*  John is what I would describe is there's human beings [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9184.0s)]
*  that have different temperament and different minds and different mentality and [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9189.36s)]
*  a ruthless competitive drive that's almost terrifying to the ordinary [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9193.96s)]
*  person. That's John Jones. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9199.039999999999s)]
*  John Jones is a bad guy who's trying to be a good [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9201.199999999999s)]
*  guy. But that guy, if we were living a thousand years ago, [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9205.759999999998s)]
*  he would be on a horse with the biggest battle ax waiting in the back, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9210.8s)]
*  hacking heads off and everybody would be running. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9215.08s)]
*  And those people have always existed. These dominators have always existed. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9218.119999999999s)]
*  But John is like a genuinely sensitive, intelligent guy who's trying to do the [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9222.960000000001s)]
*  right thing, but he's a fucking conqueror. He's a fucking conqueror. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9228.16s)]
*  That's the thing that's inside of him that leads him to be the goat. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9233.4s)]
*  And without that, you don't get there. You don't get that. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9237.800000000001s)]
*  You don't get a Mike Tyson without that. You don't get a Muhammad Ali without that. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9242.44s)]
*  You don't get a Marvin Hagler without that. You don't get that. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9246.68s)]
*  That there's a thing inside some people that is a driving force that allows them [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9251.4s)]
*  to overcome the greatest around them. It's a Michael Jordan. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9257.48s)]
*  It's a hundred percent. There's a, there's a thing, man. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9261.92s)]
*  Tom Brady. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9264.4s)]
*  And those motherfuckers are hated. They're always hated. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9265.48s)]
*  For sure. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9268.68s)]
*  Because you have to hate them because you can't beat them. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9269.08s)]
*  It's the 260 inch deer, dude. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9271.6s)]
*  Because me and my buddies were talking, it's like, there's not, they're like, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9275.12s)]
*  man, that's not the deer of a lifetime. That's the deer of 10 lifetimes. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9278.32s)]
*  Most people will never see that. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9281.56s)]
*  But it's even more than that because you can just accidentally stumble across the [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9283.52s)]
*  deer of a lifetime. You can't accidentally beat John Jones. There's a, [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9287.04s)]
*  there's a thing about, [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9290.64s)]
*  So he's goat over Khabib. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9291.84s)]
*  He's goat over everybody now. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9293.88s)]
*  Khabib's too? [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9295.92s)]
*  Yeah. Khabib is in the conversation, [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9296.8s)]
*  but Mighty Mouse is in that conversation too. Mighty Mouse, to me, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9299.32s)]
*  if you want to look at like a technical expression of the greatness of martial [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9302.76s)]
*  arts, he's as good as anybody's ever done it. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9306.6s)]
*  When Mighty Mouse was the flyway champion. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9309.2s)]
*  And the only problem is up besides Sahudo and a couple other guys like [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9311.24s)]
*  Benavides, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9317.2s)]
*  and he was not dealing with guys that are of the caliber of the guys that John [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9318.2s)]
*  Jones was facing. John Jones was facing Gustafson, Glover, T'Shera. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9323.64s)]
*  He was facing Daniel Cormier. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9328.800000000001s)]
*  He was facing the elite of the elite and he never fucking lost even when he was [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9331.0s)]
*  doing coke and he wasn't even training. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9335.48s)]
*  That's how goddamn good John Jones is. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9337.6s)]
*  And when, you know, when John Jones talks about fights though, [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9340.28s)]
*  you know, when I had him on the podcast, [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9342.92s)]
*  one of the things that he talked about, [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9344.08s)]
*  some people don't really watch tape or they only watch a little bit. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9345.960000000001s)]
*  They let their coaches do the work. John Jones studies everyone. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9350.0s)]
*  He studies their tendencies. He's get it. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9353.44s)]
*  He gets in his mind how when you throw that left kick, [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9355.800000000001s)]
*  you make this little step with your right foot. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9359.92s)]
*  You might do this thing when you shoot for a takedown, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9363.0s)]
*  when you keep your leg on, you keep your head on one side every time. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9366.52s)]
*  You might do this thing when someone throws a right hand, [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9370.640000000001s)]
*  you always lean to the left. You might do it. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9373.16s)]
*  And John Jones picked up that tendency and that's how he knocked out Daniel [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9375.84s)]
*  Cormier. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9378.92s)]
*  He knew Daniel Cormier has a tendency to duck towards his right side because he [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9379.68s)]
*  goes for that single on the left leg. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9383.640000000001s)]
*  And John caught him with the perfect head kick, but it wasn't by an accident. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9386.2s)]
*  He fucking, he set that up. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9390.960000000001s)]
*  He set it up just like Leon Edwards set up that head kick on Camaro. There's a, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9393.56s)]
*  there's a beauty of that. That's just, man, [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9397.6s)]
*  in the middle of chaos and anxiety and fear and, [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9400.44s)]
*  and the fucking fog of war, [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9404.36s)]
*  you figure out a way to connect with this thing that you saw in tape and in [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9407.119999999999s)]
*  training and in preparation. So it's with John, it's not an accident. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9411.36s)]
*  He's the goat, even with his lack of training, even with his, [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9415.64s)]
*  even with the, the, it's just like, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9419.2s)]
*  he's so fucking talented that he almost needs another John Jones to make him [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9420.72s)]
*  compete the way he would, the way, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9425.84s)]
*  make him train the way a lot of these other guys do. Like, [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9428.679999999998s)]
*  he's so good. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9432.0s)]
*  He can beat those guys without being challenged by someone like him. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9433.199999999999s)]
*  Because John Jones has never faced a John Jones. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9437.96s)]
*  Right. True. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9441.199999999999s)]
*  That's what's crazy. He's that fucking talented. And so you, to be a goat, [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9442.08s)]
*  you need all of those things. It's like, sometimes [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9446.84s)]
*  a talent is so great that even the fact that they don't work as hard, [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9449.76s)]
*  they're still better than everybody. That's John. That's why John's so good. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9455.52s)]
*  And he's still, I mean, you saw in his, he's still in his prime. The way, [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9459.84s)]
*  the way he fought three years out and he fights a heavyweight who's a 240 pound [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9464.64s)]
*  ripped heavyweight. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9471.48s)]
*  He's never fought a guy who can move like that and strike like that at heavyweight [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9472.6s)]
*  and he just shut all that shit down. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9476.12s)]
*  Dude, that video of him training a couple of weeks ago, [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9478.64s)]
*  he throws that in his training. Yeah. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9480.92s)]
*  I was like, Oh Lord, I was like, he is going to demolish this guy, dude. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9483.4s)]
*  Yeah. I was up until the day of the fight. I was like, I don't know. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9487.72s)]
*  I was with Cam Haynes and my buddy Tommy jr. And we're talking about it. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9493.08s)]
*  I was like, I don't know, man. I mean, [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9497.119999999999s)]
*  I mean he had a hard time with Dominic Reyes and Dominic Reyes is like not [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9499.279999999999s)]
*  nearly the striker that Cyril Ghan is. And I was like, [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9503.279999999999s)]
*  and then the day of the fight, I don't know what it is, man. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9507.16s)]
*  I think John's going to run right through this dude. I just, [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9509.96s)]
*  I just the day of the fight, I just had this feeling. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9513.359999999999s)]
*  I just have a feeling that John is just going to express his greatness tonight. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9516.4s)]
*  Like all those years out, all the doubts, all the chaos, [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9520.039999999999s)]
*  all the personal problems and the drugs and the party and all the mess. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9523.519999999999s)]
*  And I think that I think this is going to bring out the very best in John. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9529.199999999999s)]
*  Cause I think guys like him, [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9532.8s)]
*  I think one of the things that was happening with the Dominic Reyes fight and [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9534.560000000001s)]
*  the first Alexander Gustafson fight, [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9537.48s)]
*  I think it was so dominant that he was like playing with his food. I don't, [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9540.04s)]
*  I don't think he was like, right, you know, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9543.48s)]
*  I don't think he was like fully engaged in the fear of facing these men. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9545.08s)]
*  It's like a cat just pawing at the thing. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9549.4s)]
*  I don't think they presented the challenge that he requires to reach the level [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9551.76s)]
*  that we know he's capable of reaching. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9555.960000000001s)]
*  But I think Cyril Ghan did provide that challenge. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9557.720000000001s)]
*  And I think he knew that going up to heavyweight and winning the title and just [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9560.8s)]
*  winning it easily, the way he did all debates are off. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9564.92s)]
*  I think he goes back down to light and tries to win that. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9568.44s)]
*  He would win it. Right. For sure. But you know what? [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9571.64s)]
*  Let me tell you something, man. Jamal Hill is no fucking joke. Jamal Hill, [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9574.44s)]
*  the way he pieced up Glover to share. I was like, Oh my God, [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9578.6s)]
*  the way he grappled with them. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9582.44s)]
*  Jamal Hill might be the fucking man at light heavyweight. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9584.36s)]
*  And if John went down, that might be a wild ass fight. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9587.68s)]
*  That might be a wild fight. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9590.880000000001s)]
*  But I think John is done with the starving himself and depleting his body [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9592.76s)]
*  to make 205. And now he's the heavyweight champion. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9596.84s)]
*  I think he's he beats all the best heavyweights that are available. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9600.16s)]
*  And then he goes down in history as number one. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9604.16s)]
*  And good luck catching up. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9606.880000000001s)]
*  Who's he fighting next? Stipe? Stipe. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9608.800000000001s)]
*  July, you should go. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9611.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9613.12s)]
*  Can you make it? Probably. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9614.76s)]
*  Yeah. July. That's Vegas. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9616.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's the that's the international fight weekend. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9619.359999999999s)]
*  And that's the that's the headline fight. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9621.96s)]
*  That's going to be if as long as someone doesn't get injured. Sure. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9623.56s)]
*  They make the deal. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9626.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. T-Mobile or Rita, let's fucking go. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9628.72s)]
*  July 8th. Now, is this TBD versus TBD like they haven't decided yet? [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9631.919999999998s)]
*  They just haven't announced it yet. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9636.119999999999s)]
*  But it's online, isn't it? [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9637.839999999998s)]
*  I don't. I saw it on a bunch of web, but I just read some sketchy websites. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9639.679999999998s)]
*  I would get me all speculative. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9644.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine that if I was the UFC, [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9646.44s)]
*  that is the biggest fight you could make. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9649.52s)]
*  And that there's two there's two events, three events [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9651.52s)]
*  that are like the biggest fights you can make. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9654.720000000001s)]
*  Madison Square Garden is the biggest fight the UFC can make. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9656.92s)]
*  And then there's International Fight Weekend. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9660.04s)]
*  Those are the biggest fights you can make. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9661.960000000001s)]
*  And then there's the December one right before New Year's. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9663.560000000001s)]
*  That's generally the three biggest cards the UFC can make, [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9666.52s)]
*  like multiple championship fights. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9670.560000000001s)]
*  So if John and Stipe, I mean, that qualifies as, [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9672.32s)]
*  you know, Stipe, if you look at his record, you look at what he was able to do. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9675.92s)]
*  He's the most successful heavyweight of all time. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9679.640000000001s)]
*  He defended the title more than anybody. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9681.92s)]
*  He's the first guy to beat Francis. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9683.720000000001s)]
*  You know, Stipe, he's the fucking man. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9686.0s)]
*  And he's a legit bonafide heavyweight. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9688.2s)]
*  Never been a light heavyweight ever. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9691.0s)]
*  I think Stipe and John is an amazing. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9693.16s)]
*  It's, you know, Stipe's it's it's towards the end for Stipe. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9695.6s)]
*  But he's still a great fighter. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9700.320000000002s)]
*  And he's still and he's also had a lot of time off since the Francis loss, [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9702.28s)]
*  which is great. Rest up, heal up. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9705.68s)]
*  And he put on a lot of weight, too. He put on a lot of mass. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9708.36s)]
*  He's like 250 now. Really? [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9710.96s)]
*  Yeah, I felt like he was too small for the Ingana rematch. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9713.36s)]
*  He's like he thought he needed cardio because he beat him with cardio in the first fight. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9716.64s)]
*  You know, he beat him with he beat him with his durability [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9720.44s)]
*  because he got caught with some big shots and then took him down and then outworked him. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9723.119999999999s)]
*  Like Francis went all out to try to knock Stipe out at the very beginning. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9726.88s)]
*  And when he couldn't, Stipe dominated him. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9730.32s)]
*  And it was one of the best, like victories of Stipe's illustrious career. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9732.72s)]
*  But I think that going into the second fight, he had that sort of same approach. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9738.0s)]
*  But this time he reached a patient Francis. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9742.8s)]
*  This time, Francis was like just looking to just nuke him. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9745.72s)]
*  And he wasn't just running at him. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9748.72s)]
*  He was using technique. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9750.119999999999s)]
*  And he was he was just far more evolved as a fighter than he was the first time they fought. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9751.52s)]
*  And Francis just fucking annihilated him. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9756.76s)]
*  And, you know, but the thing is, like Stipe came into that fight light. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9759.08s)]
*  And I think he was in like the two thirties, if I remember correctly, maybe two forty at the most. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9763.52s)]
*  And he decided, you know what, I got to bulk up. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9768.2s)]
*  I got to get bigger. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9769.88s)]
*  And he got bigger for this John Jones fight. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9770.76s)]
*  But I think he was he was he was trying to fight anybody. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9774.4s)]
*  He was trying to fight. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9776.96s)]
*  He was trying to fight Francis again. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9778.32s)]
*  He was trying to fight. He'll fight anybody. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9779.84s)]
*  And for whatever reason, they weren't able to make the right fight for Stipe. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9781.64s)]
*  But I think overall, for his own like health and to rebound from that knockout loss, [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9785.36s)]
*  this is good because you don't want a guy getting KO'd in his late thirties [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9791.04s)]
*  and then fighting again three months later. Right. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9794.880000000001s)]
*  You know, especially a heavyweight that got KO'd by Francis in a brutal way. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9796.92s)]
*  So I think it's good that he's had this time off. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9801.720000000001s)]
*  And I'm excited about the fight. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9803.92s)]
*  He like Chandler McGregor. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9805.52s)]
*  Oh, that's chaos. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9807.04s)]
*  If that happens, the thing is, like Connor hasn't even gotten into the USADA testing pool. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9808.68s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9814.76s)]
*  Because so like Connor broke his leg. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9815.92s)]
*  Here's what John said a couple of days ago. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9817.68s)]
*  More than likely felt like that was kind of sprung on me. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9819.56s)]
*  Need to talk with my team, UFC and come up with a plan. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9822.84s)]
*  Asked about fighting in International Fight Week. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9825.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's listen, this is called negotiation. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9827.36s)]
*  So, you know, that's what you do. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9830.12s)]
*  Maybe I'll fight. Maybe I won't. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9832.0s)]
*  And be the left to like me. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9834.52s)]
*  Dana also said that he thinks John might retire after that fight. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9835.84s)]
*  After the Stipe fight? He may. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9838.88s)]
*  Oh, not there. He may. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9840.4s)]
*  I lost it. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9842.12s)]
*  I mean, he's going to make a fucking boatload of money for that fight. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9843.36s)]
*  And he's shocked. Wouldn't be shocked. Yeah. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9848.32s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like Chandler Chandler McGregor would be electric to see. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9852.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. For sure. If it happens. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9857.16s)]
*  I love that. I love that Chandler is just all or nothing, man. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9858.880000000001s)]
*  I love that about channels. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9862.68s)]
*  The fucking animal. Yeah, he's an animal. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9863.720000000001s)]
*  And he's a very good wrestler. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9865.800000000001s)]
*  He could fight in a very different way. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9867.12s)]
*  We chose to. Yeah. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9868.480000000001s)]
*  I feel like it's for fans. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9869.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like I feel like his last two fights, man. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9871.08s)]
*  The problem is the title fight in that style, though, [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9874.039999999999s)]
*  if you fight in that style against Connor, [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9878.6s)]
*  you're coming straight forward towards Connor. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9881.0s)]
*  That is Connors wheelhouse. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9882.6s)]
*  Connor is one of the greatest counter strikers that's ever fought in the UFC. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9884.56s)]
*  If you look at his fight with Eddie Alvarez, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9887.84s)]
*  you look at his knockout victory over Jose Aldo. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9889.68s)]
*  If you come at Connor and you give him a chance to time you, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9892.12s)]
*  especially in the early rounds, he is fucking lethal. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9895.4s)]
*  He's so good at it. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9899.56s)]
*  He's so explosive and fast and, you know, I mean, who knows? [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9901.0s)]
*  The thing is, like the USADA testing pool, I don't want to harp on this too much, [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9905.8s)]
*  but this is a giant issue for multiple reasons. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9909.6s)]
*  Here's one. Let's just speculate. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9913.12s)]
*  Let's speculate. He got out of the USADA testing pool. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9915.6s)]
*  This is what I would imagine if I was a pro athlete at Connors level [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9918.16s)]
*  and I broke my leg. You need help. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9922.32s)]
*  OK, you're not just going to heal off that eaten mangoes and fucking eating clean. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9925.4s)]
*  You need some help. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9930.44s)]
*  You know, I would say I would want that person to take something. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9931.48s)]
*  I don't. I would. You'd have to consult with an expert sports medicine doctor [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9935.64s)]
*  who would tell you you want peptides, you want growth hormone, you want this, [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9940.56s)]
*  you want that. You want all these things you can't take when you're in USADA. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9944.28s)]
*  You want testosterone. You want all these things. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9947.96s)]
*  And you look at Connor after that leg break, he got fucking jacked, ripped, [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9950.16s)]
*  just gigantic, like 200 plus pounds. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9954.8s)]
*  It looks like just huge fucking shoulders. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9957.720000000001s)]
*  And that's generally not the result of natural hormones. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9959.76s)]
*  That's generally the result of the exogenous hormone use. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9965.28s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9968.2s)]
*  This is a lot of people are speculating, not just me. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9969.64s)]
*  And then when you look at the USADA testing pool and the fact that he's not in it, [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9972.2s)]
*  that also comes in. So now here's the thing. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9975.48s)]
*  You're in your 30s, you're 35 or whatever. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9979.800000000001s)]
*  Connor is 34. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9981.76s)]
*  And you've disrupted your hormones with exogenous hormones. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9983.800000000001s)]
*  Now your body has to get back to developing its own hormones. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9987.56s)]
*  And generally speaking, when people take steroids, [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9992.08s)]
*  and I'm not saying you took steroids, but generally speaking, [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9995.199999999999s)]
*  if someone takes steroids, say if you take steroids for six months, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=9997.84s)]
*  you need a year to bounce back to normal hormone levels after that, [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10002.72s)]
*  especially if you're doing it naturally. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10007.56s)]
*  Now there's things you can take like HCG and Clomaphene [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10009.519999999999s)]
*  and all these different things that restart your body's production of testosterone. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10014.24s)]
*  But you have to make sure that that's all done before you enter into the USADA [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10018.16s)]
*  testing pool. So then you have to be in the USADA testing pool [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10022.8s)]
*  for six full months before you're allowed to compete. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10027.56s)]
*  So this is where it stands. So until he enters into that, [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10030.64s)]
*  we don't know when this fight is going to happen from now. Right. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10033.48s)]
*  Right. If he says it now tonight, I'm going to enter the USADA testing pool. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10037.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I would imagine there's no accusations, [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10041.32s)]
*  but if someone was doing something, [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10044.800000000001s)]
*  they would have a team of people that are testing them and they continue to test [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10047.12s)]
*  them and make sure you're not going to test positive. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10050.68s)]
*  Cause if you test positive and you saw the testing pool, [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10052.44s)]
*  you're out for two fucking years, kid. You know, there's, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10054.960000000001s)]
*  there's guys who make their UFC debuts and they piss hot and they're gone. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10057.44s)]
*  They get booted out of the UFC and you're banned for two years. And it's, [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10061.16s)]
*  it's terrifying. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10065.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10067.0s)]
*  And again, I don't know, no speculation, [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10067.96s)]
*  but this is just being a logical, rational person. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10070.439999999999s)]
*  Right. That's crazy, man. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10073.0s)]
*  That's the stuff that the casual fan just doesn't think about. You know what I [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10074.519999999999s)]
*  mean? Like you just, you just want the fight to happen. You know what I mean? [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10078.119999999999s)]
*  Well, the fight will be awesome if it happens. Yeah. And when it happens, [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10080.72s)]
*  I I'm assuming it's going to happen, but you know, [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10086.08s)]
*  I'm also hoping that Connor's legs, okay. You know, [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10088.759999999998s)]
*  a leg break of that magnitude, like Chris Weidman, [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10091.759999999998s)]
*  he broke his leg in a similar way and he just recently competed in Polaris, [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10094.92s)]
*  which is a grappling competition. And you know, [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10099.56s)]
*  he was so emotional after it was over because he's like, [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10101.679999999998s)]
*  this is the hardest two years of my life. So for two years, [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10104.599999999999s)]
*  he's been recovering from this shin break. Oh, that was brutal. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10107.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's so brutal, man. Some guys never bounce back. They're never the same. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10111.679999999998s)]
*  Anderson was never the same after his leg break. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10115.679999999998s)]
*  Tyron Spong was never the same after his leg break, like those, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10118.519999999999s)]
*  those kind of leg breaks. They're traumatic, dude. That's traumatic. Scary. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10121.880000000001s)]
*  I've seen three of them in real life. It's fucking rough, man. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10125.76s)]
*  Stuff gives me the, yeah, the willies, man. It's the, the worst break. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10130.84s)]
*  Like an arm break doesn't bother me nearly as much. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10134.8s)]
*  There's something about that shin break and see that foot dangling and just [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10136.76s)]
*  going the wrong way. Yeah. It's not pretty. Not good. Yeah. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10141.64s)]
*  And it's a kind of a career ender for a lot of folks. Yeah. And it doesn't see, [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10145.76s)]
*  I mean, we don't know if it's a career ender for Connor, you know, [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10149.480000000001s)]
*  and in retrospect, [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10152.92s)]
*  I wish he'd never taken that fight with Poirier because it seems like he had a [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10154.36s)]
*  hairline fracture already going into that fight. Right. And that's how it broke. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10157.68s)]
*  It was like he already had a fucked up leg. Yeah. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10162.2s)]
*  But he just didn't want to back out of the fight, [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10165.4s)]
*  which he probably should have now. Yeah. That was, that was tough to watch. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10167.16s)]
*  Yeah. That was real tough to watch, you know, [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10171.32s)]
*  cause you don't want it to end that way either. Right. Like you want it to be, [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10173.52s)]
*  of course, you know, I mean, I don't think Poirier probably wants it done that [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10176.720000000001s)]
*  way either. Right. I mean, he wants it to be his ass. Right. Yeah. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10180.56s)]
*  I mean, this is a gigantic fight. Yeah. Rematch, you know, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10183.92s)]
*  the rubber match between those two. That was a gigantic fight. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10187.720000000001s)]
*  Connor was wild back in the day, man. He still is. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10192.04s)]
*  I mean, who knows? I mean, he might come back. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10195.68s)]
*  He might be the first guy to come back from that leg break and be able to [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10197.68s)]
*  compete at the highest level. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10200.24s)]
*  He might come back and nuke Chandler and, you know, make it, [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10201.84s)]
*  or Chandler might get him and, you know, like Chandler is a fucking dog, dude. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10204.84s)]
*  Yeah. That's a dangerous guy to be locked in there with for sure. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10208.96s)]
*  That fight with Justin Gaethje, like Jesus, Louisa's. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10212.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, those dudes went at it. Yeah. And he does that with everybody. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10215.759999999998s)]
*  He's just like down to go to war. Yeah. He ain't afraid of it. No. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10219.16s)]
*  He's fun guy to watch. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of fun guys to watch. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10223.32s)]
*  It's the greatest sport in the world. Yeah. There's nothing like it. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10226.92s)]
*  So much fun, man. It is really so much fun, dude. Really is. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10228.92s)]
*  Have you ever done any training yourself? You've done anything? Nothing? [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10234.12s)]
*  Do you exercise at all? Look at you. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10237.800000000001s)]
*  No, I've not done any training. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10241.92s)]
*  It depends what you mean by exercise, I guess. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10245.2s)]
*  Do you do anything like for your health, like exercise? [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10246.84s)]
*  I spend a lot of time outside. I mean, you know, I can't say I'm, [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10250.800000000001s)]
*  I'm a gym rat, obviously. But it's interesting, man. I've always struggled. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10253.640000000001s)]
*  I've been this big forever. As weird as that sounds, right? [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10257.880000000001s)]
*  So it's like proportionately to my, [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10262.92s)]
*  you know, until I stopped growing height wise, you know, [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10266.92s)]
*  like once I got to where I'm at now, I was kind of like this size. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10269.72s)]
*  Well, I think the real benefits of exercise are not just with the way you look [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10273.84s)]
*  in your body size. I think it's your brain. Sure. I think it's [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10278.76s)]
*  especially what we're talking about, all these issues about the mind [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10282.960000000001s)]
*  and the creative mind playing tricks on you. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10286.08s)]
*  For me, forcing myself to exercise every day is one of the main reasons [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10288.88s)]
*  why I stay sane. Yeah. Through all the chaos that my life goes through. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10294.6s)]
*  Sure. And I think that's that's the real benefit that a lot of people do. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10298.08s)]
*  It's almost like the the benefit that you get physically is [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10302.64s)]
*  that's great. But that's almost like a side effect. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10307.48s)]
*  The benefit that you get for the mind for me. That's how I approach it. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10310.64s)]
*  Yeah. The crazy thing thing, I think, that I struggle with the most [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10314.32s)]
*  with it is, you know, it does bother me. Right. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10318.48s)]
*  Like being bigger, that bothers me. Right. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10321.56s)]
*  The thing that also bothers me about it is like, OK, forget it. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10324.72s)]
*  I literally went to the doctor last week, right, to get the whole [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10327.8s)]
*  bust down like I get physical every year. Right. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10332.88s)]
*  Blood work, dude, panels, counts, everything. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10336.76s)]
*  And it's just all clean, dude. And that's like. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10342.84s)]
*  It's strange to me, dude, because I feel like. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10349.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be this big. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10353.52s)]
*  Right. And it feels and that's really upsetting to me. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10355.68s)]
*  Like I don't eat a tremendous amount of unhealthy food. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10359.199999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not stagnant. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10364.92s)]
*  I mean, I go out and do I mean, I was doing, [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10366.84s)]
*  you know, hour 45, two hour sets, three, sometimes four nights a week [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10370.52s)]
*  for years at this size, and it's never bothered me. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10374.44s)]
*  But it bothers me. It does, though. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10378.72s)]
*  It bothers me in the sense of like because I don't. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10380.76s)]
*  I don't feel like I should be the size that I am. Right. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10384.84s)]
*  And I'm sure everyone's going to jump on me when they watch this [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10387.6s)]
*  and be like, well, you need to do this. You need to do that. Right. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10390.119999999999s)]
*  And I've just it's a code that I've never been able to crack. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10393.0s)]
*  Right. With diet, with exercise. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10397.84s)]
*  We've I've had a trainer out on tour and it's like [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10400.92s)]
*  I can lose 10, 15, 20 pounds. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10404.36s)]
*  And then it just it stops. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10407.76s)]
*  Right. And maybe that's me, right. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10410.28s)]
*  Because ultimately, I think the thing that's so frustrating to me is like, [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10412.12s)]
*  is it ultimately it is me. Right. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10415.48s)]
*  There is nobody else to blame. Right. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10418.44s)]
*  Like there's not I know whatever I'm doing at that time is not enough. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10421.08s)]
*  Well, you have to look at it like this. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10425.880000000001s)]
*  It's a process. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10428.32s)]
*  And you have to look at where you are in that process. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10429.68s)]
*  Now, you can be someone like Jamie, who's thin and healthy and fit. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10433.04s)]
*  And his process that he decides he wants to improve his fitness [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10438.12s)]
*  is a different process than yours. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10441.6s)]
*  And this process is scientific. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10443.64s)]
*  You can look at it in terms of calories in calories out expenditure, diet [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10447.44s)]
*  and mitigation things and all the all the different things [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10453.76s)]
*  you could do for recovery, like sauna and ice bath and all those different things. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10457.04s)]
*  All those factors play a part in this process. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10460.84s)]
*  And this process is long. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10465.48s)]
*  You have to realize you've been in the process of becoming who you are now [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10467.32s)]
*  your whole life. Thirty three years. Right. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10470.4s)]
*  So the process of going is it's but you have to be. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10472.16s)]
*  It's a path. It's a long grind. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10477.08s)]
*  It's not like I take someone on tour and I lose 20 pounds. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10480.52s)]
*  Then it stops. It's like, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10483.4s)]
*  You've just you've just started your first steps. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10485.96s)]
*  You're not climbing up Mount Kilimanjaro yet. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10488.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's a long process. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10490.76s)]
*  And people get very discouraged in the fact that they don't see tangible, [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10493.84s)]
*  obvious physical results. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10497.92s)]
*  They would like to work out a few times really hard and then to have a six pack [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10499.64s)]
*  and look great. No doubt. That's what everybody wants. No doubt. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10502.439999999999s)]
*  But the thing is a process. But. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10504.76s)]
*  It's just like your music is just like anything else. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10508.039999999999s)]
*  The more time you put into it, the more effort you put into it, [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10510.84s)]
*  the better the results are. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10513.52s)]
*  And you can get people that are like my friend, Ethan Supply, who is like [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10515.08s)]
*  fucking enormous at one time. Oh, remember the Titans? Yeah. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10518.6s)]
*  He was like, man, he was so big. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10521.76s)]
*  And now that dude is fucking uber healthy, works out every day. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10523.92s)]
*  He's super happy and fit. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10528.28s)]
*  And and he went through multiple times where he gained the weight back [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10530.08s)]
*  and blew out his stitches from having his fucking skin removed. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10533.68s)]
*  He fucked himself up and had to get it done again. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10537.12s)]
*  And and he still kept going. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10539.52s)]
*  He got back on the horse and he kept going. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10542.0s)]
*  But it's not a thing that happens quick. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10543.960000000001s)]
*  It's not a thing that happens easy. Yeah. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10545.800000000001s)]
*  And you have to be like, it's not a thing that's going to happen on its own. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10547.76s)]
*  Like this. It's like, oh, how did you build that house? [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10551.16s)]
*  Oh, just fucking just did it on its own. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10554.039999999999s)]
*  No, it's like every fucking nail has to be hammered in. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10556.16s)]
*  Every every piece of floorboard has to be cut perfectly. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10559.16s)]
*  Every two by four has to be just it all has to be done. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10562.6s)]
*  And it's a long process. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10567.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough. And I would say, you know, now [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10569.68s)]
*  I'm in the middle of that, right? [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10573.88s)]
*  Like I'm in the middle of that process of like [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10575.6s)]
*  I have wrestled with it for a long time, right? [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10579.759999999998s)]
*  And I'm ready to like move on with like the next part of my life, [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10582.279999999999s)]

*  Writing down what you're supposed to do. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10593.92s)]
*  Yeah, I need that's the thing I need is like, you know, having, [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10595.92s)]

*  And I'm just I'm slowly, but surely, you know, it's every day. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10609.08s)]
*  It really is like it's making this choice instead of that choice. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10615.199999999999s)]
*  And it's like that's so hard, right? [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10619.519999999999s)]

*  who's a dear, dear friend of mine now, you know, and him and myself [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10679.04s)]

*  This was just a few months ago, I think maybe December or January. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10713.72s)]
*  And I was like, listen, man, like I've accomplished all these things. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10718.0s)]
*  And like I've won entertainer of the year twice now. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10720.6s)]
*  And I've got, you know, 15 number one songs [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10725.04s)]
*  and all these insane accolades that I could have never imagined. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10727.720000000001s)]
*  And like in some ways, [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10730.76s)]
*  like because I love music and because I feel like I've been [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10734.560000000001s)]
*  blessed with like the voice I have in the town, I have like [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10741.08s)]
*  the voice in the town I have to me doesn't feel earned. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10744.76s)]
*  Right. Does that make sense to you? [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10748.880000000001s)]
*  Like there is a lot of work to hone the craft. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10750.400000000001s)]
*  But like nobody that's tall [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10753.560000000001s)]
*  is like inherently talented for being tall. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10757.880000000001s)]
*  Right. And just because you're tall, does earn it right. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10760.800000000001s)]
*  You don't feel like you're you're not a great basketball player [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10763.800000000001s)]
*  because you're tall. You earn that. Right. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10766.08s)]
*  Sometimes the precursor to being great at basketball is being tall. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10768.960000000001s)]
*  So you do have to not always, but for the most part, [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10774.320000000002s)]
*  statistically speaking, that's a precursor of being great at basketball. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10777.36s)]
*  Having a great voice [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10781.560000000001s)]
*  statistically is a precursor for being a great musician. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10784.320000000002s)]
*  Not always, but for the most part, statistically speaking. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10788.36s)]
*  And so I don't want to come across as contrived or anything when I say this, [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10792.080000000002s)]
*  but like I feel like sometimes that I haven't done anything [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10797.080000000002s)]
*  that's like hard to do. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10803.480000000001s)]
*  That's also a part of your humility. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10805.0s)]
*  That's part of what keeps you focused on your task. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10807.160000000002s)]
*  Yes, like you're not, you know, you're not like congratulating yourself. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10810.88s)]
*  But like Mike, but like I think my physical fitness [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10815.56s)]
*  and my appearance and my size has always been something that I've struggled with [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10819.72s)]
*  from the time I was a child. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10823.279999999999s)]
*  And like it's this mountain that I've always been standing at the bottom of [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10825.119999999999s)]
*  trying to run up and inherently slipping down every time. Right. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10830.48s)]
*  And it's this thing that like I feel like if I don't overcome it. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10835.56s)]
*  In my lifetime. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10841.4s)]
*  It will be my biggest regret. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10843.84s)]
*  Without a doubt, like it is a burden that weighs so heavily on me. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10846.64s)]
*  And many guys and silently, many women silently. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10851.24s)]
*  And not and not because I care of what other people think about me, [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10854.64s)]
*  about the way I look, about my size or any of that. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10859.44s)]
*  It's because what it I I feel like it means about me as a man. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10863.88s)]
*  Because there's this thing that I want to accomplish. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10871.039999999999s)]
*  That is solely up to me. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10874.8s)]
*  Nobody else can do it for me. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10877.76s)]
*  Nobody did this to me, but me. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10879.88s)]
*  I want so badly to conquer that and I will. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10884.08s)]
*  And I'm excited for that day to come, because I know [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10889.52s)]
*  that will mean so much to me. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10894.92s)]
*  I want it to mean something to my children. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10898.24s)]
*  I want to be running around the yard with my children. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10899.88s)]
*  I want to take my son on an elk hunt when he's 16 years old [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10903.0s)]
*  and hike up a mountain when I'm in my late 40s. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10907.32s)]
*  I want to do that with him. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10911.119999999999s)]
*  And I know right now I can't do that with him. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10912.839999999998s)]
*  And that bugs the shit out of me. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10915.56s)]
*  This is all doable. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10917.24s)]
*  It's all doable. No doubt. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10918.56s)]
*  This is not like trying to get tall. No doubt. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10919.64s)]
*  This is something that all you have to do is just stay on the path. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10922.439999999999s)]
*  And I think there is beauty in that, that it is something that can be accomplished. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10925.679999999998s)]
*  And that's why it's so exciting when people do it. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10930.279999999999s)]
*  When someone like Ethan pulls it off, it's like it's a fucking [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10932.88s)]
*  a beautiful gift to everybody else. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10936.4s)]
*  Like this is a this is surmountable obstacle. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10938.199999999999s)]
*  This is something that can be accomplished. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10941.4s)]
*  It's not easy, but it can be done. No. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10944.0s)]
*  It can be done for sure. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10947.759999999998s)]
*  Not impossible. All right. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10950.0s)]
*  We ended it with this. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10951.16s)]
*  Luke, you're a bad motherfucker. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn_IjiqrGY&t=10952.88s)]
