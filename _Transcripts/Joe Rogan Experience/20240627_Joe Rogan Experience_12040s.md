# Joe Rogan Experience #1920 - Dave Portnoy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5.72s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10.32s)]
*  Good to see you brother. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=12.32s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=15.32s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=16.32s)]
*  We were just talking about how we're a couple of right-wing psychos. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=17.32s)]
*  Yeah, perceived that way at least. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=20.72s)]
*  Perceived that way. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=23.36s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=24.36s)]
*  People just have to lump you into one category or another and if you're not completely aligned [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=26.12s)]
*  with the left, they'll just lump you in with the right. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=30.72s)]
*  Yours is pretty easy to figure out though because you didn't endorse Bernie Sanders. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=33.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=37.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=38.76s)]
*  So, I mean, it should be like all of one second to figure out maybe you aren't. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=39.76s)]
*  Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything to anybody. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  It's just, we're living in the weirdest time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  People just want to categorize people in a tweet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  They want to categorize people in 140 or 280 symbols. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=54.6s)]
*  It's just they just decide that you're this or you're that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=60.2s)]
*  That way they can categorize you as the enemy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=62.92s)]
*  Does that bother you at all? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=66.08s)]
*  Do you care? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=67.08s)]
*  I mean, I wish that they didn't, but what are you going to do? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=68.08s)]
*  I mean, does it bother? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=72.64s)]
*  Yeah, if somebody miscategorizes me or mislabels me, I guess it would bother me a little bit, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=74.12s)]
*  but that's just on them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=81.08s)]
*  You know, it's not who I am. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=83.64s)]
*  I'm a big believer in social programs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=86.28s)]
*  I'm a big believer in welfare. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm a big believer in taking care of poor people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm a big believer in social programs to clean up cities. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of shit that we should be doing in this country to help people that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=96.56s)]
*  are disenfranchised because it's not fair. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=100.64s)]
*  Anybody thinks it is fair that someone lives in a fucking crime-infested, gang-ridden inner [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=103.48s)]
*  city and that's exactly the same as someone who grew up in the suburbs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=108.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  So that would go against what I think a lot of people would expect you to say. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=112.44s)]
*  Yeah, but I also, you know, I'm a cage-fighting commentator. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=115.92s)]
*  I'm a big believer in the Second Amendment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=120.24s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of reasons why they would decide to categorize me as a right-wing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=123.96s)]
*  person, but it's not correct. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=129.2s)]
*  And also, all this ridiculous woke shit that's going on, this bizarre mind virus that's going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=131.8s)]
*  from universities into tech companies and the media and just fucking infiltrating people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=137.88s)]
*  with these rigid ideas of what you have to say and not say and what you can and not say. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=146.08s)]
*  It's like, none of that is liberal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=151.0s)]
*  None of that is really like open-minded or progressive. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=153.84s)]
*  It's all just a, it's a cult. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=157.16s)]
*  And so if you go against it, the only thing you could possibly be is the other. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  So you must be like a mega supporter. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=164.16s)]
*  My main thing with it is if I know how you're going to answer a question basically before [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=167.52s)]
*  it's asked, which I think you can do with like almost everybody involved in politics, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  I don't trust you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=176.96s)]
*  And you really can. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  Like on both left and right, ask any question, you know what they're going to answer it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  So it's like, you're not, you're not thinking independently. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=183.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=185.84s)]
*  Like if you are on the right, I have to assume you're dismissive of climate change. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=187.72s)]
*  You know, if you're on the left, I have to assume that you want a woman to have the right [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=192.36s)]
*  to choose period, you know, and you're like, there's like things like that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=197.3s)]
*  Like you are pro-abortion or you are pro this or you are pro that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  And that what's weird now is like, if you're on the left, you're pro-Ukraine war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  You want to send like your pro-military industrial complex getting funneled billions and trillions [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=210.06s)]
*  of dollars into their system to be able to create weapons to fight off Russia. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  It's like, Whoa, that's the left now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  And really that should have nothing to do with either side. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=226.26s)]
*  Like, I mean, how you feel about that, I don't think should be left or right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=227.26s)]
*  I mean, that's a super complicated issue to be honest. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=230.54s)]
*  For me, at least it's like Ukraine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=232.7s)]
*  Like you don't want a country being invaded that doesn't want to be invaded. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=234.66s)]
*  They're not Americans, but they are humans. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  So it's like, what do you do? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=241.7s)]
*  Well, like, what do you do there? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  It's a tough situation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=244.26s)]
*  It's very tough. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=245.38s)]
*  And it's also very complicated too, because there's NATO, NATO's involvement and pushing [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=246.5s)]
*  to the border of Russia and trying to get, you know, trying to get the Ukraine to join [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=251.78s)]
*  NATO and it's like Jack Ryan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=257.82s)]
*  So hey, this season, Jack Ryan is literally sort of like that plot. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=260.22s)]
*  But yeah, no, there is no easy answer to a lot of issues, but it's just so black and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=263.66s)]
*  white and that that's no good. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=268.86s)]
*  It's not if it's good. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=271.34s)]
*  This is a scary time to be alive. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=272.9s)]
*  You know, someone told me the other day that Nostradamus predicted that there was going [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=275.46s)]
*  to be some sort of a World War Three. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=281.02s)]
*  But doesn't that every year like Nostradamus, though, just throws his hat on the field and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=284.18s)]
*  it's like it's vague enough or anything can be true. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  So everything he's ever said can be true. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=292.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  Didn't he predict someone named Hister that was going to start a world war? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  He came real close with like Hitler. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=301.94s)]
*  Have you seen the Titanic book, the book that was written about the Titanic before the Titanic? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=306.26s)]
*  If you want to Google that, there is a literally a book that is called like I forget the name [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=312.7s)]
*  of the book, but it's like the biggest cruise ship that will ever sail. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=318.46s)]
*  It's going to hit an iceberg and it's going to sink. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=322.78s)]
*  That is weird. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  But Nostradamus, I'm not buying the hype on him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=327.78s)]
*  I haven't looked into it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=330.9s)]
*  Now, if he has a guy named Hissler. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=331.9s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=334.62s)]
*  What fewer people have heard a short novel called The Futility, The Wreck of the Titan [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=335.62s)]
*  published in the US writer Morgan Robertson, a novel that tells the story of the world's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=339.62s)]
*  largest passenger ship, the Titan, and how it sank after hitting an iceberg. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=344.02s)]
*  A novel published 14 years before the Titanic sank. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=347.94s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=351.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=352.02s)]
*  It's called The Titan. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=353.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=354.02s)]
*  And an iceberg. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=355.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=356.02s)]
*  But I bet they hit icebergs all the time back then. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=357.02s)]
*  Well, see, that's the Nostradamus theory that if you do enough, like, I mean, you can at [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=358.22s)]
*  this point say pretty confidently there'll be another gigantic war at some point. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=362.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  The problem is, how does yours stay lit? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  Just keep puffing on it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  I told you I don't. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  I gotta get better at this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm not a big, I told you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  You're a toxic masculinity guy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  You have to do toxic and masculinity things. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=376.54s)]
*  Not a huge cigar guy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=381.06s)]
*  No? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=382.3s)]
*  No. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=383.3s)]
*  I mean, I do like them, but I don't smoke them a lot. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=384.3s)]
*  I kind of quit. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  We had a cigar company called Honey's. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=389.34s)]
*  Something Honey's. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=392.46s)]
*  So it used to be a paper route. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=393.46s)]
*  I delivered it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=394.46s)]
*  And it was like our first advertiser. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=395.46s)]
*  I'd smoke them when I drove the Astrovan. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=396.46s)]
*  I got so high and I was just done with them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=398.34s)]
*  When was this? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=400.38s)]
*  2004. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=401.38s)]
*  You had a paper route in 2004? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=402.38s)]
*  Barstool started as a newspaper. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=404.41999999999996s)]
*  So I used to like hand it out and we had those little news racks outside subway stations. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=406.38s)]
*  For 48 hours, I just jump in my Astrovan and fill the news racks, drop in bars throughout [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  Boston. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=416.05999999999995s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=417.05999999999995s)]
*  That's how you started? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it was a newspaper. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=420.78000000000003s)]
*  So your own newspaper. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=422.78000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  I'd wake up like 4 a.m., go to the subway, hand it out to people, like walking by me [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  and just scream at them, like take the newspaper. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=429.06s)]
*  What was the motivation to do that? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=432.58s)]
*  How did you get the idea? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=434.18s)]
*  I was always into gambling. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=435.66s)]
*  And so I had a normal sales job. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=438.06s)]
*  I always knew I wanted to try my own thing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=440.98s)]
*  Flew out to Vegas, met with like the casinos. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=443.22s)]
*  You got to be a dealer. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=445.82s)]
*  You got to start at the bottom. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=446.86s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to do that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=447.86s)]
*  Talk to offshore casinos and said, how do I get involved? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=449.62s)]
*  And they all said, the internet at the time I did this, if you went to a gambling site, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=452.62s)]
*  fireworks, pop-ups, look like you're getting your credit card stolen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  They actually said, get us off the internet, put us in a physical newsletter and we'll [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=460.18s)]
*  advertise. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=464.62s)]
*  So I sold like a year of advertising before we launched and it was a gambling rack. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=465.62s)]
*  It was like a four page newspaper, but I sold the advertising and it allowed me just to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=470.78s)]
*  morph. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=475.62s)]
*  Like during the course of the year, we slowly moved strictly away from gambling to more [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=476.62s)]
*  like men's interest, like girls and things like that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=480.42s)]
*  That's how it started. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=483.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=484.5s)]
*  So when you were into gambling, like why did you decide to do a newspaper? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=485.5s)]
*  Because I knew I wanted to do something I enjoyed doing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=490.62s)]
*  I was doing cold calling sales. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=492.9s)]
*  I couldn't do that my whole life. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=494.22s)]
*  And when I called these casinos to advertise, it's what I just said. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=496.5s)]
*  The internet was cluttered. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=501.02s)]
*  It was filled. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=502.38s)]
*  There was a time when literally every gambling website had little graphics of fireworks popping [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=503.38s)]
*  up, everything. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=509.3s)]
*  And the gambling companies wanted to get off the internet because it was too cluttered. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=510.3s)]
*  So they said, if you do a newsletter or a newspaper, we'll advertise. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=514.26s)]
*  So that's why I created it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=518.74s)]
*  How funny is that? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=520.36s)]
*  They wanted to get off the internet. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=521.42s)]
*  Off the internet. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=522.42s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=523.42s)]
*  Barstool Sports. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=524.54s)]
*  Oh my God, look at that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=525.54s)]
*  2003, the first issue of Barstool Sports. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=528.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=531.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=533.86s)]
*  Hooters, football, they could have. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=534.86s)]
*  First advertisers, yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=535.86s)]
*  Hooters was your first? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=536.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=537.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=538.86s)]
*  Hooters is apparently in trouble. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=539.86s)]
*  I just read something about Hooters is not doing well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=542.1s)]
*  That's the fake story? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=544.34s)]
*  Is that a fake story? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=545.34s)]
*  I don't know, the one that people aren't interested in tits anymore? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=546.5s)]
*  Well that's a fake story. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=550.22s)]
*  I didn't know that's the one. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=551.22s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=552.22s)]
*  I think that's a ridiculous conclusion. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=553.22s)]
*  Just because a business that has girls with owl eyes over their tits. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=556.66s)]
*  I don't know how they get away with it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=562.02s)]
*  I've always wondered that in this culture, basically, where you can just hire on looks. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=564.1s)]
*  Yeah, that is true, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=570.14s)]
*  But don't they do that in strip clubs too? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=572.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=574.58s)]
*  I mean they kind of do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=575.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know how. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=576.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's no equality in strip clubs. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=577.98s)]
*  No, some are better than others, but yeah, it's based on looks. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=579.98s)]
*  Yeah, all that body positivity shit that doesn't... [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=583.26s)]
*  Out the window. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=585.38s)]
*  So how do you figure, how do they get away with it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=586.38s)]
*  How is the restaurant going to get away with it? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=587.86s)]
*  That's a good question, but it's the same thing in those Chippendale shows. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=589.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=593.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's what you're selling. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=594.14s)]
*  If that's what you're selling... [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=596.26s)]
*  You get away with it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=597.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=598.26s)]
*  That must be the case. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=599.26s)]
*  It is the case. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=600.26s)]
*  I mean, but it's not with models anymore. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=601.26s)]
*  Now you can be an obese model. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=603.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=605.54s)]
*  But that's also because you're selling clothes to people that are obese. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=606.66s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that are overweight. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=609.5s)]
*  You can sell them clothes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=612.02s)]
*  I guess it's good to have an overweight model because if you're an overweight person, you [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=614.3s)]
*  buy clothes like, oh, that would look good on me. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=618.5799999999999s)]
*  It looks good on her. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=620.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's half public pressure and half business because Victoria's Secret got basically bullied [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=621.3s)]
*  out of their fashion show and their entire model by only having the perfect Victoria's [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=629.06s)]
*  Secret angels. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  They had to go plus size. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  Now they did that because of public pressure or because of business decision or kind of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=639.02s)]
*  both. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=644.3s)]
*  You know, were they stuck there with their guns? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=645.3s)]
*  If they're like, our business is killing it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=646.3s)]
*  We don't care what you say. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=648.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=649.26s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=650.26s)]
*  I bet it enhanced their business to a plus size. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=651.26s)]
*  Correct. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=653.78s)]
*  So a good business move. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=654.78s)]
*  Are they doing it right? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=656.02s)]
*  Are they doing it? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=657.02s)]
*  I'm one of those guys. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=658.02s)]
*  I don't think there's any, I forget the word that I'm going to say, altruism. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=659.3s)]
*  I don't think there's an altruistic act in the world. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=663.98s)]
*  I think every single thing somebody does is even if it just makes you feel good, well, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=667.26s)]
*  that's not altruistic. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=672.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=673.3s)]
*  Yeah, I've said that before about being kind and generous, that it makes you feel good. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=674.6999999999999s)]
*  It's actually good for you too. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=678.66s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=680.18s)]
*  But it's still kind and generous. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=681.18s)]
*  Just because someone enjoys it doesn't mean it's not altruistic. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  It's just that there is a benefit to the person that does it too. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=687.62s)]
*  I think a lot of people have this idea of altruism that you're only benefiting the person [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=690.38s)]
*  you're helping and that's the only real altruism. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=695.42s)]
*  I think it's, you're also, yeah, I mean it benefits you, but it benefits you and it just, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=697.78s)]
*  it feels good. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=705.9s)]
*  It's like, I think people look at, when people have ulterior motives, someone does, like [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=707.14s)]
*  charities bother me when I find out that the people behind the charities are making millions [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=713.3s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=717.8199999999999s)]
*  That's the worst thing that worked. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=718.8199999999999s)]
*  That is scary. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  That freaks me out. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=720.8199999999999s)]
*  We've almost, so we've done a lot of charity and obviously anytime you say do charity, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  it is self enhancing, but we've done a ton of charity and it started, we did it with [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=726.78s)]
*  Boston Marathon. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=730.06s)]
*  So we were in Boston at the time of the bombings. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=731.86s)]
*  That's the first time we did it and we don't really ever give our money to anybody else. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=733.86s)]
*  We control it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=738.5s)]
*  We give it direct to the people because of what you said. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=739.5s)]
*  Like I don't trust charities for the most part. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=741.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=743.78s)]
*  There's just too much overhead. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=744.78s)]
*  I mean when you give to charities, there's a list of charities that you can find online [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=745.78s)]
*  where like you can see what their overhead is and how much money actually gets to the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=750.5s)]
*  people and it's a very small percentage in most of them. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=755.06s)]
*  What's like the lowest charity in terms of like the worst charity for like you give them [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=758.5799999999999s)]
*  money and how much of it actually goes to the charity? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=765.06s)]
*  Because some of them are pretty good, but man some of them are shockingly bad. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=768.9s)]
*  Like you know 10%. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=773.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=775.06s)]

*  You know when you got executives making six figures and. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=777.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=780.1s)]
*  Well it becomes a business. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=781.1s)]
*  It's no longer like charity. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=782.38s)]
*  That's real common though. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=784.7s)]
*  Like a lot of people freaked out when the Black Lives Matter people were buying mansions [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=786.22s)]

*  The name game. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=796.26s)]
*  Very commonly known and respected group is the Make-A-Wish Foundation. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=797.26s)]
*  This organization spends the vast majority of its donations on children. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=800.1s)]
*  Kid Wish Network. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=804.66s)]
*  However, it spends only three cents of every dollar collected on kids. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=805.86s)]
*  But their website and solicitations are designed to look and sound like Make-A-Wish. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=812.54s)]
*  In fact they count on confusion to gather contributions. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=817.3399999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=820.54s)]

*  But let's go to like the Red Cross. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=906.9s)]

*  but I'm afraid to say it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=926.1s)]
*  Like what is that? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=927.46s)]

*  delivering care and comfort to those in need. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=933.62s)]
*  The remaining 10 cents help to keep the entire Red Cross running by supporting routine but [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=936.06s)]
*  indispensable day to day business operations. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=940.54s)]

*  It says they were fired for... [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1044.26s)]
*  Fired by the board for criticisms and how they spent the $100 million in donations. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1049.26s)]
*  Does it say that they stole it? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1053.78s)]
*  Like no. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1056.54s)]
*  Just that they spent... [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1057.54s)]
*  There it is. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1058.54s)]
*  Non-profit watchdog charity advocate says Wounded Warrior Projects spends more than [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1059.54s)]
*  $60% of his budget on veterans. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1061.98s)]
*  The Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation provides more than 98% to veterans. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1066.6200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1070.94s)]
*  Maybe it changed since then. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1071.94s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it did. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1075.54s)]
*  And also I'd like to know why. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1076.54s)]
*  Maybe there's some logistical explanation for why they have to spend so much money. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1079.46s)]
*  I mean, what does that mean? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1084.34s)]
*  Because that's a cause. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1086.54s)]
*  You hear the name. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1087.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1088.54s)]
*  And it's... [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1089.54s)]
*  We've donated tons of different... [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1090.54s)]
*  That's the one you want to get behind right off the bat. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1092.3400000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1093.3400000000001s)]
*  Just the way it says. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1094.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1095.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1096.3400000000001s)]
*  The same with Make-A-Wish. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1097.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh, kids. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1098.3400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1099.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1100.3400000000001s)]
*  Dying kids. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1101.3400000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1102.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1103.3400000000001s)]
*  But that's the problem with fucking sleazy people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1104.3400000000001s)]
*  It's like they'll hide behind... [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1105.3400000000001s)]
*  You hear a lot of athlete ones, obviously. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1107.3400000000001s)]
*  The Brett Favre stuff's crazy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1109.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1111.5400000000002s)]
*  I didn't look into that that much because I'm not the biggest football fan, but it looked [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1112.5400000000002s)]
*  pretty sad. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1116.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1117.6200000000001s)]
*  From what it seems like, the money that should have been going to the state was going to [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1118.6999999999998s)]
*  build a volleyball court at the school because his daughter played volleyball. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1122.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  Not great. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1128.8999999999999s)]
*  And he was aware of all that? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1129.8999999999999s)]
*  Certainly seems that way. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1131.9399999999998s)]
*  Doesn't he also have probably pretty significant CTE? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1132.9399999999998s)]
*  There was a thing about Brett Favre, he thinks he's had 1,000 concussions. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1137.4199999999998s)]
*  1,000? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1141.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1142.34s)]
*  That was him, right? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1143.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1144.34s)]
*  He was just like every time any shaking could be a concussion, so he was considering the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1145.34s)]
*  definition of concussion to be like, well, then I've had thousands of them. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1149.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1152.02s)]
*  He was talking about how many times he's got his bell ring. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1153.02s)]
*  That is a concussion for the most part. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1155.6599999999999s)]
*  It's certainly close to it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1157.62s)]
*  I've always had this question. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1161.34s)]
*  You're an MMA guy, obviously. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1162.54s)]
*  So the NFL, the concussion thing, I think it's because if they start acknowledging it, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1165.6999999999998s)]
*  really, they got to go all the way back in time and deal with ex-players and things like [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1170.1s)]
*  that. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1173.86s)]
*  And you guys get hit in the face every two seconds. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1175.3799999999999s)]
*  Are they just released? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1177.06s)]
*  Is that why no one ever talks about concussions in MMA? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1178.4199999999998s)]
*  But in football, it's a huge discussion? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1182.06s)]
*  I think in football, it was never known, whereas in boxing, it was always punch drunk. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1184.54s)]
*  Everybody always knew about it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1191.6999999999998s)]
*  So I think you thought going into it that this was a risk that you were taking if you [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1192.78s)]
*  wanted to be a fighter. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1196.6599999999999s)]
*  So I think the thought behind it was, look, everybody knows what happened to Muhammad [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  Ali. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1203.34s)]
*  Everybody saw Joe Frazier at the end of his career. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1205.06s)]
*  Everybody saw all these guys who could barely talk who used to be these great, great fighters. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1207.18s)]
*  And everybody who was aware, who was in the game, said, look, you got to talk to your [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1212.1000000000001s)]
*  fighters when it's time to leave. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1216.18s)]
*  And you got to be aware of the risks. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1219.46s)]
*  But you know what you're getting into when you get into it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1221.22s)]
*  Just like if a guy is a BMX jumper and he does those flips on dirt bikes and then he [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1223.98s)]
*  falls and fucking breaks his neck. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1231.3400000000001s)]
*  You know he knew that that was on the menu. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1233.54s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1237.78s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1238.78s)]
*  You know the risk going into it where football, they... [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1239.78s)]
*  I think they didn't know. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1241.22s)]
*  I don't think people really knew... [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1242.74s)]
*  And he hit it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1245.06s)]
*  Adele hit it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1246.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1247.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1248.06s)]
*  How did they hide it? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1249.06s)]
*  I mean, they just, I believe they buried the surveys, at least from that movie Concussion [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1250.06s)]
*  with Will Smith. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1255.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1256.74s)]
*  I didn't watch that movie. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1257.74s)]
*  But I've seen that guy, the original doctor, that was the motivation of that movie. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1258.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1265.02s)]
*  I think they buried a lot of it, released their own, control it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1266.02s)]
*  I mean, I've had my issues with the NFL. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1271.1s)]
*  I think they're like maybe the most powerful group there is. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1273.26s)]
*  Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1276.9s)]
*  league of hiding information that linked to head trauma and permanent brain damage, Alzheimer's [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1281.02s)]
*  disease and dementia. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1285.06s)]
*  Some teams choose not to draft certain players in the NFL draft due to their past concussion [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1286.7s)]
*  history. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1291.54s)]
*  And I think that's part of the problem moving forward with it a little bit is if you admit [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1292.54s)]
*  it or change, you have this laundry list of lawsuits that can come forward then. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1298.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1303.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1304.8600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1305.8600000000001s)]
*  But the more the information comes out, it kind of traps them. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1307.66s)]
*  It's like, what are you going to do? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1312.6200000000001s)]
*  You have to admit that all those other players. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1315.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1316.9s)]
*  Well, I think according to what we just read and from the way I understand it, you got [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1317.9s)]
*  to slant it like it's new information. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1322.26s)]
*  Like, well, we didn't know. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1324.22s)]
*  So we didn't know that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1325.8200000000002s)]
*  So how can you hold us responsible? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1327.3400000000001s)]
*  If they can prove, well, you did know that and you hit it, then I think you had a lot [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1329.02s)]
*  of issues. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1332.3400000000001s)]
*  When did they know? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1333.3400000000001s)]
*  When did they first find out about it? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1334.3400000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of that's in the movie. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1335.7s)]
*  But there's different studies. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1337.14s)]
*  The NFL tried to intimidate scientists studying the link between pro football and traumatic [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1338.14s)]
*  brain injury. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1342.7s)]
*  This is in 2017. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1343.74s)]
*  Rather than honestly deal with this burgeoning concussion problem, the National Football [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1344.74s)]
*  League went after the reputation of the first doctor to link the sport to degenerative brain [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1349.54s)]
*  disease he named chronic traumatic encephalopathy. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1354.66s)]
*  So it was back in 2002. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1360.06s)]
*  I think that's the guy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1362.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1363.38s)]
*  Dr. Bennett Omalu. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1364.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1365.38s)]
*  That's real, man. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1366.38s)]
*  I think with football, it's probably even more pronounced because if you think about [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1371.5s)]
*  what they're doing, they're running full clip into each other. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1375.78s)]
*  So you have these giant super athletes, 300 pound guys capable of generating preposterous [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1379.02s)]
*  amounts of power and force. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1385.9399999999998s)]
*  They're just fucking. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1387.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1388.6999999999998s)]
*  Boom! [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1389.6999999999998s)]
*  The flip side. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1390.6999999999998s)]
*  I think 99% would sign up for that anyways. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1393.5s)]
*  Like I've always said that. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1397.26s)]
*  If you told me I could be one of those people. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1398.42s)]
*  Now maybe not now because I don't know about you. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1401.58s)]
*  I didn't dream I'd have the life I had now. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1405.58s)]
*  But for 99.9% of Americans, I would think being a star athlete football player is worth [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1407.58s)]
*  that risk. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1415.86s)]
*  I think most of them, if you said you may get a concussion, you may get brain damage [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1416.86s)]
*  from doing this, they'd still probably do it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1420.78s)]
*  I mean, you live a life that you really can't compare to from what? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1424.06s)]
*  When you're 15 years old or whenever you start being that athlete to well into your 40s, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1430.46s)]
*  yeah, the end of your life is going to suck. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1436.26s)]
*  But people don't look forward to that. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1438.3799999999999s)]
*  People don't worry about what's going to happen to them generally when you're 20 at 50. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1440.82s)]
*  Yeah, they don't think about it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1445.1s)]
*  They also think about. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1447.16s)]
*  Jenny Buffett quote, content to be living and dying in three quarters time. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1448.16s)]
*  That's that. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1452.54s)]
*  You can live your fullest when you can live. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1453.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1455.58s)]
*  And that life, I mean, the life of living a star NFL football player's life, that's [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1456.58s)]
*  a crazy life. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1460.8999999999999s)]
*  You're driving around in a Rolls Royce, you got diamonds on your fingers, like Joe Namath [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1462.02s)]
*  showing up with a fur coat on like you're a fucking man. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1466.22s)]
*  If someone said you can do that, but at age 50, you're going to have unbelievable problems. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1469.26s)]
*  People don't think about that. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1476.98s)]
*  And I would generally I even know that most people that sign that contract. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1477.98s)]
*  If you told me I was still cold calling my nine to five, I'd be like, sign me up. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1483.02s)]
*  I'm not worried about 50. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1487.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1489.1s)]
*  And they also think by the time I'm 50, someone's going to figure out how to fix that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1490.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1494.46s)]
*  There's always like this thought of the medical interventions and stem cells and hyperbaric [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1495.46s)]
*  chambers. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1500.82s)]
*  Everything. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1501.82s)]
*  Your office. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1502.82s)]
*  You come to Joe Rogan's office. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1503.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think that I think that people don't generally think about the risks in terms of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1506.1s)]
*  the future. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1512.74s)]
*  They think of how do I feel right now? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1513.74s)]
*  You know, especially fighters and the glory of winning a fight, the glory of getting your [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1514.74s)]
*  hand raised. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1520.3s)]
*  It's so above and beyond normal life experiences that even guys who have, you know, taken some [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1521.86s)]
*  shots and probably do feel the effects. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1528.94s)]
*  They take a few months off and they want to get back in there again because it's so much [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1532.16s)]
*  more exciting than regular life. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1535.9s)]
*  I've been blessed at this point with things that I never thought I'd be able to do ever. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1538.1s)]
*  Walking in with Patty, I got to walk in with Patty in London when the crowd was chanting [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1544.54s)]
*  his name. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1550.26s)]
*  That is still like maybe the best thing that I've gotten to do. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1551.46s)]
*  I can't imagine being a fighter like in the tunnel coming out. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1554.6599999999999s)]
*  There is nothing really else like it in sports and anything, the walkout. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1558.12s)]
*  No, there's nothing like it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1562.1799999999998s)]
*  I saw you by the way you roll your eyes when Patty won. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1564.06s)]
*  Shit and a one. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1566.98s)]
*  I thought that I thought it was a close decision. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1568.38s)]
*  I thought Jared won. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1571.7s)]
*  I thought Jared Gordon won that fight. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1573.38s)]
*  It was a good fight. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1575.42s)]
*  It certainly wasn't a blowout. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1577.54s)]
*  It wasn't one of those fights where there's no fucking way. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1579.6200000000001s)]
*  It was it was a close fight. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1583.1s)]
*  Did you see the fight, the Twitter war I got in with a guy after the fact? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1585.38s)]
*  No. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1589.78s)]
*  Justin Gaethie. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1590.78s)]
*  Oh, Justin Gaethie. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1591.78s)]
*  Yeah, he and I he threatened to beat me up. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1592.78s)]
*  Well, he definitely could. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1595.3000000000002s)]
*  That's by the way, that's not saying much like your producer could beat you up. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1596.8600000000001s)]
*  So I don't that's not much of a threat. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1600.94s)]
*  I've never been in a physical altercation. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1603.7800000000002s)]
*  He's the most violent man in MMA. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1605.46s)]
*  Justin Gaethie is a fucking savage. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1607.7800000000002s)]
*  Is he capable of beating up a civilian? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1609.5400000000002s)]
*  Would he? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1612.9s)]
*  No, he wouldn't do that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1613.7s)]
*  That's good to know. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1614.7s)]
*  No, he wouldn't do that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1615.3400000000001s)]
*  He's not stupid. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1616.18s)]
*  Because this is what happened after the fight. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1617.22s)]
*  Patty in the ring. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1620.1000000000001s)]
*  Fight of the night. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1621.3000000000002s)]
*  He said fight of the night. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1622.14s)]
*  The third round, they didn't throw a punch. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1623.82s)]
*  It wasn't fight of the night. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1625.1799999999998s)]
*  But he's talking fight of the night. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1626.3799999999999s)]
*  Patty's our guy. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1628.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, he's just a fun guy. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1629.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1630.5s)]
*  So we're saying fight of the night, fight of the night. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1630.82s)]
*  He got mad at us. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1632.78s)]
*  He's like, you're trying to steal money from the actual fighters who won fight of the night. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1633.78s)]
*  Like, no, he didn't. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1638.3799999999999s)]
*  People went into his background. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1639.9399999999998s)]
*  And wait, what did he say exactly? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1641.74s)]
*  What was his quote to me? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1643.86s)]
*  He said, embarrassing. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1645.7s)]
*  What was the no? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1649.74s)]
*  Something we've got to be better. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1651.8999999999999s)]
*  We don't stand for this. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1654.54s)]
*  People, the comments littered. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1656.22s)]
*  He was out with like a third world dictator. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1657.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, the Chechen guy. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1661.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I hit him back with that. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1664.06s)]
*  I'm like, we just said Patty was fight of the night. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1665.46s)]
*  You were out with the Chechen dictator. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1668.34s)]
*  He was one of the worst guys on the planet. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1671.58s)]
*  One thing led to another. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1673.34s)]
*  He threatened to beat me up. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1674.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Barstool guys. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1677.86s)]
*  This makes the Barstool guys look really bad. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1679.26s)]
*  Bending over for the lad. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1681.5s)]
*  Fight of the night. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1683.46s)]
*  Barstool can give him 50k, but that performance will never get you a bonus in the octagon. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1684.46s)]
*  Eh. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1689.5s)]
*  Eh. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1690.7s)]
*  I quote tweeted, this makes the Barstool guys look really bad. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1693.78s)]
*  I said, it's probably there. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1698.02s)]
*  So, oh yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1700.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1701.66s)]
*  There it is. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1702.66s)]
*  People are telling me Justin Gaethje was recently seen hanging out with a warlord accrued to [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1704.14s)]
*  brutal crimes against humanity. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1707.58s)]
*  So it's hypocritical for him to say we look bad supporting Patty when he supports a warlord. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1709.02s)]
*  I'm going to take the high road plus not mention it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1713.78s)]
*  Yeah, and then he got mad at you for that? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1717.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1721.22s)]
*  He's like, I didn't do that. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1722.22s)]
*  Find me a picture of me with the warlord. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1723.86s)]
*  But he does have a picture with his son at his birthday party. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1725.74s)]
*  So he maybe, he got paid to go there with some other guys. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1731.02s)]
*  There's a lot of guys who got paid to go there. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1734.78s)]
*  A lot of guys go there. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1736.9s)]
*  He's been doing that for years. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1738.46s)]
*  He's a big MMA fan and he brings over champions and I guess they hang out with him. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1739.7s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1744.38s)]
*  I don't know exactly what he's done or what he is accused of doing. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1746.9s)]
*  I think it's pretty bad stuff. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1751.78s)]
*  But I know Chechnya is a brutal part of the world. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1752.78s)]
*  There's some fucking crazy shit that's happening in Chechnya. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1755.78s)]
*  I mean that's where Hamzat Shemayev is from. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1759.74s)]
*  It's, Hamzat trains with that guy. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1763.1000000000001s)]
*  There's videos of him wrestling with him and grappling with him. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1766.02s)]
*  I know that he's been involved with a bunch of MMA fighters. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1769.18s)]
*  That's his thing. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1773.42s)]
*  He's a fucking savage dude. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1774.42s)]
*  He brings over savages. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1778.58s)]
*  It's a savage game. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1780.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1781.74s)]
*  Yeah, the warlord game. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1782.74s)]
*  Yeah, the warlord third, that's a savage game. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1784.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting decision to decide to go over there and many fighters have gone [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1787.9s)]
*  over there. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1793.26s)]
*  And others haven't. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1794.26s)]
*  When we did that, some fighters were like, well, I think... [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1795.3s)]
*  Sugar Sean O'Malley. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1797.94s)]
*  Yeah, he said he ought to offer, yeah, he wouldn't go. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1798.94s)]
*  Sugar Sean's the man. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1801.3s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, fuck that, I'm not fucking going there. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1804.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how much is he offering you? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1806.7s)]
*  Probably a lot, I would guess. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1809.94s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1810.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1811.94s)]
*  Because you have to know... [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1812.94s)]
*  You gotta know. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1813.94s)]
*  ...that that, right. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1814.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1815.94s)]
*  I mean, he's out there shooting guns on his ranch or whatever. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1816.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like, he's a warlord. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1819.54s)]
*  Yes, there's no other way around it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1822.06s)]
*  It's not a... [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1823.82s)]
*  There's no confusion. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1824.82s)]
*  None. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1825.82s)]
*  You're like, maybe he's not. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1826.82s)]
*  Maybe it's propaganda. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1829.02s)]
*  It's like when you hear things about Zelensky, you're like, well, he started off as a comedian. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1830.02s)]
*  There's wiggle room. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1836.1399999999999s)]
*  He's being attacked. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1838.3s)]
*  Is there something where Ukraine is cracking down on the media? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1840.74s)]
*  Somebody sent me something about Ukraine trying to control the media now. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1845.3799999999999s)]
*  Are we anti-Ukraine? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1850.5s)]
*  No, no. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1851.5s)]
*  Oh. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1852.5s)]
*  Why would they crack down on the media? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1854.18s)]
*  Well, I think because of the war effort. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1855.66s)]
*  The media is saying things like, oh, Ukraine is corrupt or oh, Ukraine has done this. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1858.34s)]
*  Critics say a new media law signed by Zelensky could restrict press freedom in Ukraine. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1864.14s)]
*  Lawmakers who passed the bill said it would help meet European Union conditions for membership, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1868.62s)]
*  but journalists have denounced it as a move towards censorship. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1873.54s)]
*  Oh. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1877.14s)]
*  Imagine if you have to join the European Union. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1878.7800000000002s)]
*  You have to fucking. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1882.8600000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1885.66s)]
*  Some of the law's most stringent provisions were relaxed in response to the criticism. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1886.66s)]
*  Serious concerns about the independence of the regulatory body remain. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1890.7s)]
*  Domestic and international news media groups said on Friday noting that they were still [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1893.7s)]
*  receiving details of the final 279 page legislation. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1897.3000000000002s)]
*  The law expands the authority of Ukraine's state broadcasting regulator to cover the [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1900.8200000000002s)]
*  online and print news media. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1905.86s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1908.4599999999998s)]
*  Previous drafts gave the regulator the power to find news media outlets, revoke their licenses, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1909.8999999999999s)]
*  temporarily block certain online outlets without a court order, and request that social media [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  platforms and search giants like Google remove content that violates the law. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1921.34s)]
*  Well, you know, they're doing that over in America. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1926.5s)]
*  I mean, we found out that because of the Twitter files. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1928.82s)]
*  When Elon released all the Twitter files, they found that the United States government [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1931.54s)]
*  was actively trying to suppress the voices of certain people that were saying things [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1934.66s)]
*  they found disagreeable on Twitter. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1938.46s)]
*  Yeah, to me. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1940.26s)]
*  Yeah, I. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1941.26s)]
*  Now I got attacked for this take. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1942.26s)]
*  I said that was like a and I get it, obviously, but I assume that was like a no duh to me. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1946.02s)]
*  Like that's what I expected. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1953.18s)]
*  I wasn't like I get suppressed like the second Elon took over my Twitter and I'm sure I don't [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1954.78s)]
*  know if you use Twitter, but mine went way up like 900,000. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1960.8200000000002s)]
*  A couple of weeks. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1965.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1966.5s)]
*  So I crazy. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1967.5s)]
*  I didn't get to that, but I direct up arrow like I went from couldn't gain a follower [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1968.5s)]
*  to up. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1971.54s)]
*  So press it. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1972.54s)]
*  And I knew I was. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1974.1s)]
*  So I wasn't surprised. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1975.1s)]
*  That's why I was like, oh, that's not surprising. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1976.1s)]
*  If you're paying attention, I got attacked. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1977.5s)]
*  People don't pay any attention. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1979.9399999999998s)]
*  They acted like I was on the left on that. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1980.98s)]
*  It's like, no, I was one of the ones being suppressed. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1983.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, yeah, no shit. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1985.34s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1987.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't complain about that shit, but I'm definitely aware of my Instagram used [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1988.6999999999998s)]
*  to move way quicker. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1992.36s)]
*  And then something happened a while back where it slowed down by a significant margin, the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1993.9s)]
*  amount of growth. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=1999.78s)]
*  I'm like, how do you complain when you have 16 million followers? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2000.78s)]
*  Like do you really complain that you're not that you somehow or another suppressed or [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2004.1s)]
*  am I really suppressed or maybe it's because I'm not doing reels. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2007.5s)]
*  You know what? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2011.06s)]
*  Maybe there's like a logical reason for it. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2012.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2014.18s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a lot of fucking algorithms and weird shit at play when it comes to Instagram [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2015.18s)]
*  and all those media companies. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2020.82s)]
*  So it's not the handpicking of people, but if people complain, if they just, this is [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2022.9s)]
*  offensive, this is whatever, there's a certain number of those that will trigger you to get [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2030.6200000000001s)]
*  pushed down. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2036.14s)]
*  Now, for whatever reason, one thing that also I think is kind of self-evident, if you're [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2037.14s)]
*  talking left and right, the left is far more savvy, like with social media. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2041.8200000000002s)]
*  Like the right will generally just wants to sling it out. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2047.6200000000001s)]
*  They'll let you say anything and they're not going to complain and they're not going to [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2051.1s)]
*  try to violate like, oh, that's a violation complaint. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2054.34s)]
*  The left will and it's a good tactic to get the right off. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2058.1400000000003s)]
*  But it's also because the left is in control of all of the social media platforms where [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2061.58s)]
*  the right has nothing. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2066.6200000000003s)]
*  100%. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2068.42s)]
*  I mean, there's no social media platform. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2069.42s)]
*  I mean, there's people that are trying to accuse Elon Musk of being right wing, but [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2071.26s)]
*  I think that's just because Elon Musk has said the Democrats are out of their fucking [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2075.26s)]
*  minds. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2078.1s)]
*  He's said what I've said in many different ways. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2079.1s)]
*  Now, I don't know how I go back and forth on how I feel about Elon. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2081.14s)]
*  Sometimes I think he's genius. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2084.2999999999997s)]
*  Other times like he may be getting a little full of himself. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2086.86s)]
*  Like I don't think he bought Twitter for the reasons he's saying he did to be some great [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2089.2999999999997s)]
*  humanitarian. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2093.1s)]
*  I think he could try to, he bought it because he got mad almost and then he tried to get [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2094.1s)]
*  out of it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2097.42s)]
*  But they held, that's the other thing. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2098.42s)]
*  Like stop complaining on the left. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2099.86s)]
*  He tried to withdraw from buying Twitter and the CEO or whatever stuck them to the price [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2102.3399999999997s)]
*  because it made money and they got a great price. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2107.06s)]
*  So they got a ridiculous price. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2109.2999999999997s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2111.18s)]
*  He gave them way more when it's worth and he had a mindset of going into it. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2112.18s)]
*  There was two things going on. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2116.14s)]
*  One, he believed that it's, it's very bad for democracy in general when you have suppression [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2117.2999999999997s)]
*  of free speech. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2123.2599999999998s)]
*  And I agree with that. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2124.54s)]
*  He really means that. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2125.54s)]
*  And he sees it happening to him. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2126.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2128.58s)]
*  And so he sees it happening to people that he knows and people whose voices he's respected. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2129.58s)]
*  And he saw that like the Babylon Bee got banned. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2133.94s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2137.7000000000003s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2138.7000000000003s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2139.7000000000003s)]
*  For calling Rachel Levine the man of the year. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2140.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2142.3s)]
*  A biological male, calling him the male of the year like that. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2143.3s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2146.18s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2147.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2148.18s)]
*  That's so offensive. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2149.18s)]
*  The Babylon Bee gang kicked off crazy. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2150.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2152.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2153.1s)]
*  So he was like, well, that's enough. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2154.1s)]
*  And then the reason why he tried to pull out of it, he's like, they're not giving me data [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2155.1s)]
*  the actual amount of fake accounts. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2161.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2164.06s)]
*  There was a former FBI guy, pull up that story, Jamie. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2165.06s)]
*  This former FBI guy estimated the actual amount of fake accounts on Twitter. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2167.9s)]
*  And he was like, it could be as high as 80%. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2173.1800000000003s)]
*  So if you're buying something and they say, well, it's 95% people, it's 5% bots, but we're [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2176.6s)]
*  trying to figure that out. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2180.42s)]
*  And he's like, how are you trying to figure that out? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2181.42s)]
*  Show me. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2183.3s)]
*  And they won't show him. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2184.3s)]
*  And he's like, show me your data that shows you. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2185.3s)]
*  And they show him 100 accounts. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2186.3s)]
*  They went over 100 accounts. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2188.58s)]
*  Over 80% of Twitter accounts are likely bots, former FBI security specialist, which is fucking [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2190.46s)]
*  wild. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2196.9s)]
*  So that's like 20% of the people on Twitter are actual humans and 80% of it is propaganda, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2198.4s)]
*  either by publicity firms or super PACs or whoever the fuck is trying to manipulate narratives. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2203.14s)]
*  And one of the things that you saw with Elon was like, there's a bunch of tweets that people [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2210.68s)]
*  from wildly different accounts that were all the exact same tweet. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2216.22s)]
*  And he's like, these are bots. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2220.66s)]
*  There's a thousand percent bots. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2221.98s)]
*  I mean, I went through a phase like you, I couldn't even, if I posted something, it was [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2223.98s)]
*  all bots, 100%. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2227.58s)]
*  So I don't just, there's a million percent bots. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2229.5s)]
*  They probably weren't giving the right information, but he did want to pull out. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2232.68s)]
*  Well, I think if they found out that information, Twitter would be worth substantially less. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2236.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's also what he was trying to do. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2243.42s)]
*  I think he's trying to probably talk them into a better price. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2245.7400000000002s)]
*  Because if you find out that a company is 95% horse shit or 80% horse shit and 20% what [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2249.26s)]
*  they say it is, like if that gets out, that's devastating to the company. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2256.94s)]
*  He also has such fuck you money though. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2261.66s)]
*  He was upset about the suppressing and I'd probably be the same way if I had that type [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2265.08s)]
*  of money. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2268.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm just going to fucking buy you. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2269.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's essentially what he did. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2270.98s)]
*  And I do think, like you said, the bots and going back and forth, he wanted to get out. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2272.66s)]
*  That's the one thing though, the Twitter pro-twitter, everyone's like, I'm going to get off my, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2276.8199999999997s)]
*  my dad was one of those guys. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2280.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm leaving Twitter. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2281.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like, what are you talking about, dad? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2282.3799999999997s)]
*  Why was he leaving Twitter? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2283.3799999999997s)]
*  Cause Elon, my dad, my dad, which people, my dad is like a very liberal guy, like hated [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2284.3799999999997s)]
*  Trump, hates him, hated him before he became president, just hate him. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2291.7799999999997s)]
*  So I interviewed Trump and I FaceTimed my dad. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2295.92s)]
*  I tried to keep it a secret and I like FaceTimed him when I was doing it just to see my dad's [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2298.6s)]
*  reaction. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2302.96s)]
*  He turtled, my dad turtled when he saw him. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2304.16s)]
*  He's like, Oh, hi. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2306.08s)]
*  But I mean, he hates him, hates him, but he's one of those guys and my dad's one of those [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2307.08s)]
*  guys. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2312.76s)]
*  So it's been interesting with my dad because I have been relentlessly attacked by the left [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2313.76s)]
*  and he is a left guy. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2319.4s)]
*  So we get these little things. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2321.2000000000003s)]
*  You still think the New York Times is like unbiased and he can't answer. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2323.2s)]
*  He's like, well, do you think Fox News is unbiased? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2327.2s)]
*  I'm like, no, definitely not. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2328.84s)]
*  But do you think the New York Times, he has a very hard time bringing himself to it, but [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2330.32s)]
*  it is eye opening for him, I think. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2334.04s)]
*  I think it's eye opening for a lot of people, but for a lot of people for a long time, that [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2335.96s)]
*  information never got to them. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2340.4s)]
*  They didn't really know. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2341.92s)]
*  That's one of the most substantial and significant aspects of Elon buying Twitter is these files [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2343.72s)]
*  being released where you're getting to see the actual involvement of intelligence agencies, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2350.24s)]
*  the actual like banned lists and blocked lists and shadow banned and how they're suppressing [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2355.7599999999998s)]
*  people's signals. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2362.3999999999996s)]
*  It's pretty fucking wild shit and it's almost entirely done to people that are on the right. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2363.6s)]
*  And then the people that are on the left that are dissenters, right? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2370.16s)]
*  The people that went along with the Great Barrington Declaration and didn't think that [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2373.3199999999997s)]
*  we should shut the country down during the pandemic. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2378.72s)]
*  And the Great Barrington Declaration. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2381.04s)]
*  I have no idea what that is. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2382.04s)]
*  Legitimate scientists like top of the food chain, epidemiologists, virologists who said [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2384.8799999999997s)]
*  that we are handling the pandemic absolutely wrong. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2389.72s)]
*  And then there's internal emails and memos from Fauci calling to publicly discredit these [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2392.2799999999997s)]
*  people who were legitimate, like absolute top of board scientists that were saying that [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2397.52s)]
*  this is not how you handle a viral pandemic and that we don't need to do it this way. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2405.44s)]
*  And they were suppressed. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2411.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2412.28s)]
*  See, that's one of those issues that will get I know for a fact, you suppressed on social [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2413.28s)]
*  media like COVID was the all time. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2418.0s)]
*  Like I went back and forth on it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2420.28s)]
*  Because in the beginning, like the wearing the masks, I was like, I don't know if there's [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2423.6800000000003s)]
*  science, I don't know if it's true. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2429.6800000000003s)]
*  I do know this, if there's a 0.0001% chance it can get COVID or whatever the saying gone, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2431.0s)]
*  I'll wear a fucking mask. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2438.2s)]
*  What do I care? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2439.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2440.2s)]
*  I don't think they should shut down business. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2441.2s)]
*  I thought it was totally up to them. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2442.2s)]
*  So I became pretty pro small business, let people make their own decisions. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2443.7200000000003s)]
*  But that that slant will hurt you on social media. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2449.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it would then more than it does now. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2452.4s)]
*  But as time goes on, more and more information comes out about how deceptive they were about [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2455.32s)]
*  their studies and how many actual risks there are involved in the vaccines and how much [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2460.2s)]
*  damage it did to small businesses and all that shit. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2465.0s)]
*  When that starts coming out more and more and more, there's so many people that had [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2468.72s)]
*  this like, dug their heels in stance on what is right and what is wrong. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2472.7999999999997s)]
*  And now they're being forced to reevaluate. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2477.92s)]
*  And it's also they're they're confronted with the overwhelming evidence that pharmaceutical [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2479.56s)]
*  companies have been doing this forever. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2484.68s)]
*  They've never been honest about stuff. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2486.7999999999997s)]
*  They've always hid information. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2488.56s)]
*  Not only have they hid information, they've actually the way they run their studies is [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2490.4s)]
*  so fascinating because when a when when you know, you hear like peer reviewed studies, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2494.24s)]
*  the scientists that have value peer reviewed studies from pharmaceutical companies don't [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2500.12s)]
*  get the data. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2504.2s)]
*  They get the review of the data by the pharmaceutical companies and then they studied that. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2505.8s)]
*  So do you trust anybody then? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2510.96s)]
*  Like even here, we're pulling up articles. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2513.08s)]
*  And who knows who wrote these articles? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2516.04s)]
*  I've always said about me, there's articles that we could pull up on me and I'd read it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2518.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, this guy's Hitler. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2522.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, honestly, they're that bad. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2524.3199999999997s)]
*  You and if somebody just read it and didn't do it, they'd be like, just got no shit. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2526.16s)]
*  This guy's the worst guy on the planet. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2529.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. So but that's why freedom of information is so important and freedom of expression [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2531.4399999999996s)]
*  is so important because you've got to be able to find out what's true and what's not. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2537.8399999999997s)]
*  And the only way is you get differing opinions, different perspectives. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2542.64s)]
*  Someone could write a very biased perspective on you and they're doing it on purpose. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2546.44s)]
*  It's a hit piece. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2550.92s)]
*  They're trying to make you look bad. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2551.64s)]
*  But then someone can write a glowing review that might ignore some of your flaws and some [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2553.08s)]
*  of the things you have done. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2557.08s)]
*  And that's not real either. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2558.08s)]
*  It's like you need to sort it out over time. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2559.48s)]
*  And the only way that gets done is through freedom of information, freedom of expression. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2562.04s)]
*  And if we don't have that, we're fucked because then whoever is in control of the media, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2566.2s)]
*  who's ever in control of social media or whatever the narrative is, they're the ones who [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2570.56s)]
*  get to dictate what's real and what's not real. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2574.64s)]
*  And you can convince a lot of fucking people that things aren't true. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2576.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So do you try like if you're trying to read up on something, I'm talking now the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  major outlets. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2586.16s)]
*  So whether it be you on Twitter or Facebook, but I'm going New York Times, Washington Post [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2588.2s)]
*  there one side, Fox News is the other. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2593.8799999999997s)]
*  Is there any place where you're like, I'm going to get a clean slate? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2595.52s)]
*  Not from I don't think from mainstream media. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2598.3199999999997s)]
*  I think, first of all, mainstream media is so controlled by advertising. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2601.52s)]
*  There's so many like if you know that 75 percent of all advertising on television is [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2605.6s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies, 75 percent. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2611.92s)]
*  That's a big fucking number. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2614.48s)]
*  If you think that they are going to have an unbiased negative perspective on pharmaceutical [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2616.32s)]
*  drugs or the pharmaceutical industry, that's not going to happen. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2623.16s)]
*  That they're going to suppress that because that's bad for their business. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2626.52s)]
*  It'll shut them down if they lost 75 percent of their advertising. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2629.52s)]
*  They would fucking go under. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2633.92s)]
*  Think about a company like CNN. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2635.84s)]
*  Right. CNN is already hemorrhaging money, hemorrhaging viewers. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2637.2s)]
*  I mean, they've dropped radically since Trump left office. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2641.68s)]
*  Right. If they came out and started attacking pharmaceutical companies and they lost all [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2644.48s)]
*  their ads, they're fucked. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2649.08s)]
*  So you're not going to get an unbiased, really honest perspective on anything that has to [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2651.52s)]
*  do with pharmaceutical companies when it comes to CNN or when it comes to any of these [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2657.48s)]
*  mainstream news platforms that rely on pharmaceutical companies for ads. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2662.32s)]
*  You're just not right. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2666.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't think any of those are the ones you just mentioned. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2667.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm super jaded now at this point. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2670.92s)]
*  But and then you have ideological perspectives. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2672.76s)]
*  You have the people that are in these ideological camps where you this is this and that is [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2675.6s)]
*  that. And you can't differ from you can't like have any sort of nuanced perspective or [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2681.4s)]
*  look at people that have a different point of view in a charitable way. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2687.4s)]
*  You can't do that because then you're a sympathizer or you're you're platforming these [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2691.44s)]
*  bad and evil people and you're carrying water for there's all these stupid fucking [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2696.76s)]
*  phrases that they like to use. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2701.44s)]
*  It's crazy how quick they jump. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2702.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But also they're fucking dying to like all those media companies. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2703.92s)]
*  They're nobody trust them anymore. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2709.52s)]
*  And the reason why nobody trusts them anymore is because they're not trustworthy. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2711.28s)]
*  Yeah. It's not it's like it's real simple. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2713.6800000000003s)]
*  It's real clear. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2715.64s)]
*  It's not like fucking you know. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2716.6400000000003s)]
*  So you you ask that cigar with one light up. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2718.6800000000003s)]
*  Huh. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2721.0s)]
*  Not I had a second time. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2722.28s)]
*  OK. Good. I hit it with this little lighter. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2724.36s)]
*  I just it wasn't as loud. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2726.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah it goes out. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2730.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that you know it's an interesting time though because it's caused the emergence [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2731.8s)]
*  of you. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2735.8s)]
*  Well the me. Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2737.2400000000002s)]
*  But also independent journalism like guys like Matt Ty B guys who were with these [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2738.2400000000002s)]
*  corporate news structures who left and now they're doing it on their own. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2743.72s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald you know Crystal and Sager from breaking points all these kind of [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2747.2799999999997s)]
*  people that you can trust because even if you don't agree with them you know they're [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2752.44s)]
*  not lying. That's all I need. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2756.2s)]
*  So you can you can have opinions that I don't agree with and I 100 percent support [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2758.16s)]
*  your ability to do that. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2762.08s)]
*  I don't want to I don't want to suppress people I don't agree with but I want you to [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2763.3999999999996s)]
*  be honest. I want you to tell me what the actual data says and I want and even if [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2766.64s)]
*  your perspective on that data I don't agree with at least I know you're telling me [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2770.24s)]
*  the truth. That's all I need. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2774.2799999999997s)]
*  And there's not a lot of that in mainstream media and that's why mainstream media is [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2776.2799999999997s)]
*  dying. It's too it's controlled by these corporate interests that really care more [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2779.3599999999997s)]
*  about money than they do about anything else. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2785.8399999999997s)]
*  Then like if you think that like the Washington Post or the New York Times is really [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2788.2799999999997s)]
*  just about getting out the truth. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2792.52s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2794.3999999999996s)]
*  No. And those two are extreme examples at this point. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2795.52s)]
*  They're they have an ideology that they are. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2798.3199999999997s)]
*  And what is straight. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2801.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know what the right word is. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2803.44s)]
*  If I wasn't doing what I was doing I would still because I don't pay enough close [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2805.64s)]
*  attention I would still sort of believe the New York Times was like a real thing. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2810.2s)]
*  I grew up in New York Times. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2814.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. Why would they have. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2815.8399999999997s)]
*  If I didn't have a podcast and I didn't talk to people all the time and talk to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2817.24s)]
*  people from different walks of life and different perspectives and different [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2820.96s)]
*  careers I would have no idea. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2826.48s)]
*  I would have no idea if I was just a comic I wouldn't I would kind of vaguely know [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2828.76s)]
*  that they're probably corrupt. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2832.52s)]
*  You know vaguely know that they're full of shit. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2834.12s)]
*  But if I read something I was like oh my god this is terrible. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2835.44s)]
*  I would just take it at face value. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2837.84s)]
*  Especially if you have a regular job where you don't have the time to be looking into [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2839.92s)]
*  this shit. You're busy all day and then maybe you have a family and obligations and [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2843.68s)]
*  fucking bills that are piling up and you don't have the time to be sorting out [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2848.76s)]
*  whether or not the Washington Post is being honest about gender affirming care. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2852.52s)]
*  And then on top of that what like Twitter is not the real world. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2857.12s)]
*  It's important. But you step outside you walk down the street and most people don't [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2862.7200000000003s)]
*  even know what's going on at Twitter. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2867.52s)]
*  There is it's you wearing it. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2868.7200000000003s)]
*  So you see it and you pay attention what people are saying. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2870.68s)]
*  But I always if I'm in the center of a controversy something's going on I focus [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2874.12s)]
*  like oh my god the world. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2880.64s)]
*  Everything's happening here. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2882.16s)]
*  And then you go outside nobody knows. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2883.48s)]
*  I think Twitter's radioactive. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2884.88s)]
*  I think you can stay in it and you'll get sick. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2887.56s)]
*  That's what I think. I think. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2890.7999999999997s)]
*  But if you just visit briefly and get the fuck out of there and then take care of [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2891.88s)]
*  yourself you're going to be all right. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2894.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think it's good for people. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2896.44s)]
*  It's the old Rickie Dreyfus is like my favorite comedian of all time. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2898.6s)]
*  He had a quote. Do you like Rickie Dreyfus. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2902.88s)]
*  Yeah it's great. He had what was the he has one about Twitter that the someone [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2904.52s)]
*  posts something in a town square. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2909.6s)]
*  I'm botching his line has nothing to do with you but people run up to it just to [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2911.3199999999997s)]
*  complain about it. That's kind of it. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2915.12s)]
*  Yeah it's talk is an echo chamber. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2916.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a toxic. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2918.44s)]
*  It's also I think legitimately bad for mental health to communicate that way to [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2919.44s)]
*  communicate just through text and it's almost all of it is aggressive and almost [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2924.56s)]
*  all of it is insulting and almost all of it is disparaging of people. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2927.92s)]
*  The amount of like anti or negative tweets versus positive tweets. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2931.52s)]
*  I mean I wonder if anybody's done a study of that like how much negative tweeting [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2936.12s)]
*  versus positive tweeting probably I guess like 90 percent. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2939.32s)]
*  It's probably somewhere like that. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2942.84s)]
*  It's just bad for you. It's bad for you too. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2944.36s)]
*  If you if you went to a bar and every time you went to a bar people were fucking [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2946.48s)]
*  arguing and screaming at each other you'd be like fuck this bar. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2950.32s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2953.0800000000004s)]
*  It's a fun. I want to go have a good time. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2953.56s)]
*  I don't want to be around these people. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2955.56s)]
*  It's it's not a normal way for human beings to communicate whether not looking at [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2957.0800000000004s)]
*  each other across the table having a drink just looking at each other as another [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2961.28s)]
*  human appreciating each other as a person a human being. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2966.68s)]
*  When you just see text on a screen and you like I'm going to fuck this guy up and [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2970.4s)]
*  you go and it's easy to do it. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2973.92s)]
*  Yeah. You can say whatever you want. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2976.16s)]
*  There's been plenty of times I've seen examples where someone tracks down like [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2979.2s)]
*  the commenter and then the commenter apologizes. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2983.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh I didn't know you'd say you know it's a different it's a different mentality [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2986.16s)]
*  when you get to that. Of course. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2988.92s)]
*  It's not normal. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2990.24s)]
*  Humans are supposed to communicate with words in front of each other. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2991.44s)]
*  That's how we're supposed to. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2994.56s)]
*  That's how we evolved. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2995.44s)]
*  That's what we're capable of understanding and appreciating. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=2997.16s)]
*  You know and you know when someone's bullshitting you and you know when someone's [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3000.64s)]
*  like got a secret agenda like this guy's kind of a creep. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  You get it. You know and then you get some people like I really like talking to that [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3006.3999999999996s)]
*  guy and then you can't wait to talk to him again. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3009.8399999999997s)]
*  And then you kind of have an agreement when you see each other you know that he likes [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3011.8399999999997s)]
*  you and you know that you like him and you know he's a nice guy and he knows you're a [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3015.2s)]
*  nice guy and you're gentle. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3018.24s)]
*  Let me buy a drink. All right let's have a drink. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3019.72s)]
*  And you never know. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3021.3999999999996s)]
*  Twitter it's like you could be getting worked up on what like an eight year old says. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3022.36s)]
*  You have no idea. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3025.56s)]
*  Or a bot. Yeah. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3026.52s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3027.88s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3029.16s)]
*  And there's these Macedonian fucking troll farms so they have thousands and thousands [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3030.04s)]
*  of accounts and they're just trying to undermine democracy 24 hours a day. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3034.4s)]
*  And they're literally being state sponsored to do that. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3038.28s)]
*  There's that too. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3041.12s)]
*  And that riles people up. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3042.36s)]
*  You know they found out that like 19 the top 20 Christian sites on Facebook were run [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3043.88s)]
*  by troll farms. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3048.28s)]
*  No I didn't know that. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3049.36s)]
*  19. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3050.44s)]
*  So there's 19 out of the top 20 Facebook Christian pages that are not real. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3051.68s)]
*  All they are is riling up people against whatever it is Islamic people or gay people [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3057.92s)]
*  or transgender people whatever it is. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3063.56s)]
*  They're just trying to get people to argue about shit getting people angry about shit. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3066.16s)]
*  It's really easy to do that too. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3070.88s)]
*  Very easy. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3072.2s)]
*  So the I think the solution is post and ghost post shit that you want. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3073.52s)]
*  Don't read the comments get the fuck out of there and don't engage in back and forth [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3078.04s)]
*  disagreements with people. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3081.92s)]
*  I don't so much either. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3083.2s)]
*  I don't. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3084.36s)]
*  But so much easier said than done so many people you preach that it's hard to do. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3084.92s)]
*  I very hard to do. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3090.28s)]
*  And also like I have a podcast so I can actually sit down and talk to people which most [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3091.12s)]
*  people don't have. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3095.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3095.84s)]
*  So you don't have that opportunity to work things out with someone to try to find out [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3096.08s)]
*  what they really feel what they believe face to face in front of them. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3099.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3102.96s)]
*  It's the best way to talk. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3103.44s)]
*  It's the best way to communicate ideas. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3104.68s)]
*  And so I don't communicate ideas in a piss poor way because I think that way sucks. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3106.56s)]
*  And so if I get to do the best way all the time which I do why would I engage in the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3111.76s)]
*  worst way like just back and forth with people on Twitter that just want to make you feel [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3116.2400000000002s)]
*  bad like not interested in that. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3121.16s)]
*  Do you have any dream guests. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3123.52s)]
*  No none. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3124.92s)]
*  Never. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3126.84s)]
*  No. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3127.48s)]
*  I like talking to people. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3129.64s)]
*  I don't care who they are. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3130.64s)]
*  I mean I like talking to my friends. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3132.0s)]
*  I like talking to I had a lady in recently that was a beekeeper. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3133.64s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3137.36s)]
*  Had a guy the other day that he has a giant piece of land Alaska and they're finding [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3138.24s)]
*  a lot of that holy mammoth bones like that. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3142.64s)]
*  I like that. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3144.36s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3145.12s)]
*  I like talking to fighters like talking to you. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3146.08s)]
*  I like talking to whoever. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3148.4s)]
*  I just like talking to people. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3149.84s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3150.7999999999997s)]
*  I like seeing how different people see this world. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3151.64s)]
*  It enhances my perspective. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3155.56s)]
*  I've gotten through this podcast a very unexpected and accidental education. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3157.56s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3163.08s)]
*  So because of that I don't have any desire to communicate in an ineffective way that [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3164.96s)]
*  makes me feel bad and read a bunch of mean things that people say about you and just [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3168.52s)]
*  go back and forth of them and like saying things that's not true. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3172.64s)]
*  It's like you're welcome to have your thoughts. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3175.64s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3178.6s)]
*  Good way to engage in that. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3179.0s)]
*  See I'm like a petty person. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3180.56s)]
*  I'm quite petty actually. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3184.8799999999997s)]
*  So like if somebody says something I don't like not once but if someone says it a bunch [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3186.48s)]
*  I keep a record. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3194.6s)]
*  I keep a mental record. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3196.04s)]
*  Champagne bottles. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3200.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah that I became that's something. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3201.2s)]
*  So I had champagne but I have champagne bottles engraved with the top the list enemies of [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3203.96s)]
*  mine and I wait for them to fuck up and then I pop them. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3212.52s)]
*  So like the most famous example of that is John Skipper the old ESPN guy. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3218.52s)]
*  I don't know who that is. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3224.0s)]
*  He ran ESPN. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3224.8s)]
*  Dana just talked about the other day because he said he was anti-MMA. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3226.6s)]
*  The deal never would have happened. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3229.88s)]
*  He ran ESPN. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3231.4s)]
*  So we had a show on ESPN Barstool Van Talk and it maybe set a record last one episode. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3232.8s)]
*  He canceled it for things we said which in hindsight I wish we didn't say him the way we [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3240.2799999999997s)]
*  did but it was years in the past. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3245.64s)]
*  So we launched one episode ESPN had a multi a little uprising about doing business with [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3248.4399999999996s)]
*  us and they canceled out the one episode they didn't tell us. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3254.0s)]
*  And John Skipper was quoted as saying I didn't realize Barstool Van Talk that was the name [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3258.04s)]
*  of the show Barstool Van Talk would be associated with Barstool. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3263.3599999999997s)]
*  That was a direct quote he had. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3266.8399999999997s)]
*  So we put him on a champagne bottle literally like three days later he got blackmailed by his [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3269.88s)]
*  coke dealer. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3275.7599999999998s)]
*  Supposedly this is what happened. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3276.72s)]
*  It had to step down. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3278.48s)]
*  According to John it's the only time he used this guy. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3280.2s)]
*  He found a random coke dealer off the street. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3283.64s)]
*  Impossible to believe. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3285.8399999999997s)]
*  He got blackmailed. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3287.04s)]
*  So he popped the champagne bottle. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3288.04s)]
*  It was like it was perfect timing. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3290.04s)]
*  He had to leave ESPN because of a coke dealer. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3291.7999999999997s)]
*  That's that's the story. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3294.52s)]
*  That's the story. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3296.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3297.88s)]
*  And they went over to run Dazon. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3299.4s)]

*  That was almost the last time I believe the media would be fair. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3315.92s)]
*  It wasn't. It was a hit piece. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  But they showed the champagne bottle so people became aware of it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3320.72s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3324.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah that's funny. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3325.24s)]

*  Skipper 62 the married father of two sons was raised in North Carolina. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3383.72s)]
*  I don't give a fuck where he's. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3386.68s)]
*  Twenty seven years at Disney. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3387.96s)]
*  They washed down the toilet for a little coke. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3389.2s)]
*  Meanwhile you look at the body of work that he did. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3391.7599999999998s)]
*  Did he do a good job. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3393.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3394.68s)]
*  But I mean if you kept him fucking hired for that long I would assume he was doing [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3395.52s)]
*  good work. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3398.88s)]
*  Fucking knuckleheads. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3400.0s)]
*  He says he did it on his own. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3400.68s)]
*  That he resigned. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3402.08s)]
*  It's a little blow. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3403.04s)]
*  Who cares. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3403.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I wrote that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3404.72s)]
*  Most likely. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3406.4s)]
*  How did I phrase it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3408.92s)]
*  Not necessarily do it but like people act like coke. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3410.0s)]
*  I don't know what they act like. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3413.56s)]
*  It's like if you haven't been around coke in your life you're probably a loser. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3414.8399999999997s)]
*  Like honestly if you haven't been around it I'm not gonna say do it. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3418.7599999999998s)]
*  But if you haven't been around it at least once you're probably not the most fun [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3421.64s)]
*  person ever. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3425.68s)]
*  Yeah I've been around it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3426.96s)]
*  I've never done it but I had a friend in high school and his cousin was addicted to [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3428.0s)]
*  coke. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3431.8399999999997s)]
*  And this was like when I was there's a formative period of my life when I was doing [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3432.7599999999998s)]
*  martial arts. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3437.24s)]
*  And for the longest time like from age 15 to 21 I did no partying. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3438.48s)]
*  I did not all I did was train. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3444.44s)]
*  I mean I trained every day. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3446.28s)]
*  I just like ate clean. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3447.92s)]
*  I slept well. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3450.04s)]
*  I did. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3451.76s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3452.08s)]
*  15 to 21. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3452.88s)]
*  From 15 to 21. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3454.08s)]
*  Those were like you know high school. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3455.68s)]
*  How did you get into that. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3457.12s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3458.76s)]
*  Well I was bullied like most people. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3460.04s)]
*  You know I didn't know how to fight. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3462.56s)]
*  I was scared. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3463.92s)]
*  And I was like I need to learn how to fight. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3464.96s)]
*  And I joined a martial arts school and I just got obsessed with it. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3466.68s)]
*  Because that's early. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3471.04s)]
*  Like that the reason I'm asking that's before the trend of MMA. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3471.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah but martial arts had always been around and you know I was a big Bruce Lee fan Chuck [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3475.0s)]
*  Norris fan. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3478.8799999999997s)]
*  Watched a bunch of those movies and shit. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3480.04s)]
*  And I thought God man amazing to do that. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3481.64s)]
*  How cool would it be to be able to do that. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3484.2s)]
*  And then I watched a bunch of kickboxing matches and I got into it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3485.56s)]
*  And then coming home from a Red Sox game. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3488.72s)]
*  It's a crazy story. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3491.64s)]
*  I would have already been taken karate a little bit but it was too far from my house. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3493.12s)]
*  It was hard to get there. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3497.56s)]
*  My parents didn't want to drive me. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3498.48s)]
*  And this place was right off the tee. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3500.2000000000003s)]
*  So I was at Fenway Park with a buddy of mine would see a baseball game and then I was like [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3503.08s)]
*  14 or 15. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3507.4s)]
*  And when we were walking home from the baseball game there was so many people waiting in [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3508.6s)]
*  line for the tee. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3512.8s)]
*  You know it is. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3513.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3514.28s)]
*  So we decided to just fucking walk upstairs and see what this Taekwondo school was all [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3515.32s)]
*  about. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3521.0s)]
*  And as I was walking up the stairs I was hearing the sound and it was like whoop. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3521.76s)]
*  Chink. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3527.48s)]
*  Like it was a whoop chink. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3528.28s)]
*  And what it was was this guy kicking this heavy bag and the bag was flying and the [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3530.84s)]
*  kachink was the chains that was holding the bag. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3536.52s)]
*  And I got up there at the top of the stairs and watched this guy John Lee who was the [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3539.8s)]
*  national champion who was training for the World Cup. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3545.88s)]
*  So he's had it is peak of training and he was doing a spinning back kick over and over [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3549.48s)]
*  again into this heavy bag. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3557.08s)]
*  And I remember watching it and I could not believe what he could do. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3559.44s)]
*  I couldn't believe the power that this guy could generate in that kick. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3564.3599999999997s)]
*  And he became like a mentor to me. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3569.24s)]
*  And this guy who was like this wild street guy from Chelsea Massachusetts who was this [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3571.44s)]
*  elite Taekwondo fighter. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3577.08s)]
*  He wasn't like you know like bow like he was like hey what's up man what the fuck you [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3578.32s)]

*  He would like eat food right before he fought. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3584.68s)]
*  Fuck these people man I'm gonna fuck these dudes up. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3587.2799999999997s)]
*  He was a street guy who was really good at martial arts. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3589.44s)]
*  I mean he bowed and said yes sir to everybody and all that stuff. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3592.12s)]
*  But when people were not around he was just cool. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3594.92s)]
*  He was hanging out. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3598.2799999999997s)]
*  He had drug problems. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3599.08s)]
*  There was a lot going on. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3600.44s)]
*  But in that moment where I saw him he was in the he was 27 years old. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3601.32s)]
*  He was in the prime of his career and he was the lead of the elite. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3606.12s)]
*  And that's how he got hooked. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3609.7200000000003s)]
*  I got hooked. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3610.96s)]

*  Yeah I became obsessed. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3619.7200000000003s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3621.52s)]
*  So I didn't want to do anything that fucked me up. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3622.2400000000002s)]
*  And my friend Jimmy his cousin was selling coke. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3625.44s)]
*  And I knew his cousin Mike from like when he wasn't selling coke like he was a [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3629.36s)]
*  mechanic. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3634.16s)]
*  He's a cool guy. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3634.6800000000003s)]
*  You know fix my car for me. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3635.7599999999998s)]

*  We hang out with him. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3639.24s)]
*  And then him and his girl got into coke bad. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3640.4s)]
*  He was selling coke. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3642.36s)]
*  And then he was just fucking just emaciated. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3643.2799999999997s)]
*  He looked like he got bit by a vampire. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3645.68s)]
*  And they would hide in there. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3647.56s)]
*  They had an attic apartment. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3648.52s)]
*  They would just go in that attic apartment do coke every day. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3650.0s)]
*  And I was like fuck coke. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3652.12s)]
*  That's hardcore to get hooked like that. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3654.4s)]
*  He got hooked. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3656.68s)]
*  Well he was also selling it. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3657.56s)]
*  So he had all this access to coke. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3659.04s)]
*  But it was people in the neighborhood. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3661.04s)]
*  I saw them doing coke and they just wanted to do coke all the time. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3662.68s)]
*  They wanted to get out and do coke. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3664.96s)]
*  And as a kid who was like finally I was a loser my whole life. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3666.64s)]
*  And then finally when I was 15 I found this thing that I got obsessed with that [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3671.76s)]
*  changed the way people looked at me. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3676.28s)]
*  Like I was now all of a sudden I was good at something like really good at [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3677.88s)]
*  something. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3680.44s)]
*  And then I became state champion four years in a row and I won the U.S. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3680.92s)]
*  Open and I won these national tournaments and it was a big fucking deal for me. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3684.28s)]
*  So I was like I am not doing anything to jeopardize that. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3688.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3690.88s)]
*  And coke to me was the big one. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3691.28s)]
*  Like I knew that that was it. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3693.16s)]
*  I feel like if I got drunk in which I did occasionally I would feel like shit the [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3694.4s)]
*  next day. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3699.1600000000003s)]
*  I couldn't train well. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3699.56s)]
*  I was hung over and I'd get beat up and sparring. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3701.28s)]
*  I was like I can't do this. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3704.2000000000003s)]
*  So I just caught most partying like I smoked pot a handful of times. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3705.44s)]
*  I got drunk a handful of times during high school and in my early 20s. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3710.32s)]
*  And then I just in the comedy world. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3714.96s)]
*  Coke was a problem with there too. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3718.1200000000003s)]
*  I sue I saw all when I used to work at Nick's Comedy Stop in Boston. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3719.96s)]
*  Yeah sure. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3723.4s)]
*  And they offered to pay me in coke or money like when you work there for a weekend [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3724.4s)]
*  like you want to get paid in coke you want to get paid. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3730.4s)]
*  And even trade like same amount of coke. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3732.2400000000002s)]
*  The dollar value. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3734.56s)]
*  Some guys went half half. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3735.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah some guys went half half. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3735.92s)]
*  Yes if you like it it's easy access. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3737.88s)]
*  There were so many guys that got hooked on coke. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3740.28s)]
*  I knew so many guys that had coke problems. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3742.1600000000003s)]
*  Then I was like that is a pitfall. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3744.08s)]
*  Like I wanted to succeed and I felt like that was one. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3745.6400000000003s)]
*  And also it was a drug that got you hyped up. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3749.36s)]
*  I like being hyped up. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3751.76s)]
*  And my friend Jimmy said to me he goes don't do coke. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3754.0s)]
*  You'll like it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3756.28s)]
*  I was like oh no. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3757.32s)]
*  I'll never forget this. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3759.6800000000003s)]
*  It was me and my friend Steve. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3760.96s)]
*  We were driving home from Kelly's roast beef in Revere Massachusetts. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3762.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're overrated. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3767.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah a little overrated. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3768.6400000000003s)]
*  The beef is but yeah the clams are pretty good. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3769.96s)]
*  So we were we were driving and there was a car next to us and they had the dome [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3772.44s)]

*  I mean that's Revere Beach. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3789.28s)]
*  But that's coke too. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3790.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3791.28s)]
*  I was like no coke. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3791.84s)]
*  And then I also had another buddy who got arrested who was selling coke and he got [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3793.48s)]
*  arrested for murder. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3798.28s)]
*  And this was a scary murder where they beat. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3799.92s)]
*  How close were you with this guy. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3802.8s)]
*  He's a training partner of mine. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3804.48s)]
*  Yeah I knew him very well. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3806.52s)]
*  I don't think he did that murder. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3807.88s)]
*  He might have did that murder. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3809.16s)]
*  I know he won't. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3810.3199999999997s)]
*  He did some shit. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3811.4799999999996s)]
*  He went up going to jail. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3812.7599999999998s)]
*  He went to jail for quite a long time. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3814.08s)]
*  Quite a few years and then he came out and he was just a totally different person. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3816.52s)]
*  He came out super jacked and all he had a bunch of like really bad tattoos and all [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3820.2s)]
*  of them were now these heavy keloid scars like he had like burned off his tattoos [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3824.7999999999997s)]
*  or cut off his tattoos or some shit. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3830.52s)]
*  I don't know what he did in prison. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3832.3599999999997s)]
*  He was real vague about it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3833.8799999999997s)]
*  But when he came out like he was a fucking different human. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3835.4399999999996s)]
*  He was an animal. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3839.08s)]
*  You didn't want if you sparred him like when we sparred they weren't sparring [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3839.96s)]
*  matches they were fights like they were full on fights like we would spar like we [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3843.56s)]
*  were trying to kill each other. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3848.92s)]
*  It was very dangerous. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3850.0s)]
*  And he was doing I know he was selling coke and doing coke and then he got arrested [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3851.6800000000003s)]
*  for this murder where they took this guy. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3857.7200000000003s)]
*  And again I don't know if he did it but he did he did get arrested and then [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3861.4s)]
*  released. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3865.6s)]
*  They broke all the bones in this guy's body with a hammer and they kept injecting [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3866.52s)]
*  him with cocaine to keep him awake. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3872.04s)]
*  What. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3874.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3874.96s)]
*  And then they cut his hands off and they cut his head off and then they left his [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3876.12s)]
*  body somewhere. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3880.44s)]
*  And I think the idea of cutting his hands off was to hide his fingerprints and then [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3881.56s)]
*  this dude got arrested for that crime. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3885.64s)]
*  And I was like so it was more evidence to me like coke is fucking crazy business. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3888.36s)]
*  I mean. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3893.56s)]

*  Yeah they cut his head off cut his hands off. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3904.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3908.2s)]
*  You know that's like pretty bad. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3909.2s)]
*  It's the baddest of the bad. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3910.7599999999998s)]
*  It's horrible shit. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3912.24s)]
*  But I knew a lot of guys like that I knew a lot of because of the martial arts there [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3913.72s)]
*  was a lot of like really tough guys that gravitated towards. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3918.6s)]
*  Truly hope you didn't know a lot of guys like that. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3921.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't know a lot of guys like that but I knew I knew guys who were hit men. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3924.2799999999997s)]
*  I knew a guy was a hit man for whitey bulger. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3928.72s)]
*  I trained him. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3932.16s)]
*  I trained him I remember like teaching him shit because I was once after like a year [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3933.44s)]
*  or two of doing taekwondo. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3938.12s)]
*  My instructor offered me a job and I was basically like teaching the younger like [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3940.72s)]
*  lower belt classes teaching them basic techniques and I would teach like early classes [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3948.08s)]
*  and kids classes and stuff like that in exchange for training. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3953.04s)]
*  So I didn't have to pay for training anymore and I get a key to the school I could go [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3956.96s)]
*  anytime I want. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3960.8s)]
*  It was like they would do that with like the prospects people that they thought really [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3962.2400000000002s)]
*  could have a potential. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3967.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I was teaching a lot of people and I was teaching this one guy and I remember [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3968.96s)]
*  he goes he wanted to kill somebody where would you hit him. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3972.68s)]
*  It was like a real question. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3976.0s)]
*  It wasn't like an asshole just fucking around like if I was going to kill somebody is like [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3977.24s)]
*  if you want to kill somebody where would you hit him. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3981.3999999999996s)]
*  I was like the neck maybe. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3984.2799999999997s)]
*  I think so too probably the neck. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3985.72s)]
*  What a crew you're running. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3987.6s)]
*  It was very strange. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3988.6s)]
*  Well I was most people were respectable but it's like you know if you have hundreds and [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3989.6s)]
*  hundreds of students and your your your business is teaching people how to fuck people [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3993.12s)]
*  up you're going to get bad people that want to learn those skills. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=3996.72s)]
*  That guy went away and I knew a couple of guys who went away who were in the south [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4000.12s)]
*  Boston mob. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4005.24s)]
*  That was the reason why Dana moved out of Boston the south Boston mob. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4006.68s)]
*  They were they were shaking him down when he's running a boxing gym. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4010.04s)]
*  It was scary. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4014.32s)]
*  There was scary fucking people. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4014.88s)]
*  That's the whitey bulger situation because he was in bed with the FBI. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4016.0s)]
*  They were letting him kill people. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4019.96s)]
*  They were letting him sell drugs. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4021.56s)]
*  The party. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4022.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4023.88s)]

*  That's real. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4026.84s)]
*  Like that was all going on when I was a kid in Boston and I was connected to people [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4027.64s)]
*  that wound up like a good friend of mine who was a comic. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4033.1600000000003s)]
*  His brother was in whitey bulger's crew and wound up getting arrested and going to [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4035.6800000000003s)]
*  jail. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4040.36s)]
*  His brother that I knew very well from the gym. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4041.04s)]
*  So I knew a few of those guys. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4043.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4046.56s)]
*  I don't have any of those stories. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4048.08s)]
*  I grew up in a little suburb. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4049.32s)]
*  I did too. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4050.44s)]
*  Granted. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4051.1600000000003s)]
*  I grew up in Newton. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4052.2400000000002s)]
*  I was in living. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4053.2400000000002s)]

*  No but but she's the school was in Boston. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4054.8s)]
*  So I would go into Boston and most of my friends were from the inner city. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4058.44s)]
*  Most of my friends were from Chelsea and you know Dorchester and and these you know [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4062.64s)]
*  young tough kids who would come from these you know bad neighborhoods and bad [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4068.7999999999997s)]
*  households. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4073.04s)]
*  Those are the ones that made the best fighters. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4073.48s)]
*  Well that's still true. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4076.2s)]

*  Still getting. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4083.6s)]
*  That's how I kept the fuck away from coke. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4084.2s)]
*  People don't believe me. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4087.16s)]
*  They think I'm lying. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4088.04s)]
*  Why would I lie. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4088.96s)]
*  I'd lie. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4089.52s)]
*  I tell the truth about everything. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4089.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah people always. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4091.12s)]
*  There was a phase where everyone called me a coke and I'm not like I've handful. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4092.12s)]
*  This is a bar stool like people make fun of it but I've done coke less than a [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4096.76s)]
*  handful of times. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4100.8s)]
*  Adderall. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4101.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4101.92s)]
*  Coke. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4102.52s)]
*  No. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4102.8s)]
*  Well my friend Duncan Trussell has a great joke about Adderall. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4103.68s)]
*  The Adderall is like someone did coke and they were scientists and they're like I [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4107.4s)]
*  can fix this. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4111.04s)]
*  No Adderall. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4112.92s)]
*  I was warned even for this podcast. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4114.0s)]
*  They're like don't do too much Adderall. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4117.08s)]
*  You'll talk too much. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4118.32s)]
*  It's like but I did a little. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4119.12s)]
*  How much do you do. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4121.12s)]
*  I've toned it down but like you know a 30 a day. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4122.76s)]
*  If I if I have to think it makes me feel like I can cure cancer. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4126.88s)]
*  Really. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4130.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4131.12s)]
*  Makes me I love it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4131.32s)]
*  Like I don't get jittery. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4132.24s)]
*  Like at least I don't think I do. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4133.5199999999995s)]
*  Coffee Adderall I like. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4134.96s)]
*  It gets the brain going. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4136.2s)]
*  But I have tried to wean off of it because I don't want it not to work when I need it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4137.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4140.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4141.44s)]
*  So you want it to be a tool. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4141.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4143.12s)]
*  Well we were just looking that up last night and we were trying to figure out how [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4143.84s)]
*  many people are on Adderall and there was 41 million prescriptions I think in 2020. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4147.56s)]
*  Forty one million. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4153.72s)]
*  How many how many of those are fake. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4154.72s)]
*  No it's like how many people are doing it. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4157.56s)]
*  If you have 41 million prescriptions like well you get a prescription like if you get [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4159.92s)]
*  a prescription is it for 30 days or for 60 days. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4164.200000000001s)]
*  Like how many prescriptions do you get a year. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4166.76s)]
*  Like how many humans are we talking. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4168.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4169.56s)]
*  I mean that's 41 million prescriptions like how many people. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4170.8s)]
*  If it's 41 million people on Adderall we get a fucking messed up country. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4174.92s)]
*  You know everyone's like you'll wait. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4180.08s)]
*  I mean for documentation that it's really bad for you but who knows. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4181.96s)]
*  Well is coffee really bad. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4186.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean I think coffee is good for you. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4188.32s)]
*  Some of it. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4189.76s)]
*  I've gone to war on this coffee. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4191.5199999999995s)]
*  There's studies say like it's pretty good for you. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4192.88s)]
*  There's some studies that say it's bad for you. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4195.92s)]
*  Well that's they used to say that it's you know I know everything. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4197.84s)]
*  But now they find out that coffee actually can hydrate you. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4200.5599999999995s)]
*  That I don't believe. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4202.92s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4204.04s)]
*  It's liquid. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4205.16s)]
*  Coffee hydrates you. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4206.68s)]
*  I see that's it can't. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4207.8s)]
*  I know what it does to me. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4209.8s)]
*  But it makes you urinate because it does it is in some ways it dehydrates you [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4210.84s)]
*  because it is a stimulant but you're also drinking in so much liquid that it [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4216.68s)]
*  doesn't dehydrate you. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4221.0s)]
*  Like people Google that make sure that's true. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4222.4800000000005s)]
*  I think you can find both. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4224.64s)]
*  I think you can find both. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4226.400000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4227.28s)]
*  Does coffee hydrate you. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4227.8s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4228.84s)]
*  Coffee does count towards your daily water intake. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4230.0s)]
*  However drinking huge amounts of caffeine can be dehydrated. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4232.28s)]
*  That may be from big coffee though. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4235.4s)]
*  That's because the increase in urination can result in a higher risk of [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4237.8s)]
*  dehydration. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4241.24s)]
*  I don't think it is a coffee website. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4242.04s)]
*  I don't think it's from big coffee. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4244.719999999999s)]
*  But the thing is like I don't think they need to say coffee is OK. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4246.32s)]
*  Everybody's hooked on coffee. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4250.88s)]
*  I fucking love the stuff. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4253.8s)]
*  Caffeinated drink mayo seems can contribute to your daily food. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4255.88s)]
*  Listen I'm a coffee guy so the better the I am too. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4260.320000000001s)]

*  He has it's time. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4605.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4606.44s)]
*  You go to a UFC fight the whole audience. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4607.08s)]
*  They do it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4609.6s)]
*  Cheers with they do it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4610.04s)]
*  I know you're right. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4612.320000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4614.360000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4615.0s)]
*  It's just different because let's get ready to rumble was the first. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4615.4800000000005s)]
*  It was iconic. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4618.72s)]
*  Let's get ready to rumble. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4619.88s)]
*  And he has a beautiful silky smooth voice. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4622.120000000001s)]
*  Michael Buffer's voice is fantastic. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4626.200000000001s)]
*  They're very different deliveries. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4628.04s)]
*  Very different. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4629.360000000001s)]
*  But Bruce is perfect for cage fighting. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4630.56s)]
*  That's Bruce. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4633.4400000000005s)]
*  Let me hear. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4633.96s)]
*  He looks like he's 12. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4635.400000000001s)]
*  I thought Buffer had the potential. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4637.6s)]
*  He's about him. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4639.280000000001s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4639.8s)]
*  Oh it's a documentary about Jeremy Horn. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4640.72s)]
*  That's the old did you watch the original UFC's. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4643.92s)]
*  I mean like when hoist Gracie would like beat people in his. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4646.64s)]
*  What do they call the guard. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4651.08s)]
*  No the kimono. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4653.08s)]
*  He choked him out in the key. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4654.68s)]
*  You don't know what happened. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4656.96s)]
*  Well the key is brilliant for a jujitsu player because the key makes people grab it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4658.04s)]
*  They grab it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4662.52s)]
*  They don't even just instinctively there's clothes there you grab it and then he just [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4663.120000000001s)]
*  drags you into his world. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4666.52s)]
*  And he beat like five guys in a night. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4667.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4669.120000000001s)]
*  I didn't find out about the UFC until UFC 2. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4669.88s)]
*  I had heard about it and then I watched UFC 2. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4672.64s)]
*  I rented it like a blockbuster or something. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4677.52s)]
*  And I remember immediately I was like oh my god. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4680.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah I was hooked right away on it too. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4682.400000000001s)]
*  Also it was like an eye opening experience because I was a kickboxer. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4684.040000000001s)]
*  So I was a stand up fighter. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4687.88s)]
*  I was a striker. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4688.92s)]
*  And then I was watching this guy just grab a hold of people and get them to the [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4690.040000000001s)]
*  ground and trip him. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4692.68s)]
*  I'm like is it that easy. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4693.360000000001s)]
*  Is that easy to fuck me up. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4695.080000000001s)]
*  I wrestled in high school for a year like maybe I could stand up on my feet. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4696.44s)]
*  And then I went to jujitsu classes and got mauled and I was like oh my god I'm [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4700.12s)]
*  helpless. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4705.24s)]
*  Like I had this totally distorted perception of my abilities. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4706.12s)]
*  I was like I'm a good kickboxer. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4709.839999999999s)]
*  If someone comes up to me I'll fuck them up. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4712.04s)]
*  And I had this whole idea in my head. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  And then like jujitsu like I'm sure it's good and everything but I could avoid all [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4715.44s)]
*  their bullshit. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4719.08s)]
*  No I got just mauled and manhandled. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4720.599999999999s)]
*  I remember thinking like after a few classes like oh my god I'm fucking helpless [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4723.799999999999s)]
*  and I thought I wasn't. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4729.44s)]
*  That's most people. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4730.92s)]
*  Most people have this idea in their head like oh my fucking mentality I see red [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4731.92s)]
*  body start dropping. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4736.0s)]
*  Like you're helpless. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4737.679999999999s)]
*  You're like a child. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4739.5599999999995s)]
*  You're a child to someone who knows how to fight. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4740.16s)]
*  You really don't know until you experience it. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4742.96s)]
*  And so I think what UFC did is it opened everybody's eyes to jujitsu and how [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4745.839999999999s)]
*  effective jujitsu is and how it's so much different than every other martial art [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4751.32s)]
*  because like if you're a good athlete and you're strong you can hit hard. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4754.96s)]
*  There's always like a swinging chance if you're in a fight with someone and you [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4759.16s)]
*  sucker punch them or something happens. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4763.48s)]
*  But in a jujitsu match or a guy was a jujitsu black belt there's no chance for [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4765.639999999999s)]
*  like a lucky submission. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4770.36s)]
*  There's no chance for you winning. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4772.28s)]
*  You have zero chance. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4774.2s)]
*  They if they clinch you you're fucked. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4775.639999999999s)]
*  You don't even know how to stop it. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4778.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't know what to do. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4780.599999999999s)]
*  All of a sudden you're tripped. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4782.36s)]
*  You're inside control. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4783.5599999999995s)]
*  You're like what is this. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4784.839999999999s)]
*  Why is this knee on my chest. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4786.04s)]
*  I still don't know watching it. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4787.04s)]
*  Like I've been ringside for a couple of I don't know enough about it. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4788.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't even know when someone's necessarily in trouble. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4793.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4795.839999999999s)]
*  It's like because I'm a novice watching it. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4796.08s)]
*  So well they used to have these earpieces that they would hand out. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4797.5199999999995s)]
*  There was sell at the concession stand. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4801.28s)]
*  It was like a little local radio and you could put it on. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4803.36s)]
*  You can hear the commentary which is great. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4806.28s)]
*  And there. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4808.759999999999s)]
*  But I don't know what happened. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4809.12s)]
*  They stopped doing that. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4810.08s)]
*  It would be a good thing for people to have because it's like I think if I was [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4811.12s)]
*  watching in the audience I think I might also buy it on ESPN plus and then listen [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4815.4s)]
*  to the commentary and like an air pod. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4822.24s)]
*  I think that's the way to do it because like when Daniel Cormier is explaining [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4824.4s)]
*  wrestling like to this day when he's explaining shit to me like I'm all ears [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4828.2s)]
*  when he's talking about clinch positions and you know what's important and what [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4833.0s)]
*  what a person has to do in this spot or that spot. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4837.0s)]
*  And then when it goes to the ground like when I'm explaining transitions and I'm [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4839.8s)]
*  explaining when someone's OK when they're not OK and now they're fucked. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4843.4400000000005s)]
*  And what he's going to do is this and then the person does it like for people [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4847.0s)]
*  that follow along at home that was in the early days of the UFC that helped the UFC [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4850.240000000001s)]
*  very much because otherwise like it's just a scramble of bodies on the ground. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4855.120000000001s)]
*  You don't know what's happening. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4859.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4860.84s)]
*  You need someone to walk you through it in a step by step way. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4861.160000000001s)]
*  And so if if you don't have access to commentary I think that does that does [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4865.4s)]
*  hurt the experience a little bit because you don't. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4869.84s)]
*  But if you do have access to comment but it's also electric life because the [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4871.8s)]
*  crowds electric everyone knows. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4875.08s)]
*  So you get us like well I may not know. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4876.76s)]
*  I get a sense from the crowd but the crowd rises and gets like super loud when [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4879.4s)]
*  somebody's a little bit of trouble. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4884.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4885.84s)]
*  Well in a stand up fight there's nothing like that's like Adesanya versus [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4886.12s)]
*  Paheta that kind of fight. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4890.04s)]
*  Like it's there's nothing like being there live because you if you see Paheta [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4891.92s)]
*  throwing those fucking death hooks at him and like yeah right. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4895.96s)]
*  You know what's happening. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4899.28s)]
*  It's very clear to see what's going on. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4900.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody understands that. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4902.12s)]
*  But then the ground is where it gets a little more complicated for people. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4903.24s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4907.96s)]
*  OK. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4908.8s)]
*  When Spotify you did Spotify did you care when all that shit was going on with [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4911.4400000000005s)]
*  Spotify with like the people revolting against you at Spotify or did you just not [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4916.0s)]
*  give a shit at all. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4919.92s)]
*  Well the people at Spotify weren't. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4920.88s)]
*  There was just a couple of people that were like tech people that were upset. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4923.400000000001s)]
*  So then how did that become such a big story. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4927.72s)]
*  The real story was the medical misinformation story. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4930.4400000000005s)]
*  That's where things got weird. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4934.64s)]
*  And there was a lot of people that were behind that. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4935.88s)]
*  They did you know Democratic super PACs and there's a lot of shit. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4937.92s)]
*  It was like very organized. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4942.160000000001s)]
*  But that was because of having people like Robert Malone and Peter McCullough that [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4944.04s)]
*  were telling a narrative that was contrary to what was going on in the public about [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4949.32s)]
*  vaccines and about the efficacy and about the dangers and about covid and the [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4953.679999999999s)]
*  actual dangers of covid and also alternative treatments whether or not they [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4958.599999999999s)]
*  were effective whether or not the information is being suppressed. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4962.44s)]
*  That stuff got creepy. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4966.5599999999995s)]
*  But did you care is more like because you from outside looking in you had built [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4968.16s)]
*  this thing up all yourself took a paycheck but signed it over to Spotify. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4972.88s)]
*  To me that would be as I was curious what your thought process were at any point. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4980.12s)]
*  Like I wish I just kept this myself. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4984.679999999999s)]
*  I don't I don't need this headache or did. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4986.599999999999s)]
*  No because I would have done the same thing and I would have been banned from [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4988.84s)]
*  YouTube. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4991.12s)]
*  I would have been in trouble in other ways. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4992.16s)]
*  It was a matter of like a time where talking about certain things was very taboo. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=4994.48s)]
*  And I talk about everything. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5001.16s)]
*  And when I had access to someone like Robert Malone who owns nine patents on the [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5003.5199999999995s)]
*  creation of M.R.N.A. vaccine technology and that guy who got vaccinated was [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5009.24s)]
*  telling you about a terrible cardiac event that happened to him while he got [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5013.88s)]
*  vaccinated and then him doing the research on M.R.N.A. vaccines and the [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5018.599999999999s)]
*  benefits as well as the adverse side effects and as well as what the actual [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5023.679999999999s)]
*  studies showed in terms of efficacy that the fact that they never really showed [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5028.12s)]
*  that they could stop transmission that they were lying about that it's going to [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5033.12s)]
*  stop it in its tracks. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5036.639999999999s)]
*  There was no information about that. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5037.68s)]
*  In fact there was a woman in the in Pfizer that had to talk to the European [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5039.360000000001s)]
*  Parliament and they asked her like does it. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5043.4400000000005s)]
*  Did you do research to see if it stopped transmission. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5046.320000000001s)]
*  She said no. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5049.400000000001s)]
*  So they all they knew is that it created antibodies and everybody wanted the [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5050.360000000001s)]
*  pandemic to be over and everybody wanted it. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5054.76s)]
*  And they feel like this is our way out of this. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5057.4800000000005s)]
*  And it was like that was the narrative. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5059.160000000001s)]
*  Rachel Maddow was like if you get this vaccine you won't get covid right on [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5060.4800000000005s)]
*  spread covid. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5063.72s)]
*  The virus stops with you. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5064.400000000001s)]
*  We all now know that is horseshit and that's a lie. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5065.8s)]
*  And this guy was telling me that over a year ago. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5069.4400000000005s)]
*  And when I started talking about that it became a real fucking issue. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5072.6s)]
*  But my perspective was like look if it's true it's true and the chips will fall [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5076.64s)]
*  where they may. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5083.360000000001s)]
*  And if the only way people are getting this information is through me that's [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5084.160000000001s)]
*  fucking crazy. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5087.400000000001s)]
*  But that's also the cross I have to bear. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5088.88s)]
*  This is what it is. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5091.320000000001s)]
*  I'm talking to this guy. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5092.8s)]
*  I'm fascinated by it personally. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5093.92s)]
*  I want to know. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5096.0s)]
*  I mean he was wildly disparaged. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5097.2s)]
*  So was Dr. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5099.2s)]
*  Peter McCullough wildly disparaged. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5099.84s)]
*  But turns out he was accurate. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5102.56s)]
*  And as more and more information gets out over time it will show what happened [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5104.320000000001s)]
*  how they were suppressed how there was active campaigns to silence them and what [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5110.0s)]
*  those how those campaigns were funded. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5113.88s)]
*  And that's what we're finding out right now. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5116.64s)]
*  So it was an uncomfortable time for sure. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5119.4800000000005s)]
*  Especially when people like you know fucking Neil Young. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5122.16s)]
*  I love Neil Young. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5124.68s)]
*  You know but you know Neil Young I don't know if this is true. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5126.36s)]
*  Somebody told me that after I released my video explaining how a lot of the stuff [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5129.24s)]
*  that they called misinformation in the past that would get kicked you off is now [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5133.12s)]
*  mainstream news like the fact the lab leak hypothesis. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5138.04s)]
*  If you talked about the lab leak hypothesis on YouTube at the beginning of the [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5141.72s)]
*  pandemic you would have been fucking canceled. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5146.12s)]
*  They would have pulled you off of YouTube. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5148.36s)]
*  They would have suppressed your episodes. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5149.88s)]
*  They would have canceled. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5151.08s)]
*  Now that's on the cover of fucking Newsweek. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5151.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5153.96s)]
*  Right. And now most scientists and epidemiologists and virologists are porting [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5154.4800000000005s)]
*  towards that as a likely scenario that is a lab leak. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5158.76s)]
*  I had Brett Weinstein who is a evolutionary biologist on yesterday and he explained [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5161.64s)]
*  why that lab leak hypothesis is most likely correct in scientific terms that are [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5166.6s)]
*  like mind boggling. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5172.320000000001s)]
*  So was it good. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5174.64s)]
*  No. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5176.0s)]
*  But it is what it is. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5176.6s)]
*  You know and you know my perspective is look it could be I'm in a very unusual [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5177.96s)]
*  unfortunate situation and sometimes you find yourself in a place in life life [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5183.400000000001s)]
*  where you have to figure out what you're going to do. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5188.32s)]
*  Are you are you going to not talk to these people because of pressure when you [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5190.360000000001s)]
*  think these people are telling the truth or are you going to let the chips fall [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5194.16s)]
*  where they may. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5197.68s)]
*  So that was over because from again totally outside it seemed like a big deal [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5199.32s)]
*  like it seemed like a big thing within Spotify. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5203.64s)]
*  It seemed you're saying it wasn't as big though it's just small like you weren't [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5205.5199999999995s)]
*  getting that for me is the bit almost all the stuff you said whether it was true [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5208.759999999999s)]
*  and not true. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5214.16s)]
*  I think you believed it was true. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5214.879999999999s)]
*  That's all that kind of matters. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5216.04s)]
*  It turns out a lot of it was but it's there's similarities. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5217.599999999999s)]
*  You did it so long yourself and then Spotify's under a ton of pressure. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5223.48s)]
*  Didn't they delete some of your episodes. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5227.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5229.36s)]
*  Well they they they did that and they also were very apprehensive about certain [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5230.360000000001s)]
*  guests that I had on and there was you know a lot of pressure from advertisers. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5235.88s)]
*  There was a lot of pressure from different people. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5240.4400000000005s)]
*  They were you know like different artists like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5243.84s)]
*  her their stuff and it was touch and go. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5247.76s)]
*  But again over time it showed that that was all true and then all that went away. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5250.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5256.56s)]
*  And so it was the right. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5257.360000000001s)]
*  Now if I was wrong now imagine if I was wrong and imagine well not even me I [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5259.08s)]
*  shouldn't say I was wrong because I wasn't really the one who was saying these [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5264.08s)]
*  things these things were mostly being said by experts but those experts turned [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5267.320000000001s)]
*  out to be horse shit. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5271.52s)]
*  That would be devastating. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5272.52s)]
*  Like if it did cause the death of millions of people because these guys were [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5273.92s)]
*  lying. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5278.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5279.16s)]
*  People didn't take something that could have saved them and you know but turns [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5279.4800000000005s)]
*  out that's not really the case. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5283.280000000001s)]
*  And turns out there was alternate therapies and alternate different [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5284.4s)]
*  medications that were suppressed. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5289.639999999999s)]
*  Not only that the information about simple things like vitamin D and exercise [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5291.799999999999s)]
*  and the benefits of those things and how that was suppressed about how obesity [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5295.36s)]
*  contributes to COVID that was all suppressed. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5299.639999999999s)]
*  None of that stuff was being discussed and awareness. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5302.32s)]
*  So it's just one of those things where you find out that the more things change [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5306.04s)]
*  the more they remain the same. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5310.92s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies from the fucking beginning of their industry have been [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5312.76s)]
*  full shit. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5316.2s)]
*  They make great stuff. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5317.5199999999995s)]
*  They make Adderall you love it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5318.5599999999995s)]
*  They make Viagra. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5319.92s)]
*  They make cancer medications at work. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5320.96s)]
*  They make all these different things that are wonderful for people all these [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5322.68s)]
*  different things that save people. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5325.4s)]
*  But really what they're in the business of is making money. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5327.12s)]
*  That's what they're in the business of. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5330.2s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5331.24s)]
*  And when something comes along that that fucking steps on their money they don't [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5331.8s)]
*  like it. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5335.8s)]
*  You know. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5336.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5338.24s)]
*  Like I said what for me it was almost the bigger issue of how you I was curious [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5338.759999999999s)]
*  how you were dealing with it. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5343.5199999999995s)]
*  Meaning. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5344.92s)]
*  I just keep on keeping on. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5346.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's keep doing it. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5347.96s)]
*  Was there was it was that relationship ever close to being severed because of that [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5348.5599999999995s)]
*  or not. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5352.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5352.08s)]
*  I don't know though. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5352.88s)]
*  You know I don't know from them my relationship with them was always great [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5353.599999999999s)]
*  and communicating with them. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5356.12s)]
*  They stood by me the way they stand by rappers. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5357.16s)]
*  That was one of the things they said like think about all the shit that rappers say. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5359.599999999999s)]
*  But they stood by you for the same reason you're saying I'm not a rapper. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5362.48s)]
*  For the same reason you're saying everything else. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5366.2s)]
*  You make the money. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5368.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5369.36s)]
*  Like they probably weren't standing by you because we think he's got smart guys [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5370.12s)]
*  to Joe Rogan. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5373.76s)]
*  We like Joe. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5374.64s)]
*  They're staying by you because of the biggest podcast. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5375.28s)]
*  A friend of mine who's a brilliant businessman said you have the number one [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5377.08s)]
*  podcast in 96 countries. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5380.28s)]
*  If you had the number 96 podcast in one country you'd have been gone. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5382.12s)]
*  Correct. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5386.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5386.68s)]
*  And that's correct. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5386.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5387.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5388.04s)]
*  And that's everything. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5388.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5389.12s)]
*  But that's that's why for whatever reason you know I found myself in the position I [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5389.48s)]
*  found myself in like that's that's who you are right now. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5395.32s)]
*  That's your place in life and you have to just be who you are. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5398.32s)]
*  You can't change because of the pressure. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5402.24s)]
*  You can't just decide to become a different person because there's all this pressure on [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5403.92s)]
*  you because you're scared. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5407.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5408.2s)]
*  Like then I'd quit. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5408.599999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't want to do it anymore. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5409.48s)]
*  I would go do it for free. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5410.759999999999s)]
*  That's there was a point in time I was like what would I do if I lost all of it. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5413.2s)]
*  And I thought about it very carefully and I said I'll just do it for free. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5418.16s)]
*  If I lost all my ads and all my advertisers I would still have the number one podcast [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5421.88s)]
*  but no advertisers. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5425.679999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5427.04s)]
*  I just do it for free. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5428.0s)]
*  I just you know cut my spending down a little bit. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5428.88s)]
*  Still do stand up. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5432.5599999999995s)]
*  Keep doing the same shit. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5433.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5436.12s)]
*  I mean you don't need advertisers. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5436.639999999999s)]
*  You can do that in this day and age. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5438.12s)]
*  This is a different world. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5440.04s)]
*  You know the fact that an independent media organization whether it's like breaking [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5441.639999999999s)]
*  points or sub stack can exist and have millions of subscribers and millions of people [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5446.2s)]
*  that pay attention. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5451.24s)]
*  This is a different world. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5452.28s)]
*  It's not a world where you're on fucking ESPN. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5453.76s)]
*  You get caught doing coke and they just fire you. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5457.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5458.8s)]
*  That's a different. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5459.48s)]
*  They live in a different world than I do. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5460.12s)]
*  I live in the world of social media and the world of well your direct platforms direct [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5461.5599999999995s)]
*  to consumer. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5466.44s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5466.84s)]
*  And I've had a lot of offers to do that. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5467.96s)]
*  Like there was a lot of people that were these like fucking huge billionaire people [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5469.599999999999s)]
*  who came to me and said listen we can take this and go straight to subscriber model and [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5474.5599999999995s)]
*  then you never have to deal with anybody ever telling you what to do again. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5479.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5481.92s)]
*  I thought about that but I'm like but also Spotify has been great to me. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5483.0s)]
*  I have a great relationship with the CEO of Spotify. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5486.5199999999995s)]
*  He's my boy. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5488.759999999999s)]
*  I love that dude. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5489.96s)]
*  So you know I stick with them. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5491.08s)]
*  They stick with me. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5494.12s)]
*  We're good. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5495.0s)]
*  And it works. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5495.599999999999s)]
*  And so it's a fucking very unique thing that I got in right at the right time where [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5496.4s)]
*  YouTube was demonetizing people and they that was one of the ways they got people to [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5501.879999999999s)]
*  self center self sensor rather. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5506.759999999999s)]
*  They demonetize people that talked about controversial subjects and they demonetize a [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5508.64s)]
*  lot. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5513.88s)]
*  That was one of the things that we found about when we left YouTube because we had a [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5514.120000000001s)]
*  really good relationship with YouTube and most of our episodes were monetized. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5519.4800000000005s)]
*  But every now and then they would demonetize an episode and we would try to. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5523.280000000001s)]
*  Jamie would you know he would protest it or you know he would dispute it and you know [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5526.200000000001s)]
*  put in a request for review. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5533.96s)]
*  And sometimes they would reverse it and sometimes they weren't. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5536.84s)]
*  And it was like this weird touch and go game where like who is telling me what I can and [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5539.88s)]
*  can't say. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5545.639999999999s)]
*  Who the fuck are these people. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5546.24s)]
*  And why are they in my life. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5547.92s)]
*  Why am I why am I making decisions based on whether or not some fucking dork who has [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5549.599999999999s)]
*  this subjective opinion of whether or not something should be discussed or not [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5554.679999999999s)]
*  discussed. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5557.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5558.44s)]
*  And so when we left Spotify we left YouTube and went to Spotify all that stopped. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5559.28s)]
*  The moment we left YouTube the moment we got a deal with Spotify we were on YouTube [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5566.32s)]
*  for several months. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5571.48s)]
*  They didn't demonetize any of our shit during that time. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5572.92s)]
*  They just took in all the revenue. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5576.0s)]
*  They stopped demonetizing us completely. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5577.96s)]
*  So it was an increase in revenue by like something somewhere in the neighborhood of [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5581.0s)]
*  25 to 30 percent because that's the amount of podcasts that they would demonetize. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5583.96s)]
*  The revenue just went sky high. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5588.92s)]
*  I was like this is wild. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5590.599999999999s)]
*  This is really fascinating. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5592.5199999999995s)]
*  And if I stayed over there during the whole covid shit during the like the Neil Young [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5593.68s)]
*  stuff and everything dude it would have been bad. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5598.8s)]
*  They would have probably yanked me off of YouTube. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5601.240000000001s)]
*  They'd have probably killed my account. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5603.080000000001s)]
*  They could have done it. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5604.360000000001s)]
*  They did it to many people. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5605.320000000001s)]
*  They killed many people's accounts for wrong reasons. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5606.92s)]
*  And those reasons now are being like very clearly exposed as being incorrect. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5609.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5614.120000000001s)]
*  Fascinating. That was. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5616.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah I always wondered that part. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5617.400000000001s)]
*  It feels very weird though. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5620.320000000001s)]
*  It was felt very weird. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5622.88s)]
*  But the thing is I kept doing stand up and when I go on stand up people would go [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5624.56s)]
*  fucking crazy when I go on stage. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5628.0s)]
*  Yeah well the thing you have I've said this in the past similar I think to Barstool [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5630.36s)]
*  you've been doing it so long so your audience knows very well who you are. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5635.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5639.2s)]
*  So it it it's not like what Neil Young or anybody said it's not going to affect [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5639.44s)]
*  your base because your base is very real and they've been with you forever. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5644.2s)]
*  So in fact I gained two billion subscribers during that month. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5647.8s)]
*  Two million. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5652.2s)]
*  That makes sense to me. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5654.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5655.68s)]
*  So that was what was wild about it. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5656.44s)]
*  It had the opposite effect that was intended. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5658.0s)]
*  Well that always does. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5660.16s)]
*  Little fatso Brian Stelter was on CNN talking shit about me. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5661.28s)]
*  I'm like. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5664.56s)]
*  That's been Barstool from day one. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5667.12s)]
*  The more people attack the more your base grows and they almost become more [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5669.04s)]
*  ravenous. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5672.4800000000005s)]
*  They do become more ravenous especially in response to someone like Brian Stelter. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5673.04s)]
*  Because you see that guy talking like who the fuck are you. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5677.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5680.52s)]
*  Like what. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5680.92s)]
*  Imagine a world where that guy's your best friend. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5681.8s)]
*  Well that is so of all the people have come at me and a lot of people say it so [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5683.84s)]
*  you can take it kind of with a grain of salt. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5689.0s)]
*  If someone writes a hit piece someone I always say let's sit down I'll bring my [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5691.04s)]
*  cameras you bring yours. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5695.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5697.16s)]
*  And we can both do whatever nobody ever has taken me up on that ever. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5697.400000000001s)]
*  And now that's an interesting because that takes away their power of ever ever. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5701.52s)]
*  They love to be able to edit and take your stuff and you can just see how their [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5705.2s)]
*  body language is and whatever because I see who they are correct. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5709.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5713.52s)]
*  Because I'm comfy. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5713.96s)]
*  I know there's things I've said that you know with time culture environment they [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5714.76s)]
*  don't come across I would have worded differently said different jokes whatever. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5721.4800000000005s)]
*  But I'm comfortable with I've never I always got a kick out of there's accounts [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5724.64s)]
*  that hate me. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5728.4800000000005s)]
*  They deleted their entire like Twitter profiles. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5729.200000000001s)]
*  This went back like delete everything. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5731.4400000000005s)]
*  We've never delete anything really. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5733.12s)]
*  It's all out there. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5734.88s)]
*  You want to find it's there. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5735.52s)]
*  But I'm comfortable with who I am. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5736.76s)]
*  So if you have this big problem with me wouldn't you want your subject to sit and [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5738.48s)]
*  be like open book. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5742.72s)]
*  You can do it live. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5743.84s)]
*  You can do all the footage. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5744.64s)]
*  They never do it. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5745.88s)]
*  Not once. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5746.88s)]
*  Because they're not trying to have an objective analysis of who you are. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5747.599999999999s)]
*  And you get to see them. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5751.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5752.96s)]
*  Like you get to see what type of person how they are. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5753.4s)]
*  Are they normally not normal. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5755.72s)]
*  Do they squirm. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5757.16s)]
*  And they know your base will come for them. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5758.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes that too. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5760.68s)]
*  Which we've had that people have criticized me for that because there is a [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5761.5199999999995s)]
*  theory out there. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5766.4s)]
*  And I'm sure they say with you that I have a responsibility because we have this [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5768.5599999999995s)]
*  base. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5772.5599999999995s)]
*  So if I say so somebody throws a jab at me on Twitter says something I have the [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5772.96s)]
*  responsibility not to respond. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5778.0s)]
*  If it's an individual that's not connected to no no they say anybody. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5779.88s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5783.44s)]
*  Yeah that's what I said because that person is also has a base. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5784.12s)]
*  That person has a platform. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5787.16s)]
*  And Twitter is a public square. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5788.48s)]
*  You're tagging me you're saying like I don't have to bite my tongue. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5790.5599999999995s)]
*  Even within Barstool people feel differently. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5793.639999999999s)]
*  They're like well don't do it because it does reflect you know you can't control [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5795.56s)]
*  everybody and we do have idiots who will say stuff that's too far over the edge. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5799.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5804.4800000000005s)]
*  How do you stop that. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5805.320000000001s)]
*  You can't. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5806.080000000001s)]
*  But at the same time I'm not just going to let someone go there and take shots at [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5806.52s)]
*  me. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5809.56s)]
*  It's like that's not my nature. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5809.72s)]
*  It's never been my nature. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5811.080000000001s)]
*  So that sometimes I've tried to be a little better with it. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5812.280000000001s)]
*  But it's not the best. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5815.92s)]
*  But it's an interesting thing because this is all very new. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5817.080000000001s)]
*  Like the. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5820.44s)]
*  The idea of podcasts and these independent platforms that reach millions of people has [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5823.2s)]
*  never existed in human history. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5828.88s)]
*  There's never been anything like this. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5831.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5833.6s)]
*  Guys like you and guys like me and people that are doing it. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5833.8s)]
*  There's no road map to follow. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5837.32s)]
*  Now for young guys coming up or young girls coming up like young non-binary folks [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5839.76s)]
*  coming up. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5843.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5844.24s)]
*  They get to look at what we're doing and they see like a little bit of a road map. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5844.5599999999995s)]
*  So for people that are getting involved in this right now I love the fact that some [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5848.88s)]
*  17 year old kid in Michigan in his fucking apartment you know or his his bedroom can [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5853.360000000001s)]
*  start a podcast and if people like it they keep tuning in and then it can grow and it [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5860.76s)]
*  can and it can get to a point where that person could be the number one podcaster in [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5867.0s)]
*  the world. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5871.84s)]
*  You see it with like Twitch streamers and YouTubers. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5872.160000000001s)]
*  It's a fucking amazing time. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5875.160000000001s)]
*  It levels the playing field. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5876.68s)]
*  You don't even know where talent generally if you do it enough can rise. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5877.92s)]
*  It's more than leveling the playing field because you're uninhibited. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5881.88s)]
*  You're unhindered by corporate interests. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5885.6s)]
*  So you have this ability to talk about things in a way that like there was never a long [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5888.280000000001s)]
*  form discussion of complicated ideas for hours and hours uncensored that ever existed [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5895.0s)]
*  before. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5901.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5901.8s)]
*  Didn't exist until podcasts came along. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5902.12s)]
*  So it's not even a level playing field. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5904.8s)]
*  Like they're working hindered. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5906.84s)]
*  They have ads. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5909.0s)]
*  They have to cut every fucking seven minutes and go to commercial break. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5910.24s)]
*  They have corporate interests that like review what they're doing. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5914.16s)]
*  They have to have meetings with managers and executives. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5917.68s)]
*  I don't have any of that zero. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5921.04s)]
*  So it's not level at all. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5922.88s)]
*  I have a monstrous advantage above and beyond. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5925.0s)]
*  I'm drunk and high on 45 percent of the podcast that I do. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5928.6s)]
*  Like what are you talking. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5932.96s)]
*  There's no it's the advantage is 100 percent on my side. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5933.76s)]
*  Because it didn't exist before. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5937.2s)]
*  And I'm a pioneer. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5938.76s)]
*  I'm one of the early guys. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5939.84s)]
*  So because I've been around it now for 13 years I've been doing it for 13 years. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5941.4800000000005s)]
*  I've amassed a following that's been paying attention for so long. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5945.12s)]
*  That's like it's not it's not even. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5949.4400000000005s)]
*  That's also why I think you're perceived. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5952.72s)]
*  Well I don't think I know as a threat because you you you can say what you want and you [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5956.320000000001s)]
*  can also influence politics whatever it may be and they can't get to you really. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5961.96s)]
*  Well I don't know if that should be perceived as a threat. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5969.04s)]
*  I think they're looking at it the wrong way. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5971.84s)]
*  But if they were an individual I'd say you shouldn't look at it that way. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5973.4800000000005s)]
*  You should look at it like what are the benefits of doing something in the way that [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5976.88s)]
*  that person does and whether or not you can adjust and do whether you don't think [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5980.04s)]
*  they you don't think you don't think like I'm sure they do. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5984.76s)]
*  But I'm what I would say if they were an individual I know they're a corporation. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5988.36s)]
*  So it's sort of a different entity. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5991.92s)]
*  But if they were an individual I would tell them you're looking at it the wrong way. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5993.4800000000005s)]
*  If someone's out there killing it don't look at that person as a threat. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=5998.08s)]
*  Look at that person's like what do they do. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6001.32s)]
*  How do they do that. Why do they do that so differently. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6003.0s)]
*  Why is it so effective. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6005.16s)]
*  Like what maybe what's the flaws in my delivery. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6006.52s)]
*  What's the flaws in my application. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6009.36s)]
*  What's the flaws in the way I'm promoting my thing. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6011.4800000000005s)]
*  And why doesn't that resonate with people. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6014.88s)]
*  You know if you if you have someone who speaks like a normal person like who speaks [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6017.08s)]
*  like you would if you're having a drink with a buddy that resonates for people. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6021.24s)]
*  They go I get to know he's a fucking regular guy. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6025.88s)]
*  Totally. I get it. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6028.84s)]
*  I like to listen to him even if I don't agree with him at least I know where he's [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6030.16s)]
*  coming from. That's a regular person. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6033.5599999999995s)]
*  When you're listening to Don Lemon talk you don't get any of that. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6035.599999999999s)]
*  You get there's a way of discussing things that you know if that guy was in your [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6038.96s)]
*  living room talking like that you'd be like right. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6044.12s)]
*  Why are you doing. We've got to get him out of here. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6046.0s)]
*  He's crazy. I think he's on drugs. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6048.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6050.04s)]
*  You know like. Yeah no. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6050.4s)]
*  Nobody talks like that. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6052.16s)]
*  Nobody talks like a news anchor when they're alone with you. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6053.24s)]
*  Right. So that's one of the reasons why like Greg Gutfeld works right. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6056.32s)]
*  When that guy's doing his show when they're sitting around with a bunch of people [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6061.32s)]
*  talking they're laughing right. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6065.84s)]
*  They're talking normal normal normal. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6067.5599999999995s)]
*  That's why it works so well. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6070.4s)]
*  You're like how is that the number one late night show. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6072.0s)]
*  How is it not right. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6075.16s)]
*  How is it not. Look at what he's doing. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6076.5199999999995s)]
*  He's him. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6078.32s)]
*  That's across. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6079.12s)]
*  I mean that's across the board. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6080.28s)]
*  Like we just so we just did our first we had the rights to a college football game [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6081.28s)]
*  and we announced it as though we had a rooting interest because we did. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6085.04s)]
*  And people half the people loved it half hated it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6089.92s)]
*  But even the people hate it's like this is how we talk in our living room. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6092.92s)]
*  That's what people want. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6095.64s)]
*  They want just normal. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6096.64s)]
*  That's what people want. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6098.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6098.76s)]
*  We used to do fight companions when I lived in L.A. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6099.2s)]
*  me and Brendan Chobb and Brian Cowan and Bravo. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6101.4800000000005s)]
*  We would do these fight companions where we would sit down and watch the UFC and talk shit [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6104.72s)]
*  and drink and get fucked up the man in cast which you're not a football guy but that's what it is. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6109.72s)]
*  Same kind of second screens. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6113.76s)]
*  Those fight companions would get way more views than the UFC would because people would like to [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6115.76s)]
*  listen to and they would also listen to us. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6122.240000000001s)]
*  We would let them sync it up. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6124.4800000000005s)]
*  We would give them the exact time that the fight because it was like a bit of a delay because of the [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6126.16s)]
*  networks and all that shit. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6130.6s)]
*  So we would tell them and also if they were watching the fights afterwards like they had to work and [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6132.04s)]
*  then after they got off work they could sync it up. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6136.84s)]
*  I'd give them like on the first fight we're at five seconds six seconds seven seconds eight. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6139.12s)]
*  So they could pause that at eight seconds rewind their thing to eight seconds. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6144.16s)]
*  Bam. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6147.56s)]
*  And so they were with us and they would listen to that instead of the comment there. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6148.320000000001s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6151.2s)]
*  I mean we did that with normal sport. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6151.96s)]
*  We had the same thing. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6154.16s)]
*  We would turn the cameras early on us like the Barstool people watching sports in our biggest [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6155.320000000001s)]
*  moments because everyone wants a fan like someone hits a home run against your the biggest as [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6161.24s)]
*  always when your team loses people like to watch someone die on camera which is great. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6165.8s)]
*  But it's the fan experience. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6169.4s)]
*  It always works. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6171.2s)]
*  That is what works with podcasts. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6172.48s)]
*  If someone's interesting. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6174.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6175.4s)]
*  If someone but if they're not God so fucking annoying like if you like I watch a lot of [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6175.76s)]
*  professional pool and this lot of telling me that. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6180.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah I'm addicted. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6183.88s)]
*  And then there's these like pool commentators that are just fucking amateurs. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6185.36s)]
*  They're terrible. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6189.28s)]
*  They talk too much. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6190.04s)]
*  And then there's guys like Jeremy Jones. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6191.32s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6192.5599999999995s)]
*  And I can't wait to listen to him or Earl Strickland. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6193.5199999999995s)]
*  But the guys who are bad they ruin it. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6195.8s)]
*  Like I just turn the volume down. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6197.92s)]
*  I don't want to hear him talk. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6199.4s)]
*  They're stupid. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6200.72s)]
*  They talk too much. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6201.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6202.28s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6202.5599999999995s)]
*  You know it's just it's just if it's good. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6203.96s)]
*  But if it's good it'll it'll it'll resonate. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6206.599999999999s)]
*  People will like it. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6209.36s)]
*  If it's not it won't. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6210.679999999999s)]
*  And that's what it's supposed to be all about. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6211.679999999999s)]
*  That's what people are supposed to have the freedom to do something that other people enjoy. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6213.32s)]
*  And that's the most unique thing about this time is this time. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6218.360000000001s)]
*  You don't have to have any qualifications. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6221.72s)]
*  You don't have to have any background in broadcasting from a specific institution or any of that. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6223.8s)]
*  You just be yourself. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6230.0s)]
*  Do your thing. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6232.0s)]
*  And even us when we've hired people from networks it's crazy. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6232.72s)]
*  First the Internet the network people generally flame out with us a little bit because they want they're expecting like a producer to be like you do [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6238.4400000000005s)]
*  this this is set up where people who are kind of born from the Internet they've gotten on our radar or wherever they are by just doing [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6247.64s)]
*  themselves. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6255.08s)]
*  Like you don't need anybody really. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6255.92s)]
*  I always that drives me nuts when people apply for us like I can do this I can do that. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6258.400000000001s)]
*  It's like you don't need us. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6263.96s)]
*  You should have like a library that I can just go watch you like you don't. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6265.360000000001s)]
*  Why do you need Barstool. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6268.88s)]
*  You don't need anything. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6269.64s)]
*  It's so easy to create your own content without any help really. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6270.52s)]
*  But they'd like to be connected with Barstool because Barstool is a brand that also has a gigantic following already attached so they know if they hook up with you they'll get an [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6274.48s)]
*  audience. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6283.919999999999s)]
*  We can be the gasoline. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6284.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6286.2s)]
*  So we can blow somebody up. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6286.599999999999s)]
*  But if you don't have it and you're not motivated like the example that I've given Call Her Daddy which I think is second to you on Spotify. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6289.48s)]
*  Do you know that you look blank. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6298.759999999999s)]
*  You give me a blank like you don't know that. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6300.28s)]
*  I don't pay attention. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6301.719999999999s)]
*  Do you know you don't even know what it is. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6302.68s)]
*  I know what Call Her Daddy is. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6304.4400000000005s)]
*  I know the whole controversy. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6306.200000000001s)]
*  Do you know why I know the whole controversy. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6307.56s)]
*  No. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6309.280000000001s)]
*  Because my boy Andrew Schultz. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6309.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6311.4800000000005s)]
*  Andrew Schultz who was supposed to go on a date with that one girl. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6311.96s)]
*  Sophia Franklin. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6316.360000000001s)]
*  So he bails on the date. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6317.320000000001s)]
*  She goes out and meets the agent who winds up trying to negotiate this contract. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6319.160000000001s)]
*  Soup guy. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6323.68s)]
*  Soup man. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6323.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6325.04s)]
*  Tell the story from you know it. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6326.120000000001s)]
*  You know I know it really good. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6328.200000000001s)]
*  So Call Her Daddy Alex Cooper. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6329.5199999999995s)]
*  We we saw a sizzle reel that she made. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6333.919999999999s)]
*  So Call Her Daddy is now on Spotify. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6336.679999999999s)]
*  She got a huge contract I think like three years 60 mil. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6338.48s)]
*  She's great. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6340.839999999999s)]
*  But we saw a sizzle reel. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6341.759999999999s)]
*  Called her in. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6343.24s)]
*  I'd never seen anything like the sizzle reel. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6343.879999999999s)]
*  And she sat down like who made this for you. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6346.28s)]
*  And she's like I did. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6348.48s)]
*  I learned how to edit it. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6349.28s)]
*  I did all of it. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6350.32s)]
*  We just hired her on the spot when she said that. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6351.24s)]
*  She said oh by the way I do it with another girl. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6353.44s)]
*  I'm bringing her with me. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6356.2s)]
*  It's like OK fine. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6357.0s)]
*  Didn't even meet the girl. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6358.12s)]
*  Sophia Franklin at the at the time. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6358.88s)]
*  The thing exploded. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6361.400000000001s)]
*  Now Barstool has been around close to 20 years. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6363.12s)]
*  It's no overnight success. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6366.32s)]
*  You were around for 12 years doing the podcasting. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6367.88s)]
*  They went from zero to 100. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6371.04s)]
*  Like within two months. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6373.400000000001s)]
*  It's all anybody was talking about. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6374.72s)]
*  Call Her Daddy. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6375.84s)]
*  Call Her Daddy. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6376.360000000001s)]
*  So we hired them each 70 grand a year. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6377.24s)]
*  Three year contracts. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6380.4800000000005s)]
*  You can look at like we'll reevaluate it at the end of the year. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6381.64s)]
*  This thing blew up so quick. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6385.52s)]
*  And they started looking around. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6387.759999999999s)]
*  Be like wait a minute. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6389.08s)]
*  We're making 70 grand. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6389.719999999999s)]
*  Our numbers we should be making millions. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6391.04s)]
*  They're right. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6393.04s)]
*  They should have been if they were independent and they weren't through us. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6393.839999999999s)]
*  But it's kind of like the band model right. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6397.0s)]
*  The band label you sign to think. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6399.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6400.759999999999s)]
*  So we did give them a raise. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6402.16s)]
*  They were each making about 500 grand by the end I think of year one. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6403.719999999999s)]
*  Sophia Franklin's boyfriend Suit Man was an executive at HBO. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6408.5199999999995s)]
*  And what essentially happened is he started shopping Call Her Daddy around. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6413.72s)]
*  And we still own them. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6420.599999999999s)]
*  They stopped putting out the podcast. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6422.32s)]
*  They won't do anything. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6424.24s)]
*  And they started leaving little clues like hey we're being held hostage in so many [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6425.639999999999s)]
*  words by Barstool. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6429.96s)]
*  Making stuff up frankly. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6430.96s)]
*  And it got to the point this is in the middle of COVID. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6433.4s)]
*  And they wouldn't put out episodes. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6435.5599999999995s)]
*  And we're trying to pay the bills for everybody. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6437.68s)]
*  So they came over to this like for Barstool, Lor and Call Her Daddy. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6439.84s)]
*  We had a very famous meeting on the roof deck of where I lived. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6443.76s)]
*  It was Alex and Sophia. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6447.04s)]
*  And I said listen we own the IP. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6449.04s)]
*  Call Her Daddy was ours. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6451.52s)]
*  And I basically shortened their contract and agreed I'll give you guys the IP. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6453.04s)]
*  You guys just work one more year. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6458.56s)]
*  Somewhere in there. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6460.160000000001s)]
*  Should have been two more. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6460.84s)]
*  They left. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6462.88s)]
*  I'm like this is this is the deal of a lifetime. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6463.4800000000005s)]
*  We need to pay the bills and get them going. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6465.4800000000005s)]
*  Alex calls two days later and she says listen I want to take this deal. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6468.08s)]
*  Sophia is never going to take this deal. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6473.5199999999995s)]
*  She's in with her boyfriend. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6475.72s)]
*  They're shopping it around. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6477.12s)]
*  They're saying all these things. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6478.48s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6480.04s)]
*  So I call both Sophia and Alex. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6481.5599999999995s)]
*  I said we're going to do a deal with Alex. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6484.48s)]
*  Sophia you come or you don't come. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6486.599999999999s)]
*  But we're moving forward. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6488.72s)]
*  Didn't hear anything back from Sophia. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6490.599999999999s)]
*  Alex we do the deal with. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6492.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's all because of the boyfriend. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6494.76s)]
*  We had Scooter Braun. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6498.0s)]
*  This is also you know Scooter Braun. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6499.5199999999995s)]
*  He's Bieber's agent. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6502.08s)]
*  He calls. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6503.5599999999995s)]
*  I've never talked to Scooter Braun ever. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6504.12s)]
*  I got a call from a guy I know Dave Grutman who's like a Miami nightlife guy. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6506.92s)]
*  He goes hey I got Scooter Braun on the other line. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6511.08s)]
*  Will you talk to him. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6513.24s)]
*  I go yeah but you tell him everything he says to me is on the record. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6514.5199999999995s)]
*  Like I don't give a fuck. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6518.04s)]
*  Like I'm in my own world. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6519.0s)]
*  I could give a fuck less who Scooter Braun is. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6519.92s)]
*  So Scooter Braun gets on the phone. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6522.2s)]
*  He goes I talked to Sophia Franklin. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6524.2s)]
*  This is after we already moved along. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6526.28s)]
*  It's like I think you should take her back. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6528.320000000001s)]
*  Do the deal. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6530.64s)]
*  It's like all right whatever. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6532.320000000001s)]
*  We're already moving on hung up made a video instantly. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6533.12s)]
*  Like Scooter Braun just called me who the fuck does Scooter Braun think he is. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6536.04s)]
*  And the rest is so much history. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6539.68s)]
*  Alex went got this huge deal. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6542.76s)]
*  She's killing it. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6544.4800000000005s)]
*  Besides you I think she's just about the biggest podcast out there. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6545.84s)]
*  And Sophia went on her way. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6550.16s)]
*  I went nuts. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6552.6s)]
*  Like I actually hijacked their stream. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6554.52s)]
*  Like we had their stream and what they hadn't posted in maybe two or three months. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6557.400000000001s)]
*  I just went on. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6562.84s)]
*  All these Call Her Daddy fans thought it was going to be the next Call Her Daddy. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6564.12s)]
*  It was just me explaining what the situation was. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6567.2s)]
*  And all these all their fans had no idea who I was. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6570.52s)]
*  Like who the fuck's this guy. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6572.72s)]
*  So it they went their separate ways. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6574.2s)]
*  And what actually happened with them behind the scenes. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6577.72s)]
*  Who knows. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6580.240000000001s)]
*  I believe Alex's side of the events but it really seemed like he thought he was going to take them be their manager. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6580.72s)]
*  It was what's the big. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6587.04s)]
*  There was there was some big network that like basically had the deal ready for them. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6588.08s)]
*  So it turned into a huge thing. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6592.64s)]
*  It was all during Covid. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6593.88s)]
*  It was a big story. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6594.8s)]
*  What is Sophia doing now. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6596.6s)]
*  She has her own broadcast Sophia with an F. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6598.0s)]
*  She's not my favorite person. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6601.6s)]
*  She's not my favorite person. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6603.400000000001s)]
*  Well I got to think that people like that are influenced by the people that were. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6604.8s)]
*  Is that guy still her boyfriend. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6609.52s)]
*  No. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6611.04s)]
*  And you know what's crazy. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6611.52s)]
*  I thought if you asked me beforehand. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6613.160000000001s)]
*  That guy cost her millions. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6616.080000000001s)]
*  Millions. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6617.360000000001s)]
*  Millions. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6618.04s)]
*  Millions and millions. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6619.0s)]
*  It was so. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6620.72s)]
*  Imagine how long that podcast could have kept going. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6621.0s)]
*  And everything on the IP. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6623.360000000001s)]
*  And they could have left and gone to Spotify the same way with her attached. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6624.52s)]
*  And she would be fucking driving a pink Rolls Royce and balling out of control. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6629.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know that she's doing terribly. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6633.72s)]
*  She's certainly not doing what Alex is. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6636.64s)]
*  And what does Alex do now for a co-host. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6639.360000000001s)]
*  Does she have a solo solo. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6641.360000000001s)]
*  Just took it. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6643.240000000001s)]
*  So it went from splitting it 50 50. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6644.12s)]
*  She just took it all. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6646.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6647.6s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6648.320000000001s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6649.360000000001s)]
*  It's it's weird when there's one person that's like the driving force behind it but then [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6650.280000000001s)]
*  another person is connected to it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6654.72s)]
*  And like that person thinks that they should be the person. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6656.400000000001s)]
*  And it was that he said she said on who was doing it. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6659.360000000001s)]
*  Boyfriend is also in the business and he. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6661.64s)]
*  Listen trust me. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6664.280000000001s)]
*  I got this. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6665.120000000001s)]
*  I'm going to handle this. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6665.72s)]
*  And also he's like the new boyfriends who's fucking excited about it all. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6666.84s)]
*  I mean he's actually a boxing guy. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6671.56s)]
*  I've never met him. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6673.88s)]
*  He's a boxing guy. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6675.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6676.280000000001s)]
*  He did. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6676.52s)]
*  He did all HBO boxing. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6677.240000000001s)]
*  Interesting which doesn't exist anymore now. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6679.120000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately which is a fucking terrible tragedy. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6681.0s)]
*  I used to love HBO boxing. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6684.120000000001s)]
*  He's a lampley and fucking Roy Jones Jr. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6687.0s)]
*  Legendary knights are like the best. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6690.0s)]
*  Have you seen those documents. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6691.84s)]
*  Oh yes. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6693.08s)]
*  HBO boxing was one of the greatest institutions that ever existed. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6694.44s)]
*  And the fact they went away made me so fucking sad. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6698.52s)]
*  I couldn't understand why they would do that. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6701.72s)]
*  They put on some of the most amazing fights ever. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6704.4s)]
*  And the broadcast was excellent. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6707.76s)]
*  Jim Lampley is the best of the best. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6709.76s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6711.84s)]
*  Other than John Anik who I think is the goat. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6712.68s)]
*  John Anik is the greatest play by play guy that has ever existed. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6715.8s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6719.96s)]
*  And then Lampley for me was the best in boxing. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6721.16s)]
*  And Howard Letterman. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6724.28s)]
*  He was so fucking smooth. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6725.24s)]
*  Harold Letterman. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6726.0s)]
*  They had it all. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6726.72s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6727.44s)]
*  I mean fucking it was amazing. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6728.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6730.04s)]
*  The different people that they had that would sit in and do commentary. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6730.76s)]
*  It was fucking perfect. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6735.12s)]
*  It was the perfect group. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6736.8s)]
*  It really was. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6738.24s)]
*  It was perfect for boxing. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6739.0s)]
*  It always had that big fight feel but boxing is so fucked up. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6739.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6743.36s)]
*  I mean I love boxing. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6743.96s)]
*  Larry Merchant was get all grumpy and shit. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6744.88s)]
*  Larry Merchant was perfectly grumpy. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6747.64s)]
*  Remember when he was in the ring with Floyd Bay with her. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6750.4800000000005s)]
*  I was 20 years younger. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6753.36s)]
*  I'd kicked her ass. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6754.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6756.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6756.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6756.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6757.0s)]
*  The craziest thing that anybody could ever say ever. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6759.28s)]
*  You're literally talking to the greatest boxer the world has ever known. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6761.88s)]
*  And you're saying play that play that. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6766.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6767.4800000000005s)]
*  Even though it appeared that he wasn't protecting himself and thought that that was part of the [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6769.12s)]
*  ceremony that you were going through of apology that you unfairly took advantage of it. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6776.599999999999s)]
*  What do you say to those who say what did you do there. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6785.5599999999995s)]
*  You went in the fight and didn't charge. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6789.0s)]
*  I just want to say everybody that bought pay-per-view that came out to Las Vegas. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6790.679999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6794.0s)]
*  Anyway Floyd you know you're a promoter but now we're talking to as a prize fighter. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6794.36s)]
*  Let's take a look at what happened at the end of the fight. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6800.32s)]
*  You describe it. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6803.32s)]
*  I love this moment. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6807.2s)]
*  We touched. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6809.88s)]
*  We touched gloves. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6810.679999999999s)]
*  We back to fighting hook. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6812.24s)]
*  Right here. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6815.32s)]
*  That's all she wrote. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6816.48s)]
*  So for you it was just an automatic response. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6818.28s)]
*  Let's get on with the fight. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6822.76s)]
*  It's protect yourself at all time. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6824.32s)]
*  He does some dirty. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6827.04s)]
*  We're not here to cry and complain about what he did dirty or what I did dirty. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6829.0s)]
*  I was victorious. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6832.36s)]
*  If he wanted to rematch he can get a rematch. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6833.48s)]
*  You were in charge of the fight. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6836.2s)]
*  You were aggressive and trying and taking advantage of what you saw. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6840.28s)]
*  You don't ever give me a fair shake. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6846.2s)]
*  You know that. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6847.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm going to let you talk to Victor Ortiz. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6848.2s)]
*  I'm through. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6850.28s)]
*  They put somebody else up and give me an interview. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6850.76s)]
*  HBO need to fire you. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6856.12s)]
*  You know shit about boxing. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6857.32s)]
*  You ain't shit. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6859.72s)]
*  You're not shit. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6860.92s)]
*  I wish I was 50 years younger and I'd kick your ass. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6862.16s)]
*  First of all I'm on team Floyd Mayweather in that exchange. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6866.2s)]
*  You got to protect yourself at all times. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6873.92s)]
*  You have to protect yourself at all times. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6875.5199999999995s)]
*  Also Victor Ortiz did do something dirty. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6877.08s)]
*  He head butted him. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6880.04s)]
*  Also you know that's just all within the rules of boxing. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6880.639999999999s)]
*  That's why he won the fight. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6884.599999999999s)]
*  Also Larry Merchant I don't agree with the way he communicates with fighters. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6885.96s)]
*  The way the way I communicate with fighters I try to be 100 percent respectful at all [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6890.04s)]
*  times and also with reverence to the fact that these people they trained for their [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6895.04s)]
*  whole life and then you know six to 12 weeks for this particular event. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6901.28s)]
*  When I'm in the ring and I'm in the cage and I'm trying to interview a fighter all [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6905.96s)]
*  I'm trying to do is try to get that person to express themselves the best way they can [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6910.0s)]
*  as respectfully as they can. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6914.4s)]
*  I would have not talked to him like that. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6915.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6918.16s)]
*  You're you're you come across to me as part of the brotherhood of the fighting [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6918.44s)]
*  community whereas I get like Larry Merchant even like Jim Gray. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6923.44s)]
*  Like I don't get that. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6927.2s)]
*  They come across very different to me and I don't mean like you're carrying anybody's [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6928.799999999999s)]
*  water. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6933.0s)]
*  They're sports broadcasters. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6934.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6935.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6936.2s)]
*  You you are you are part of the UFC. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6936.5199999999995s)]
*  I also I do it from a deep respect like. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6941.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6947.599999999999s)]
*  Well that's even your what you were we were talking about earlier. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6947.879999999999s)]
*  You're you're training and all. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6951.08s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6952.76s)]
*  There's a they're coming at it totally different. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6953.72s)]
*  Well Larry Merchant came from a different world. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6956.0s)]
*  You know it's a different world. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6958.28s)]
*  Back in that world you the sports world the way sports broadcasters talk about [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6959.52s)]
*  athletes is very different than the way fight broadcasters talk about athletes. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6965.04s)]
*  You know sports broadcasters will call athletes bums. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6969.72s)]
*  They'll call athletes you know he's lazy he's this that I will never fucking say [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6972.44s)]
*  that in a million years. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6977.36s)]
*  I also think social media is sort of changed because his era athletes couldn't [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6978.84s)]
*  go direct right to social media and express him going direct. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6984.84s)]
*  Yeah right. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6989.240000000001s)]
*  That was him expressing himself. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6989.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6991.240000000001s)]
*  Look you know I don't think I don't think Floyd's wrong. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6991.88s)]
*  I think Floyd's right. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6995.92s)]
*  And I love Larry Merchant. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6996.96s)]
*  But you know look that's just what I think the whole exchange is hilarious. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=6998.280000000001s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7001.64s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7002.360000000001s)]
*  But I would never talk to Floyd Mayweather that way. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7003.4400000000005s)]
*  I would try to get him to express himself the best way possible. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7005.719999999999s)]
*  When he said I want to thank the fans for coming out I would let him say that. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7010.96s)]
*  Yeah right. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7013.799999999999s)]
*  I would have let him get it all out of his system. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7014.04s)]
*  And I would say so your perspective is that he should have protected himself at [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7016.96s)]
*  all times. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7020.599999999999s)]
*  I would have said what did you feel like when he headbutted you. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7021.28s)]

*  They want to see you win. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7360.68s)]
*  They wanted to see there was some shit talking going on. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7361.92s)]
*  And then Conor McGregor took that to a completely new level. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7364.68s)]
*  And while he also had the combo if you have the you know you can talk like him and back [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7367.88s)]
*  it up. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7371.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7372.28s)]
*  Yeah you can talk like him and you're also the elite of the elite you know. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7373.0s)]
*  That's how you become Conor McGregor. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7377.24s)]
*  Yeah I mean but just like that is very very valuable and promotion is very very valuable [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7378.24s)]
*  and they learned that. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7384.88s)]
*  And you know and I wanted to help those guys do that in those moments. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7386.52s)]
*  That's all I'm trying to do is get you like I've had conversations with people that [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7390.16s)]
*  that wind up getting jobs like that and other promotions and I say here's it's not [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7394.6s)]
*  about you. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7398.84s)]
*  Make sure you know it's not about you. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7399.32s)]
*  All you're trying to do is get them to give the best interview that they can give and [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7401.2s)]
*  just stay out of the way. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7406.2s)]
*  Stay out of the way and make it as entertaining as possible. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7407.6s)]
*  Like when Derek Lewis Derek Lewis takes his shorts off in the middle of the cage and I [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7410.92s)]
*  go why'd you take your shirts off. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7415.2s)]
*  My balls was hot. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7416.8s)]
*  I mean they're all. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7418.96s)]
*  And I'm like I understand sir. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7419.88s)]
*  OK. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7421.52s)]
*  I mean my whole thing is just make them shine. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7423.08s)]
*  That's all I'm trying to do. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7425.68s)]
*  And occasionally occasionally I have to confront them about certain things like when [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7426.92s)]
*  Hamsa Chamiah beat Kevin Holland. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7431.76s)]
*  See if you can find that interview when Hamsa Chamiah beat Kevin Holland. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7434.52s)]
*  I was in a very interesting situation because Hamsa weighed in eight and a half pounds [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7438.0s)]
*  overweight and he fucked up the entire main event. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7442.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh I was recently fighting Nate Diaz. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7445.4800000000005s)]
*  So I was in a situation where I wanted to praise Hamsa because he just rag dolled [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7448.72s)]
*  Kevin Holland. One of the most spectacular performances of the year. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7454.0s)]
*  I mean he showed why he's the motherfucker of motherfuckers and why everybody's scared [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7457.36s)]
*  of him. But also he weighed in eight and a half pounds overweight. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7461.04s)]
*  He fucked up the entire promotion. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7464.4s)]
*  Like why did it happen. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7465.92s)]
*  And so like play for me again. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7467.4800000000005s)]
*  This is Chetna. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7478.88s)]
*  Hamsa that was an incredibly impressive impressive performance against a very [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7479.92s)]
*  dangerous guy and Kevin Holland. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7484.64s)]
*  But you were just ran right through. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7486.240000000001s)]
*  I saw this. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7493.360000000001s)]
*  I have to confront him. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7494.76s)]
*  Give it to both guys who left here. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7510.240000000001s)]
*  I fight them both of them. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7512.4800000000005s)]
*  I know you don't care about that now but if you want to compete for the welterweight [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7513.96s)]
*  title it's important that they know you can make 170 pounds. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7517.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7520.56s)]
*  Of course I'm supposed to make the weight as well. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7521.84s)]
*  But doctor stop me. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7525.8s)]
*  Nobody can stop me. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7527.400000000001s)]
*  If I die I die in the cage. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7528.96s)]
*  I didn't come here to make my weight. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7530.84s)]
*  I died in my pants. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7532.280000000001s)]
*  I can't die in the cage. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7533.56s)]
*  I'm dying in the cage. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7535.320000000001s)]
*  I never leave that cage. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7536.84s)]
*  Now it's my home. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7538.12s)]
*  I take everything from you guys. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7539.8s)]
*  I believe that Hamsa but imagine if this was a fight for the title and you came in [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7542.360000000001s)]
*  eight pounds over it wouldn't have taken place. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7547.320000000001s)]
*  It was lower. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7550.0s)]
*  The guy said to me the doctor you have to drink water and make some vitamins and [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7551.320000000001s)]
*  **** and they let me do that **** and I knew that night I can fight that guy. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7556.16s)]
*  So then make my weight up to the guy. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7562.84s)]
*  Yeah I wasn't that more. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7565.88s)]
*  So the doctor told you to stop cutting the weight but you believe you still could [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7567.52s)]
*  have made it. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7570.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7571.24s)]
*  Okay let's take a look at the finish because it was absolutely. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7572.2s)]
*  I give you the most credit. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7574.8s)]
*  I had a hard time that you understand stood him perfectly. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7576.12s)]
*  I love that dude. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7578.64s)]
*  I love you. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7579.96s)]
*  You may be the only one that crowd was. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7580.68s)]
*  I **** love him to death. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7582.24s)]
*  He's got the opposite effect. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7584.52s)]
*  The whole crowd was booing him. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7585.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7586.76s)]
*  Which is good. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7587.0s)]
*  By the way just as good as cheering. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7587.92s)]
*  I don't know why they were booing him. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7589.64s)]
*  I mean they can do whatever they want. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7591.64s)]
*  That's their reaction. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7593.32s)]
*  What do you mean why they're booing him? [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7593.68s)]
*  He basically. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7595.2s)]
*  Did you watch that interview? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7596.52s)]
*  He missed weight and then he's basically like **** you **** you. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7598.2s)]
*  Yeah I get that. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7601.36s)]
*  But you know Kevin Holland was supposed to be fighting Daniel Rodriguez at 180 [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7603.04s)]
*  pounds. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7607.36s)]
*  So Kevin Holland was 180. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7608.08s)]
*  He was at 180. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7609.4400000000005s)]
*  He fought a guy that was at his weight class in that fight. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7610.28s)]
*  So but. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7613.4800000000005s)]
*  And dominated. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7613.84s)]
*  Here's a question then with fighting. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7614.76s)]
*  Like I know a boxing. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7616.32s)]
*  You don't study your opponent. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7618.68s)]
*  But that was not the right opponent. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7621.36s)]
*  Kevin Holland was not supposed to have that opponent. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7622.64s)]
*  Correct. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7624.28s)]
*  So Kevin Holland. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7624.6s)]
*  Kevin Holland was supposed to fight Daniel Rodriguez. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7625.68s)]
*  He's primarily a stand up guy. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7627.6s)]
*  So did Kevin Holland have a choice. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7629.200000000001s)]
*  Like no I don't want this fight. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7630.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7632.04s)]
*  Got it. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7632.72s)]
*  Because I mean. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7633.080000000001s)]
*  Kevin Holland's a gangster. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7633.72s)]
*  He'll fight anybody. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7635.0s)]
*  And he said I'll **** take it. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7636.04s)]
*  I'll take it. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7637.56s)]
*  You know Kevin Holland's a **** entertaining guy. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7639.280000000001s)]
*  But this is for a fight where you just trained stand up and you're against [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7642.6s)]
*  literally the best wrestler in the division who's a **** ****. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7647.360000000001s)]
*  That guy is a **** ****. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7651.4800000000005s)]
*  Hamzat ragdolls people and talk **** while he's doing it. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7652.72s)]
*  He picked up Lee Jinglian and carried him to Dana White while he was talking ****. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7655.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7660.84s)]
*  Well that's my point though. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7661.04s)]
*  To what you're saying is a gangster. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7662.240000000001s)]
*  So he took the fight. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7663.96s)]
*  Like you train for one guy then you get the. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7664.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7666.72s)]
*  Arguably the best guy is a totally different style. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7666.88s)]
*  He had to just do what he did and hope that his skills would prevail and they [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7668.8s)]
*  didn't. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7673.0s)]
*  He got **** up. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7673.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7674.68s)]
*  But if he survived that. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7675.04s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7676.4400000000005s)]
*  The pace that Hamzat put on in that first round. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7677.0s)]
*  I don't know if he would have been able to do that for three rounds. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7679.6s)]
*  He might have significantly tired if he didn't get that finish because the amount [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7681.84s)]
*  of look at this. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7686.72s)]
*  He picks up Lee Jinglian and he carries him over to Dana White drops him down. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7687.52s)]
*  And while he was doing it he was talking **** to Dana. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7692.84s)]
*  Like when he's not seen it here but before that when he picks up Lee Jinglian. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7695.76s)]
*  Go and think this was that this is a different this is a different opponent. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7700.4800000000005s)]
*  This is just him ****. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7703.08s)]
*  He just carries this around. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7703.96s)]
*  This is him ragdolling people. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7705.2s)]
*  But when he fought Lee Jinglian he literally hoisted him up is right here. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7707.08s)]
*  He no that's an uppercut. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7711.88s)]
*  That's in another organization. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7713.84s)]
*  So he carries Lee Jinglian over to Dana White. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7715.320000000001s)]
*  And so he just looks he's looking over Dana White is like I **** kill everyone. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7718.360000000001s)]
*  Like he's lifting the dude in the that's not Lee Jinglian either. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7723.16s)]
*  That's another guy. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7726.76s)]
*  He just carries people then because he's just a monster. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7728.320000000001s)]
*  But the fact that he's literally hoisting Lee Jinglian who's a top flight fighter [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7731.76s)]
*  top flight welterweight fighter. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7736.96s)]
*  He's holding him up in the air talking to Dana White. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7738.64s)]
*  I kill everyone. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7741.08s)]
*  He's like in the middle of a fight. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7742.6s)]
*  Everybody talks to Dana White. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7743.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7744.96s)]
*  But he during the middle of a fight while you're ****ing a guy up before you even [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7745.2s)]
*  decide to **** him up you're holding him up in the air talking ****. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7749.4400000000005s)]
*  That's how good that guy is. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7752.6s)]
*  He's so good and he's so focused and dedicated. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7754.16s)]
*  Hamza Chamayev is a ****ing terrifying human being. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7758.04s)]
*  So who's here. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7761.12s)]
*  Like. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7762.280000000001s)]
*  OK. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7763.96s)]
*  So on the casual I know who he is now. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7764.2s)]
*  I've known who he is. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7766.64s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce his name. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7767.52s)]
*  But he's a guy if they got a fight like who who's capable of giving him a fight. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7768.84s)]
*  Everybody in the division the top guys. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7774.72s)]
*  Bilal Mohammed Leon Edwards who's the champion. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7777.04s)]
*  Kamaru Usman. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7780.0s)]
*  All those guys are very capable. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7780.88s)]
*  So is Usman. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7782.4800000000005s)]
*  He's a huge name obviously. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7784.320000000001s)]
*  He's the one who got caught by Edwards. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7785.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7787.08s)]
*  So is that the next fight. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7787.360000000001s)]
*  I think Usman the rumor was that he has to get hand surgery. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7789.68s)]
*  Kamaru Usman had a tear in one of the ligaments in his hand that had bothered him for a long time. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7794.16s)]
*  It was misdiagnosed and then he had to eventually wind up getting surgery and he got that surgery before the Leon Edwards fight. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7800.56s)]
*  But I believe the word is that he needs another surgery for his hand. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7807.64s)]
*  I don't know if it's the same hand. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7813.88s)]
*  I don't know what it is but I do know that there's been talk of whether or not he will fight Leon Edwards for the title in England. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7815.6s)]
*  Because that's a giant fight. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7823.96s)]
*  Leon's coming home. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7825.280000000001s)]
*  Spectacular knockout one of the greatest head kick knockouts if not the greatest the most consequential in the history of sport. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7826.76s)]
*  Fifth round down on the cards a minute to go. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7832.8s)]
*  And then again that's why John Anik is the goat. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7836.280000000001s)]
*  John Anik is literally saying that he could stop and he could he could resign himself to his fate but that's not the cloth he's cut from. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7838.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7844.52s)]
*  Boom. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7844.84s)]
*  Head kick right after he says that. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7845.360000000001s)]
*  The greatest call in the history of MMA and maybe the history of all sports. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7847.200000000001s)]
*  And then that would be the big fight. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7851.4800000000005s)]
*  There's the rematch because Kamaru was winning that fight and if he just chose to fight defensively and move away that round he would have won that fight. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7855.080000000001s)]
*  But he engaged and he got head kicked. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7862.320000000001s)]
*  That would be the big fight. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7865.0s)]
*  But if Leon wants to fight in March and if Kamaru can't recover in time I don't know maybe there's a minor surgery that only needed a few weeks off and he can get back. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7866.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the story is but I've heard various stories. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7876.88s)]
*  I haven't talked to Leon. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7880.6s)]
*  I haven't talked to Dana about it. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7881.68s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7882.84s)]
*  What is what is the latest on the latest I saw it's still from like December was one of what Thompson said something in an interview and then like Ali said that's fake news. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7884.160000000001s)]
*  And I haven't I can't find another update newer than that. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7894.280000000001s)]
*  Like he said he was supposed to have hand surgery is what Thompson was saying. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7898.4800000000005s)]
*  They might want him to fight in my words. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7901.4400000000005s)]
*  Well dude if but Thompson broke his his hand in that fight too. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7903.400000000001s)]
*  Thompson broke his hand in the fight with Kevin Holland. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7907.4800000000005s)]
*  Kevin Holland broke his hand on Wonder Boy and Wonder Boy broke his hand on Kevin. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7910.16s)]
*  He said they're looking at where he was. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7914.8s)]
*  Now that's a good fight. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7916.64s)]
*  That's a good fight because Jorge Masvidal sucker punched Leon Edwards backstage when Jorge just won a fight. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7917.92s)]
*  And then I think he just knocked out Darren till. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7925.8s)]
*  Masvidal was my most Miami night I've ever had. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7928.4s)]
*  What happened. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7931.28s)]
*  I love him. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7933.12s)]
*  So I am in Miami and I got invited to a barbecue at Masvidal's house and I've known Masvidal from the early like you know backyard fights basically the Kimbo stuff. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7934.0s)]
*  I knew it was like all right I'll go to this. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7950.72s)]
*  They asked they actually there it is. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7954.2s)]
*  They actually asked me they go you you bring your girlfriend and I was like should I. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7958.0s)]
*  Like I will. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7965.16s)]
*  I don't even know how they had. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7966.84s)]
*  They knew I had a girlfriend. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7968.599999999999s)]
*  No don't bring her if you're coming to this. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7969.679999999999s)]
*  It's like all right fine. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7971.12s)]
*  It was. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7972.5199999999995s)]
*  That a girl sitting next to me who was like. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7974.719999999999s)]
*  Assigned to me basically like everywhere I went the girl was following. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7979.92s)]
*  And finally. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7984.92s)]
*  Somebody like are you not interested like no I'm not interested. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7987.5199999999995s)]
*  I have a I have a girlfriend. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7991.04s)]
*  She was there for me. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7993.0s)]
*  It was a wild wild experience. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7994.48s)]
*  They had all this food barbecue everything. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=7998.5199999999995s)]
*  But that was to me he's like the real king of Miami. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8000.839999999999s)]
*  It was a it was a wild wild barbecue. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8004.32s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker that knockout of Ben Askren. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8009.12s)]
*  Oh my god craziest knockouts in the history of sport. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8012.08s)]
*  That was crazy. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8015.08s)]
*  And one of the great celebrations. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8016.56s)]
*  Oh my god of all time. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8018.4s)]
*  Oh my god the sleep so yeah when he just punched him a couple of times where he's out cold. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8019.76s)]
*  Somebody did that celebration the other night they mimicked it. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8025.92s)]
*  I forget what I was watching but they mimic the Mosvadov that to me is like maybe the most iconic celebration I've seen. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8028.32s)]
*  It's one of them. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8035.76s)]
*  It's definitely one of them. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8036.64s)]
*  It's it was just a perfectly timed and a clever knockout. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8037.68s)]
*  He did it on purpose. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8041.96s)]
*  He did it. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8043.120000000001s)]
*  He planned it out. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8043.52s)]
*  And you could see him training that there's video footage of him. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8044.400000000001s)]
*  I saw that because he knew that he tried to shoot. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8047.4400000000005s)]
*  Stink was 100 percent going to shoot. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8049.8s)]
*  And if he gave him that opportunity. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8052.0s)]
*  So he came at him like this and he went at him at an angle. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8053.64s)]
*  And then when he went out an angle Askren is just immediately going to try to contain him. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8056.4800000000005s)]
*  That's in his instinct. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8060.4400000000005s)]
*  It's his fucking DNA. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8061.96s)]
*  He's an elite wrestler. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8063.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8064.040000000001s)]
*  And then he comes out with that flying knee. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8064.400000000001s)]
*  I like Ben. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8066.400000000001s)]
*  Ben has one of the now his legacy is getting knocked out for a guy who was like what you said a world class wrestler. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8067.32s)]
*  Well we got him. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8074.8s)]
*  Unfortunately it was I was one of the reasons why he got into the UFC because I was telling Dana forever. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8076.32s)]
*  You got to get this guy. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8082.44s)]
*  He's great. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8083.4s)]
*  He's great with the mouth. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8083.96s)]
*  And he's a specialist man when he was in Bellator. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8085.08s)]
*  That's when he was in his prime. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8088.12s)]
*  When we got him in the UFC he already had fucked up hip like he had a hip replacement. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8089.96s)]
*  And you know and then when he fought Jake Paul in the boxing match which he had no business in doing he just did it because he's just give it a try. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8093.759999999999s)]
*  And a lot of money. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8100.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah right. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8101.839999999999s)]
*  He had no business doing that. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8102.799999999999s)]
*  That's not a sport. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8103.919999999999s)]
*  But when he was in Bellator when he was the champion in Bellator he was a motherfucker. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8105.16s)]
*  He would rag doll people like Douglas Lima and Andre Koroskov all these elite killer fighters. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8110.919999999999s)]
*  And I was like Jesus Christ could he do this to everybody. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8117.599999999999s)]
*  He might be able to do this to everybody. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8120.36s)]
*  And he might have been able to do that to everybody if they fought him during that time period. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8121.8s)]
*  But unfortunately he was in Bellator and Bellator was always considered like the B League. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8126.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8131.0s)]
*  It was never you know like it was always like guys who fought there. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8131.4400000000005s)]
*  They fought there because they couldn't fight in the UFC. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8134.72s)]
*  And I was like maybe for some of them. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8137.12s)]
*  But I don't think that's the case for. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8139.240000000001s)]
*  There's guys over there in Bellator guys like Douglas Lima that I could think could beat anybody in the world. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8141.4400000000005s)]
*  They just have to. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8147.64s)]
*  They just have to be in the situation where they could fight them. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8148.84s)]
*  And that's how I felt about Ben Askren at that time. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8151.76s)]
*  I'm like he's so fucking good man. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8154.4400000000005s)]
*  He's so fucking good. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8156.8s)]
*  And his wrestling was so above and beyond what everybody else's was that he would get a hold of you and you were just going down. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8158.08s)]
*  You're going for a ride baby. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8164.56s)]
*  And you couldn't stand up with them because you know you always worried that if you committed to a strike he was going to grab a leg grab an ankle grab your fucking waist. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8166.2s)]
*  And then you're rag dolled. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8175.2s)]
*  And that's what he did to everybody. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8176.64s)]
*  Finally Ben Askren highlight in Bellator because when he was in Bellator people thought it was boring because all he was doing was like throwing him to the ground and giving him noogies. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8178.28s)]
*  Like he wasn't like a devastating striker and he wasn't a devastating ground and pound man. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8189.64s)]
*  But for me it was I'm a purist. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8194.4s)]
*  I want to see what a person is capable of doing to another person. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8197.8s)]
*  And if even if it's not exciting even if that person can just take that person down at will and hold them down and keep punching them. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8201.28s)]
*  Even if the punches aren't devastating I am fascinated by someone's ability to impose their skill set on someone else. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8208.080000000002s)]
*  See that I've had this was this was Ben Askren man he would just take guys down and you know these aren't the most devastating elbows but you ain't doing shit about it. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8213.6s)]
*  You can't do shit about it. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8222.04s)]
*  And if he can do that to you for five rounds and so be it. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8223.44s)]
*  Everybody got taken down. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8226.36s)]
*  Everybody went for a ride. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8227.960000000001s)]
*  Everybody wound up with Ben Askren on top of them beating the fucking shit out of them. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8229.480000000001s)]
*  And you know was he the most exciting fighter. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8234.84s)]
*  No no but was he exciting to me. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8237.24s)]
*  Yes because I'm a purist. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8239.84s)]
*  What I want to see is guys at the height of their ability doing what they want to do to people. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8242.44s)]
*  Look how he avoids this leg lock and he just starts beating people up. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8248.48s)]
*  They didn't know what the fuck to do. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8251.48s)]
*  They couldn't believe it. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8252.84s)]
*  He could just take you down at will. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8253.64s)]
*  And the way he would do it was so weird like that. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8255.039999999999s)]
*  Like look at it just back up a little bit so you can see that exchange right there. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8257.52s)]
*  Like he's he goes down on his back and then grabs a hold of a leg. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8261.64s)]
*  Like he's doing things you're not supposed to do. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8266.080000000002s)]
*  You got to be a purist. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8267.880000000001s)]
*  This to me just looks like mesh like this to me is a turn the channel. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8269.04s)]
*  But this is not to me because this is a guy that is doing what his skill set is. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8272.44s)]
*  He's doing wrestling and he's doing it to the best fighters in the division and just beating the shit out of them. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8278.28s)]
*  And no one could stop it. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8283.52s)]
*  I firmly believe that if the Ben Askren in the peak of his condition at Bellator fighting the UFC I think he's a fucking nightmare for everyone in the sport. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8285.0s)]
*  Everyone. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8293.880000000001s)]
*  Maybe guys like Kamaru Usman because he's also an elite wrestler would give him a hard time. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8294.84s)]
*  And maybe he would have beat him. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8300.08s)]
*  But I would have loved to have seen it. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8301.36s)]
*  I would have loved to have seen him against Tyron Woodley in his prime against all those guys in their prime against Wonder Boy in his prime. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8302.84s)]
*  I would have loved to see it. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8308.32s)]
*  Could you stop that. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8309.16s)]
*  Can you stop that guy. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8310.08s)]
*  So what do you think then of you're talking guys in their prime and what do you think you mentioned him. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8311.16s)]
*  What do you think of the Jake Paul phenomenon. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8315.640000000001s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8317.880000000001s)]
*  And anybody who denies he's a bad motherfucker is crazy. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8319.28s)]
*  He knocked down Anderson Silva in a boxing match. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8321.72s)]
*  I don't care if Anderson still was 47 years old. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8325.359999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he's in the best shape that you could be at 47. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8328.72s)]
*  And I'm sure they're drug testing especially non-existent. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8332.359999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he was probably trained as well as you can be trained at 47 years old. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8336.039999999999s)]
*  And he's also like a certified killer. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8342.76s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8345.76s)]
*  Anderson Silva was so fucking good and still good. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8347.119999999999s)]
*  I mean in the beginning the first round he was winning that fight. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8350.439999999999s)]
*  You see what Anderson Silva is capable of and Jake Paul beat him. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8352.64s)]
*  That's fucking end of story. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8357.08s)]
*  Now if he goes on to start beating actual real professional boxers with credible records that's where things get interesting. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8359.119999999999s)]
*  And I think the way he's doing it is brilliant. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8365.96s)]
*  He's at least fights Nate Robinson. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8367.8s)]
*  He fights Ben Askren. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8369.96s)]
*  He fights Tyron Woodley gets all these fucking brutal knockouts against guys who are like at least have names. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8371.56s)]
*  Tyron Woodley even though Tyron Woodley might have been you know at the end of his career and maybe not as dedicated he was when he was the welterweight champion of the UFC. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8378.16s)]
*  He's still Tyron fucking Woodley. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8387.84s)]
*  He's still a dangerous dangerous man. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8389.44s)]
*  And Jake Paul flatlined him. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8391.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8393.16s)]
*  Flatlined him. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8393.36s)]
*  That is. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8394.72s)]
*  I don't know if I'll ever fight a boxer. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8395.28s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8398.039999999999s)]
*  You think so. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8398.96s)]
*  Sure. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8399.56s)]
*  Why. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8400.16s)]
*  Because the money's right. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8400.64s)]
*  If the money's right they give him the right fight where it makes sense like Tommy Fury. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8401.72s)]
*  That's a good fight for him. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8405.44s)]
*  Tommy Fury is not a real boxer. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8406.52s)]
*  Of course he's a real boxer. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8408.16s)]
*  No chance. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8409.039999999999s)]
*  He's a professional boxer. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8409.4s)]
*  Is he a world champion. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8411.08s)]
*  No. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8412.84s)]
*  But he's it maybe he is. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8413.6s)]
*  Is he. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8415.28s)]
*  No. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8415.68s)]
*  What is he. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8416.32s)]
*  What is Tommy Fury. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8416.92s)]
*  He might have some sort of a title. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8418.0s)]
*  If he does it's a name only. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8419.48s)]
*  I saw Tommy Fury box. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8421.6s)]
*  He is not a boxer. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8423.4s)]
*  Well he's definitely a boxer. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8424.68s)]
*  Well he puts on gloves. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8426.56s)]
*  He's definitely a boxer. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8427.84s)]
*  But is he a boxer like his brother. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8429.32s)]
*  No. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8431.88s)]
*  Well clearly but you. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8432.2s)]
*  Tommy Fury would not. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8433.76s)]
*  We would not know who Tommy Fury was if his last name wasn't Fury. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8434.96s)]
*  Probably we wouldn't know as much about him. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8439.039999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8441.76s)]
*  But he's still a good looking guy. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8442.24s)]
*  He's built great. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8444.08s)]
*  He you know he looks like. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8445.16s)]
*  Well those are. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8446.56s)]
*  He looks the part. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8446.76s)]
*  Looks the part. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8448.199999999999s)]
*  No doubt. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8449.08s)]
*  But what I'm saying when I guess. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8449.6s)]
*  He's a good journeyman boxer. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8451.16s)]
*  Let me rephrase this. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8452.52s)]

*  Why would I hate Tommy Fury? [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8545.640000000001s)]
*  He's not Demetri Bival. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8547.839999999998s)]
*  He's not Canelo Alvarez. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8549.48s)]
*  But he is 100% a real boxer. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8551.0s)]
*  I'd like to get the combined records of everybody [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8553.439999999999s)]
*  Tommy Fury has fight. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8555.88s)]

*  with a lot of undefeated fighters [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8562.32s)]
*  as they're making their way up? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8563.8s)]
*  Because what happens is fighters are very clever. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8565.0s)]
*  Their managers are very clever. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8567.599999999999s)]
*  They match them up with people that's [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8568.8s)]
*  going to give them a good record. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8569.96s)]

*  They want to see someone who's like an undefeated fighter [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8576.48s)]
*  or like 16 and 1. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8579.24s)]
*  The last guy he fought was 11 and 2. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8580.52s)]

*  Guys get fucked up all the time in training. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8661.16s)]
*  They break hands. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8662.880000000001s)]
*  They fuck their wrists up. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8663.68s)]

*  They're trying to make the most amount of money possible. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8676.68s)]
*  The same thing with Tommy Fury. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8678.88s)]
*  They're trying to set it up where if he's going to fight in the lead fighter. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8680.039999999999s)]
*  I hope they fight because I'll put my net worth on Jake Paul. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8683.56s)]
*  What if Tommy Fury boxes him up? [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8686.92s)]
*  What are you going to do then? [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8688.72s)]
*  He won't. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8689.84s)]
*  You don't know that. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8691.16s)]
*  I was at the fight, the Jake Paul fight in Cleveland. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8692.28s)]
*  Tyrone Woodley won and Tommy Fury fought on that undercard. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8696.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8700.28s)]
*  He was the worst fighter I've ever seen. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8700.880000000001s)]
*  So maybe he's improved. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8702.76s)]
*  Okay, well let's find that fight. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8703.720000000001s)]
*  Let's find that fight. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8704.6s)]
*  Maybe he's improved by light years since that fight. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8706.24s)]
*  What I'm seeing right there, that is a boxing. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8709.0s)]
*  I could probably watch you versus a tomato can and you'd be throwing haymaker and be [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8711.16s)]
*  like oh he can throw punches but it's versus tomato can. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8715.640000000001s)]
*  That's not just haymakers. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8718.68s)]
*  It's skillful boxing. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8720.04s)]
*  The way he's setting that up, that's very skillful. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8721.32s)]
*  So here's the fight versus Taylor. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8725.16s)]
*  Taylor by the way I think showed up on, he was working the ticket booth before that. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8729.32s)]
*  Somebody dropped out and they needed. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8734.52s)]
*  Yeah, I do believe this is a last minute replacement. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8737.0s)]
*  But what I'm seeing is a real boxer. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8739.16s)]
*  And if you don't think he's a real boxer, you're being a hater. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8741.4s)]
*  I have no reason to hate him because he's good looking. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8744.36s)]
*  No, because he's Tommy Fury's brother. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8746.84s)]
*  Or he's you know. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8748.92s)]
*  I love Tommy. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8749.96s)]
*  I love Tyson Fury. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8751.24s)]
*  I just have never. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8752.44s)]
*  We're gonna have to agree. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8754.44s)]
*  I don't think he can. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8755.48s)]
*  It's not the best video but you're still seeing a real boxer man. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8758.92s)]
*  He's a fucking boxer. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8762.6s)]
*  Just by standing there? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8763.48s)]
*  No, by boxing. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8764.92s)]
*  He's fucking boxing. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8766.44s)]
*  This might not be the best performance that he has ever had in his career. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8769.0s)]
*  But what I see from his highlight reel, what I see from some of the fights that I've watched, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8772.52s)]
*  he's a good boxer man. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8776.76s)]
*  You're seeing it right here. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8778.04s)]
*  He's a real boxer dude. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8779.96s)]
*  You think he's not? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8781.48s)]
*  You're crazy. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8782.12s)]
*  If you're saying he was good in this fight, I got nothing for you. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8783.24s)]
*  Because he was. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8786.68s)]
*  Right here. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8787.08s)]
*  What are you seeing here? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8787.48s)]
*  You're seeing a bad fighter? [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8788.28s)]
*  I'm seeing a guy just standing in the ring. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8790.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're so crazy. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8791.96s)]
*  You're seeing a good fighter right there? [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8793.32s)]
*  He's fighting. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8794.92s)]
*  He's fighting a guy that's not elite. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8795.72s)]
*  But me and you, if we just start fighting, we're fighting. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8797.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not fighting a guy that's elite. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8799.4s)]
*  But he's still fighting. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8801.56s)]
*  He's a real boxer. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8802.84s)]
*  For you to say he's not a real boxer is crazy. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8804.28s)]
*  What's Anthony Taylor's record? [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8806.6s)]
*  This is a last minute replacement. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8809.96s)]
*  This is not the best example of him. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8811.8s)]
*  And I'm not saying that he's even reached his full potential [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8814.2s)]
*  or gotten to a place where I think that he should be in consideration [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8817.08s)]
*  to be fighting for any kind of a title. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8821.32s)]
*  Jake Paul beating Tommy Fury does nothing for me in terms of me. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8822.92s)]
*  I think Jake Paul, I have no idea. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8826.84s)]
*  I'd love to see him fight what I consider a guy who has dedicated his life to boxing, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8828.92s)]
*  which Tommy Fury has not. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8834.2s)]
*  How do you know? [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8836.039999999999s)]
*  Because I've watched him fight. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8837.24s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8839.08s)]
*  It's so crazy to say. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8839.88s)]
*  How do you know he hasn't dedicated his life because you watched him fight [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8841.24s)]
*  and he doesn't seem to... [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8843.96s)]
*  Because he was on... [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8844.76s)]
*  He's two and three. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8847.24s)]
*  That guy was two and three? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8848.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8849.8s)]
*  So if you can really fight, you take him out pretty quick. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8850.44s)]
*  There's a lot of guys that are two and three that are still good fighters. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8853.08s)]
*  He was on... [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8855.56s)]
*  He's Big Brother. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8856.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8857.96s)]
*  That's not a real fighter. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8858.76s)]
*  Because he was on Big Brother? [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8859.96s)]
*  Yeah, because... [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8860.92s)]
*  Probably on Big Brother for publicity. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8861.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was definitely on for publicity. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8865.0s)]
*  Wasn't Andrew Tate on one of those fucking stupid reality shows too? [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8867.0s)]
*  Andrew Tate was a world-class kickboxer, a world champion kickboxer. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8869.96s)]
*  It doesn't mean that someone sucks just because they're on some stupid reality show. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8873.32s)]
*  Was Tate on before or after? [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8877.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8879.24s)]
*  He was on Big Brother, I think. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8879.56s)]
*  No, he was. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8881.08s)]
*  He got kicked off, I think. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8881.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8883.72s)]
*  What do you think of all his stuff? [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8885.4s)]
*  I don't know what's happening. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8888.68s)]
*  What really happened and why is Romania going after him? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8891.0s)]
*  Are they being pressured by someone else to do this? [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8895.0s)]
*  What is the reason why they're doing it? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8897.64s)]
*  And what do they have on him? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8899.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8900.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, that to me is the right answer. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8901.64s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8906.68s)]
*  A lot of people are acting like they know. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8907.48s)]
*  If you go really... [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8908.84s)]
*  Well, they want him. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8909.56s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8910.6s)]
*  They want him to go down and they want him... [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8911.72s)]
*  He represents something. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8913.96s)]
*  He represents toxic masculinity. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8915.16s)]
*  Well, he is. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8917.4s)]
*  He is sort of toxic. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8918.6s)]
*  Romania Thornes, they seize his car collection as investigation continues. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8919.72s)]
*  The one thing I don't get about this... [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8924.039999999999s)]
*  Well, I do get, I understand. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8925.8s)]
*  People are actually like want the charges to be true, which is crazy, [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8927.32s)]
*  because that would mean a lot of bad shit to happen to a lot of bad people. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8931.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would rather the charges be incorrect. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8934.84s)]
*  Look, Romania, I don't know what their system is like. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8937.64s)]
*  I don't know whether they're corrupt. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8941.64s)]
*  I've heard things, but I don't have any real information. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8943.32s)]
*  So I'd be talking out of my ass to say, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8947.24s)]
*  you know, if he really did like sex traffic people, [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8949.96s)]
*  if he really did all the things he's saying, [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8953.64s)]
*  well, I hope that gets proven in court and I hope he gets punished. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8955.88s)]
*  If he really did that, if he didn't do that, I hope he gets exonerated [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8959.24s)]
*  and I hope he gets the fuck out of Romania. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8962.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8964.12s)]
*  I don't know what he did. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8965.0s)]
*  I know a lot of what he does is theater, right? [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8966.36s)]
*  A lot of what he does is very like satire. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8969.08s)]
*  He plays the role of this boastful misogynist who smokes cigars and drives Lamborghinis [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8971.48s)]
*  and that's his thing. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8978.12s)]
*  And because of that, he's amassed an amazing amount of money [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8979.160000000002s)]
*  and he's done it by doing this character's online persona. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8982.44s)]
*  But then also says very wise things. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8986.44s)]
*  He says ridiculous shit, but also says really interesting things. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8989.720000000001s)]
*  He's a very smart guy. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8993.960000000001s)]
*  If you listen to him being interviewed by Patrick Bette David, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8995.240000000002s)]
*  Patrick Bette David interviewed him after he got canceled off of all social media [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=8998.68s)]
*  and Patrick is fantastic. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9002.68s)]
*  He's really good at letting people talk and talking to everybody [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9003.880000000001s)]
*  and Patrick is so wealthy and so successful outside of the world of podcasting [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9008.279999999999s)]
*  that he only does it because he's interested in him. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9013.64s)]
*  And so he's the perfect guy to handle that [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9016.279999999999s)]
*  because he does not afraid to talk to anybody. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9018.279999999999s)]
*  He'll talk to anybody. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9020.199999999999s)]
*  And so he had him on for a long form conversation. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9021.64s)]
*  They talked for hours and you get to see this is a very intelligent and calculated guy. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9024.359999999999s)]
*  You might not agree with his message. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9029.08s)]
*  You might not agree with all the misogynist stuff. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9030.599999999999s)]
*  You might not agree with, and I don't agree with it. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9032.68s)]
*  You might not agree with all the crazy antics, but you cannot deny [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9034.84s)]
*  that that's been incredibly successful because it resonates with a lot of young men [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9040.44s)]
*  who don't feel represented in the media. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9043.960000000001s)]
*  And they see this guy and it looks like fun. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9046.12s)]
*  Do they agree with what he's saying? [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9047.960000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean they agree with it. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9049.16s)]
*  They think it's fun. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9050.28s)]
*  It's like pro wrestling. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9051.32s)]
*  He's like a bad guy in pro wrestling. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9052.6s)]
*  He's a heel. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9054.44s)]
*  He's smoking cigars with his Lamborghini's and... [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9055.56s)]
*  See, that's where I go. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9058.52s)]
*  I think there's probably a lot of people think that [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9062.44s)]
*  and then I think there's probably other people who take it seriously. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9064.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9067.08s)]
*  That's where it's a super... [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9067.560000000001s)]
*  That is where it gets fucked up. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9069.560000000001s)]
*  Where it gets fucked up is like young boys repeating the shit that he's saying to young girls [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9071.480000000001s)]
*  because they think that they're supposed to do that. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9076.76s)]
*  He owns them, which is nuts. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9079.24s)]
*  So you hope people are like, oh, that's an act. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9081.400000000001s)]
*  The one thing I will say for an intelligent guy, which I agree with you he is, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9084.12s)]
*  to be doing the things he's being accused of doing [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9089.32s)]
*  and then go seek publicity is a very unwise move. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9093.0s)]
*  If he did the things that he did. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9097.960000000001s)]
*  Then it's like what you would think if you're committing atrocities, [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9099.960000000001s)]
*  you would try to stay under the radar. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9104.12s)]
*  He does quite the opposite. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9105.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but again, we don't know. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9107.16s)]
*  No, nobody knows. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9109.560000000001s)]
*  That's the problem is... [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9110.2s)]
*  That's like the pizza thing, the pizza box. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9111.560000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9113.4s)]
*  Everybody saying he got busted because of the pizza box [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9114.36s)]
*  and then the authorities like that had nothing to do with it. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9117.48s)]
*  No, they knew he was in Romania. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9119.24s)]
*  It was just... [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9120.6s)]
*  What's that word? [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9121.24s)]
*  Schadenfrode? [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9121.88s)]
*  Schadenfrud. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9123.08s)]
*  Schadenfrud. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9123.88s)]
*  That's what he was. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9124.6s)]
*  He's making fun of Greta Thunberg and then he gets fucking arrested right afterwards. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9125.88s)]
*  It's kind of hilarious. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9129.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9130.52s)]
*  The way it happens, like people said it's the biggest self-owned L. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9130.92s)]
*  Third biggest tweet or retweet. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9135.24s)]
*  It was Greta. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9137.24s)]
*  I mean, it was okay. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9138.119999999999s)]
*  It's kind of funny when she said that's what happens [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9139.64s)]
*  if you don't recycle your pizza boxes. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9141.4s)]
*  That shit's hilarious. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9142.84s)]
*  That was good. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9144.119999999999s)]
*  Chad, that shit's hilarious. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9144.68s)]
*  You got to give it to her. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9145.96s)]
*  And also, why are you going after some 19-year-old autistic [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9147.88s)]
*  who was really into climate change? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9150.68s)]
*  I tried to figure out whether that was provoked. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9151.8s)]
*  He just did that out of the blue? [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9157.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9158.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's just talking shit. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9159.0s)]
*  Now again, that move from somebody who's being accused of sex trafficking, [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9160.359999999999s)]
*  I think rape was thrown in there. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9164.52s)]
*  And then you're out there being like, look at me, look at me, crazy. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9166.44s)]
*  Again, but what you said nailed it. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9169.8s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9171.24s)]
*  I think the latest thing that they're saying is tax evasion. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9172.6s)]
*  Right? [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9177.24s)]
*  Is that it? [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9177.800000000001s)]
*  Is that what they're saying? [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9178.44s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9179.24s)]
*  I'm Googling them now. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9180.12s)]
*  I just found an exclusive story on Vice that says the reason he was kicked off of Big Brother [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9180.84s)]
*  is not the reason that was publicly known or what was thought of. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9186.84s)]
*  It says that he was arrested for suspicion of rape in 2015. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9190.92s)]
*  He was investigated over allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse in the UK [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9195.320000000002s)]
*  during which time he appeared on Big Brother for five days. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9200.68s)]
*  It was just posted a little bit ago. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9203.32s)]
*  UK authorities declined to prosecute. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9204.92s)]
*  This says that they told the producers of the show five days before he was kicked off. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9208.2s)]
*  Then a video was found of him and a girl doing something. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9214.52s)]
*  That then they came out and said this was a kinky video they were making. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9219.08s)]
*  And everyone thought he was kicked off the video. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9221.880000000001s)]
*  The girl came out and said that that was very consensual and that they were doing role play [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9222.44s)]
*  and that they liked to do this thing where he would beat her up or something. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9227.88s)]
*  This article is saying that didn't have anything to do with why he was kicked off the show. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9230.92s)]
*  This is one of the perfect examples of what we're talking about. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9234.119999999999s)]
*  I don't fucking believe Vice. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9239.4s)]
*  How can you believe anything that is said about somebody so controversial because everybody [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9243.0s)]
*  seemingly has already made up their mind. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9248.759999999998s)]
*  So where to get real information on him? [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9251.08s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9253.0s)]
*  All the objectionable stuff I think also was unnecessary. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9253.56s)]
*  I think if you want, I mean I don't know him. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9257.0s)]
*  If I did know him I would tell him all the the [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9259.24s)]
*  bullshit and the shit about him being the top G and all that stuff. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9262.44s)]
*  All that shit is great. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9268.28s)]
*  But the misogynistic stuff like if you have daughters or if you have a wife or if you have [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9269.72s)]
*  sisters you don't want that. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9274.44s)]
*  That narrative like putting that out there that's negative to everybody. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9277.56s)]
*  It's not even positive to him. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9281.64s)]
*  It's like it's not necessary. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9283.56s)]
*  We had him on one of our podcasts and he almost struck me exactly how you said. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9285.08s)]
*  Let's say he's talking for 10 minutes. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9291.0s)]
*  I'm like oh making sense smart and then he says something so wild over the top. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9292.92s)]
*  Literally like women are my property. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9298.52s)]
*  I own them. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9300.2s)]
*  It's like whoa what'd you just say? [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9300.68s)]
*  And that's what he does. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9303.56s)]
*  He's also selling that class. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9305.32s)]
*  What is the class? [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9307.64s)]
*  The hustlers university. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9308.52s)]
*  What is that? [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9310.44s)]
*  What are they teaching people? [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9310.92s)]
*  It's like to hustle. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9312.039999999999s)]
*  But what are they teaching? [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9313.8s)]
*  Are they? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9314.52s)]
*  To hustle. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9316.84s)]
*  They can quit at any time they want. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9317.48s)]
*  It's like 70 bucks a month and you become a top G. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9319.0s)]
*  That's literally. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9322.76s)]
*  I mean is that bad? [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9323.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9325.72s)]
*  I mean is it a con game or is he trying to give them legitimate information? [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9326.36s)]
*  What has he given him other than what he's already said in interviews? [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9331.24s)]
*  How is it the university? [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9335.16s)]
*  He has people who and that's where it's a grayer. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9337.08s)]
*  Aren't they like professors? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9341.96s)]

*  But he if you want to use the word toxic masculinity he's it. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9462.28s)]
*  Well the bad stuff that he said it bodies that. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9467.800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9471.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah and that's what people are that's why people are rooting for what he said to be true [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9471.720000000001s)]
*  because they don't want that. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9477.16s)]
*  Right but you're still crazy to root for that because you're not thinking about the victims [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9478.12s)]
*  that would be basically that that means a lot of people were hurt. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9482.12s)]
*  Well it means if it's true you want them to be punished. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9485.800000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9489.560000000001s)]
*  Like hoping that it's not true when it is true is not good either. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9490.2s)]
*  No but you know I'm saying like if you're hoping that it's true and it's not true that's [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9495.240000000002s)]
*  horrible because you are hoping for people to have been victimized. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9500.36s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9503.0s)]
*  Yes right. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9503.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah I mean you should never hope violent crimes are committed. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9504.44s)]
*  Right absolutely agreed yeah for sure. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9508.12s)]
*  But you also hope that he's not accused of these things when it's just because of his [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9510.92s)]
*  bombastic personality and talking shit and getting all this attention which he clearly has done. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9514.28s)]
*  You got to wonder how much of it is sat like when he talked to Piers Morgan that was a very [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9519.72s)]
*  interesting conversation because Piers confronted him on all these things and he did a great job [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9523.8s)]
*  of explaining what he does and why he does it and you know it's like the guy went viral in a way [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9527.48s)]
*  that no one has and so quickly. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9534.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9537.08s)]
*  Wow we're like my 12 year old and my 14 year old were asking me about it. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9537.56s)]
*  Yeah no he was it. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9541.24s)]
*  Yeah all over TikTok and all over everything and if you just look at some of those little [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9542.68s)]
*  parts. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9547.32s)]
*  In a weird way if you're 12 year old and 14 year old are hearing some of the outrage like nobody wants. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9547.72s)]
*  Yeah he didn't even have a TikTok I think and he was like the number one guy on TikTok crazy. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9557.16s)]
*  I think they probably banned him right I mean they banned him from everything they [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9561.64s)]
*  banned him from Facebook and he's still on his Twitter. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9565.32s)]
*  Yeah Elon brought him back. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9567.64s)]
*  Yeah which listen I agree with I think you should be I don't think banning people is the way. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9568.76s)]
*  I think this exchange with Greta Thurnberg is a perfect example of how to counteract that. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9575.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9579.88s)]
*  She just mocks him and then he gets arrested and she has the fucking tweet of the year making fun [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9580.199999999999s)]
*  of his arrest and a fucking perfect one-liner that's what happens you don't recycle your pizza [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9586.199999999999s)]
*  boxes. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9591.16s)]
*  Yeah right. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9591.48s)]
*  It's genius that's why it's good that someone like that is on social media because you get [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9592.12s)]
*  you get a chance for people to participate in the conversation. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9596.84s)]
*  I agree I go I go back and forth it's it because I am. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9599.56s)]
*  You should go back and forth because you're a thoughtful guy. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9604.2s)]
*  Yeah because it's like super free speech yeah like take Kanye for example like I I'm Jewish [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9606.52s)]
*  I hate Kanye beforehand but I think he's anti-semitic like the things he's saying [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9616.199999999999s)]
*  bother me and there's a lot of people in my mind who follow Kanye they're rabid Kanye fans [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9621.32s)]
*  and the things he starts saying to me can leak down. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9629.56s)]
*  What is the the biggest thing that he said I know I know in general. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9633.16s)]
*  To me Hitler wasn't a bad guy. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9636.92s)]
*  That was crazy. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9639.8s)]
*  Like I what did he say what was he exactly loves Hitler or something like that he was [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9641.4s)]
*  loves everybody he was with Alex Jones and Alex Jones was trying to also wearing a mask. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9646.28s)]
*  Yeah he was trying to throw him a lifeline yeah Alex Jones was trying to [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9651.16s)]
*  throw out Jones was the voice of reason yeah and he's like no you don't mean Hitler was [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9654.52s)]
*  a good guy he's like no no no well that's not what you mean yeah Hitler's terrible [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9657.800000000001s)]
*  yeah for Alex to have to tell him Hitler was terrible it's pretty funny so if you're going [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9663.08s)]
*  down that way I don't know I think he's the way he's going down is he's never I don't think [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9667.96s)]
*  he's experienced anything like of course he's never experienced anything like this right [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9674.199999999999s)]
*  where his everything's taken away from him I mean he had to stop construction on his house [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9677.96s)]
*  he's losing all of his money all of his sponsorships everything's gone all of his [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9682.439999999999s)]
*  connections to all these businesses connections to banks everything's gone it's kind of wild to see [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9686.279999999999s)]
*  because we've never seen that before where a guy is a superstar and a billionaire and he says some [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9692.119999999999s)]
*  awful shit and then everything's taken well and this may be Kanye's personality and in a way [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9698.759999999998s)]
*  he's also you can listen to him talk many times like he's a genius he's brilliant like the things [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9705.88s)]
*  he's saying what he did which may be unique and some could say maybe they respect he didn't take [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9711.8s)]
*  a step back he kept saying things yeah and he wouldn't apologize and now you can be like well [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9719.88s)]
*  if you didn't think he did anything wrong but in the end it came across he's just to me very [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9725.08s)]
*  anti-semitic I mean if you're defending Hitler that's you've gone pretty far I think he's also [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9729.4s)]
*  mentally ill well he's bipolar I think he said that yeah well I think he said recently he's not [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9734.2s)]
*  bipolar but he might be autistic but I mean it's self-diagnosis he was definitely medicated at one [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9738.52s)]
*  point in time right remember when he got kind of chubby and he was like really like sedated [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9743.96s)]
*  but then he hated that he didn't want to he didn't want to be that and then he got off of that and [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9748.36s)]
*  I had him on the podcast and you get a chance to see how his mind works it's like he works in [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9753.16s)]
*  these rants and he says something and he keeps talking and you gotta like stop and wait wait [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9759.4s)]

*  oh it's a whole deal right how are you [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9976.84s)]
*  look as a comedian that guy was like the the greatest amount of ammunition and information [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9987.32s)]
*  and the greatest resource a comic could ever so before he was elected I said I would vote for [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=9994.36s)]
*  Trump because I of what you just basically said I'm like I hate politics I'm like I think I'll [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10000.12s)]
*  break it now did I anticipate like I the amount of hate in this country has gone both sides just [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10005.96s)]
*  well also the denying the results of the election that was where it got crazy because you know the [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10014.439999999999s)]
*  saying the election was rigged and that's a threat to our the foundation of our democracy [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10019.96s)]
*  and if you I believe that if you're going to say the election was rigged you have to have rock [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10025.72s)]
*  solid very specific information that points to that that you could show the world and I don't [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10032.68s)]
*  think that was the case I don't I don't know how much election fraud exists I know it's less than [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10038.36s)]
*  zero it's not there's no election fraud there's fraud in everything if you don't think that [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10045.56s)]
*  there's people that are running some sort of an election center that are democratic centered [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10051.960000000001s)]
*  that wouldn't do something that they think would help the world by making sure that someone who [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10058.2s)]
*  they think is evil and a very threat to democracy itself if that person gets into power and you [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10063.720000000001s)]
*  don't think that they would do something to suppress that whether it's by making voting [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10069.640000000001s)]
*  machines not work correctly or by suppressing ballots or by hiding ballots there's unscrupulous [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10074.12s)]
*  people that exist how many of them exist is the question how much fraud was it on the republican [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10080.68s)]
*  side how much fraud was it on the democrat has it happened has election fraud happened in the [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10086.68s)]
*  history of humans abso-fucking-lucent 100 so the real question is how much election fraud [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10091.800000000001s)]
*  does exist and did it swing the election I don't think he proved that I don't think he had the [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10099.16s)]
*  information where he could show the United States here's how I know for sure objectively have [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10104.6s)]
*  someone who's just like a rock-solid statistician and an analyst who can show you beyond the shadow [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10109.88s)]
*  of a doubt that there's a problem and that that was the problem I agree with that and then when [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10117.4s)]
*  you got the fucking people that are these fucking MAGA people and they're out there and you got the [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10121.4s)]
*  FBI riling them up you got guys like Ray Epps who is saying you need to go in there we need to go [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10127.64s)]
*  in there we need to take this place and that guy is un not prosecuted not arrested not charged [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10134.04s)]
*  and then the FBI has to have a conversation with Ted Cruz and he's saying did you have people [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10142.6s)]
*  in the FBI that were involved in that that were that were actively trying to rile people up and [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10150.52s)]
*  they won't answer that question my thing my issue with it is you alluded to it I think both sides [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10156.76s)]
*  this is and this is actually sort of sad but my view of politics both sides are equally treacherous [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10164.76s)]
*  and they're both going to do whatever they can dirty world yeah they're both going to do [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10173.64s)]
*  whatever they can win to the election so if one side's cheating I think the other side's cheating [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10177.800000000001s)]
*  so guess what whoever wins and cheats the best whatever games over that's it they they out cheated [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10182.92s)]
*  you if you want to say that unless you can show that they cheated beyond a shadow of a doubt [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10188.68s)]
*  which he hasn't to the world which he hasn't correct and it's almost like the old I mean [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10192.68s)]
*  Trump I think he's very very very smart I don't think he has a fuck about anybody but Donald [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10197.32s)]
*  Trump and to be honest I think most politicians it's like the movie gladiator when Maximus asks [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10203.0s)]
*  he wants uh Maximus to be the president of Rome he's like no no no I don't want that he's like [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10209.56s)]
*  that's why you gotta be it because nobody with the brain would want to who wants who wants this [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10213.96s)]
*  headache yeah who wants that job yeah so it's you end up with people who shouldn't have it exactly [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10219.4s)]
*  yeah and those are the only ones who want to run exactly which is crazy and that's the cycle like [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10225.4s)]
*  this guy Santos which now I am finding funny the guy from New York yeah what happened with that guy [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10229.88s)]

*  never done it before and now all of a sudden you're in the middle of it and as an independent [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10541.88s)]
*  person which you are it's a rare spot where someone gets as much attention as you do and has as much [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10545.16s)]
*  power and influence as you do but you're completely unconnected yeah you could do whatever you want [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10551.72s)]
*  and that's what's scary that's where it gets wild yeah to a degree I mean we are it's crazy [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10555.96s)]
*  we're regulated so I mean I still deal with like I've always said for people who don't like me [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10562.44s)]
*  the best thing that ever happened was we became this gambling company or associated because I [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10568.6s)]
*  can't be as unhinged or like I can't go after people in the manner I would like to have to [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10573.4s)]
*  stay away for the most part good for yeah well I know it keeps me up because you know I am a petty [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10579.08s)]
*  I like gambling I don't gamble I don't gamble much I mean I used to gamble a lot on fights I used to [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10584.68s)]
*  bet on fights are you allowed to I don't think I am now I think now the UFC recently because of the [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10591.16s)]
*  oh there was a scandal James Krauss thing but that was a fighter who was managing and training a [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10596.6s)]
*  fighter who was accused of telling people about an injury that could affect the outcome of a fight [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10603.48s)]
*  and I don't know if it's true I don't know what the evidence is all I know is the allegations but [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10610.119999999999s)]
*  I know it's serious enough where they're investigating it and it's serious enough where [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10613.72s)]
*  his fighters are not allowed to compete in the UFC anymore so it's a really big really big deal [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10617.72s)]
*  because like you know I'm friends with people that just train at his gym that work at the UFC that [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10623.48s)]
*  now have to find a new gym they feel and I'm like whoa like you just but you just train there it's a [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10628.599999999999s)]
*  gym filled with fighters like you're not even allowed to train there anymore or they feel like [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10633.24s)]
*  they're not allowed to train there anymore I should say like Laura Senko who's a top flight [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10637.16s)]
*  analyst who's like that's her gym that's her home gym and she's in this like situation and there's [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10642.199999999999s)]
*  a lot of fighters like Brandon Moreno who is the you know at one point in time was the flyway [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10647.24s)]
*  champion and now he has to find a new camp to train because he was trained by Krauss. Sports take it [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10653.8s)]
*  wildly seriously and naturally it's the integrity of the game. Gambling yeah look if you're going to [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10661.16s)]
*  allow gambling which I think you should allow you have to make sure that there's no fucking [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10665.56s)]
*  bullshit yeah and that people aren't doing something like that where they're giving someone [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10669.48s)]
*  like letting them know this guy's gonna lay down and then bet the house on this guy you know. No [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10673.88s)]
*  you gotta cut that off. But I used to gamble with my business partner and on it my friend Aubrey so [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10679.08s)]
*  the way I would do it is like I used to gamble on the fights early on like the early days of [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10687.16s)]
*  the year it's like early 2000s I would just go to the betting I'd go oh nobody even knows about [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10692.36s)]
*  Anderson Silva like bet the fucking house on this guy bet the house on this guy and I would do that [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10696.68s)]
*  but then I thought about it for a while I was like maybe this isn't good for my commentary [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10701.64s)]
*  like maybe I'll be biased if I have like 500 bucks on this guy or something I'm like [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10705.24s)]
*  I should probably stop doing this so I just stopped doing it and I would just tell Aubrey [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10709.24s)]
*  and we were at one point I'm like 84% winning because this was back you have the inside info if [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10714.279999999999s)]
*  you know what's inside info it was you know Anderson Silva's Anderson Silva before the [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10719.56s)]
*  general public I guess it's not inside it was bookmakers weren't obsessed with MMA the way I [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10724.119999999999s)]
*  was they didn't know about Chudo they didn't know about ring and rising and k1 and all these [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10729.4s)]
*  different there's just so many different organizations that people are fighting for [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10735.96s)]
*  overseas deep and like if you're gonna know real fighters like the like what a person's capable of [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10739.08s)]
*  I firmly believe you have to have some training yourself you have to be able to see like where [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10746.84s)]
*  the openings are whether or not someone's doing something special and you have to be obsessed with [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10751.88s)]
*  it and if you're not obsessed with it you're you're basing it on records and how well this [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10756.6s)]
*  guy fought without knowledge of whether or not a person was committed and whether you know there's [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10762.68s)]
*  there's guys that are underdogs that I look at them like how the fuck is that guy an underdog [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10767.08s)]
*  right and they wind up dominating I'm like this is a crazy line still to this day yeah to this day [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10771.0s)]
*  there's bad lines where I see them I'm like oh my like you gotta look at that guy like if that guy's [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10775.720000000001s)]

*  didn't really know what the fuck was going on that's natural it'll catch up obviously as MMA has [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10791.56s)]

*  her technique is so sharp so that's why when I came up to you once it was on the ground I was [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10856.52s)]
*  done yeah I'll give molly credit she took about 9 000 shots before she submitted yeah she got [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10861.560000000001s)]

*  groove like charles olivera like for the longest time he was he had the the accusation of being a [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10877.56s)]
*  quitter you know that was the the the rub on him was like when the shit got hard he would fall apart [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10882.92s)]
*  and then all of a sudden he didn't and also he started dominating everybody and all of a sudden [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10888.199999999999s)]
*  he knocks out michael chandler submits justin gachi he's the motherfucker of motherfuckers [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10891.48s)]

*  mindset and where they're at in life like you remember buster douglas fought mike tyson nobody [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10901.8s)]
*  thought he had a goddamn chance but buster douglas's mother died before that fight combo with [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10906.359999999999s)]

*  buster douglas was a bad man he just didn't commit himself to boxing like he could have he was [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10922.52s)]
*  like many super talented people he just didn't go all in there's some super talented people that [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10928.12s)]
*  just skate by because they're able to you know there's like kabib said that kabib never got [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10933.960000000001s)]
*  met off said that the talented guys it's too easy for them and that you want the guys that are just [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10939.4s)]
*  willing to just grind and work hard and they eventually overcome the talented guys because [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10944.52s)]
*  they just have this mindset where they can suffer and they can train and they can get up in the [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10949.16s)]
*  morning and do it again they're dedicated and they don't drink and they don't party [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10953.32s)]

*  and that's why he retired undefeated because he had that unstoppable commitment that discipline [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10966.28s)]
*  that championship drive and some really talented guys don't they just don't for whatever reason [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10971.72s)]
*  they just they it comes too easy in the beginning or that they're you know they're trying to chase [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=10977.16s)]

*  he's the epitome of that marvin haggard was the fucking man he was the guy that like outworked [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11002.76s)]
*  everybody and he was the guy that like always had a chip on his shoulder because he always thought [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11008.6s)]
*  that they all looked past him and then when he knocked out tommy herrins he's like what's up now [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11012.12s)]
*  yeah that was like the best fight oh my god what a fight that was unbelievable but haggard had a chin [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11016.28s)]

*  mugabe who was knocking out everybody and haggard just kept beating the fuck out of him and eventually [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11027.72s)]
*  broke him and mugabe was never the same again after he beat up mugabe but that's the i mean [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11033.24s)]
*  obviously haggard was super talented too and one of the best switch hitters ever in boxing other [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11038.92s)]
*  than terrence crofford who i think is like right up there terrence crofford he switch hits better [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11044.279999999999s)]

*  biggest difference well maybe not biggest but what in my mind mma boxing is the best guy's [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11076.28s)]
*  always fight in mma box and you may not get it but you have to be in the ufc like we never got [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11084.28s)]

*  saw fedor in his prime come over to the ufc and by the time he went to strike force he was already [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4dbkrYMQI&t=11127.800000000001s)]
