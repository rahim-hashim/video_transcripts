# Joe Rogan Experience #1417 - Kevin Ross
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiWYB_xTd9k)
*  to one Kevin Ross bringer of gifts good to see you brother thank you very much
*  for that bag oh you're very welcome it's very cool people let you know Kevin
*  brought a giant heavy bag filled with sand that has to weigh north of 200
*  pounds I think it's about 250 yeah a lot of fun getting that in my car by myself
*  is that your preferred method for conditioning your shins for sure for
*  sure you know the the thing with can shing conditioning a lot of people do
*  you know they smack themselves in the shin with bottles and kind of stupid
*  things like that but you're you're not really creating what you need to which
*  is a overall conditioning overall strengthening of the nerve the bone all
*  you're really doing is deadening little spots in your nerves but that's the
*  worst thing you can do without strengthening your bones you're deadening
*  the nerves but not strengthening the bone overall and if you're not doing
*  that you're gonna think your bones a lot stronger than it is but it can't handle
*  the impact so with a sandbag or your your covering much more surface area and
*  you know applying it in a realistic situation where you're you're able to
*  throw kicks repeatedly at this thing and what you what you really want to do is
*  do it to a degree that it's causing a certain amount of pain but you're able
*  to do this daily with with repetition because that's how you continually
*  develop just like getting stronger at anything you know it doesn't happen
*  overnight you got to just do this every day just at the end of your session
*  knock out a few kicks and then again tomorrow and again the next day and you
*  slowly and steadily are able to go harder and harder and develop the
*  strength and conditioning in your shins so the idea is that you're making like
*  these little tiny micro fractures right yeah for sure and yeah like I said you
*  want to be able to cover a good surface area so you're hitting it all that kind
*  of at once as opposed to like little spots which is what happens when you
*  just whack it with a bat or something like that my experience was whacking it
*  with a bat is everybody kind of quits you're like hey I'm gonna condition my
*  shins and then they just go what the fuck am I doing and they stop doing it
*  well the thing too with with when you're able to kick like that is you can kind
*  of slowly build up you know you start a little bit lightly and develop a little
*  bit stronger and you kind of create a little little bit of a crease and you
*  know as you get going you your brain can kind of wrap itself around it a little
*  bit better and then you start going harder and harder and by the end of you
*  know your five ten minute session you're putting some serious weight into that
*  and you're not you're not noticing it as much yeah we were talking about your
*  your need that you had a fracture in your knee that you didn't realize you
*  had yeah that's this it's weird like the thing that disturbs me maybe the most
*  in kickboxing and so I've only seen it a few times is when someone checks a kick
*  and their their leg snaps in half yeah like Tyrone Spong when he fought Gokhan
*  Saki or Anderson Silva when he fought Chris Weidman same thing that snap of
*  when the the shin gives out like that can you prevent that from doing this
*  obviously it's one of those just freak things that happens you know clearly
*  with those guys you can have the most conditioned shins in the world but you
*  catch them the wrong way wrong time they can happen and it's rare but it does
*  happen and it doesn't really matter how long you've been doing this how strong
*  your shins are sometimes things just break I always wonder how many guys have
*  little breaks and they don't know about it too probably a lot yeah yeah they
*  said that's what happened with Anderson that Anderson threw a kick and he broke
*  it before that like he felt something was wrong and then we threw that second
*  kick and it snapped in half that's that's why I did that yeah yeah that
*  makes sense well Weidman was checking it perfect he was checking it right at the
*  top of his knee yeah and you know that's a big thing with you know fighting a lot
*  of a lot of people tend to just blindly just pick their shin up you know as
*  opposed to paying attention to where it is on your shin that it's hitting just
*  like when you're kicking you need to pay attention to what piece of your leg
*  you're hitting with which piece of your shin you're checking with and the higher
*  up on your shin it is the harder it's going to be and when you're southpaw
*  versus orthodox and throwing that inside leg kick you're you're you're coming up
*  words at an angle which is tends to be like low on your foot or your your ankle
*  and then you're checking with high up by your knee so you have the smallest part
*  of your shin connecting with the hardest part of somebody else's and with that
*  that's just the one that tends to do that yeah it's a shin on shin contact is
*  such a brutal thing like I think everybody should experience it once yeah
*  you know just crack yeah and you know the funny thing is it doesn't matter how
*  long you've done this for you we watch these fights and assume that they don't
*  feel pain and that it doesn't bother them but even guys with hundreds and
*  hundreds of fights you see him the next day and they're gimping around pretty
*  good yeah you know we have this idea in our brains that eventually you're gonna
*  get to a point when you just don't feel pain and it doesn't bother you but
*  eventually you realize that never happens you know it is better to get
*  that out of your head now you know Muay Thai and kickboxing and anything that's
*  bone-on-bone is it's going to be painful and that's part of the art of it you
*  learn how to place your kicks better and pay attention to what you're doing and
*  yeah of course you develop your shin conditioning and that kind of thing but
*  it always hurts it's always gonna hurt it's such a brutally effective way to
*  fight and it's so interesting that Thailand perfected that yeah I've always
*  been fascinated by that like you know you think about the entire world it's
*  an enormous world and people have been fighting in this enormous world from the
*  beginning of time and this one island they said hey I got an idea well it's a
*  cultural thing over there you know it's part of their upbringing it's like
*  baseball over here or soccer and other parts of the world where everybody kind
*  of does it to one extent or the other and you know clearly if you're doing this
*  from a time you're a child particularly when it's a job like it is for them over
*  there and it's a it's more than just for fun it's not for fun it's like this is
*  how I survived it's this or working in the fields you know and that completely
*  changes their mentality about it and that's why when you go there it's like
*  obviously the skill for sure but but the mentality and their reasons for
*  doing this like it's so different it's so different yeah and they start so
*  young and there's they're basically sent to these camps and they start
*  fighting like you know before they're like 10 years old yeah oftentimes yeah a
*  lot of these kids you know their their family send them to these these camps
*  and that's where they're raised you know they're raised in a gym to be fighters
*  and to work for the gyms I mean that that's really what they're doing is
*  they're working you know they're they're getting money to send back to their
*  families and they're not doing this for fun they're not doing you know the hobby
*  I've always been fascinated by the way the tie spar as well because I think
*  it's really interesting that given that they do fight so often and their
*  livelihood depends on it and that is not a game they've really figured out a
*  bunch of things and one of the things they figured out is hit the pads hard
*  hit the bag hard spar light yeah yeah there's there's give and take to
*  everything that we do and we're trying to maximize our learning and minimize
*  the damage or the the risk of injury that we're taking and we have the
*  opposite approach here in America just beat the shit out of each other and you
*  know that's good that's how you're gonna get better but you don't really develop
*  when you're going hard like that you're learning how to be tough and you're
*  going on how to take damage and you're you know learning how to be in the fire
*  like that which is important but you're not really developing you know when you
*  when you're playing when you're practicing when you're not thinking about
*  getting injured or knocked out you're able to learn new imply new things and
*  new techniques and then and practice things that you normally wouldn't it's
*  like when you're worried about getting hurt you're only gonna focus on the
*  things that you're really good at you know you're not gonna try these
*  different approaches and that's what really limits a lot of our development
*  you know a lot of you see a lot of fighters their their ability kind of
*  levels off at to a certain degree and they don't they don't continually
*  develop as their careers go on and they also don't last very long either because
*  the amount of damage their their bodies and their brains are taking you know
*  each one of us only has a finite number of shots to the head we can take and and
*  shots of the body we can take and do you want to use those in the gym or do you
*  want to use those in the ring you know and it's I think it's really about
*  finding a good balance between that you know in the beginning all I did was just
*  go crazy and spar super hard six days a week leading all the way up to the fight
*  and six days a week you were sparring hard really yeah yeah and with guy I
*  mean the smallest guy I had to work with coming up was probably 20 pounds bigger
*  than me and you know in a lot of ways this helped me develop and gain a lot of
*  strength and confidence and and ability to take that kind of punishment but it
*  also did a lot of detrimental things a lot of stupid injuries a lot of damage
*  you know over the years I've come to develop and get more onto the the Thai
*  approach of things and practice and playing and you know finding when the
*  time to go hard is and when the time to to learn and develop is and what's
*  counterproductive and what isn't how do you make that distinction like how do
*  you know when it's the time to go hard you don't you don't really I mean
*  everything that we do is a process of trial and error you know and I think
*  once you kind of understand that you can think clearly and apply the things you
*  need to in the midst of that firefight which which you know is really what
*  shuts a lot of people down in the beginning they they can't process the
*  information that's happening because it's so intense and and that is why it's
*  important to kind of have that in and have that fight like situate scenario in
*  in the gym but once you've done that and you've had the experience and all of
*  that I think it's it's so much so much more beneficial to start going towards
*  the other direction especially if you want to stay in this sport for a good
*  amount of time and and and not take unnecessary damage for really no no
*  purpose whatsoever it should to me it should be the exception and not the rule
*  you know have those hard training sessions in the once in a while especially
*  if you can get working with people that you're not used to because because you
*  know obviously when you fight it's you don't know what they're really doing in
*  there and it's like working with a stranger and in the gym we we know each
*  other so well that we tend to just work on those things and not practice but but
*  that's how we develop and if we're not doing that we're really limiting
*  ourselves it's got to be difficult to find the right balance in terms of like
*  what gym you're training at like where you training at these days I'm down in
*  San Diego now I moved down there two years ago at the the boxing club oh is
*  that Artem yeah yeah Shirovsky and Levin's place yeah yeah and Levin was
*  there too Artem Shirovsky and the small Artem he he we met almost 15 years ago
*  he was actually the janitor at this gym had just moved from Russia and now he he
*  owns three of them and is this amazing gym owner and business person which is
*  it's just an unbelievably fascinating story that he has and an inspirational
*  thing and but yeah that's where I'm at and now and I kind of bounced back
*  between San Diego and out here Gina lives out here so I kind of go back and
*  forth now that place is it's called the boxing club right yeah but it's Muay Thai
*  yeah yeah there's another gym out here called boxing works which is which is
*  the one I turned out in Torrance and same thing it's it's a Muay Thai gym and
*  both these gyms are Muay Thai and kickboxing related yet they're boxing
*  why do they call it boxing works is it just to get people to join I don't
*  really know you know I don't really know why that happened or how that happened
*  but yeah it's kind of ironic that both those places are seemingly boxing gyms
*  and they're not at all what made you make the move down there a lot of things
*  I I'd always planned on ending up in San Diego I mean that's the one place I love
*  it down there yeah and I've lived all over this country since you know moved
*  all over the place since I was a little kid and San Diego was just where I always
*  planned I'd be one day I didn't think I'd move down there until I was done
*  fighting but through the process of a lot of things and you know transitions in
*  my life it just kind of was the right time to go it's the perfect balance
*  because it's like a city but it's not a big city yeah and it's got a lot of
*  beauty like there's beautiful hills and the ocean is beautiful like but it's not
*  that crowded it's like it's all right I shouldn't even be talking about it yeah
*  and when I want people to move there once you go there it's it's tough to
*  want to be anywhere else you know the the energy that's there the the way that
*  people are you know you you have all those things that are in other cities but
*  all everything that's perfect and in one place it's it's very unique in that sense
*  I think there's a lot of positive aspects to the military presence there
*  too because I think there's so many disciplined people down there yeah
*  there's like a lot of health conscious fitness oriented and disciplined people
*  yeah because of the fact there's such a giant military presence down there like
*  there's so many people that are involved in the military and so many people that
*  are involved in the military have a lot of discipline train a lot are interested
*  in martial arts in particular yeah you know it's just I think it flavors that
*  community mm-hmm yeah it's it's it's a wonderful place and I love it I love it
*  yeah don't go there the problem is the fucking drive whoo that drive yeah well
*  every time I work in San Diego I leave here like eight in the morning oh yeah
*  yeah just like let's if I have to work there at night I'm like let me just
*  fucking get it out of the way yeah get that four-hour drive out of the way
*  early yeah you know if you like for me if I leave at around 10 1030 I can
*  usually get there in about two hours before traffic hits but there's this
*  really short window of time but if you miss it it's a rough one yeah my friend
*  Bill Burr takes helicopter down there yeah well he's been taking helicopter
*  lessons we should all get some helicopters and be a lot easier to get
*  around well he doesn't have a zone but he takes lessons yeah and so you know he
*  just hires one and he'll actually fly and he has a the co-pilot who's like the
*  you know flight instructor explains everything to him make sure he's doing
*  everything right yeah and then you down there in an hour yeah
*  oh yeah have you ever been in a helicopter I haven't they kind of freaked me out a little bit you know they just seem so sketchy
*  they're sketchy yeah yeah but if they're well maintained like anything else you
*  know he took me up in one and we flew over Van Nuys and over Matt it was crazy
*  flying over Malibu because we did it right after the fires oh you get to see
*  all the houses that were burnt the ground nuts man and like point doom so
*  these just huge estates that are probably worth 25 million dollars just
*  burnt to the fucking ground it's like and so many of a man Malibu lost like 600
*  structures that's wild man it's hard to wrap your brain around the the damage
*  that was done and then I saw this scale which showed you know what the
*  California fires are and what the Australian fire oh my god that's just
*  my friend Tom is there right now and he said they had to divert his plane he was
*  supposed to fly into Melbourne and they diverted it to Sydney because they
*  couldn't fly through the smoke 70% of the country's covered in smoke and a
*  good percentage of those fires were started by people just fucking around
*  like throwing cigarettes into the bush crazy yeah they said half a billion
*  animals are dead she's yeah that's terrible it's insane and they said that
*  koala bear like so much of their habitat is destroyed they're they're in like
*  grave danger yeah it's yeah I mean like it's a like something about like 80% of
*  their range has been destroyed yeah it's crazy koala bears only eat like I
*  think they only eat eucalyptus trees yeah it's all they eat just kind of
*  fucked up just they found what works yeah they're into one thing it's like a
*  dude who only eats blueberries you know like bro what if they run out of
*  blueberries yeah yeah I don't think they can eat other things I think that's like
*  their digestive system has evolved to eat eucalyptus leaves yeah yeah that's
*  horrible it's fucked up man when you look at the map of where the fires are
*  it's it's crazy it's like multiple if like it's like if we had like multiple
*  states like Texas Wyoming Nevada all on fire at the same time that's what it's
*  like over there yeah it's hard to wrap your mind around it is yeah have you
*  ever been when there's a fire here not not close enough to really feel like
*  that but but around and even just them in the general area I mean you realize
*  how quickly they can spread and just take over everything and you know so
*  devastating I've been evacuated three times yeah from where I live and this
*  last one the houses across the street from my house burnt to the ground yeah
*  and then two houses down one of those houses burnt down on my block ten houses
*  are gone yeah it's fucking nuts man I went to walk the dog today and we're
*  walking by these just empty lots where these people used to live you know what
*  bright side nobody died hopefully everybody had insurance but it's just
*  it's humbling when you see it coming because everybody's like there the
*  firefighters are doing their best they're just they're dumping water
*  they're doing their best to create fire breaks and everything they can but
*  there's nothing they can do it's so big I mean it was so big it was just coming
*  over the top of the mountain you looked all the way to the left and all the way
*  to the right just nothing but fire and these guys are just constantly circling
*  over and dropping water down and doing their best but it's like it was crazy
*  and that was nothing compared to up north in Northern California yeah
*  Northern California people died on the fucking highway they couldn't get out of
*  the way of it that was terrible man that was so bad you know I was up there
*  probably about five years ago when these are going on and they were just popping
*  up everywhere and there was some that were pretty close to the gym and having
*  to like watch and see where they're at cuz they were close to the apartments
*  who lived in like we might have to like get out of here because they just pop
*  all over the place and they hop from one place to the other with the wind and
*  everything Henry Cejudo almost burnt to death you know the story about him he had
*  to jump out the window barefoot burnt the fuck out of his feet yeah like he
*  didn't even know what was going on he was sleeping and then all sudden he's
*  waking up he's like what is happening and he looks out the window and
*  everything's on fire it got to him that quickly mm-hmm scary shit man but it's
*  it's that you know that's fucked up about it but we all had to go to like me
*  and my neighbors and some friends of mine we all picked a hotel in town we
*  all went together but there's like a weird camaraderie about when shit like
*  that goes down where everybody was happy it's horrible that those things kind of
*  happening they really make you realize like what is important yeah and you
*  know it's the same thing like when you when you travel overseas and go to
*  third-world countries like they seem to have a very good understanding of what
*  life should and is about and then you come here we have everything everyone
*  has everything and everyone's complaining yeah everything and we're
*  miserable and we're spoiled and that's that mentality it's it's so
*  unfortunate it's like the more you have the more you have to complain about and
*  forget what what is important in this life it's weird that it takes something
*  like that to jar you it's you should be able to learn from that and then carry
*  that lesson yeah but that lesson is like sand in your fingers man how quickly
*  like after like 9 11 or things like that how long does it last yeah and and such
*  a traumatic thing like that you know we have like a week or two of America let's
*  let's let's get together and let's take care and love each other and then I
*  forgot yeah well I've I mean to make an analogy with martial arts one of the
*  reasons why I enjoy being around martial artists and why most of my friends a
*  good percentage of my friends are martial artists I feel like training all the time and getting humbled
*  particularly in jujitsu because you can get tapped out a lot and you you know you
*  just train and you get tapped out and you keep going it's not like getting
*  knocked out it's not like you know you can only get cracked in the head so many
*  times and sparring but you you develop this kind of humility that is it's it's
*  everybody kind of understands it and there's this feeling that you get where
*  you understand when someone's trying to kill you all the time like on a regular
*  basis some dudes trying to choke the fucking breath out of you and someone's
*  got their arm wrapped around your neck like the rest of the world seems easier
*  you know and I almost feel like human beings are engineered through through
*  evolution we've sort of been designed through natural selection to learn how
*  to survive difficult things and when the difficult things don't exist we make
*  things that aren't difficult difficult yeah very much so very much so you know
*  for me I feel that training and martial arts and fighting and all these things
*  it it clears the static and the noise out of your life and it allows you to
*  focus on the things that are important and not be so distracted by fluff and
*  nothingness yeah you know and even a day or two of not training I like I feel that
*  stuff seeping back in yeah and it's it's it's it's substantial you know and like
*  I don't know how everyone's not running around shooting each other because just
*  a few days of not doing this I'm like I want to kill somebody because because I
*  allow just the stresses of nothing to get it there you know make this sound
*  more consistent just push that a little bit further just because it's you're
*  doing cigarette things like hello I don't have a voice all right how about
*  that that's perfect all right how much longer do you think you're gonna compete
*  I have no idea man how old do you know I'll be 40 this year oh shit yeah that's
*  the magic number you know the since the day I started you know I didn't start
*  till I was 23 yeah and so let's tell your story because it's it's a it's a
*  fascinating story because I love a guy whose life is fucked up and then he
*  figures something out yeah and then becomes a role model and in a lot of
*  ways that's what you've done yeah it's a long story and I am I'm actually in the
*  process of writing my opera biography right now which I've been working on
*  pretty consistently for the last five years something that you know I really
*  was doing it for myself in a lot of ways to have an understanding of the things
*  that I've been through and the things that I've learned and processed and
*  acquired over these years which is you know in a lot of ways it's been extremely
*  rewarding doing all this but it's also been in very difficult very painful and
*  emotional going back through all these things that happened to me in my
*  childhood and my upbringing and things that I'm even to this day I'm still
*  trying to process and understand a lot of and where were we going with all this? My story.
*  Well your story of not starting until you're 23 and before that too much
*  partying yeah so summarize a lot of this you know I was I grew up in a lot of
*  different places moved around a lot you know my parents split up very early me
*  my mother and three brother four brothers sisters you know we basically
*  lived in somebody's basement for in the beginning and we're living on welfare
*  and bouncing around from place to place and so much of that shut me down
*  emotionally and you know when I was a kid from what I'm told I mean I've really
*  not much recollection of my childhood because I've blocked so much of this out
*  and so it's been really difficult for me to write this book because I don't
*  really have many memories I have almost no memories of that time in my life
*  where I felt like a child that carefreeness of childhood and I've had
*  to you know talk to siblings and friends from back then and look through photo
*  albums and slowly things start coming together and you know that that's why a
*  lot of this has been really therapeutic but I was a fighting I always loved
*  boxing and was very intrigued by it and martial arts you know Bruce Lee was
*  always a hero of mine and but I hated violence coming up I hated it but I was
*  intrigued by it so one of a really good friend of mine we lived in Colorado for
*  about a year or two he would get into fights on a weekly basis in school and I
*  was fascinated by it I'm like wow that like you're so brave and so strong and I
*  felt like such like a weak I was very allowed like weakness to overtake me
*  throughout the the events of my life and I was very shy I didn't talk you know I
*  was always athletic and that kind of thing but but as far as confrontation
*  and that I'd like it just shut me down and I didn't like it it upset me a lot
*  you know when people would be angry with me and so I had this this strange
*  dynamic where I was drawn to fighting and I was drawn to violence in one way
*  but if I also hated it a lot and was scared by it but but over the years you
*  know I thought about I was like oh maybe I'll try boxing one day and that'd be
*  really cool you know I was fascinated watching two people in the ring and then
*  all these people are watching and they're there with each other regardless
*  of at their skill level and you know just thinking about what it must be like
*  in there to do that you know and it fascinated me but it but again like I
*  said I love martial arts so I wanted to be able to kick people I want to be able
*  to elbow people and knee people and I never saw any fighting that was like
*  that you know as I was coming up I mean you'd see taekwondo and karate and a lot
*  of points sparring and that kind of thing and forms and you know even that I
*  thought was was fascinated but I wanted to fight like boxers did and I just
*  never really saw anything like that and one day 94 this is right when we moved
*  to Vegas I was watching ESPN at like 2 in the morning and they used to have tie
*  fights on once in a while and this fight came on I got this next fight is gonna
*  Muay Thai fight between so and so and when that started I was immediately
*  hooked it hit something in me that just like lit me on fire I was like this is
*  everything that I've been looking for this is something so different and it
*  just spoke to my soul and it fascinated me and I was like if I am ever gonna do
*  this that's gonna be it it's gonna be Muay Thai but you know for various
*  reasons it scared me one I didn't know how I'd be able to afford it I didn't
*  know if my parents would even let me and you know coming up the way I did I was
*  partying and drinking all the time even at that I mean I started drinking when I
*  was like 12 years old holy shit yeah and by the time I was probably 18 I was
*  physically dependent alcoholic I had to drink every day in order to keep my
*  nerves from shaking my hands would would would tremor how much we drinking a lot
*  a lot every day I would drink every day all day throughout the day a little bit
*  at night I would just be pounding 40s fuck constantly you know and that's all
*  that's all that I did I that's all me and my friends did was we would just
*  drink we would drink every day and how did you wean yourself off that starting
*  Muay Thai is what what what did it I as I said I learned about it in 94 over the
*  years every once in a while I'd see a fight and I'd be like oh I want to do
*  this so bad and in 98 I actually started calling around gyms in Vegas I was like
*  I'm gonna find a place to do this and for me it was one of those things or if
*  I'm gonna do it I want to do it right and I want to do it to fight and if I'm
*  gonna do it to fight and what is the the fastest way to get there and I was like
*  I need to take one-on-one lessons I need to I wanted to learn from a tie you know
*  and that was not to say you know like Americans or anybody else can't can't
*  teach it but I was like if you're gonna learn you might as well learn it from
*  the source and the only place in Vegas that taught Muay Thai one of the only
*  places that even taught Muay Thai and definitely only place that had Thai
*  instructors was master toddy's gym and I called the gym you know went down and
*  talked to one of the instructors and when he let me know how expensive it was
*  gonna be I was like there's just no way there's no way I'm gonna be able to do
*  this and and for me I also knew that if I am gonna go after this I'm gonna need
*  to stop drinking stop partying completely alter my entire existence I'm
*  probably gonna lose all my friends everyone's gonna laugh at me I didn't
*  even know how serious I took myself you know I was like I laugh at me when I say
*  this you know like it's and if you knew me back then you'd probably laugh too
*  like what do you mean you're gonna fight you stupid it's a stupid thing I could
*  ever think of and one of my best friends Mo he for whatever reason this one night
*  we were up on the roof drinking and smoking weed and he we got to talking
*  just about life and he was actually born with a heart defect I can't remember
*  the exact name of the disease that he had but he's in a hospital so his whole
*  life he was eventually gonna need to get a heart transplant and he said what do
*  you want to do with your life you know I looked at him like he was asking me what
*  what I want to do when I got to the moon I'm like what do you mean what I want to
*  do with my life and he's like I was like well I always wanted to fight and
*  expecting him to laugh at me about this he was like well why don't you like why
*  don't you do it you know I told him well well I feel old already I was 18 at the
*  time I've already felt ancient then you know and I told him all my reasons and
*  all my fears and doubts and all these things he's like you know I'm in he's
*  like if anybody can do it you can he's like I think you should and that really
*  that always stuck with me I was like maybe I can and in that moment you know
*  I felt very motivated and wanted to do it but by drinking you know continuing
*  to drink and all these other things I just put it suppressed it into the back
*  of my mind and then about a year later he was in the hospital and he needed to
*  get a heart transplant they basically he was basically at that point was like
*  you're gonna be here until you get one or you're gonna die and you know I don't
*  think any of us realized how serious it was or maybe we just didn't want to he
*  ended up passing away while he was waiting for the transplant and that just
*  obviously devastated me to no end and through that night through my drunken
*  coping I was like I'm gonna do this I'm gonna go after this dream you know my
*  friend he didn't even get a chance to fail at a dream and I'm too scared to
*  even try for no reason just out of fear that's literally my only reason not to
*  do this other than you know financial and all those other surface things but
*  it really just boiled down to fear and I was like you know what I'm gonna do I'm
*  gonna go after this for him you know he didn't get a chance to live I'm gonna
*  live for the both of us but you know unfortunately his his death sent me even
*  harder down that downward spiral of alcohol and depression and three years
*  later I I just had a realization one day I was like if he was still alive he
*  beat the fuck out of me for wasting my life I've been wasting my life for 21
*  years because I'm afraid you know I'm afraid and I'm too afraid to fail I'm
*  too afraid of all these stupid reasons that that all of us give ourselves in
*  order to make ourselves feel better about not going after things but really
*  they're just that they're just that they're just excuses they're just things
*  that make you feel better and they're bullshit they're all bullshit almost
*  every excuse we have is total bullshit because there's people with those
*  excuses and with all those reasons and more and they're able then they do it
*  like what is your excuse and it just it just smacked me in the face one day and
*  I I was at that point when I could not ignore it any longer and this was going
*  into 2003 so I was like made it my New Year's resolution to do this and you
*  know one night I was sitting down with my father and we'd have these he'd get
*  into these long talks with me because I was always very quiet and he'd like
*  take me off to the side and his way to kind of talk to me and get to know me
*  better and he's like so why don't you tell me something you've never told
*  anybody you know I'm like what do you mean like what can I like I killed
*  somebody when I was little like like racking my brain what I could possibly
*  tell him and you know that that kept replaying in my mind you want to fight
*  you want to fight you want to fight and very like quietly like I want to fight
*  one day and he's like what he's like I want to fight and he's like what do you
*  mean you want to fight you know I told him and he's like well why don't you and
*  I told him all these reasons he's like well I cannot help you with all of your
*  fears and doubts in this but look I'll make a deal with you if you quit
*  drinking and dedicate yourself to this I'll take care of every all the financial
*  things in order to let you do this I was like he said we had deal I was like
*  alright yeah and he's like points now I was drinking a 40 at the time he's like
*  what about that drink in your hand I was like well I was gonna start tomorrow so
*  you know I don't want to you know maybe I can finish this all right but you know I
*  understood even at that age like you can't put things off like that it was
*  like you're gonna do if you're serious about it you're gonna do it now so I
*  dumped out the rest of the 40 and the sink he had in there and two days later
*  I got into the gym and was it hard to wean yourself off the alcohol though if
*  you were physically dependent on it was it was both extremely difficult yet I
*  was so focused on this goal that none of those I had to overcome so much not just
*  the physical dependence of the on alcohol but but my lifestyle and not
*  changed so many things but I'd been putting this off for so long that I knew
*  there was there was no time for me to waste you know I was so focused on this
*  once I made that switch in my mind like I'm gonna go after this and there's
*  nothing that's gonna stop me and I've wasted so many years already that
*  everything I'm doing is gonna be playing catch-up you know there's no way for me
*  to get to like I'd look at you know that like sunshine guys like that I'm like
*  I'm never gonna get there so everything that I do has to be to get me closer to
*  this goal and I can't allow you know my physical dependency or my doubts or any
*  of these things slow me down because everything I'm doing I have to play
*  catch-up you know and having that that focus allowed me to overcome all of
*  those those physical and emotional and mental challenges and of course that's
*  not to say it was easy it was extremely difficult it was extremely difficult but
*  it was you got two choices you know you can you can allow these things to slow
*  you down and hinder you and weaken you or you can say I'm gonna go forward
*  anyway it doesn't matter how afraid I am it doesn't matter how hurt I am it
*  doesn't matter how tired I am this is what I want and I'm gonna put everything
*  that I have into this so that way when I'm done when my own my life is over
*  this anymore I can look back and have no regrets that I didn't allow these things
*  to slow me down I didn't allow the excuses that we all have hinder me and
*  keep me from doing this you know because one day we're gonna wake up and realize
*  we could have gone after these things and we didn't because of X Y & Z but
*  really those things aren't aren't anything you know do you stop and think
*  about those moments when you first started this because that's a profound
*  life shift all right to go from being a guy who's kind of aimless and parting a
*  lot but knowing that you should do something with your life to finally
*  doing something like what was it like when you finally started training well
*  what did it feel like when you actually because you hadn't had you done anything
*  athletic before that you know I was always athletic my whole life I was
*  always really good at sports I hated I hated the team aspect of things though
*  I despised being on a team of any kind I love playing sports for the for the love
*  of it you know but anytime I was on like a team I would just hated it I despised
*  it and you know by the time I was like I think 12 I completely turned my back on
*  anything team related because I felt to me it felt like it just ruined all
*  the beautiful things about the physicality of of athletics you know it
*  put this this this one it hindered me in a lot of ways you know and having to
*  rely on other people you know was always a big thing you know it's like it doesn't
*  matter how hard I work because this person might not have worked at all right
*  and you know that's why I'm so drawn to fighting because it's it's even though
*  you do have a team of course it really is everything is on you the good and the
*  bad there's nothing you can point you can point to all these other things but
*  it's really just you so yeah I think back and I look back to that time and
*  what was the first day like it was do you remember yeah yeah I do it was so I
*  started out just doing private lessons I didn't even start doing classes until
*  maybe six months to a year so I was doing private lessons on a daily basis
*  my trainer Master Chen who's one of Tati's original instructors he had me
*  in the gym like 6 a.m. there's a minimum so this is January in Vegas which is
*  brutally cold which you know a lot of not a lot of people realize and their
*  gym had no heat all the windows were like broken so there's no insulation or
*  anything and I was I was just I was I was so excited you know so nervous and
*  you know obviously I wanted to do really well and perform and everything was just
*  everything was so new that I didn't really I didn't really have a lot I
*  couldn't even really process it so there wasn't a lot of really a lot of thought
*  that was going to it I was just I was just excited I was just constantly
*  excited and motivated and wanted to my whole goal was to fight you know I was
*  like I want to fight even if it's only one time so everything I did was with
*  that mentality you know it's like I want to get better I want to get better I
*  want to do everything that I can at every moment and I put every ounce of
*  myself into every second of the day was geared towards this you know it was
*  singularly focused on this goal can you remember the first day yeah remember
*  the first day of footwork and yeah oh man the first day the first day he has
*  me up in the ring it must have been maybe the second or third day because
*  there was I know there was other people there and maybe they were just hitting
*  the bag and stuff so there there was a couple of the other pro fighters there
*  are other they were pro fighters I was nobody and I'm up in the ring and so
*  this is day one he's like shadow box I've never done anything fighting
*  related I'm like what do you mean like I don't even know what that is you know
*  what I'm saying like what do you mean shadow box so like so much of my
*  everything in my career has been like thrown into the deep end can you swim
*  kind of thing and like this forced learning curve you know you know I
*  didn't get babied into anything you know it's like all right shadow box go ahead
*  and everyone all these fighters are like staring at me watching me I'm like it was
*  traumatic in a lot of ways but having to confront that and face that
*  particularly me because I'm naturally a very shy person a person that doesn't
*  speak ever to anybody I mean even now you know I'm still very quiet but if you
*  knew me back then I was basically a mute you know and I had no interaction with
*  especially strangers and people I didn't know and even the ones that I do it's
*  still barely even communicate with so all of this was so foreign to me this was
*  like an alternate universe that I was in and yeah it was it was it was so scary
*  but it was like you don't have a choice like get up there and do it or get the
*  fuck out of here you know what I mean so there wasn't there wasn't time for me to
*  really think about it or like even be really nervous about it's like do it
*  shadow box like and and and this instructor he barely spoke English it's
*  not like I can like say hey well I don't really know what I'm doing and maybe
*  you can show me some things just like go and that's very much a tie approach it's
*  like just do it I'm not gonna tell you how I'm not gonna explain the steps just
*  go kick the bag or hit it just do it and yeah it was it was scary but then once
*  you got some momentum once you had a couple of weeks under your belt and this
*  started becoming a real normal part of your life what was that feeling like
*  what you realized like hey I'm fucking actually doing this yeah it's this is
*  actually happening well every day every day I was taking significant jumps I
*  mean as I said I've always been naturally athletic so I was picking this
*  up like quick really quick I mean even within a few weeks people thought I'd
*  been doing it for years you know and a lot of that you know does come from my
*  physicality but but my drive to do it and into it too to have my sights set so
*  high that you know I was taking these quantum leaps every single day so over
*  over the weeks and over the months you know it just it really felt like I was
*  like oh I'm on track you know I'm on the path I should be on I'm gonna I'm
*  gonna be amazing at this you know this is great I'm natural at this you know
*  I'm gonna be I'm be a champion one day I'm just be crushing people and you know
*  everything everything was pointing in that direction you know with my my
*  development and you know started eventually going into the classes and
*  sparring and all those kinds of things and you know it was always like when do
*  I get to fight when do I get to fight when do I get to fight and I think it
*  was nine months in I finally got I got to fight and I was like oh this is it
*  this is this is my moment you know I'm gonna go out there you know I'm gonna
*  crush this dude and then I'm gonna be you know on my way to the big time not
*  that they're even you know back then there's no big time there was no this
*  wasn't this was before YouTube this is before anyone even knew what Muay Thai
*  was you know you had to tell everybody you did kickboxing basically which just
*  crushed my soul every time every time say well it's like kickboxing and you
*  know for Muay Thai people to have to say that is it's devastating it's like
*  someone say well it's like karate you know what I mean which no disrespect to any of
*  these other arts but but to say that it's that in order to help people you
*  most of the time I would just say yeah yeah yeah it's like kickboxing instead
*  of having to explain to them what it is and yeah so nine months in I got the
*  there was gonna be a fight in Salt Lake City Utah and a bunch of the other
*  people at the gym were fighting as well and we were all gonna go up there and
*  compete is this an amateur fight yeah yeah headgear no yes headgear but you
*  know the funny thing was we had headgear but we didn't have shin guards we had
*  eight ounce gloves and we had knees to the head which was a trip so anyway so
*  so I was like oh yeah great we get to fight and I was so excited and my pops
*  and Gina and we we drove up there and you know like I said I really felt like
*  I was on my way but when we got there the guy that I was originally supposed
*  to fight I don't remember if he backed out or it was just that he was closer
*  in weight to somebody else you know and that was kind of the thing back then we
*  would just show up at places and be like you got to fight for me or don't you and
*  they didn't and I was like I was devastated I was devastated I'm like I
*  did all this work I was so ready and now I don't have a fight and you know my
*  turn is like well is there somebody else you can get and so the the the promoter
*  you know he's calling around calling around and then he finally is like well
*  there's one guy that's gonna take it but he always you by 20 pounds and he's had
*  about 30 fights already I was like let's do it I don't give a fuck man I was
*  like I didn't do all this for nothing you know what I'm saying and you know
*  and again that like that was just our mentality the way that we came up and
*  the people that we came up under was you fight anytime anywhere anyone any style
*  any weight it doesn't matter and so yeah I didn't even I didn't even really
*  think about it as far as like that goes you know it's like I get to fight that's
*  a fucking awesome man and I felt I felt I felt confident in a way but it's also
*  that you have no idea what you're really doing like you can train your whole
*  life but if you've never fought you don't know anything anything you have no
*  concept of what it's like to be in there you have the hardest sparring in the
*  world with a complete stranger and it's night and day between a real fight and
*  sparring and so it's like yeah you you you want to feel confident going in
*  there but you have no concept of what it is so it's really just fake it's fake
*  confidence and I got fucking crushed man so I got there and I you know I have no
*  concept of like pacing myself or anything so I just like I'm like
*  sprinting at this guy and in like 30 seconds I was just done I couldn't
*  breathe I couldn't think I couldn't I could barely even see felt like felt
*  like I was underwater and it was it was the worst thing in the world because
*  nothing this guy was doing was hurting me and every time he had hit me the whole
*  crowd and all I wanted to do was just say it's it's nothing bothering me this
*  isn't hurting like I wanted to like tell everybody like this isn't hurting me I
*  can't breathe like all I'm really trying to do is not pass out right now and and
*  I mean like physically I couldn't do anything but but I was able to last for
*  a while and do a couple decent things in there but by the third round he was
*  just battering me need me in the face and you know he did he just kept
*  clenching me up and just needing the piss out of me and there was nothing I
*  could do and they finally stopped it in the third round and I was devastated
*  man I was devastated I remember walking like as I was walking back to the the
*  locker room everyone in the crowd was like cheering for me and like oh that
*  was awesome man like like good job good job what is wrong with these people like
*  that wasn't good that was so terrible that's terrible and I was like laying in
*  the back and bleeding all over the place and my opponent comes in he's like dude
*  that was your first fight so yeah man I hate to see you in like a year or two
*  he's like that was I was amazing and you know that really that really stuck with
*  me you know that that one that he said that and also just the the impact I saw
*  that you could have on people that that it's not necessarily about whether you
*  win or lose that it's what you show in there it's the heart that you show it's
*  the the spirit that you show and you know I had like a day or two when I was
*  like maybe this just isn't for me you know I thought I thought that this that
*  I was gonna be so good at this I thought that it was just gonna like skyrocket to
*  the top and I got crushed man I didn't even make it out of the fight and like
*  maybe this isn't for me but I was forced to face that day one like do you want to
*  do this regardless of how good you are regardless of you win if you if you
*  can't win and maybe you can't be the best in the world do you still want to
*  do this yeah I fucking do I love this so much and me having to face that so
*  early on was was was extremely significant I saw so many of the people
*  I trained with would go on these undefeated streaks like 10 15 20 fights
*  but inevitably you will lose and if you haven't had to confront that early on
*  eventually you do most of those people never fought again or just like crushed
*  them mentally where they weren't able to overcome it but I had to deal with
*  that the first day and overcome it be like you know what that doesn't matter
*  I'm gonna bust my ass in a gym don't make sure that never happens again and
*  I went on to win like 19 20 fights in a row from there and you know that was
*  really a significant moment in my career where I had to confront the the reality
*  of this and you know that so much of fighting is a perfect metaphor for
*  for things in life like if you really want something you can't always focus on
*  what the results are or the immediate results like winning and losing and all
*  of these things are so much of that is just on the surface ego level of things
*  yeah and when you break it all down like what is your why are you doing this I'm
*  doing this because I love it I'm doing this to improve myself I'm doing this
*  because it's what keeps me healthy mentally physically spiritually and all
*  of these things and that's the most important thing and yes it was an
*  extreme motivator to be better and you know not to let that have happen to me
*  again but you know really it really made things clear to me early on like what's
*  important here also just to get over that it's so it's so psychologically
*  important that you like you were saying you just kept getting sort of tossed to
*  the wolves everything you did was difficult it was almost symbolic of your
*  journey that you were forced to fight someone who had 30 fights and 20 pounds
*  heavier when you had no experience that trusting the process is you really only
*  trust the process if it's difficult yeah you know that whole expression trust
*  the process well if you're fucking everybody up what do you mean trust the
*  process you're out there just fucking everybody up of course I'm trusting I'm
*  the man yeah right but when you get your ass handed to you and then you have to
*  rebuild and you have to realize well there's a series of variables in your
*  your encountering the variables and speed and in aggressiveness and in
*  styles and in trickery and some people are better than others at figuring you
*  out and some people have a style that's tailor-made to defeat your style and
*  it's good when that does happen yeah and not just to trust the process but to
*  appreciate the journey yeah yeah and sometimes people they just want success
*  mm-hmm well we all want yeah of course we all want we always want things to be
*  good it's it's kind of that same mentality of you know like you want to
*  give your kids what you never had but a lot of times when you do that you end up
*  with a spoiled brat who has no concept of work ethic and what it really takes
*  and you're hindering them even more so than than you were because you had to
*  like confront all these things right you know what I'm saying and it's it's
*  unfortunate that so many things that you would think would help us or really hurt
*  us in the end and it needs to be difficult it needs to be a struggle and
*  of course you want help along the way but the harder you have to work that in
*  the long run the stronger you're gonna be the better you're gonna be the
*  more independent you're gonna be the more self-sufficient you're going to be
*  and all of these things are gonna better you so then in a lot of ways it's like
*  maybe I should make my kids life hell and then he's gonna be really strong and
*  he's gonna be an entrepreneur and he's gonna change the world I don't know yeah
*  it's it's hard you know I have children it's it's tricky I think you don't want
*  them to have a hard life but you do one of the most difficult things too is we're
*  all on our own journey and what's beneficial for one is detrimental to
*  somebody else so yeah it's good to have advice it's good to have somebody that
*  believes in you but that's not necessarily going to help you just
*  because sometimes that might end up hurting you you know having people that
*  do believe in you and telling you how great you are and you know opening doors
*  for you and all of these things you know in many ways those things can be
*  extremely detrimental and you don't you don't develop the things that you
*  inevitably will need in the long run you know and there's no there's no one way
*  to get anywhere you know it's there's so complex and there's so many variations
*  of things that that that that apply to success in anything I have one favorite
*  day in the weather in Los Angeles the weather in Los Angeles is perfect right
*  it's just so often it's like 80 degrees and sunny it's like 90% of the time 80
*  degrees and sunny me and my friend Brian and my friend Steve Rinella we filmed
*  this television show called meat eater and went on a hunting trip in Prince of
*  Wales Island in Alaska where it's the rainiest part in North America it's so
*  fucking rainy you you think you're gonna stay dry in your tent but there's no
*  such thing as dry like and I realized this one of the first nights I had to
*  get up take a piss in the middle of night and I had a headlamp and I turned
*  my headlamp on and inside my tent was like it was raining because it was so
*  much there was mist it was moisture like so much moisture that turning on the
*  headlamp was like you you were like doing it in fog like everything was wet my
*  sleeping bag was wet my clothes were wet and I was like oh you don't you don't
*  get dry there's no dry we had one day we had a fire one day we figured out how
*  to start a fire actually using Fritos is a pro tip if you ever fucking Fritos
*  are made with some fucking crazy toxic grease that they work great as lighter
*  fuel like if you light them they stay lit for a long time and then we were
*  like taking like the inside of logs and like using that wood and wood that was
*  like maybe under the bottom of other wood so it didn't get as wet we slowly
*  put a fire together anyway I was there for six seven days we got back to LA
*  and it was 80 and sunny and the feeling of that Sun I was like this is the same
*  Sun I always experience but it's always just you know it's normal it's no big
*  deal it's just California weather another day in paradise but not that day
*  that day I was like fuck this is amazing I was driving on the street my face felt
*  good like everything it felt good and I called my friend Steve up I go dude I've
*  never been happier like this is like the happiest day I've ever experienced yeah
*  and I think it's because we were suffering in just cold and rain for seven
*  days yeah you like do you need that yeah other what because if you just have
*  these goddamn sunny days you like everybody out here in California you just
*  spoiled baby well it's like the if everybody's winning nobody's winning
*  right is losing nobody's losing so if you don't have the good and the bad you
*  don't even understand you can't appreciate the good or what the bad can
*  be the helpful things that it does and yeah we don't want that but but those
*  are the things that help you grow and those are the things that that we
*  inevitably need you know I hate to I don't hate to because I want to do this
*  I'm gonna toss a little hand grenade at you and see what you want to do with it
*  here but I've been thinking about this a lot lately and you know wanting to
*  communicate my story and these things that have happened to me and then this
*  opportunity came up and this opportunity to reach a lot of people and to there's
*  that quote that says be the person that you needed when you were younger you
*  know and Gina has that on her wall and it stares me in the face every day and I
*  realize that I now am the person that I needed when I was younger and if
*  somebody would have opened up their mouth and let me know that I wasn't
*  alone and that that I wasn't so isolated and so many so many horrible things that
*  we all deal with is because we feel isolation we don't think anyone could
*  understand and we don't think that anyone else is going through these
*  things and if we did just that knowledge of not being alone would be so
*  significant but when I was 14 years old I was molested by my stepmother and this
*  went on for well over a year close to two years and it was obviously
*  detrimental to me and these are these these are things that I'm just now
*  finally starting to be able to understand and realize like what happened
*  to me and realize how young I was at the time you know when I meet of a 14 year
*  old kid like you're fucking baby you're a baby you you know it's like when we
*  think about ourselves when we were younger like at least myself I'm like I
*  still feel the same I did when I was younger I was just little you know what I
*  mean yeah but you don't really understand how little you were until you
*  have like a little 12 14 year old kid standing next to you like you're not
*  like you don't even how could that happen in like thinking about how so a
*  study that said one in six males are abused by the time they're 18 which
*  means every one of us probably knows somebody that this has happened to you
*  know and to think how devastating it is to women but but but to her men it's
*  it's it's such a different thing because you're almost it's almost viewed us but
*  well when it happens from a woman you know it's almost viewed as like a good
*  thing yeah like it's a positive thing like oh I wish that happened to me when
*  I was a kid like I want to be molested and you know we're not able to really
*  understand it and understand the damage that it that it does and and you know I
*  I if I wouldn't have felt so alone and so isolated at the time I you know I
*  don't necessarily know if things would have changed but I definitely would have
*  wouldn't have felt so alone you know when it felt like there's nobody in the
*  world that could possibly understand this there's nobody that who can I talk
*  to about this you know like I can't talk to my friends a couple my friends knew
*  they thought it was the coolest shit ever you know they're like I want that I
*  want that bad I'm like well it was your stepmom too which is dude it was it was
*  so confusing you know as I was I was very conflicted by it you know like I
*  could understand it at all and then to have this person like mentally
*  manipulating me and making like oh it's not a big deal it's okay it's almost
*  like it's a good thing you know like it's like there's nothing wrong you know
*  it's it's you know I'm not a stranger and in this you know even prior to that
*  as I said I started drinking when I was 12 but but this really just derailed me
*  so much and made me internalize and put up these barriers and walls around me
*  and things that I like I said I'm only even just at this age starting to
*  understand like the negative habits that this created in me of distrust and of
*  negativity and of you know having to be having to be alone and not trust people
*  and you know and so many things like that that you know like Jean is probably
*  the only person that I've ever talked to in depth about this I mean my couple
*  people my family know and almost none of my friends and I've never spoken to this
*  to anybody you know I I try to go to a therapist once and talk about this but I
*  started realizing like this therapist is getting more out of this our interaction
*  than I am like he's you know like a overweight person that needs like
*  self-confidence help I'm like oh geez man like like who can I fucking talk to
*  about this and you know maybe maybe I can't talk to anybody but I am in a
*  position to where I can reach out and let other people that know that they're
*  not the only ones going through this and that has been weighing on me so much
*  lately especially over the last few years no I'm like you are in a position
*  to be able even if you it only helps one person like you can you just don't know
*  how to like well I could write about it or I could do like a video blog or
*  something and I've been thinking about this a lot lately like how do I how can
*  I do this and like should I do this I'm like I don't know if that's like a good
*  thing like it's not like I'm a like psychologist or someone that can like
*  help with this and but I just felt like I need to express this and and and and
*  communicate this and then maybe it can do some good for even one person and then
*  if I didn't that would haunt me forever I I had an experience when I was 13 with
*  a girl who lived up the street who was 21 a couple times but it was very
*  different than your experience it was I mean I'm ashamed to say it was kind of
*  fun you know it's it was different it was I couldn't believe it it was very
*  weird yeah but it definitely like kind of screwed up my idea of what boy-girl
*  interaction was I didn't go from like 13 year olds most the time they're like you
*  want a kiss oh no do you I don't know yeah to you know this girl grabbing my
*  dick and pulling her tits out she was a woman you know she was 21 and it didn't
*  it didn't hurt me like your story like your story hurts like it sounds like you
*  were betrayed and you were you were and also the fact that was your stepmom I
*  mean with me it was like what the fuck was that all about and I don't I don't
*  I didn't tell anybody yeah I didn't tell anybody for like fucking years and years
*  later I probably didn't tell anyone till I was in my 20s and I think I probably
*  told a girlfriend when I was in my 20s yeah and she was like when it was the
*  first time you ever fooled around I was like well because that was really the
*  first time I had ever fooled around with anyone was this 21 year old woman what
*  else it was the same thing for me you know I I didn't even kiss a girl until I
*  was I don't know 12 13 like late late because I was such a shy person so I
*  went from just kissing to that I think it was no in between I think the same
*  with me I think I don't even think I kissed I think I kissed her yeah I think
*  she was the first person I kissed yeah yeah and yeah to just have your
*  innocence ripped away like that and to be thrust into this adult thing you know
*  obviously the situation was that much worse it being you know my stepmom and
*  it being being molested and you know it's such a different thing than a woman
*  being raped forcefully raped oh it's way different yeah but psychologically and
*  emotionally you know it's it's it's it's devastating it is it it is obviously
*  and you were living with her as well yeah you know that's the whole thing is
*  terrible and you said it went on for a year longer than year it was probably
*  close to two years how did it stop I stopped it actually you know this was
*  something you know I never obviously I never felt right about this I was very
*  conflicted by it you know and I was like this definitely isn't a good thing but I
*  don't know like and I did I definitely I didn't understand how bad of a thing it
*  was you know and again she was very manipulative and you know any time I
*  would kind of bring that subject up like yeah I don't think this is okay you know
*  this is this feels wrong and she's like no no you know and find this way to you
*  know rationalize it or make it okay and you know but as time went on like I just
*  like there this is bad how old was she she was probably 30 young 30s you know
*  now that was another thing like once I got to that age and then I saw a 14 year
*  old I'm like what the fuck like I didn't even I couldn't even conceptualize how
*  twisted this person was until I got that age like how could you how could you
*  look at a baby a child and and do that how could you do that you know that
*  expression hurt people hurt people yeah and you know and unfortunately a lot of
*  that for me is helps you like rationalize it and make it like oh well you know she's
*  fucked up and you know even even my father you know after you found out like
*  he kept this lady around for a while really yeah after he found out yeah I mean they they they kind
*  of split up and divorced but but they kind of worked together still and you know he kept her
*  around for for quite some time and you know that alone was extremely damaging to me and a
*  betrayal such a betrayal and such a such a traumatic thing that I didn't even really
*  understand how damaging that was after the fact until really till recently you know because I
*  myself would rationalize it well you know he didn't want to like like be an asshole and like
*  center off like she was an alcoholic too and you know you know it's like oh you know he's just
*  trying to you know make this horrible situation like okay for all of us and you know I didn't
*  really think about like how fucked up he was in the whole situation and like how how much more
*  damaging it was in the long run to me by not having my father protect me like if Mike this
*  happened to my child I would fucking murder a woman that did this you know I certainly
*  wouldn't keep her around you know and I certainly wouldn't like just handle it handle it the way
*  that he did you know and that was that was almost it magnified the the damage that much
*  more so because of the way that it was handled you know and to not have that to not be taken
*  care of by adults by not be taken care of by my father by the people around me that who are
*  supposed to love me and take care of me and and and they did the exact opposite like they fucked
*  fucked my world up you know and I put band-aids of alcohol on it my whole life you know and I
*  understand like why I why I did that and why it was I mean I really was trying to kill myself
*  really I mean when you look at it that's what I was doing I was just doing a long process of it
*  you know and that's that's that's what we do it's like we don't want to take the gun and kill
*  ourselves but I'm gonna I don't want to really live and I want to like I want to check out of
*  this place sooner the better so I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it happen and
*  that way I can't say I killed myself but I was killing myself every day and putting myself in
*  situations that were extremely dangerous and detrimental and damaging and that's what I was
*  doing and and you know half of my life was I was just destroyed and you know I'm trying to use
*  this second part of my life to make up for that make up for the damage that was done and to try
*  to turn a horrible situation in a negative situation something that I could easily point
*  to and allow destroy my life which is what I was doing and trying to do the opposite you know it's
*  again with the fight approach it's like you have a loss you have a horrible thing happen you have
*  an injury what are you gonna do with it are you gonna let it destroy you and break you and never
*  do this again and then be depressed and bitch and complain and whine about it we're gonna say yeah
*  shitty things happen to all of us fucked up things happened and we all have the excuse to let it
*  destroy our lives and to use it to make ourselves feel better about drinking and drugs and just being
*  an asshole and you know like we all have reasons to be dicks and we all have reasons to you know
*  take it out on other people but that doesn't mean that you should and that doesn't mean that you
*  don't still have a choice it's that victim mentality and this is something that I just
*  started understanding because you know that that term victim mentality I'm like yeah well I'm a
*  fucking victim but what victim mentality really is is feeling like you don't have a role to play
*  from that point yeah you might not have been able to control these terrible things that have happened
*  to you but you do have control over what you do from there you have control over whether you use
*  that to go into a more positive light or you use that to to drastically damage you and you know be
*  this burden that you carry well sometimes I think when someone like you goes through something like
*  this and comes out on the other end what you can do by talking about this can set a path for so many
*  people to understand that you know someone looks at you you know they see you fighting on television
*  and they they see you on the internet and you know successful Muay Thai fighter and you know you look
*  cool you have this beautiful girlfriend everything seems so positive you know when you're a young
*  kid and your life is shit like mine was clearly like yours was you you look at these people like
*  they're nothing like you they're aliens there's some different thing they they're there they're
*  it's the world's opened up to them so easily yeah and they're better than you when someone hears you
*  talk about your experience the alcoholism the abuse the isolation the feeling like a loser and
*  all the things that are so relatable to so many people when you can talk about this you can you
*  you're setting a map that other people can follow and this is something that's so important in
*  culture and in human beings we're all part of some strange evolution of the human race and the
*  things that our grandparents went through were likely unfucking believably horrific the things
*  their grandparents were it went through were probably magnitudes worse and this is just how
*  human beings have gone from being monkeys to being what we are now and it's happening very
*  rapidly yeah and one of the things that accelerates this understanding of consequences and of the
*  ability to rise to the occasion and overcome obstacles and to be able to use adversity as
*  a tool to better yourself is someone like you what you're doing right now is very very beneficial
*  to so many people millions of people are listening to this right now and so many of them this is gonna
*  resonate with them they're gonna say oh this guy who is this fucking badass kickbox or moit excuse
*  me moitai right badass dude who's this like you know like people admire you and to hear this is
*  so it's so powerful I mean it's it I'm so glad you said it I'm so glad you talked all of it from
*  the beginning you know your your earlier struggles to this because this is medicine for people man
*  there's a lot of people that are hearing this right now and they're going I can do it too I
*  can do it too yeah and that's that's always been a motivational thing for me to try to be honest
*  with the the things that I deal with the ups and the downs and to to show my losses to show my
*  injuries to show to be vocal about the doubts that I have that that I still have that I still
*  deal with you know it's it's easy to look at these people in the spotlight and be like they don't
*  deal with fear they don't deal with pain they don't deal with doubts they don't deal with feeling
*  like they're inadequate yeah I think I think was a clip or something you were talking about the
*  imposter syndrome yeah and I'm like yeah like it doesn't matter how amazing you seemingly are on
*  the outside to all of these people like we're all just human beings we are all just individuals that
*  have made choices and have steered our lives in certain directions but but it's almost like when
*  you make it to a point it's like oh they don't deal with this anymore yeah I deal with the exact
*  same fears doubts in all of these things that I dealt with day one to this day I'd still deal
*  with them those same questions they have never gone away ever gone away you know you learn how
*  to handle them better and you learn you should get strengthened by them but but they don't
*  necessarily disappear and a lot of times they can get worse over the years because now you're now
*  you're in a position where you're expected to be a certain way people have people have expectations
*  of you you know you're supposed to be this superhuman being are you supposed to be extremely
*  confident are you supposed to only put on a plus performances and you're not allowed to fail you're
*  not allowed to be human anymore and the when we can humanize these things and then it lets people
*  realize that they can do it too you know we're not we're not necessarily made up of anything
*  different than anybody else you know we've just gone through a process of learning and developing
*  and diving off of cliffs that we didn't know where they were going and you know that's that's what we
*  all have to do you know like the people in these spotlights they're they're just human beings yeah
*  and the more that you you meet them and read about their stories and you know so I love reading
*  autobiographies like geez like the things these people have had to overcome they weren't handed
*  anything if it more than anything it was more devastating and detrimental and they've had to
*  overcome more than you could possibly imagine and it wasn't just given to them they had to work and
*  strive and struggle and fail fail over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
*  until they got to where they got to and still do they still do they still fail constantly we all fail
*  constantly yeah well failure is a gift yeah once you make that switch once you understand it and
*  like you can view these losses or these things that happen or these struggles as you know I
*  always view them as challenges be like are you gonna quit are you gonna give up I always view
*  like when I'm tired in the ring or in on a workout I'm like you won't quit I'm like fuck you man you
*  know I view that that that that voice in your head you know that the that devil that's looming over
*  your shoulders like you're gonna quit your failure you know what fuck you I'm not quitting I'm never
*  gonna quit I'm never gonna stop and there's nothing you can do so keep talking but I'm going
*  forward is there a time will you ever get past that and you understand that you're never gonna
*  quit and instead just concentrate on the task at hand or do you think that that that voice that
*  you're duking it out with that you take that motherfucker to the grave you definitely take it
*  to the grave you I think we feel like we get farther away from it and we get stronger and we
*  get more confident but it never gets far that you never get farther away from it you know like it
*  like I compare to my alcoholism it's like I could go ten years without ever drinking again but all
*  it takes is one bad day yeah we are all one bad day of being in the worst situations ever and
*  that's why it's so important to you know you look at people on the streets and things like that but
*  like you know how easy that can happen yeah like how many bad days are bad situations would it take
*  to turn a successful person into that not a lot no we're all just balancing on this very yeah
*  delicate thing that you know it seems like we're all strong and safe and all this like well when
*  the power goes out and you know that the world's gonna go to hell like that yes we just pretend
*  like it's not right that's how we get through the day so but yeah like to your point is I don't
*  think we're ever any farther away from those things that held us back before we get stronger
*  and we learn how to process them and we we understand it more and we understand that the
*  series of things that we need that will take us down that road or get us farther away from it but
*  it but it's just right there you know and no matter how much we learn and develop I think
*  and sometimes that makes it even more scarier it's like the higher you get the farther you have to
*  fall and and and it's the more you can be aware of that that that you're never gonna get farther
*  away from it you always need to be diligent that you always need to do things that are gonna steer
*  you in a more positive way I think that it that is like the goal to to not falling back on that I
*  think the worst thing that we can do is have this belief that we're past it yeah that's never gonna
*  happen again I'm not an alcoholic anymore I'm not a drug addict anymore I'm not depressed
*  anymore that's what that's what's helped me is is I I did think I one day I would be so far away
*  from it that it would never be a thought anymore but but by knowing that it's always right there
*  that keeps me sharp you know it's like that that you need that thing to keep you at your best or
*  we start to get lazy it's that that that same concept of having people that push you in the
*  gym or in life or or etc if if you don't have somebody pushing you you can only ever push
*  yourself so hard you might think you're pushing yourself really hard but you don't really have a
*  basis for where that is so like for myself I always run my sprints on a treadmill because a
*  treadmill doesn't lie this is how fast you're going and this is how long you're doing it now
*  you can go out on the street and say I was going as fast as humanly possible you're always gonna
*  hold yourself back a little bit you know that's just the way we are as human beings you know that
*  that safety net that we have ingrained in us to not go over that edge but if you're not pushing
*  that edge you're not developing and you're always holding yourself back a little bit a little bit
*  and no matter how hard you think you're going or how honest you think you're being unless you have
*  somebody a society it's so important to have people in your lives that that that keep you in
*  that sharpened state you know that that that that that question you yeah that that push you and
*  you know like like for me Gina's always been that way for me that person like she's not gonna look
*  look at my not let me bullshit you know just keep me honest you know sometimes to an extreme extent
*  and like give me a little bit of a break here you know it's like that person that that pushes you
*  and it's uncomfortable to be pushed and you don't want to be pushed I want to relax and I
*  want to like sit on the beach and drink beers and do all these things but is that gonna help me get
*  to a better place in my life a better place in my mind in my heart now that's gonna allow me to
*  just like be a lazy piece of shit and just drift off and die and be no benefit to to myself or
*  anyone else for that matter so as uncomfortable as it is to be pushed and as uncomfortable it is
*  to be pressured and to want to excel we all need those things you're either improving or your
*  decline yeah and I think that's such an important thing to keep in mind like it's only one of the
*  other yeah there is no in the middle it's like the concept of balance you never find balance
*  because once you find it you lose it you're always jumping on both sides of this line too much or
*  too little you're either going too fast or too slow yeah and we're trying to find that perfect
*  balance of everything and you'll never can find it but knowing that you never can find it forces
*  you to be diligent about all these things and to constantly be trying to find it and the more you
*  try to find that the more you're gonna develop and learn ways that aren't the right way and then
*  finding what what does work it's like trying to find your your calling and your passion in life
*  is like you don't have enough to necessarily know what that is but whittle it down by fine what don't
*  you want it to what do you hate what do you hate right don't even look at what you like what do you
*  hate I don't want to do this I don't want to do this I don't want to do this I I learned very early
*  on at a young age like I do not want to go down this path that I see everybody on this go to school
*  get a job have kids get married retired die like I don't want I don't want that I don't know what
*  I do want I just know that to me I don't want anything to do with that I'm gonna go in the
*  exact opposite direction whatever that is as long as I'm far away from that that's where I'm gonna
*  be what's one of the benefits of being an outsider yeah when you're an outsider and you see all these
*  people that are supposedly doing the right thing but living these sort of empty meaningless lives
*  that they don't enjoy particularly that they don't enjoy you know and then you know when I was a kid
*  I I always looked at normal people living normal lives I could never relate I never understood it you
*  know I also grew up from a broken home and we were also on welfare and you know the whole deal I
*  think a lot of motivated people come from a place of despair when they're younger and I always had
*  this thought in my head that one day I would make it one day I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it and
*  then one day I realized and I don't know when I realized it probably when like on paper I'd
*  already made it yeah I realized oh there's no such place like this is not real like you can't ever
*  you don't make it no no one makes it yeah like if you every day you have to be trying to do better
*  every day you have to be trying first of all there's no perfect human let's accept that you're
*  always gonna be flawed you're always gonna you're always gonna be subject to fits of rage and envy
*  and and all the things that you wish that you would never have in your mind so you're gonna
*  constantly be working to make sure that that never happens you've constantly be working to make sure
*  that you are always evaluating your perspective on life and always looking at things from meditate
*  constantly meditate make sure that you approach life with a learned perspective like you're a
*  better person you were the day before and whatever you're trying to do whether it's fighting or
*  whether you're do you have an art form that you practice whatever it is that you're doing you're
*  trying to do better every day and you never even if you you accomplish some like one you know you
*  accomplish some amazing work of art that's just that day the next day you got to go back to work
*  like if you have a world championship fight and you've trained for eight weeks and you win by
*  knockout the spectacular result and you're very happy with the result you got a day or two to
*  relax yeah you got a day or two and then you're like fuck okay now what well now you got to get
*  back to work and if you if you think that there's some place like a movie where you're holding hands
*  with your loved ones and the fucking sunsets going on and the credits roll that's horseshit and we
*  have this idea in our head that there's this place that you can get to where you've air quotes made
*  it yeah and I'm here to tell you that motherfucker doesn't exist I mean obviously I'm not the most
*  successful person in the world but on paper I've accomplished a lot of shit and it doesn't mean a
*  goddamn thing every fucking day every fucking day I get up and I'm like all right I figure out how
*  to do this I gotta work on this new bit okay I got this podcast today I gotta be on point let me
*  think about this let me read this book let me you know whatever the subject is let me get all let
*  me get into it you have to if you don't you're you're gonna feel like shit yeah it's that and
*  that destination mentality yeah there's no destination yeah it's just a journey you're
*  never gonna get there there's no where to go as soon as you get there like geez I'm just as far
*  away from that thing that I thought because as you develop your the things that you think you
*  want developed to yeah one day I'm gonna be rich but the richer that you get the richer you want
*  to become well then you start filling up your life with these meaningless destinations right
*  which are material objects I want a fucking yacht bitch yeah I want a jet you know and you're like
*  I want a bigger jet Tom's got a fucking jet but I want a big jet I want to show I'll pull my jet
*  up beside his jet let him know motherfucker there's levels to this game you know and that's what people
*  do and it's they they fill their lives up with meaningless possessions and they are happy a
*  band-aid to cover up the like what is the real thing here do you know how many really successful
*  people I know that are fucking medicated to shit all of all of them a lot of them a lot of more
*  more more more so than the people that aren't in the ways should the people that struggle they're
*  on a better medication for real the struggle of like like a hard-working person that can get get
*  done with a day of hard work and have a feeling of accomplishment and then go home to your family
*  and get going again knowing you have to get up in the morning and do it again knowing you don't have
*  enough money to buy a yacht but knowing you have enough money to put food on the table and there's
*  a satisfaction to being able to provide that that's a better medicine well that's the thing
*  with with why it's so important and vital to to travel and you know go to these third world
*  countries like these people literally have nothing and are inviting perfect strangers
*  into their homes and giving them things that they do not even have themselves like why are
*  these people so happy why are they so at peace right because they understand what's important
*  that it's not this materialistic thing and and that's not to say that materials are bad but we
*  view them as these these these objects of success yeah and then I've made it and I've things are
*  perfect in my life and they they do the exact opposite in a lot of ways if you don't have a
*  good grasp of of what's really important in this life and and unfortunately a lot of times we need
*  everything taken away for us to really understand what those things really are yeah you can appreciate
*  some things you can appreciate a nice car or a nice house but if you get really caught up in them
*  you are trying to fill up a bucket with a hole in it yeah and it's never gonna fill up yeah you're
*  always just gonna look for bigger and bigger things to try to fill that bucket up and and you're gonna
*  feel full of anxiety all the time chasing that and there's no real there's no real satisfaction
*  then that's why you know when you look at one of the things that people look at when you look at
*  people that are extremely materialistic that you know wear the the most fancy jewelry and
*  drive the most fancy cars and the biggest houses we always think they're shallow always I mean isn't
*  that funny like the thing that you would look at in terms of like like markers for success markers
*  it's like material things are the big ones right they're the big markers for success the big house
*  that's the big one right big ass fucking mansion look at this big everything big everything big
*  fucking rock on his finger yeah big chain you know big this big that there's nothing there
*  there's nothing there and so ingrained in us from the time that we're born because it's hard to get
*  that's it that's why it's a trick it's one of those things it's hard to get so you think you
*  want to get it yeah because there's a lot of things that are hard to get that are worth getting for
*  sure right i mean becoming a great fighter is hard yeah but it's worth doing because once you do do
*  it and you you realize like like there's an expression that i've used before but my tango no
*  instructor said to me when i was a little boy he said martial arts are a vehicle for developing
*  your human potential yeah and i remember that i'm like oh shit like and i've used that many
*  times explaining to people but that is the benefit of getting good at a martial art yeah like you
*  go through this difficult thing and then through that you reap all these personality rewards you
*  reap these character rewards you reap this understanding of what you're capable of right
*  if you are capable of making it through a brutal camp and getting up in the morning when you know
*  you don't want to that alarm clock goes off you're like i don't want to fucking run but you do it you
*  go out and run and you you do it every day and you get through it and then you're successful and you
*  realize that you have this incredible endurance because of the discipline that you put in you
*  realize that you have this incredible skill and this understanding of how to fight correctly because
*  of all the time and the hours and the focus you're a better person because of that right that's a
*  real goal but that yacht you know like like i'm gonna i'm gonna work 16 hours a day so i can get
*  a bigger yacht and then you know i need a house with bigger windows i need a it's there's a nonsense
*  to that like look i'm not saying if you can afford a nice house get a fucking nice house it's great
*  to have a nice house what i'm saying is it's not the end yeah it's the you you are the project
*  your mind is the project how you treat people is the project how you you're the way you are with
*  your family and your friends and your loved ones and the people you communicate with get better at
*  that yeah that's that's that's the goal in this life the goal in this life is how we treat each
*  other i know and i i i wish these were things that were taught no no no no it's better it's better
*  that you didn't learn it that way because you had figured out yourself yes because you had to figure
*  out yourself and because you can explain it to people you in particular that you can explain it
*  to people having gone through this horrific adversity and come out on the other end with a
*  message yeah and so other people that are going through some tough shit you've got the medicine
*  the medicine is your you've you've actually experienced it and you know it's a map it's a
*  map of the territory it's not it's not a fucking pill that you can take and all of a sudden
*  everything's going to be better but what it is is a map of the territory and you know and and a
*  knowledge hey you can get through these woods and on the other side there's a beautiful green
*  meadow and there's a lake and it's really nice yeah for sure you know i think that that was one
*  one of the benefits of the way i grew up which was really hard and horrible but i got to see
*  firsthand both sides of money you know i went from living in a basement with five other people
*  and living on welfare to living with my father in a mansion and it's like oh yeah all this money and
*  all this stuff is just emptiness and and meaningless and and it doesn't necessarily equate to real
*  happiness and like why are we all chasing this so hard and i got to see that firsthand very very
*  early on i was like i don't want this at all it's a trick it's like the same reason why people love
*  to play video games because they're difficult but there's no there's no real reward unless you're
*  a professional video game player and you make a living doing it nowadays there's no real reward
*  you just get better at it and you get some sort of a sense of satisfaction and i mean there's a
*  there's something to be gained from it in fact some video games they've actually shown can increase
*  your cognitive performance and other things similar to the way chess does but the the trap is that
*  they're hard to do so when we see things that are difficult human beings are sort of puzzle
*  and problem solving oriented we see puzzles we want to solve and we see mysteries we want to find out
*  that's why everyone's into like bigfoot and ufos and shit because it's a mystery yeah oh what is
*  it what do you think it is like we have a natural inclination to try to solve things like that yeah
*  and we think that because in life look if you try to solve where the food is you survive that's what
*  made us alive that's why our dna has been passed down for all these hundreds of thousands of years
*  because our ancestors figured out where the food is you know they figured out how to drill a hole
*  in the ice and fish they figured out how to you know how to survive and this is why things that
*  are difficult to do are attractive to us but we have to be able to differentiate between things
*  that are difficult and meaningful and things that are difficult and bullshit yeah my friend you know
*  brian callen my friend brian callen said something to me once we're really young and uh it was the
*  perfect thing we're both in our 20s and he said all you want is enough money so you don't have to
*  worry about what something costs when you go to a restaurant yeah he's like everything else is
*  bullshit i was like you're right yeah that feeling of being able to have enough money
*  to just get a nice meal at a restaurant and not sweat it yeah like everything else is gravy yeah
*  well you know they've done countless studies on this like once your basic human needs are met
*  you know you have food shelter yeah um everything from that point on is doesn't correlate to any
*  kind of happiness and in many ways is the exact opposite you know creates more stress yes and all
*  of these things like what how much do you really need and if you the more you you think you need
*  the more problems you're creating and the more distractions you are from um the important things
*  in life and and developing as a human being you know you're developing all these materialistic
*  things but you're not developing yourself emotionally and mentally and spiritually and uh
*  yeah like just as soon as you realize that and be like why am i what am i what is the purpose of
*  what it is that i am chasing yeah i think the study was like they said 80 000 like everything
*  over 80 000 like you really don't experience any much more you know before that you're you get into
*  like 40 000 30 000 well now you're struggling it's hard to feed yourself yeah becomes very it's a
*  weight on your shoulders but once you hit a certain number it's like you're gonna be all right yeah
*  yeah you're never gonna be in the street yeah you're you're living like i remember i lived in
*  this apartment i had this uh kind of shitty apartment and then i moved to a better apartment
*  and then i was sitting in this better apartment i was like i'm kind of used to this like i'm used
*  to this like this is just home now there's a feeling when you get where you're home like all
*  right i'm home now i'm in this other apartment it just costs more money yeah you know like okay i
*  remember thinking that like is this better yeah i mean i guess it's better but it's cost twice as
*  much like now i gotta fucking think about how i'm gonna pay for this bitch yeah well yeah i think
*  about like when i had like five dollars in the bank or when i had five thousand dollars in the
*  bank like did i feel different i didn't feel different at all no you know i might have felt
*  different like when i go out to eat and the check comes like i'm gonna pay for this kind of thing
*  but but emotionally i didn't feel any different whatsoever yeah and uh yeah i think that's such
*  an important lesson for all of us to learn and if you know the early the sooner you figure those
*  things out you know the better like so many things in life we figure out so late if ever
*  you know when we're kids we look at uh adults our parents um those in authority and we think oh
*  they got it figured out you had a really good joke about this about thinking um the older you get the
*  more you you understand life and how things are going on but the the older you get realized nobody
*  knows what the fuck is going on and everyone's out here just winging it yeah like i don't know
*  what the fuck i'm doing i'm just kind of trying my best but but i'm like oh maybe i should look
*  to my parents for advice like geez they're really just adult kids like they know what the fuck they're
*  talking about yeah the bit was do you remember when you thought that grown-ups were real they
*  don't exist like i used to think that one day i'm gonna be a grown i was crying i was young i was so
*  upset one day i'm gonna be a grown-up and everything's gonna make sense yeah and then one day
*  you're at the supermarket and the guy goes paper plastic sir you're like sir i'm a sir am i grown
*  up fuck this is it and then you realize no one knows any more than you about what this is all
*  about you might have more data in your head you might have more experience you might be a brain
*  surgeon you might know how to build rockets you might be smarter than me yeah but you don't have
*  any fucking idea what this is yeah no one does you cannot no you can but everything is there i like
*  to think there are there are really no facts everything is a theory because we could all be
*  asleep in a dream right now or hooked up to a machine like nobody knows that for sure so how
*  can you possibly say anything is factual you can say things are factual with the information that's
*  in front of you but that information might be bullshit and 10 years from now i might say we
*  might have a completely different perspective on things that we're doing now that we think are right
*  and like this is the way life is this is the way the world is you know like 10 years ago people
*  had a very different approach to things you know what we can say is as far as we know this is the
*  case and this is what we know is repeatable yeah if you do this if you put two bricks on top of
*  two bricks you have four bricks we're pretty sure but maybe not but we might be in a dream yeah like
*  we could all be wrong and that's why i i think it's you know so stupid to to judge other people's
*  beliefs be like oh your way is the right way you got it figured out and everybody else is crazy but
*  you think it i'm like don't you think that they think the exact same thing you do well there's a
*  problem today and there's a lot of people out there giving advice and um this is what's interesting
*  sometimes advice it resonates and then you get older and wiser and you realize that advice is
*  really stupid because you have it's there's people that are giving advice and they're they're they
*  were they're there's like a lot of value in motivating people right like when someone's
*  a like legitimately motivational person whether it's like wim hoff the ice man or someone is like
*  really done some things there's something about them that that their inspiration is fuel it's it
*  really does something to you but then there's a lot of people out there that are just saying
*  shit because they think it's going to be motivating to other people and it sounds like horse shit and
*  it only tricks dummies and that stuff is painfully prevalent yeah there's so much of it there's so
*  many people out there that are trying to offer advice and they're trying to motivate people
*  but then you go hey man what have you experienced they've had a placid dull life
*  filled with non-accomplishments yeah the biggest accomplishment is tricking people into thinking
*  they're a good motivational speaker like the uh get rich quick thing oh there's so many of those
*  this is how they've gotten rich sure yeah dude i was watching a documentary on one of those guys
*  one of these uh internet guys who rents houses and rents cars and tries to pretend he's this big
*  baller and and spends all this money and you know and ran a bunch of scam dating sites and
*  all these different things and i'm like wow this is this is this pursuit is odd it's a fucking odd
*  thing this pursuit of tricking people into thinking that you're more knowledgeable than you actually
*  are what resonates with people is like what you were talking about from the beginning of this
*  podcast when you're talking about your life and how you felt and your own real legitimate
*  experiences and the feelings of inadequacy and then the finding the light at the end of the
*  tunnel and all these different things that are just you're you're you're relaying your your
*  life's lessons and experiences those are extremely valuable for people those are extremely valuable
*  but because people know they're extremely valuable there's a lot of bullshitters out there that are
*  trying to concoct these things and and and trick you and like this is how i got this mansion
*  you can get this mansion too you can make i'm gonna show you here on a whiteboard this is what you
*  can do and like they're just horse shitting yeah but there's money in that and so there's a lot
*  of them there's like they pop up all the time i get emails from them i get uh the fucking instagram
*  messages i i see them like hey i want to come on your show motivate people i'm i'm really about
*  motivating people like bro you're 22 the fuck are you motivating you ain't motivating shit
*  you know go move to nepal for a year yeah and it's also such a it's a tricky thing because like
*  for even for myself it's like of course i want to motivate people i want to help people and yes
*  but you can start drifting into that now i'm a motivational speaker yes now i'm not being honest
*  yes communicating the full spectrum of the things that i'm dealing with and going through and like
*  i'm only going to focus on these positive things like oh just do this this and this and you know
*  you're going to go the right way and oftentimes because they don't have someone in their life like
*  the way you were describing jeena yeah someone who's good hey fuck face you know yeah pull your head
*  out of someone you have to have someone in your life that's raw with you that's real with you and
*  for me it's my friends it's definitely my wife she doesn't bullshit me about anything yeah those
*  people are giant in your life you gotta have people that check you yes they have to know you
*  too they have to know you you can't hide anything from them we have we have a lot of us tend to have
*  these um um what would the word be i don't know these people in our lives that like they're only
*  there because you're doing something for them or yes like yeah but those people aren't pushing you
*  they're they're yes men yeah they're parasites parasites and they're not it's not a real
*  relationship no it's not a that's not a relationship you're gonna grow through that's
*  a that's a relationship that's gonna make you feel good yes and and in a lot of ways and yeah it's
*  fun and comfortable it's like but if you if that person can't uh get to the core of you yeah and
*  really like when you tell me something i know it's truth because you have no other reason to to say
*  bullshit right you don't owe me you don't need anything from me yeah yeah that's giant for
*  people you you can't like this is one thing that i've seen many times with celebrities
*  yeah when they go off the rails and they they don't hang out with other people like them
*  so they don't have real friends they have these employees and people and it gets real sketchy
*  and everyone that they talk to and interact with need something from them and they assume this
*  position of authority where no one can question them like no one can call bullshit no one like
*  you gotta have peers it's very important and you don't have if you don't have the respect and the
*  friendship of your peers like man you're a drift yeah you're not tethered you're out there in orbit
*  just fucking floating around you're another dimension and yeah not good things easy to get
*  there too very easy yeah much much easier especially for successful people people start
*  kissing your ass yeah i'm like oh this is nice i don't need i don't need to deal with this
*  bullshit i'm gonna have these people around me that make me feel good and say yes to me and
*  bring me all the things that i want and give me no stress when i meet people like that i go you
*  should do jiu-jitsu yeah go get choked because that's they'll tell you the truth an important
*  thing anything physical yeah that yeah is uh extremely i think vital for everyone i mean
*  particularly kids coming up yeah putting kids into athletics and martial arts and things like
*  and if you don't like martial arts look you can't fake a marathon yeah 26.2 needs to be run you need
*  to go left foot right foot left foot right foot till you hit the fucking finish line period end
*  of discussion yeah if you don't do that you don't get there you can't fake it you can fake a lot of
*  shit yeah there's a lot of shit you can fake but moving your body you know you can't really fake
*  that yeah you gotta do it yeah you know a 90 minute yoga class is 90 fucking minutes it's hot as
*  shit and you're in there sweating your balls off and it you know you gotta get to the end yeah you
*  gotta get to the end you know and it's just it's a small thing that's a small thing yeah you know
*  life is a big thing but these small things that you can do they'll help you understand what's
*  necessary to get through the big things yeah and there's there's it's all macro and micro it's all
*  connected in some strange way yeah yeah i'm glad you talked about all this stuff man all of it from
*  the beginning you know and then leading up to the the thing with your stepmom people you know
*  people need to hear from a guy like you that looks like you know you're a cool cat you got
*  your shit together well you know it'd be it would have been very easy for me just to come on there
*  and us to bullshit about yeah and that kind of thing we could do that too though yeah we can
*  definitely do that but you know i i i it's important for me just to be honest with all the aspects of
*  my life and to not start drifting into that just yeah this surface you know this is who i am and
*  you know image image mentality and uh yeah i i'm very aware of not wanting to be there yeah and
*  trying to uh always express myself on this trap yeah yeah yeah the image thing's a trap it's not
*  bad to look good but the this to concentrate on your image above truth and honesty is a real trap
*  yeah and um especially i think there's fighters fall into that category a lot because fighting
*  is so fucking it's so perilous yeah you don't know what the future holds you have no idea every time
*  you train you could tear an acl you really have no idea every day is and you're relying on your
*  tissue to feed yourself right your tissue and your cells and and physical motion and action
*  in order to that's what you do for a living it's so perilous there's so many things just so many
*  things that could go wrong and and when you know you think about an actual fight itself i mean the
*  anticipate like i i think back to um this past weekend with uh cowboy and connor and looking at
*  cowboy like the what the weight of the moment yeah in in his eyes you could see him warming up
*  and he talked about there's this video that they played before the fight which he he goes through
*  all of the nervousness that he experiences before he fights goes through all the faking it and
*  smiling and pretending he's cool and meanwhile inside he's freaking the fuck out and all that
*  stuff that adds to this need to make everything look great yeah yeah for sure yeah we we we
*  we want to we want to be viewed as superhuman yeah yeah and we're none of us are no my favorite
*  piece on that was uh mike tyson in his prime remember mike tyson that documentary where he
*  talked about his mindset walking to the ring i was afraid yeah yeah i'm not losing it yeah
*  and i'm a god oh yeah once again and i said to throw up some god yeah that gives me fucking
*  goosebumps every time yeah you know because he would just put himself into this state of mind
*  you know custom model used to hypnotize him when he was 13 oh yeah huh yeah i didn't know about
*  that till he was on the podcast i don't even know if he ever talked about it oh yeah but he was
*  talking about how when he was a kid like this guy he went from being this really you know poor kid
*  who was abandoned no love a constant crime and terrible poverty around him to all of a sudden
*  he's getting all this love for doing this one thing for smashing people and he found himself with
*  one of the greatest boxing minds that's ever lived in custom auto who's explaining to him fear and
*  motivation all these different things and he's hypnotizing him so he's hypnotizing this 13 year
*  old kid to smash people and saying you don't exist only the task exists and he's putting him
*  into this mindset and so then when he gets into the ring he's just fucking steamrolling people
*  yeah like it was almost like a science project like custom model found at the end of his rope
*  right he's old man about to die he's been through great champions like floyd patterson and he trained
*  all these great fighters and now he's got the greatest one he's ever seen but he's a dying man
*  and this kid's 13 and this kid is just he was 190 pounds when he was 13 teddy teddy atlast said he
*  would bring him to these smokers and no one would believe it yeah he would go how old is that they
*  would go how old is that kid he goes he's 13 he was like get the fuck out of here and he's like
*  okay how do you hold you think he is he's like 16 all right he's 16 put him in there with a 16
*  year old and he would smash some 16 year old he was just built insane he just had insane genetics
*  and then on top of that he had the greatest mind ever when it comes to motivation and understanding
*  fear and boxing who a guy who studied his entire life and he's a hypnotist and he's hypnotizing
*  this young 13 year old kid to smash people and the results youngest ever heavyweight champion
*  and one of the scariest fucking fighters in the history of sport there he is in the caskills i
*  mean that's also raised in isolation in the fucking cat skills up in the mountains yeah fuck
*  what a story it's a goddamn movie yeah oh and then well then you think about like how amazing
*  that was for him as an athlete but how detrimental that was to him yeah as a human being and all the
*  things he's had to develop so much later in life and like yeah you understand like why he was
*  fucking nuts yes you know like you expect these people to be normal when they're doing this thing
*  why do we expect that right like you you you you want these people to be these amazing athletes
*  and these savages and these things but then when they're human beings on the outside like oh well
*  that's a piece of shit and like you can't have it it's difficult to have it both ways well it's also
*  human beings are so incredibly nuanced and when someone does a thing wrong we want their whole to
*  be wrong everything who they are we want a one or a zero we want a black or a white and particularly
*  when you're dealing with people like fighters that are dealing with this insane amount of pressure
*  and this incredible emotional roller coaster ride and then on top of that why did they become fighters
*  in the first place almost all of them i mean let's say let's just be real generous and say 75 75
*  of them came from a fucked up childhood there's 25 of them maybe they're just really enjoyed
*  competition yeah but 75 came from a feeling of deficit 75 came from a fuck you i'm going to show
*  you they came from this thing and people that come from that thing they're not the most balanced
*  folks yeah they're going to make mistakes you know and compassion and understanding and and
*  the ability to forgive those are those are some of the most important aspects of community
*  and friendship and of the human race we have to be able to be compassionate towards people
*  that have experienced a different life than we have and we have to be able to forgive people
*  when they fuck up and we can't just write them off and that's one of the weirder things about
*  today with this whole cancel culture shit yeah like people just want to decide you know like
*  based on a tweet someone said or some some things someone did that's it you're you're canceled
*  forever get out kill them death off with their head yeah it's almost like there's too many of us
*  we just don't value it's almost like people in traffic we don't value each other because there's
*  so many people that you we just have an overwhelming abundance of human beings you can cancel somebody
*  and you don't even think about them get rid of them who's next you know it's so much easier for
*  us to be judgmental and have a voice and to say you're wrong i'm i'm i'm justified in the way i am
*  because i've never done that so i'm a good person and you're a bad person right because we don't want
*  we don't look inside and be like we're all fucked up we all have horrible things we all do really
*  awful things to each other and these people are in the spotlight so it's easy to point at them
*  and make yourself feel better about the things that you haven't done and sure or justified in
*  your actions but but like we're all fucked up and we all make mistakes and we all need
*  some sympathy and love and and we all need these things yeah we're all human humans need love
*  we need sympathy we need understanding and we need to be able to say i'm sorry and we need other
*  people to be able to accept that we need to be able to communicate with each other and this also
*  cancel culture i think is born out of social media because it's the most bizarre way to communicate
*  ever a one-way like text message to the world yeah you know it's like that everybody's gonna see that
*  everybody sees that you don't know right and then also people are sending these you know really
*  disingenuous ones just hoping that people like them more because of the things they're saying
*  which is like a sport now it's like let's see how many likes i can get oh i got ding ding ding
*  yes in your opinion yes and then that becomes who you are i'm an activist but you're just
*  complaining to the void he's screaming out into the world yeah that's you know we're living
*  through strange times man well it's the the cancel culture and i view it as the the team culture of
*  everything is what's i think one of the more detrimental things to our uh to humanity is
*  you're either on this side or that side and our side's right your side's wrong and
*  most of us are somewhere in the middle yeah but we can't have an in the middle conversation because
*  it's you're with them or you're with us yeah i want to know how people think if i disagree with
*  them i like talking to people i disagree with well that's what i you know that's really uh
*  one thing i really love about your show is your ability to communicate with people even the ones
*  that you obviously don't agree with but you're able to talk to them and to hear their points of
*  you and not be like oh you're a fucking idiot like even if you're nuts like and talk to them and and
*  that is something that is so missing today is our ability to communicate with people that don't
*  agree with us like just because you have a different opinion than me doesn't mean we can't
*  meet in the middle somewhere or learn from each other or or you know a big thing for me coming up
*  was we can learn from everyone even if it's what not to do yes that is so vital in you know um in
*  everything but like for me in training was like yeah this person doesn't want the fuck they're
*  doing but maybe one day i'm gonna face somebody like that so maybe i should kind of get a little
*  grasp of their mentality and you know that just applies to life like maybe you don't agree with
*  their thought process but you can at least understand it and then know what it is you do
*  and don't like know what your beliefs are you got to take a step outside of your beliefs to understand
*  if is that even what you believe or is it just the way you were raised and the way you grew up
*  like do you really believe these things have you ever taken a step outside of them or or listened
*  to somebody else's alternate perspective on what they believe and have an open mind to it like oh
*  you know that kind of makes sense a little bit it's hard because you don't get that many
*  conversations with people where you disagree with them and it's not confrontational usually
*  they're confrontational or you're confrontational so it always starts off on the bad foot i've
*  i've learned how to do it from doing this podcast and one of the most surprising things about doing
*  this podcast is i've learned how to talk to people better yeah i didn't think that was a thing i
*  thought i just just was talking to people but then i realized somewhere along the way way not only
*  people listening but sometimes i'm annoying okay how do i how do i do this where i'm less annoying
*  and in learning how to do things that are less annoying i've become a more compassionate
*  conversationalist i understand how to talk to people better and i've i've gotten it's i apply
*  it to my whole life now i've gotten better at it and i've seen people who are bad at it
*  it's so frustrating like i have some really smart friends and you know i'll talk to them and they
*  just fucking interrupt each other and they interrupt you and they don't let anybody talk
*  they're not listening they're just waiting for their time to talk and you know it's it's so
*  strange they're not able to ever consider other people's opinions they think that everyone but
*  them is wrong and it's you know it's basically like you know how it is when you see a youtube
*  video where people have no idea how to fight and you see them fight you know that thing that is so
*  crazy i've to this day i'm like i've been doing martial arts my whole life i don't want to fight
*  anybody but i see people fight they have no idea how to fight i'm like i imagine myself if i was
*  in a street fight with this guy i'm like this is i would be like why are you doing this man this is
*  you don't know what you're doing hey yeah hey you're crazy you're gonna get killed you're lucky
*  i'm nice but that's the same way with conversation there's a lot of people out there having
*  conversations have no idea how to talk they don't they're not even really listening to you yeah
*  they're just so and like why are you doing it why are you arguing you're you're in a conversation
*  you don't even know how to have one yeah you're not listening you're just talking you're just
*  using someone like a like a wall that you're throwing a fucking tennis ball off of it's bizarre
*  yeah yeah yeah well you had you had a good uh statement on this and then i think it was your
*  last special it was like you have two idiots in a room it's the more confident one that they listen
*  to yeah and it's that that concept of you just just say more words and you know have more opinions
*  and you don't have to think just be loud and make a lot of noise it's a game they're trying to like
*  checkmate you yeah instead of like having a communication and conversation they're trying
*  to like socially dominate you and this look i used to do it for sure yeah um i mean i think it's a
*  learned thing you know people do it to you and you go man i got fucking kicked my ass in that
*  conversation i'm gonna get better at kicking people's ass and then you get better at sort of
*  bulldozing people or talking over them or talking loud or having these uh like these sentences that
*  maybe you could pull out of your ass every now and then to shut people down it sounds good and
*  it becomes a sport yeah instead of what it really should be this is sharing ideas and communicating
*  with people like i mean if you're really into the sport of just debating people and shutting
*  people down and insulting people okay that good for you but people don't like listening to that
*  that much yeah what people like listening to for what i've from my experience is someone
*  actually talking to someone someone actually expressing their thoughts and then the other
*  person considering their thoughts and either agreeing or disagreeing but people are so happy
*  when you could do that without real conflict yeah you know i've had some people on that i
*  just five years ago i would have i would just said you fucking moron i would have screamed at them
*  what are you talking about you're an idiot you can go fuck yourself jump off a bridge but instead of
*  doing that i'd be like okay why do you think that and tell me tell me what about this and then and
*  here's what i think let me tell you what i think yeah you tell me what you think yeah and this is
*  why i was able to do that in a non like snarky way yeah oh yeah you think that yeah tell me more
*  but but yeah like like that's how you get the best out of people though that's how you understand who
*  they really are yeah and it's so valuable so valuable for me it's just for me i know it's
*  valuable for people that are listening but just for me as a human from my own education it's been
*  everything yeah everything i've learned more from talking to people on this podcast both from talking
*  to scholars and scientists and and really intelligent people and morons yeah you know i've
*  learned a lot from talking to morons just just the awkwardness in the way they process thoughts and
*  the way they view the world and the way they've chosen to communicate like you learn from that
*  just like you're saying like sparring with someone who's like doing has terrible habits yeah you go
*  oh look at this guy what the fuck are you doing man yeah but you learn you can learn from people
*  yeah well i think that's something that that really separates you from a lot of people i mean like
*  yeah there's shows where people are very opinionated and loud and you know people like that and that
*  kind of thing but your ability to communicate and to bring out conversation regardless of what the
*  subject matter is makes it very intriguing and you can learn a lot regardless of who the guest is
*  like you learn so much from these people because of the way you are able to communicate with them
*  the way you're able to bring out conversation and and get in depth with all of these subjects
*  well i'm genuinely curious about most things and i'm genuinely curious about the way i think
*  i'm like why do i think that way so if someone thinks different than me i'm genuinely curious
*  like why do you think there's an instinct to go nah you're fucking wrong i'm right but i i just go
*  i know what that is that's a trick don't do that that's that's dumb don't think that way just try
*  to find out this is not a game it's not a contest yeah find out why this person thinks this way
*  and it's better for everybody yeah but it's just a lost talent like a lot of people do and i didn't
*  even know it was a thing until i started doing podcasts it just took me a while like podcasts
*  like anything else for me at least as i'm doing it i'm trying to get better at it and i realized
*  i used to not be as good like i can't i never listen to my podcast but if i did listen to like
*  the old ones from the beginning i probably like yeah fucking terrible jesus christ yeah you know
*  plus most of them i was high out of my fucking mind i don't know half what i was talking about
*  while i was saying it i was ruining conversations left and right but these conversations for me are
*  like it's like going to school it's like every day i'm going to school about humans you know going
*  to school about whatever the subject they're talking to me about but also going to school about
*  how you know the more people you talk to especially like this no cell phones we're wearing headphones
*  and there's one of the reasons i like headphones is because your voice is in my ear yeah you're
*  not over there you're right here man you're we're locked in and this is exactly the same way that
*  other people are going to hear it which is a very unusual way to hear a conversation yeah you don't
*  think about it that way but most of the time when you hear a conversation your voice is louder
*  because it's closer and they're over there yeah and you're talking to each other and you know
*  maybe you check your phone or maybe you're distracted by other noises but when you're
*  wearing headphones you don't hear anything else yeah so you're locked in and when when else would
*  you and i and we're friends i've known you for years when will we ever sit down like this yeah
*  for hours just across from each other staring each other's eyes just talking yeah yeah i never
*  thought about that with the headphones big yeah that's interesting it keeps you from talking over
*  each other too much too because conversations are improvisational right you know you have a dance
*  partner you don't want to step on each other's toes but you do it occasionally it's just so you
*  get better at it and it's for more than two people it's mandatory like when you have three or four
*  people on a podcast you cannot do it without headphones or it's just talking over each other
*  like i learned that doing those fight companions oh yeah because everyone's drunk and then they
*  have the headphones on it's sort of at least comes some of the over talk you know yeah yeah
*  that makes sense yeah it's uh it's a journey man like everything else you know like everything
*  else it's a journey i mean if you're doing it right your relationships being a parent being a
*  comedian being a fighter being a doctor i'm sure you if you're concentrating on it you get better
*  at it yeah i'm sure yeah i think i think just the understanding of it's a constant balancing act
*  it's a constant development the sooner you come to terms and understand that the better off you're
*  going to be but we get we get locked into these ways of thinking these ways of living and so you're
*  that way till you die a lot of people are and and to constantly be questioning yourself and to be
*  searching i feel like i'm a seeker i'm seeking um different ways to do things different ways to think
*  different perspectives on situations but particular ones i might be like stuck on like this is the way
*  i think this is what i believe like i want to explore what my beliefs and feelings and
*  viewpoints are um on everything yeah i think that is how you gain a better understanding of
*  what this thing is what this thing we're experiencing is yeah which nobody knows what
*  the hell it is nobody knows what it is yeah i just got i mean i'm there's some scientists that are
*  they they're trying to they've written a book about it but they're trying to come on the podcast
*  to lay out all of the reasons why this is a simulation yeah and i'm going over some of their
*  work and i'm like this is fucking so crazy yeah because if if they're right like what are we
*  doing yeah are we playing a video game yeah if they're right we are maybe we are and then
*  there's the thought that maybe that is what life is period and that this idea of like oh one day
*  we're going to create an artificial environment that we exist in that's going to be indistinguishable
*  from the real world that we exist in now maybe it's always that yeah maybe it's been that from
*  the beginning and evolution is actually a part of this long game and that this cycling of life
*  and life and death and all these things is just a part of this insanely long progressive game
*  yeah yeah blow blow your mind up and the more you think about it and you know who can say that
*  that's not the case yeah you know nobody nobody can no you can't you can't and the more you think
*  about it you might like check out of reality to a degree so it's it's a it's a scary thing i'm also
*  genuinely curious as to other people's perspectives like there's sometimes a i you know i love reading
*  people's uh takes on current events takes on people and takes on like movies and music and all
*  because i i disagree with so many of them and i i go what how is this person viewing the world
*  like i would like to be them for a short period of time if i knew for a fact i can come back and
*  be me again i want to see what are you seeing like how do you are you in pain all the time
*  like are you just what why are you mad at stuff like like what is it you know like is it an
*  emotional thing or is your mind just wired different look we're all assuming right that water tastes
*  the same to you as it does to me and that like the sunshine feels everybody knows sunshine feels good
*  but does it feel the same i don't know what your sunshine feels like right yeah you know i think
*  about that a lot um one thought i have is like this is white we both say it's white but maybe this
*  looks completely different to you maybe this white looks yellow yellow yeah we call it the same thing
*  because we're we agree and that's like so much of reality is just something we all agree upon
*  until we don't until we change our minds but there's so many people that see and feel and
*  think very different things and we look at them as crazy because the majority of us say that's
*  not the way we see or sure but all anything is is an agreeance upon what this thing is and
*  is that is that what makes things real that we agree that it's real
*  i don't know that's a trail either well i mean think about other things that people have tastes
*  for like food for example there's people that enjoy certain flavors like spicy foods for example
*  and there's other people that fucking hate it my wife's mom she can't have anything with any pepper
*  or anything anything even remotely hot oh it's too hot like not everything is too hot and i can't
*  make things hot enough i'm pouring hot sauce on everything like what is she feeling like what is
*  like i wonder if she had my taste buds like what is it what am i experiencing different than her
*  what you know people that love certain kinds of music there's people i've tried so hard to like
*  jazz because it seems like a cool thing to like like it seems like you you're must be a cool guy
*  if you like jazz like my good friend alonzo boden hilarious comedian loves jazz goes on jazz cruises
*  does stand up on these cruises i try man i try listen to it i get some of it it's kind of cool
*  but if i had to choose between jazz and other music i'm like get the fuck out if it was one
*  music that i could just wipe off the face of the planet i don't know probably would be like dumb
*  country songs but outside of dumb country songs i just i don't know what they're experiencing like
*  what is it about it that's resonating why do some people go bonkers for some movies and other people
*  think they suck yeah like what is it yeah one thing that always trips me out is i think about
*  like people we view as lunatics and like what if they are seeing reality and we have blinders on
*  you know because when you take into account what a finite percentage of what's really out there that
*  we're able to see with our perception and you know compared to like x-rays and gamma rays and all of
*  these things like we have such a tiny filter on everything that's really going on out there
*  we don't really see we don't see shit compared to what's really there and like maybe these whacked
*  out people are just seeing more of what's happening and that's what makes them nuts because they're
*  like you're not seeing all these demons falling around and all these colors and like we just have
*  we have a filter on that so we can like process information where like and it keeps us sane but
*  that's i mean what's really going on out there well you think about how small amount of acid
*  you need to take to completely perturb the way you view the world yeah you know i think mckenna
*  described this Terrence McKenna described acid that the potency of acid is like it's literally
*  like for in terms of like the amount that you need in order to have an effect he made an analogy like
*  an ant deconstructing the entire empire state building in a matter of seconds like that's
*  how potent it is in terms of volume you don't need a couple drops of acid in a huge human body
*  and you're tripping balls for seven hours you know that's a chemical disruption of this very
*  delicate ecosystem so if your neurochemistry is off in any way up or down sideways screwy you
*  got too much of this or too much of that which we know is the case with everything right like
*  some people are born with bad eyesight some people are born deaf some people are born and
*  they have problems processing pain they don't feel pain correctly some people are born and they must
*  have an imbalance of the chemicals that are floating around inside your head yeah and their
*  view of the world is radically different than ours yeah and also those chemicals can shift depending
*  on for your personal experience like life abuse children that are abused their chemicals in their
*  head as they're developing are off they're different their brains are different they process
*  life different because of abuse people that have experienced extremes trauma extreme violence when
*  they're young ptsd they're processing things differently than people that have not yeah what's
*  even crazier about that is i read a book called it didn't start with you and it talks about how
*  these things are passed on generationally from like trauma your grandparents had is passed on to you
*  through your dna and it and it and it changes us like how much is passed on to us that we have no
*  control over that alters our the way we feel things the way we see things all of these
*  experiences that people have that that that just get passed passed down like that without any
*  outside influence just just through that process of being do you have any children
*  no when you have children you see it in a really weird way like um my middle daughter my 11 year
*  old is uh an obsessive like she she's obsesses on things and tries to get better at them or you
*  gotta try to tell hey time to go to bed she's doing like backflips in her room and shit like stop
*  stop go to bed like you gotta go to bed but that's me like and i always thought i was
*  fucked up i was like i thought i was doing this and i probably was my whole life to try to show
*  that i had value because i felt like i was ignored and i didn't know my dad and i was felt like an
*  outsider and a loser and i always felt like i would become i would throw myself into things to
*  show that i had value and i would get really good at things to show that i had value and that would
*  be this obsession was like me trying like trying to escape the existential angst of my existence
*  and just the the constant anxiety and this just feeling of just inadequacy trying to escape it by
*  being obsessed with things but also trying to prove through getting good at things that i have
*  value because the first time i ever felt like i was worth anything was when i started getting
*  good at martial arts like and then people started respecting me i was like oh i have a thing that
*  people think i'm good at now that i'm good at this thing that became my identity and i just
*  threw myself into that but my daughter's growing up with none of that like she's all loved and she's
*  all smiling and happy and she's not depressed she gets a lot of hugs and she has friends but
*  she's a fucking psycho and i'm like oh you got that for me like you got my crazy gene but you
*  got it without all the fucked up parts right like you're not sad you got it without the sad thing
*  you just want to get good at stuff without like a happiness to it and also a feminine happiness to
*  it instead of a masculine like a great i just wanted to smash that's all i wanted to do i just
*  want to smash things because i was angry she's not angry so it's weird to see this obsessive
*  like completely obsessive behavior in terms of like trying to get better at things and she
*  accelerates it she excels at so many different things that she gets good at yeah she gets good
*  at things and they become her whole life like all day long obsessive like it's really weird but in a
*  happy way and it's so it's it's strange genetically yeah you know and you know you've met my dog
*  marshall the fucking nicest dog in the world right he's so nice now that's a genetic thing
*  that dog is a golden retriever and when he like when you come over to him and he starts one he's
*  so happy and he wants to get pet and he runs and grabs a toy always he always wants to bring you
*  something like i didn't teach him that yeah i found him for three years i found him since he was a
*  little tiny baby he was like six weeks old when i got him never had a rough day in his life every
*  day's been fun but he's learned through his dna that he's supposed to retrieve things and bring
*  them over and that you are happier when he brings things over because that's the dna that's in his
*  system it's not he didn't learn it yeah this is literally inside of him from the box like right
*  out of the box look at the ingredients oh he likes to bring you things yeah because his ancestors
*  brought you things his ancestors brought other people things and they were rewarded for it and
*  they said oh they give me treats and they like me more when i bring things so i'm gonna just keep
*  when you know you shoot a duck out of the sky and they get that duck and bring it over and everybody
*  gets happy so it's in him yeah it's crazy i don't think we understand what what dna actually is or
*  whatever fuck you dna is just a name right what are the components of the life form that are
*  passed when two life forms breed and they make another one i don't think we really understand it
*  i think we we have a rudimentary understanding of the chemistry involved but in terms of like
*  personality and in terms of like the thoughts that are in our heads like i was reading something by
*  uh rubert sheldrake and he's talking about why uh children are afraid of monsters he's like children
*  that grow up in the city are afraid of monsters they're not afraid of like uh gunshots and car
*  accidents things that are really scary they're afraid of monsters because our ancient ancestors
*  were eaten by cats yeah they were eaten and by wolves and those kind of things so we're
*  we're afraid of fangs and things in the dark when you can't see them come and you can't protect
*  yourself yeah crazy crazy it's in there it's in the dna yeah i mean there's so much there's so
*  much stuff like that that just we don't understand anything have you ever met someone that has like a
*  legit phobia like a phideophobia or arachnophobia like fear of snakes or spiders i know that i have
*  i'm trying to think i don't know who that was but yeah it's like where did that come from it's dna
*  man guarantee i've seen it on fear factor we had a few people that had a legit fear of snakes and
*  spiders they're like oh my god oh my god you see their whole body was shaking and they were trying
*  like hey this aren't even fucking poisonous yeah these are just snakes but there's something about
*  snakes like someone they love or they're someone in their ancestry or some someone survived a snake
*  attack something yeah there's something yeah well i can like so much of that is is realizing how
*  little like control we have over everything like how we raise our children or how we interact with
*  people and like what does and doesn't affect us and like the fact that any of this works in any
*  remote way is insanity yeah like it doesn't make any sense we think it makes sense because it's
*  normal to us but it would really take a step back and like think about it like this is nuts
*  everything is nuts this life is nuts and you know like sitting here with you is nuts
*  like you're talking about like like some of the people you've met through this and like you're
*  like how did i get here and like what is this like yeah i feel that way too like what the fuck is
*  going on like what did i do to get here like this is weird what did i do to get here yeah i think i
*  really believe in some strange way that this thing made me do this yeah that this podcast like almost
*  like the universe made me do this yeah and it sounds like so pretentious but i'm just being
*  honest i feel like almost like this thing has a life of its own and a mind of its own and it
*  tricked me yeah it tricked me and and it played on my obsessive mind just keep doing it keep doing
*  it maybe you get better at this hey keep doing it bring on other people keep doing it keep doing it
*  and through this untold millions of people have been exposed to all these different we've had three
*  billion downloads over the course of 10 years so i don't know how many people that is how many
*  individuals but it's a fuckload so all of these different people have come on and expressed all
*  these different ideas and so many different people are hearing them in their earbuds whether in
*  traffic or when they're at the gym and all these ideas percolate inside people's brains and then
*  it gives them different perspectives and then it makes them maybe explore things maybe i'm gonna
*  try jujitsu maybe i'll try yoga maybe i'm gonna try eating better maybe i'm gonna try doing this
*  and through all that you see a shift in the culture of the human beings that have been in
*  that have been affected by all these people's conversations yeah and for me it feels like i
*  i'm getting sucked into being here yeah like i'm like okay and then also like me getting better at
*  it is just me it's like it showing me how to extract better information get out of my fucking
*  way don't ruin it and make it better for the people that are listening yeah it's really what
*  it feels like i know it's crazy it's even saying it sounds like hippie bullshit well and you think
*  about like why are we attracted to certain things certain people certain sometimes we're attracted
*  to people that doesn't make any fucking sense be like everything you do and say and make me feel is
*  like everything opposite of what i really want and but but i'm attracted to you and like these
*  things like like bring a certain thing out of me yeah develop me in a certain way where nobody else
*  could do that like you this person does that for me for some reason or this action this sport this
*  thing like why am i drawn right right right like i shouldn't be like it's fucking horrible and like
*  it hurts and like all these all these things that doesn't make any sense at all but nothing makes
*  any sense at all and like it doesn't make any sense and like that i think that's why it's so
*  vital to follow your heart and follow the things you feel because everything else like nobody knows
*  what the fuck is going on like nobody can tell you what you should do shouldn't do to be successful
*  or to be happy or to be all these things like you've got to listen to what's inside of you
*  yeah i mean you could be wrong you could listen to what inside inside of you and you could be
*  wrong but you have to learn how to like decipher that voice better yeah like i've been wrong about
*  things that i thought i wanted and then and then you go okay this is why i was wrong i was delusional
*  or i was kidding myself or fixated on the wrong thing yeah or i was thinking that this thing was
*  going to bring me some sort of peace so it's going to bring me some sort of uh some sort of
*  just normalcy yeah you know and then it doesn't happen so you're all right well guess there is no
*  normalcy nothing is normal everything's crazy we're all nuts yeah nobody knows what's going on all
*  those things that should be a t-shirt yeah nothing is normal everything is crazy no one knows what's
*  going on at all the sooner we realize that the better would be like we're all in the loony loony
*  yeah it will definitely be easier that's why i'm i'm always scared of drugs that make people
*  confident my favorite drug is marijuana because it does the opposite of making me confident
*  it makes me paranoid it makes me it makes me compassionate and it makes me also like going
*  jeez this is crazy like that's why i like it yeah i like it because i think the drugs that make you
*  can like we should all be a little less confident yeah you know we we need each other a lot more
*  than we like to pretend and this life is like this temporary thing that we're going through
*  we have a certain amount of heartbeats and uh then who knows the lights go out and hopefully
*  we go to a better place but yeah well i think the thing it does too is it strips that that veil away
*  like that veil of uh feeling like everything's in balance and normal and you know life is like
*  this is life like life is fucking weird man weird super weird super weird we distract ourselves with
*  normalcy and habits but take a step back and like this is nuts this is all nuts and we pretend like
*  it's normal and it's cool and everyone's like in agree and said like we all know what's going on
*  i don't know what the fuck's going on we're all living in a spaceship flying through the atmosphere
*  yeah we're all tripping balls over here we're just all doing it so it feels normal
*  but we can find some moments of comfort and happiness in the chaos and that's what we're
*  all seeking yeah you know we're all seeking these moments of comfort and happiness and camaraderie
*  and and friendship you know we're all seeking love too we're all seeking the good feelings
*  yeah but you got to get through the shitty ones to even appreciate the good feelings it's a catch
*  22 yeah yeah but just understand that you need you need the good and the bad yeah you don't
*  know what good is unless you have bad yeah it has to be that way so we're getting towards three
*  o'clock here we're almost going to wrap this thing up um what are you uh doing now in terms
*  of your career you're still fighting for bellator yeah yeah so bellator kickboxing which i'm very
*  i'm very thankful that they have that still um yeah yeah i'm you know i'm a gigantic fan of
*  kickboxing in muay thai and it's always perplexed me why it hasn't caught hold in america more than
*  it has yeah which is something we could talk about for hours yeah i'm very thankful that
*  paramount network is still invested yeah huge shout out to scott koker is one of the scott koker
*  amazing uh there is and uh they got that big fight this weekend with julie budd and cyborg
*  uh which is cool um but yeah i'm still fighting for them i don't have anything on the books right
*  now i'm waiting like i always have been since the beginning of time um you know something you think
*  is going to change like eventually i'm gonna have all these fights lined up and
*  i've never known when the next one is and certainly not when the next one is after that but um
*  yeah i'm hoping something will come up and you know as far as how long i'm gonna keep doing this
*  i don't know man i could be done today maybe i'll decide i don't want to fucking do this shit anymore
*  but um i think i've always had a healthy understanding of that like fighting is what i
*  do and i will always be a fighter but this isn't it for me like i have so many things that i do in
*  my life you know i'm i'm a writer like i said i'm working on my autobiography right now i've
*  written two books so far i'm an artist i paint i draw play the piano a little bit um i speak
*  you know i'm i'm a renaissance man do you think you'll be more invested in art when you're done
*  i don't know you know i think um i'll definitely have more time to do it you know as far as how
*  much i'll do it as a career i don't know you know for me art has always been something that
*  i do it because i love to do it if it starts becoming a job where it's like you need to do
*  this or you need to do that i think that would make me lose a lot of love for it yeah you know
*  like most things yeah so but i think you can get through that without it becoming a job i think
*  that's a perspective because at the end of the day it's still art yes like just because you have to
*  do it for a job like like what does that mean just do it yeah you know what i mean like if you think
*  oh i have to do art now now it's a job it's like you know the the expression marrying your mistress
*  well i think you can just do art yeah you know you just be obsessed with it like you are
*  if it's not a job yeah and then the other parts just sort of take care of itself yeah well like
*  everything i do i feel is artistic expressions you know my fighting my actual art sure my writings
*  and those kinds of things but uh i don't think i'll ever be like have be stuck on a job or one thing
*  you know because there's i'm just too interested in too many different things you know i think i'll
*  always be balancing many different aspects and certain times i'll be more focused on one thing
*  like my fighting obviously that's a very finite timeline on that but once that's done you know
*  it's going to shift and i think it will always be that way to to one extent or another i will be
*  always be doing a multitude of things and exploring and developing and learning and um yeah
*  like i said i'm a seeker i love it well when you're done and you want to do something else come
*  back in here and talk to us and tell us what's up i would love to man this has been really great my
*  pleasure brother always i appreciate you man thank you now i appreciate kevin ross ladies and
*  gentlemen thank you goodbye that was great thank you
