# Joe Rogan Experience #2139 - Akaash Singh
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGBzg1xVtUM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  So Jamie, I'm sending you these things right now. You want to feel like a lazy piece of shit?
*  Uh, yep.
*  This is what me and Ari were sending each other last night. This is all the Phish concert at the Sphere.
*  Oh, Phish is a fascinating thing.
*  Dude, the Sphere in Vegas, that giant globe, the whole ceiling is all LCD or LED. What kind of screen is it?
*  L-E-D? Whatever the best shit is. It's like a billion dollar building.
*  But the screens on the ceiling, so Phish utilizes these for all these crazy trippy psychedelic images.
*  And so while the show was going on, people were just like, WAAAAAAA!
*  It's like the greatest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. Look at this. That's the ceiling.
*  Awesome.
*  That's the ceiling.
*  Oh, that's great.
*  Doing crews and then going to that show? What a party.
*  I mean, they're doing a residency, so I guess they're doing six Sphere shows.
*  Check out some of the other ones I sent you, Jamie, because I sent you quite a few. They're all different.
*  One of them is a dog. A dog is like licking. Like licking the screen.
*  I need to see this. I did not know how big Phish was. I didn't know it was big at all.
*  But they have such a massive cult following.
*  They do.
*  They sell out everywhere.
*  Yeah, it's like the dead. It's basically the same. It's like a new generation of the Grateful Dead.
*  And growing up, I was aware of the Grateful Dead. Phish, I was doing a show in Atlantic City, and then the guy that was booking it was like,
*  I don't know, man, it's tough. Phish is here this weekend. The whole city. And I was like, what? Phish?
*  P, the one with the phish? P-H? Phish?
*  And he was like, yeah, they're huge. And then people follow them.
*  I had a buddy of mine, his girlfriend was really into Phish. I just didn't get it.
*  Yeah, I've never heard a single song.
*  I was like, what are you talking about? Like, what's the big deal? Like, look at this one.
*  Holy shit.
*  Isn't this insane?
*  That's awesome.
*  It's insane.
*  Now, even hearing this in the headphones, that feels awesome. And looking on this screen.
*  Yeah. And apparently there's not a bad seat in the house.
*  And one of the guys from Phish was doing an interview about it. And he was saying essentially like every seat is incredible because every seat you see the sky and you see this.
*  You see fireworks. And it's just fucking amazing.
*  This is awesome.
*  So they're doing a UFC there in September. And I have no... Look at the dog.
*  Oh, that's so sick, dude. That's so sick.
*  Isn't that amazing?
*  Yeah. What's going to be on the screen of UFC 100 is Max Holloway is knocking you out with two seconds left in the fight.
*  One second.
*  Yeah, one second.
*  Yeah, it's going to be all kinds of shit. I mean, they're essentially planning for that different than they've ever planned for any other event.
*  Dana told me they've already spent $9 million preparing for September's event.
*  That's so sick. So tickets are going to be nuts for that.
*  It's going to be nuts. Yeah, it's going to be a nutty event. I don't think they're going to do more than one of them.
*  I think they're only going to do one because the idea is like it's so expensive to do and there's so much involved in preparing for it.
*  But it's an investment. So you're going to get it back.
*  Has anybody written a book on Dana building the UFC? You would know. I would not. I'm very much casual.
*  I remember being like 13 seeing the UFC commercials and it didn't it seemed like this fringe thing.
*  And now it's this massive mainstream thing. And I don't want to give all the credit to one person, but it seems like he's the one.
*  A lot of it. A lot of it goes to him. Yeah, it wasn't for him. Yeah, it just wouldn't be the same thing.
*  You have to have a maniac rather than that organization. Yeah, he's a maniac, but a genius mania. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  He's literally born for that job. Yeah, it's perfect. He's the perfect guy for that job.
*  My cameraman was telling me this morning, Kevin, shout out to Kevin, he films and edits all my stuff, but he's a big UFC fan.
*  He said Dana put out like a three minute video after UFC 300 of a bunch of people criticizing the fight card on UFC 300.
*  And I was like, dude, that's the thing that you need that.
*  Michael Jordan has that thing. Dana White has that thing. Dave Portnoy has that thing where it's like, I remember everybody that ever insulted me.
*  Fuck you. No matter how famous I get. Fuck you. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have that. I don't either.
*  I keep moving. I don't like that kind of stress in my life. I don't like dwelling on things.
*  I don't like creating additional conflict. Maybe I did when I was younger, but that shit doesn't seem appealing to me at all.
*  How do you let go? If you had it when you were younger, how did you let go of it?
*  I just realized it wasn't helping me. Yeah. The same way I let go being jealous of people.
*  I would be jealous of other comedians like if they were killing it. Yeah. I would be like, oh, I hope he bombs. Yeah.
*  This is when I was 21, I felt this. That's very young for that. And I saw it. I was like, God, what a weak thought. Yeah. I was embarrassed.
*  Yeah. I remember being 27 and just being so angry. And I haven't let go of all of it by any stretch.
*  But being like, I don't like me being like this. Yeah. And then I realized all my hate of other people is rooted in me worrying I'm not going to make it or worrying I'm not funny enough.
*  And then you get kind of like, that's embarrassing. So let's try to move away from that. Yeah.
*  Especially with comedy and something that you can actually improve on. It's really stupid. Yeah. Or even martial arts, something you can improve on.
*  I get it with girls because they get it with looks. Yeah. Like looks. Oh, they're saying, OK. No, looks is a fucking terrible.
*  What a crazy crap shoot. Yeah. You could just get two sixes. Yeah. Or you get two ones. Yeah.
*  And there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. You just got fucked by genetics.
*  And it's because men don't give a fuck about your personality. They barely care. Yeah. It's as long as you're nice enough. Yeah. You're nice and smiley and friendly.
*  Be there. Don't stop the fun. People are like, she's great. Yeah. Yeah. She's awesome. She was quiet. Like we're such losers, dude.
*  She was like not interrupting me when I was talking. She's awesome. Yeah, dude. It's all genetics. Yeah. It's all just we're looking for those features. Yeah.
*  We're looking for symmetry and all kinds of different things. And it's just the world is a rough place if it's just a looks thing. Yeah.
*  But if it's a performance thing, goddamn it, it's the opposite. Like you should be excited by someone who's better than you. Yeah.
*  Because that gives you something to strive for. And it also gives you fuel. Yeah, absolutely. And I've said this publicly, I think on another on True Geordie's podcast, but watching Andrew blow up, there's times where I'm insecure.
*  I'm like, oh, am I going to get there? But then watching him handle all of it, I'm like, oh, that is such a blessing to be able to watch him handle everything. So if and when I get to that position, this is how you handle it. I've seen it done before. Yes.
*  That's important. That's important to learn how to just be yourself. Stay yourself. Yeah. Stay yourself. Because the pressures are different. The world. It's like you step into a different atmosphere. Yeah. It's like a different environment.
*  It's like you're on a different planet. Yeah. The number of gravity is different as the number of eyeballs increase. Everything. Every feeling you have about these groups of people with an opinion you amplify as their numbers amplify. Yes.
*  So if you are hung up on other people's opinions and then you blow up, you're in real trouble because if you read all that stuff, you can go crazy. And we've all seen it. We've all seen guys who go crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Just like the pressure and the other people and the opinions and all that stuff, it cracks them. I remember when you came on Flaygrant, you were like, I'm sure there's stuff that's negative about me. I just don't read it. And then that actually helped me because I was like, oh, if Joe Rogan doesn't the most famous guy I know doesn't read the comments.
*  I thought there was like something weak and you needed to like train yourself to get used to negative. It was like a really stupid thought. But it's like that you could just not do it. And then those people aren't real in the real world. If you're a nice person, right? You want to have nice exchanges with people.
*  Like I'm a nice guy. I like to be friendly. I like meeting people and hugging them. I like I like fun times. Yeah, I don't like arguments. So if I'm engaging with people who are troubled mentally ill people that are just looking to shit on all the then you get all that energy in your head. Yeah, I wouldn't.
*  I wouldn't gravitate towards that energy in real life. Why would I gravitate towards that energy online? Yeah, this is not good for you. Yeah. So if you pretend that you don't care at all. Yeah. Well, now you're pretending. Okay, now you're not now you're not a human. Yeah, cuz all humans care about other people's opinions. Yeah, it's a part of why we all survived. You know why our tribes managed to move into cities and create agriculture and create civilization. Yeah, it's
*  it's you have to like each other you get along. It's part of the deal of being a human being. Right. And if you try to pretend I don't give a fuck. Okay. Yeah. Well, now you're lying. That's a coping mechanism. Now you're lying. You just got to be honest about who you what you are. You're a human being. And if you're a human being, you which what do you want? You want good interactions with people? My wife said a thing I was getting in my head a couple times that she says a thing. She's like, let me ask you a question. Have you ever gone to a content creators page and left a negative comment? And I was like, I don't think so. And I I love
*  hating on things. But going on to someone's page. And then she's like, now imagine doing it incessantly all day long. Those people have some level of mental illness that like their life is based around hating someone else. You can't take those people that seriously. And I was like, that's a valid point. They might dislike me. But that level is weird. Yeah, they're losers. It's a bandwidth issue. And I don't mean they're losers. Like they're never they can't be winners. I mean, like the what you're doing, you're engaging in loser behavior. I've engaged in loser behavior. Yeah, of course. I've been a loser. Right. Doesn't mean you're
*  a you are like this is a can. Yeah, you are a can. You never change. This is never going to be a plant. Right. You know, it is what it is. That's not what I mean. But I mean that if you're acting like a loser, if it walks like a duck, you're a fucking duck. You're a loser. Yeah. And if you're going on, you think Michael Jordan's leaving negative YouTube comments, you know, I'm saying like, like, people that are successful don't have time to try to take other people down for no reason. Unless you're Kat Williams. Yeah, but that's he's great at it, though. He's so good.
*  He's so good at it, though. If you're not that good at it, don't do it. But also, he's being accurate. Yeah. The thing about Kat is like you can't refute the things he's saying other than the book thing. There's no way he reads that many books. But 40 is impressive. It's not as fast as he said, but it's impressive.
*  Oh, it's five flat. He ran the 40 and like five flat. Have you seen that clip? Yes. Crazy. He's fast. Yeah, he's fast, man. And he's cool. He's fun. He's a fun dude. Hey, I have some loser behavior to apologize for before we get really. Yeah, yesterday I'm walking through Austin.
*  And I'm like, this city is great. Why did I get on Rogan the first time and shit all over Austin? What a fantastic city. I'm a loser. Sixty eight degrees on a Sunday. I'm walking around. There's trees. There's beautiful people. There's good food.
*  And I realized the only reason I hated it is because I would leave Texas when I moved to New York or L.A. And every hacky liberal would be like, oh, I hate Texas, but I like Austin.
*  And then I got insecure and some loser shit. Now, you know what? Fuck Austin, dude. Fucking vegans. They suck. This is great. If you go to certain parts of Austin, you will get annoyed. I was in East Austin a couple of months ago and I saw some fucking guy driving his Tesla with a mask on.
*  I literally wanted to yank him out of his car and break his neck. You fucking. You're a problem voting. I guarantee you. You're a problem. Oh, my God. You're the reason why there's no cash bail.
*  Dude, I saw a guy in 2022 in an elevator and he got mad at me for not having a mask on. I was like, buddy, it's over. It's over. He got mad at you. He was like, you're not wearing a mask. And then because New York had the whole mask thing for longer.
*  And so I guess. But to me, once it was, it's still going on in 2022 when you got in the elevator. I guess. Well, my wife, NYU, she got a master's at NYU and they made them take boosters, which I took the Vax. I'm fine with that. But boosters. I was like, I'm not doing it. If it's a cold, I'm not vaccinating. It's a cold. I'm not doing it.
*  And then they made them wear masks until I think middle of 2023. They had to wear masks, which is insane. There's no science, zero science. Yes. If you look at the science behind masking, there's actually legitimate science that breathing those dirty fucking masks with that bacteria inches from your mouth is bad. That's that's fair.
*  Yeah, because you're you're you're spitting in this thing. And then this thing is right in front of you. And it's also warm and moist. So it breeds bacteria like a surgeon wears masks to protect someone whose body is cut open. That makes sense. And then inside of them, he's not talking, having full conversations. He breathes in it for the surgery, takes it off. That's it. Another mask or whatever. And if you wear one of those tight fitting and 95 or whatever they call them, is that what it is? Yeah. And then you have a 95. If you wear one of those, like even that is you're getting air in. Okay. And you might be able to get air in.
*  And you must understand that the particles of whatever virus it is are smaller than the fucking holes that you're getting air through. You could vape through those things. You're seeing people vape through them. No. Yeah. Fucking vape goes everywhere. There's a doctor that was showing that early on. Yeah. He was a respiratory specialist. This is insane. And let me show you why it's insane. So it takes up, you know, one of those big juice box vapes that those dorks use. That's what they're doing.
*  I would at least say sucking on a robot dick. So he takes this big puff and then blows right through like one of them surgical masks. Wow. Okay. So the COVID particles are smaller than the vape particles. Yeah. It's nonsense. But it made people feel better. I wore them in the beginning because, you know, it's like you don't want to be an asshole. Everybody's scared. You don't want people upset. Oh, there's no mask. Yeah. And I got to early on. I'm with you. I was I get it. We didn't know what the fuck this was. We didn't know how to control it. So this is what we feel when we
*  need to do. And then as more info started coming out, we should start to get less hysterical about it because there's more info on it. And it felt like in New York, we didn't. I thought some places went so far. The other way was a little nuts, but it was more fun.
*  Liberals. Yeah, liberals. And this is coming from someone who's been mostly a liberal their whole life with most issues. I'm liberal about pretty much everything until it gets to like border and guns. And then I'm like, I, I know violence. I understand reality. Right. And this crime is real. It's a real thing. Yeah. Like this idea that you shouldn't be protected is fucking
*  nuts, especially when you're defunding the police. You fucking idiot. Yeah, that was crazy. Yeah, that was crazy. Yeah. You know what? I have a bit in the special where I talk about just like the marketing of it, like defund the police. I don't when you when I talk to liberal people about what that means, they would be like, yeah, you know, I just want to like specialize the police force and have less like have deescalation measures first, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, well, that's a specialized police is a lot better than defund the police. You maniac. Yeah. Well, what terrible marketing to do is train the police better and make improve the police.
*  And give those folks mushrooms every now and again to let them cleanse. You because of you, I started smoking weed a little bit. It's great. I gotcha. You got you on that podcast that day. You got me on the podcast that day. And buddy, let me tell you shrooms even better. Yes. I'm so glad I waited till I was 37 to do any of this. I don't think I could have handled it. That's smart. That's actually true.
*  Shrooms are the best. All when you were showing me that fish thing, all I was thinking about is I'm going to get shrooms tickets to a fish show. Sit there and lose my mind.
*  Ari Shaffir is trying to convince me to go to a makeup specialist and get like a prosthetic nose and chin. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got to put a wig on maybe. Maybe get a wig. Yeah. Not a blonde one. People know. Yeah. Maybe a redhead. Maybe a redhead. And it's some baggy clothes or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Something to hide the guns.
*  Well, I can't invite just my tattoos. If anybody identifies those, you have to if you're going to go to a fish concert, you have to just be one with the crowd. You can't do that if you're famous. Oh, interesting. You got to be able to sneak in and just just just take it in.
*  Wow. Dude, we could just run out this fear. Let's just do a god. Let's just do a concert, a private concert with fish for you and your friends. And I am obsessed with AI animation. I'm obsessed with it. I follow like 15 different people online now on Instagram. I just said, I'll come across my feed and I'll just find these these insane videos that they're creating like instantly with AI and they're beautiful. They're amazing. We made songs with AI.
*  I saw AI on the Patreon, one of the Patreon episodes and they're so good. So 20 seconds. 20 seconds. It's unbelievable. Have you seen the rap beefs that are happening where they think the songs are AI? Because they're so like, one guy said, I know this song isn't AI because how can AI take a breath in a song? And I was like, no, they can. It's AI. It's just going to get better and better. No, they um, they take breaths. They do all kinds of stuff. Now they mimic all the patterns of speech that they can record from all these different people. So they have act like if you have a date
*  like say if you and I are we've been on a bunch of podcasts. Yeah. So they could take us and have us say anything. Yeah. And it would be like weird pauses and clearing of the throat. It would be indistinguishable. What is your is this? Drake takes aim at Kendrick Lamar with AI Tupac and Snoop Dogg vocals on TaylorMade.
*  So Drake and Kendrick Lamar beefing. Drake wrote a beef and he did AI Snoop and AI Tupac talking about how disappointed they are in Kendrick Lamar. He wrote the raps and then the voices sound perfect. It's unbelievable. It's happening.
*  What is wrong with Kendrick Lamar?
*  They're just beef. This rap just it's competitive. They beef sometimes. I think Kendrick started this one and then it's just like who wants to be the best? And hip hop is rooted in this kind of like battle rap and like competitive spirit.
*  Well, hip hop is an interesting thing because I love hip hop, but I don't really love bragging. But I love hip hop bragging. Yeah, because it's performative. It's not you don't take it seriously.
*  Well, it's it's it's also you got to put yourself in like, like Jay Z in 99 problems, you know, where he's rapping about all you think about is cash money hoes. Like if you grew up with holes in your zap, you would, you know, that's the whole idea is like, if you come from nothing, and then all of a sudden you got diamonds and you're driving a fucking Lamborghini.
*  Yeah, absolutely. It's supposed to be a celebration of the fact that you made it and it's part of the bragging.
*  I remember when my parents had money, they had money, lost money, had money, lost money. But the last time they had money, I was like, who needs all this stuff? Then they lost money. I started comedy. I was broke as fuck. Whole family's not making money. And I was like, all I want to do is buy things when I get money. I'm buying everything. And then you buy a few things and you're like, I'm good. I got a nice place to live. I'm happy with my 2012 Honda Accord. We're good.
*  The thing about expensive stuff is if you can't afford it, the stress of that not being or barely being able to afford it and working for it is not nearly worth what you get out of the thing. The only time nice things are worth it is when they're kind of free. Meaning not that they're free, but that you don't feel it. Like if you went out and bought a new Mustang, you wouldn't even feel it. If you're rich. Like it's like, oh, I can enjoy this. This is fun. It's like it doesn't affect your life.
*  But if you make $60,000 a year and you go out and buy a new Mustang and then you look at those car payments and you look at your rent payment and then you look at your bills, you're like, fuck.
*  Like maybe I should take on like a little Uber thing on the side.
*  You know, that's my Mustang.
*  Yeah.
*  People wind up doing that to pay for a car, which is a great thing to do if you want to do it that way. But the additional stress like houses.
*  Like I always tell people this.
*  This is an important lesson that I learned when I was 27.
*  When I was 27 was the first time I ever had a nice apartment.
*  I moved to Hollywood.
*  I was on a television show and I got this place in North Hollywood and it had a loft and I had a pool table in my living room.
*  I'm like, this is amazing.
*  This is the dream.
*  And I was sitting down.
*  I didn't even have furniture yet.
*  And I was dating this girl and we were sitting down listening to seal, you know, that kiss.
*  And we're listening to it.
*  I had this dope ass fucking stereo that I've never had a stereo.
*  And then I mean, I'm a bullshit stereo, but I never had a real stereo with a big speakers.
*  Yeah.
*  And so we're listening to this.
*  This sound is like going all it's bouncing off the walls.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, this is incredible.
*  But then after a few months, I had this revelation.
*  I was like, oh, this is just home.
*  This is the same feeling I had in my shitty apartment in New York.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just home.
*  The high wears off.
*  Exactly.
*  My shitty apartment in New York.
*  I had a television and a bed.
*  That's all I had.
*  All I had is a television and a bed and a pool cue.
*  And then I had in the other room, I had a kitchen that I was fucking never in.
*  I just ate out every day.
*  Yeah.
*  Very rarely did I cook.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like, that was home.
*  So I'd go there from the road, do a gig, plot my bags down, sit on the couch, turn on MTV.
*  I'm home.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the same feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  The exact same feeling.
*  But if you've got to bust your ass and really kill yourself for the same feeling, it's not worth it, kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Your home feels like your home, no matter if it's a $50 million mansion or a fucking condo that you're paying $600 a month on.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the same thing.
*  My wife is big on the thing where if you can't afford it twice, you can't afford it once.
*  That's smart.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's, I'm very financially, I think just by product of being a comedian and like you risk everything.
*  I don't have any risk aversion at all.
*  My wife is a little more risk averse.
*  So like if I want to buy a nice watch, I'm a little bit into watches now.
*  She's like, can you buy that twice?
*  I'm cool with you buying it.
*  Just make me feel better.
*  Can you buy it twice?
*  Right.
*  That's it.
*  That's all I want to know.
*  Can you buy, the watch thing's a thing.
*  That's what the dudes get into.
*  And the bitches are just expensive.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you get into watches that people don't know are expensive, but they are expensive.
*  That's what I love now.
*  Because walking around New York, I don't want to, I'm a very robbable guy.
*  So walking around New York, I want something that's nice.
*  And you're like, all right, fair enough.
*  I don't think that's that nice of a watch.
*  I'll let them walk.
*  Yeah.
*  That's my jam now.
*  You got to think like that if you're in certain spots.
*  Yeah.
*  Has New York gotten that bad?
*  So apparently I looked this up because Alex like keeps up with this stuff.
*  Alex on the podcast and he was saying crime is down.
*  So I looked it up.
*  Murder is down like 15% from a year ago.
*  Rape is down like 4%.
*  I think assault might be up, but yeah, you do feel.
*  There's a problem though, underreporting.
*  And one of the problems with under when there's no police presence and like
*  that's a thing in L.A.
*  right now, robberies are so common.
*  It's so bad.
*  The mayor of L.A.'s house got broken into.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The L.A. mayor pulled that up.
*  It just happened.
*  Wow.
*  Just happened yesterday.
*  They're so fucking common and cops aren't coming for anything that a lot of shit
*  goes underreported because if you call it in and no one does anything, no one cares.
*  Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass safe after suspect breaks into her official residence.
*  That's crazy.
*  I like how she has an official residence is also wild.
*  Yeah.
*  What's the unofficial?
*  Her and her family were not harmed when a suspect gained entry.
*  I like how I said that gained entry.
*  He gained access.
*  He broke into your fucking house.
*  The Getty house, the L.A.
*  mayor's official residence on Irving Boulevard around 640 a.m.
*  this morning.
*  First of all, that's ridiculous that you have a place where everybody knows you're
*  going to be because it's the mayor house.
*  Yeah.
*  And you've got to stay in the mayor.
*  Yeah, but it's no one should get in.
*  We all know where the president's stand.
*  Yeah, we're not getting in.
*  I hung out with the governor when I first moved to Texas.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And the governor lives in the governor's mansion.
*  And so you got to go to the governor's mansion.
*  You go through all the security.
*  They're frisking you taking stuff out of your pockets.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Cops and I'm like, how crazy is it that you're staying in this spot where everybody
*  knows where you are?
*  And then while I was hanging out with them, a drone flew over the balcony.
*  It turned out it was the fire department.
*  They were doing something drones.
*  So they they scan for fires and shit.
*  And I don't know what they do.
*  But I was like, this is crazy.
*  Do you deal with this all the time as a drone in front of your fucking house?
*  Yeah, I get a shock.
*  I remember watching a presidential debate.
*  It was Obama and Romney, I think.
*  And then we're at the Village Lantern where we came up.
*  And then my boy, Michael Bloustein points to the TV and he goes, why would anyone
*  want this? And I was like, yeah, that's a good point.
*  All that to leave my house.
*  Yeah. So it's drones flying over my house, a level of scrutiny.
*  Any time I say, oh, people are jumping off.
*  Remember, they were jumping on Barack because he said, oh, a lot.
*  They're just all over him.
*  It's like, dog, can I live?
*  Imagine that now.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's rough.
*  I got hairy legs.
*  It's I it's so rough to watch.
*  It's so rough to watch.
*  Imagine if Obama came along and ummed and people complained about that.
*  Wait a minute. How are you not complaining about this guy?
*  That's true. This is ridiculous.
*  Do you want I heard you say I think Michelle should run.
*  She could win. She could win, I think.
*  I think I think if she won, I think if she ran, she could win.
*  Yeah, I think I don't think she wants that, though.
*  No, I don't think she wants that in her life, which is bullshit
*  that they dealt with over the eight years with there when he was president.
*  Yeah. Fuck all that.
*  Fuck that job for anybody that, you know, that like really would really, really good at it.
*  Yeah, I trust the person who doesn't want the job.
*  I'm the person who wants the job.
*  For sure. You have to be like real desperate to change the world.
*  Yeah. And and be a good person and actual good candidate
*  to understand that they're going to come for you.
*  Yeah. Like the way they're coming for Trump right now.
*  Yeah. This thing that they're doing right now with the criminal trial
*  for the hush money payment, this is essentially the way it is.
*  It's like he incorrectly labeled a payment on.
*  It's like a ledger thing.
*  It's not even like it's illegal to pay someone to shut up.
*  The whole thing is it's like how he recorded what that payment was for.
*  I don't know enough about the trial to know.
*  I don't. But I think what a casual observer like myself would say is,
*  oh, this seems like a witch hunt.
*  And I don't think if your strategy is to make Trump not win an election,
*  I think that only emboldens his support.
*  People who are on the fence might be like, oh, they really are trying to get this guy.
*  He's right when he says all this stuff.
*  They're definitely trying to get him.
*  But if you look at what's going on in New York crime wise, look at the the bail situation,
*  like those two guys that beat up the cops, the illegal immigrants that beat up the cops.
*  I didn't even know about this.
*  They let him out right away.
*  And the dude was like to pocket the camera and shit.
*  I just got out.
*  I was kind of fired to be honest.
*  There's a young guy who walked here from Guatemala.
*  He's like, fuck you. I just beat up your cop.
*  That guy is Scarface.
*  We watched a movie about that guy in the 70s and loved him.
*  Yeah. And you are never going to get that guy out of here now.
*  Yeah. Even if you beat up a cop, like you're not even deporting him.
*  You're just letting him right back on the street.
*  And then how are you tracking him?
*  You're not tracking him. Are you tracking him?
*  No, you're not tracking him. There's no resources.
*  There's no fucking money for any. Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  South Park had a really good take on illegal immigration like 15 years ago,
*  which was like the liberals are all just like, let him in, let him in, let him in.
*  A conservative is like, don't let any in.
*  And nobody's like, hey, maybe we could also just try to help them out in their country
*  so they don't need to sneak in.
*  Yeah. And that's probably a great way to do aid.
*  The problem with that is then you don't get the cheap labor that you need to make cars for like ten dollars.
*  That's very true. That's very true.
*  My parents owned a restaurant that failed.
*  But if you think we were hiring legal people, that's crazy.
*  No chance we would have closed even faster.
*  That's the thing about L.A.
*  They just switched it to twenty dollars an hour for minimum wage.
*  There's no way you can afford that.
*  Businesses are just going to close up shop.
*  They're going to kill the economy or just keep hiring illegals.
*  It's going to be one of those.
*  You can't do it because they have to get paid a certain amount.
*  Even the illegals do. Really?
*  Unless you're paying them under the table.
*  If you're running McDonald's, you can't pay people under the table.
*  They'll get you.
*  Well, they're also just going to do the self-checkout and just eliminate workforce wherever they can.
*  That's what's going to happen.
*  It's going to be an AI thing.
*  It's going to be self-checked.
*  They already have a thing here.
*  There's a water burger that's like a digital water burger.
*  You order it on your app and then you pull up to a kiosk.
*  It just fucking comes out.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  Yeah. We're all going to get used to it.
*  The self-checkout doesn't seem weird anymore.
*  Not at all.
*  Remember Bill Burr's bit like 12 years ago where he's just like, I'm just stealing it.
*  Now we're all like, no, we'll just pay for it.
*  I'll sit and they'll have a tip at the end at the airport.
*  I just rang myself up and you want a tip?
*  Get fucked. Give me my money back.
*  That's the tip. That's ridiculous.
*  The tip thing is crazy.
*  But people try to weasel tips out of you everywhere.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's weird how like some things get tips like a Starbucks barista.
*  Yeah. But other things you never think about tipping.
*  Yeah. You know, that are like harder jobs.
*  Yeah.
*  I so I this might be classism or whatever.
*  When I see the like grocery delivery guy, I often see someone that I feel like could use the money more than the fucking barista at Starbucks.
*  So I try to over tip them.
*  I'll do the one dollar standard at a coffee shop because my friends shame me.
*  But now I'm like I'm kind of classist in how I tip.
*  I'm like, who needs it more?
*  And then I'll over tip that guy.
*  Well, I like to tip people. It's fun.
*  I've heard feels nice.
*  I've heard your tips are pretty crazy.
*  It feels good.
*  It's like I call it like a little love bomb.
*  You leave a love bomb for someone.
*  I'm changes their day.
*  I'm fighting against my Indian heritage.
*  Anytime I leave a big tip, I'll do it.
*  But it's tough.
*  It took a lot of work.
*  I'm Italian and Sinatra and all this.
*  Because given everybody's handing out big tips, that's a big thing for the Italians.
*  It makes people feel better.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes it's a it's a nice thing to do.
*  It makes people feel better.
*  But my point is like, how can we not tip the stewardess on an airplane?
*  Because they're the fun police, dude.
*  That's why sometimes they are the fun.
*  Can I just have my seat back while we land?
*  Why can't I have my seat back while we land?
*  What's your fucking deal?
*  No sense.
*  Yeah.
*  It's they're just doing their job.
*  I know they're forced to do that stupid shit.
*  But if you let me have my seat back, maybe I'll give you a 20 on the way out.
*  They'll get fired.
*  They didn't follow the stupid fucking protocol.
*  But those people like they're they're bringing your food.
*  They're bringing you water.
*  It's true.
*  You press a button and then they have to come over to you.
*  Summon them with a button.
*  And they don't get a tip.
*  That's true.
*  But the Starbucks guy does.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  You know, and that's smug fuck.
*  Oh, some of them are so smug.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that a prerequisite for being a barista?
*  You have to like, look at people.
*  Can I can I tell you, I'm trying to tip better as I feel I'm more blessed.
*  And I remember Covid being like, oh, yeah, these these tips are
*  this an important thing to do.
*  Right. But if you give me any attitude, the way I press zero
*  and then spin it back around to you so you can see me not tip, it makes me so happy.
*  I'm overjoyed.
*  Zero. There you go, buddy.
*  That's a Texas thing, I think, to a degree.
*  We don't like rudeness at all.
*  Very yes, sir. No, sir.
*  I'm raised. Yes, sir. No, sir.
*  Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. Please.
*  Thank you. These are huge when I was growing up.
*  Yeah. So if you don't give me that, I feel so like who the fuck?
*  There's a real benefit in that kind of Texas friendly, like politeness.
*  Yes. A real benefit that makes everybody feel better.
*  Absolutely. I call people ma'am and sir all the time.
*  Yeah. Makes everybody feel better.
*  Yeah. And now that I'm old, nobody gets offended anymore
*  because I'm older than the people I'm sorry.
*  I'm ma'aming 95 percent of the time. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I'm always older than young guys.
*  I'm calling sir. Yeah.
*  But it's it's you know, it feels good.
*  Makes everybody feel better.
*  Yes. There's a there's a method to it.
*  There's a there's an intelligence to it. Right.
*  Because that whole East Coast thing, you know, I grew up in Boston.
*  Everybody's hard assed and hard edged.
*  And I'm like, yeah, I'm not.
*  I don't have to do that.
*  But but I get why they're that way, because everybody that lives
*  on the East Coast, unless you move there recently, you're essentially
*  the child of either immigrants or the children of immigrants who are,
*  you know, of grandparents of immigrants.
*  They're children or grandchildren.
*  Yeah. Someone someone came from a boat.
*  Yeah. And they landed on that spot, whether it was the 1920s
*  or whatever the fuck it was with my family was in the 1920s.
*  So these people, they landed there from fucking Italy and Ireland.
*  And they were poor as fuck and desperate. Right.
*  They made it across the ocean on a boat without YouTube.
*  They didn't know what the fuck they were getting into.
*  Yeah. They probably barely saw a photo of what America looked like.
*  They had no idea if they're going to get a job.
*  Yeah. Those are hard ass people.
*  And so those people raised hard ass kids.
*  And it takes a long time to break that out of a generational cycle.
*  And I think for a lot of people that moved to California, like
*  I didn't even know people were friendly until I moved to California.
*  Yeah. When I moved to California, I'm like, girls are so much nicer.
*  They're like nice.
*  They're like, hi. Hi. How you doing?
*  They're not going to just be mean to you. Right.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I think some of it also is just the number of people, the density of population.
*  In Texas, I see a person every 90 seconds.
*  I can say hi to everyone I walk by. Yeah.
*  In New York, there's too many people.
*  If I hold the door open for one person in Texas, two might walk through.
*  In New York, 30 might walk through.
*  So I'm not holding it. I'm not doing this.
*  That's a great point, because like I walked my dog yesterday.
*  I'm walking down the street and everybody I see him waving.
*  Yeah. How are you doing?
*  But I saw like five guys. It's so much easier. It's easy.
*  If you're in New York City and you're walking on the street
*  and it's just constant flow of people coming your way.
*  You literally can't wave to everybody.
*  You would be a crazy person.
*  Imagine you walk down fucking Fifth Avenue waving at every single.
*  You get the shit kicked out of you.
*  Someone would get upset at you.
*  Like the Joker opening scene.
*  Just get chased down the street and get beaten the fuck up.
*  Bro, I've been watching a lot of videos on Instagram,
*  unfortunately, of women getting punched in the face in New York.
*  I've seen like four or five of them over the last few days.
*  People just punching women for no reason.
*  Yeah, that's like a thing. That's like a thing.
*  What is that? I don't know.
*  I thought it was only white women at first, so it was just funny to me.
*  But then I found out they're doing it to everybody.
*  And now I'm scared for my wife.
*  Yeah, I saw some Asian lady get punched in the face today.
*  Yeah. Fuck for no reason.
*  Just walking down the street and this dude just wait.
*  She had a mask on too, by the way.
*  Maybe that's why. Maybe that's why.
*  This dude just way later and knocked her mask off.
*  Center flying out of nowhere.
*  Like you don't think you're going to get hit.
*  First of all, people die that way all the time. Yeah.
*  Because if you don't know you're going to get hit and you get hit,
*  you go unconscious and you bang your head off the concrete. Yeah.
*  It's like getting the world dropped on you.
*  Yeah, no, that's one thing that fighters are keenly aware of that most of us don't.
*  I don't think think about a lot.
*  You got to really think about that on concrete.
*  Yeah, you're going to punch somebody on concrete.
*  You might go to jail. Yeah.
*  You might go to jail for a long time and you might have horrible nightmares.
*  Yeah. You could have avoided that.
*  You didn't have to do that.
*  Especially if you're you're skilled. Yeah.
*  And you know that like, I don't have to fuck this guy up,
*  but this guy's fucking pissing me.
*  Yeah. Teach this motherfucker a lesson.
*  Yeah. I have a friend who had that exact situation.
*  It's like I haven't fought since then.
*  I don't know what happened to the guy.
*  He's I had to get out of there.
*  I just and he's like a trained fighter and he's like, I can't.
*  I don't know what happened to him.
*  I couldn't find out. And that just haunts me.
*  I was very enthusiastic about fighting until I was 19.
*  And when I was 19, I fought in this tournament in Anaheim, California.
*  It was the Nationals and I was the Massachusetts state champion.
*  And I fought this kid who is I think he was from Illinois.
*  I think he was the Illinois state champion.
*  And I I hit him in the head with a wheel kick.
*  With a what a wheel kick is, is like your body spinning.
*  So I'm standing with my left foot forward and I'm spinning my right heel around
*  in a circle. OK. And it has insane power.
*  I mean, insane power. Right.
*  The amount of power that you get in a wheel kick is because it's my legs.
*  It's my upper body. There's a whip to it.
*  It's got all this torque.
*  And I caught this guy per he came at me with what's called a stepping roundhouse
*  kick. So he had his front leg forward and he stepped forward with his left leg.
*  He was going to throw a kick and I spun with my right leg at the same time.
*  So I caught him running in and I blasted him in the face and he went out
*  faceplant snoring. Never woke up. Never woke up.
*  He was unconscious for half an hour. They put him in a stretcher.
*  I was watching. He never got out of that stretcher.
*  Holy shit. Took him to the hospital.
*  I have no idea what happened to him.
*  And I it freaked me out. Yeah.
*  It freaked me out. Yeah.
*  I lost my next match and I was that was my third match of the day.
*  Were you just like, I can't get over this?
*  No, no, I lost my next match. The guy was just better.
*  I just lost. OK. And but.
*  When I went back to Boston,
*  my my main instructor, he wasn't there in California when I was fighting.
*  And so because there was like a team of us, it was like 10 of us
*  that went to California.
*  And he he said to me, he goes, I heard you had a great knockout.
*  And I said, yeah, he goes, he goes, wheel kick.
*  I go, yeah, I go. I thought he was dead.
*  He never got up. He goes.
*  Sometimes they die.
*  I was 19 and I was fighting for zero money.
*  And none of it made any and my heel was sore.
*  I was I was limping the next day because my heel was sore from his face.
*  Yeah. And then I was thinking, I'm not immune to that.
*  Someone could 100 percent do that to me.
*  We're whipping fucking bones at each other. Yeah. You know, I mean.
*  I just it changed my my feeling about it.
*  I never I didn't have the same enthusiasm after that.
*  That was probably like the beginning of the end for me.
*  I fought for a couple more years, but it was like that was kind of it.
*  I was kind of like, what was your aspiration before that to be
*  like a world champion?
*  I want to be in the Olympics.
*  Ah, OK. Yeah.
*  But there's no money in Taekwondo.
*  There's no no money in kickboxing either.
*  I don't offer for a kickboxing fight.
*  It was like 500 bucks.
*  Boy. But then if I fought, if I fought professional,
*  then I could never fight amateur again, because now I'm a professional.
*  So it was like 500 bucks.
*  It was like 500 bucks to train for like two months and maybe get pummeled.
*  Yeah. You know, maybe get brain damage, maybe get my nose shattered.
*  You know, maybe get my ribs kicked in like.
*  And that's the beginning of the standup career, essentially.
*  Because I was doing both at the same time as well, which was also a problem,
*  because I knew I wasn't as committed to fight.
*  But it really began with that 19 year old when I knocked that dude out.
*  That was the beginning of the end.
*  And then it was like later on, it was headaches from kickboxing.
*  Oh, wow. I was getting a lot of headaches.
*  I was getting headaches.
*  Like after sparring, I would be lying in bed and my brain would just be throbbing.
*  Just boom, boom, boom.
*  And I remember thinking, what am I doing?
*  Yeah. Like am I ruining my brain?
*  Yes. I knew a lot of guys who their brain got ruined.
*  Yeah. It didn't seem like they realized it.
*  It didn't seem like because they were still fighting.
*  Yeah. It didn't seem they realized or maybe they didn't know what to do.
*  Or maybe they just weren't that smart.
*  But they were still fighting and training.
*  But I was realizing they were slurring their words. Yeah.
*  And there was.
*  There's just this clear evidence that something was off.
*  Yeah. And I was like, oh, my God, is that happening to me?
*  Is that going to happen to me? Yeah.
*  You know, and then there's also later on, I realize there's also other side effects of that,
*  which is like impulsiveness, gambling addiction.
*  Yeah. Crazy. They start doing a lot of drugs.
*  They drink a lot.
*  A lot of guys become drunks because they're just trying to like,
*  but they're just trying to feel good.
*  Yeah. They just feel terrible all the time.
*  Yeah. And we had no idea about any of this back then.
*  You're in a fog of depression.
*  Because they people thought back then punch drunk was a thing.
*  That was real. Everybody knew a guy.
*  But no one worried about it up until it was obvious.
*  Right. You know, and no one worried about there's a sub concussive
*  traumatic brain injuries that cause a lot of CTE,
*  which is chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
*  Right. And that's that's the thing that makes people kill themselves and,
*  you know, do wild shit and lose their fucking mind.
*  But soccer players get that. I know it's so heading the ball.
*  I've heard this and it's so crazy how delicate the brain is.
*  We don't think about it. Super delicate.
*  Yeah. Super delicate.
*  And that's why I tell my friends that are all they still like to spar.
*  I was like, man, I know it's fun. I know it's fun to spar.
*  But don't do it. Don't fucking do it, man.
*  Don't do it because you could just slip away and not even realize that you slipped away.
*  Yeah. Because all you have to do is like spar with one meathead.
*  One guy. And then he hits you. You get mad and you hit him.
*  And next thing you know, you're in a fight. Right.
*  You're in a fight in the gym.
*  And a lot of fights happen in the gym.
*  There's a lot of sparring matches that essentially become fights
*  where you're just wailing. You don't break it up.
*  No, most gyms don't. Right.
*  It depends on the gym.
*  A really good gym will break it up, especially if someone's better
*  than the other person in the way on on them.
*  A really good gym will stop that. Yeah.
*  But a really good gym will not want you to spar like that most of the time anyway.
*  Most of the time, they want you to what they call technical spar.
*  So you're just kind of like you're hitting each other,
*  but you're not like full blasting each other.
*  You're just getting timing in.
*  And that's a really great way to spar if you trust your sparring partner.
*  So if you got a guy that you could do it with and he's cool and you're cool
*  and you like each other, you know, and you can make this agreement.
*  Like if I hit him, I'm going to hit him like this.
*  I'm just going to like stop at the body.
*  And if you do that, then you really develop sharp timing and it's great.
*  But you do have to do hard sparring every now and then
*  because you got to know what that feels like.
*  And the consequences of making mistakes are so much more.
*  I want to be honest, I think about getting into like jujitsu and stuff.
*  And then you start talking like this.
*  And I'm like, I think I'm OK.
*  I think I don't need this.
*  I think I'm not built for it. Yeah.
*  Well, I'm a grappler.
*  Well, you got a son looking good.
*  I went, by the way, mothership is beautiful.
*  It's on took me yesterday. Thank you.
*  Gorgeous. Mitzis.
*  Also, I as a non-drinker, I didn't have any interest in Mitzis.
*  And then I went there and I was like, oh, this is a vibe.
*  Yeah, this is like a speakeasy.
*  And then I heard it shut down for anybody but comics after a certain hour.
*  Yeah. That's awesome. After 11 p.m.
*  It's comics and their friends. That's awesome.
*  But yeah, it's on looks good, dude.
*  And he said he was training with you. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I got those guys on a workout boot camp.
*  Shane Gillis, Assan, Derek Poston, Brian Simpson, Duncan Trussell.
*  Is Poston still doing only meat?
*  He's doing carnivore. He told me he was doing that.
*  So is Assan. Yeah.
*  I got them on that for January.
*  It was World Carnivore Month.
*  And I said, I just want you guys to try this one month.
*  He said it was so hard.
*  Eggs. You could eat. It is hard. Yeah.
*  But once you get accustomed to it, like, that's how I eat.
*  I mean, I'll still eat whatever I want every now and then.
*  Yeah. But the vast majority of my diet is all just meat and eggs.
*  No veggies? Very little.
*  If I want to, like the other night, I had a salad.
*  I felt like having a salad. And blood work is all good.
*  No. It's great. Oh, it's great.
*  Everything's great. Look at that.
*  Yeah. No, it's amazing.
*  It's like your body wants to eat real food.
*  And if you're eating bread and all that bullshit, it's not real food.
*  It's just your body's like, I'm never tired.
*  OK, so through that, I used to get the look.
*  I 100 percent I'm addicted to pasta.
*  Like, if you give me a big bowl of like linguine with clams,
*  I will fuck that up.
*  Oh, fuck some lasagna.
*  You put a pizza in front of me. I can't stop eating.
*  Yeah. I'll eat a whole pizza, a whole extra large pizza. Right. But.
*  That's not good for you. Yeah.
*  And when I would eat like that, I would always crash.
*  I would get these moments like the middle of the day.
*  I was like, I got to take a fucking nap.
*  I wanted to take a nap. I love that feeling.
*  It's a great feeling. So fun.
*  It's so fun to just be able to take a nap if you can.
*  But if you're busy and you can't take a nap and now you got to go do things
*  and you're all droopy. Yeah.
*  But when I started eating only meat, one of the first things I noticed
*  is that my energy levels were completely level throughout the day.
*  It was flat. It never went up. It never went down.
*  I was like, this is crazy.
*  Like, I'm not getting tired. Right.
*  Where I'm expecting to get tired.
*  And then I realized, oh, that's probably like an insulin dump.
*  Like my body's probably fucked up from all this carbs.
*  Yeah. All this sugar and bullshit that I'm putting in my body.
*  And as soon as I stopped doing that, I felt so much better.
*  And that's what those guys said.
*  That's what Assan said. Derek said.
*  They're like, dude, I feel so much better.
*  I have so much more energy. Yeah.
*  Because you're not poisoning yourself.
*  Yeah. I did like a keto style.
*  It was called soda, this thing before I filmed the special.
*  I let go like 20 pounds.
*  And it was I didn't realize the idea of eating fat instead of carbs is fat,
*  even with a smaller amount is just more filling.
*  So carbs, you can eat 200 calories of carbs.
*  You're yeah. Protein and fat. Yeah.
*  Carbs. I'm hungry again right away. Right.
*  If I have even just a teaspoon, a teaspoon, a tablespoon and a half of olive oil,
*  I'm good for four or five hours, usually.
*  Yeah. It's more more.
*  It's a higher satiety level.
*  So if you if you just eat a 16 ounce steak,
*  you put a 16 ounce ribeye in front of you.
*  And if that's all you're eating, you'll be full.
*  You'll eat that. You're like, that was great.
*  But if there's mashed potatoes right next to it with gravy.
*  Yeah. And then maybe some french fries.
*  And then maybe over there, there's a little bit of spaghetti and meatballs.
*  I'm going to keep eating. Right.
*  I'm going to keep stuffing my fat, stupid face.
*  And then I'm going to at the end of it, I'll be like this.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Which is still my favorite thing to do.
*  Yeah. But it's really bad for you.
*  It's a great feeling. That's like drinking.
*  Great feeling. It's really bad for you.
*  Yeah, I don't I don't drink, but I will gorge.
*  Yeah, it's not good, man.
*  It's not good. You really especially one of the things as you get older,
*  you you realize there's there's a giant difference between people
*  my age that take care of themselves and people my age that neglect their health.
*  They they deteriorate.
*  Like I have friends that are my age.
*  And when I tell people we're the same age, they're like, what?
*  Yeah. Like the other people can't even believe it.
*  How is that guy your age? Yeah.
*  Because he didn't do anything.
*  He didn't take care of himself.
*  We have to take care of you.
*  You got to treat your body like it's a fucking car.
*  Yeah. If your car's got a fucked up transmission, get it fixed.
*  Yeah. If you change your fucking oil, stupid.
*  Have you have you seen this guy, Brian Johnson?
*  He was on Flavorous. He's fascinating.
*  He's fascinating. Yeah.
*  He says he eats like 1800 calories a day.
*  And he the saying he says is kind of fire.
*  He goes, every calorie is fighting for its life.
*  Every calorie has a purpose.
*  And if we can't find a purpose for you, you're out.
*  Yeah, every piece of food has a purpose.
*  It's also like injected his son's blood into him.
*  And yeah, yeah.
*  So when I first read articles, here's what I'll say.
*  When I would just read articles, he's coming on the pod
*  or researching and I'm like, they paint him as like this billionaire
*  fuckboy who just wants to be a billionaire and have sex with 18 year old or whatever.
*  They kind of make him seem like that.
*  When you talk to him, he's like, I think humans can live forever
*  with the help of AI, and I just want to push us there.
*  And you feel like, oh, yeah, this is not.
*  He's not like he was wearing like a unicorn shirt when we saw him
*  and like some blue corduroy.
*  No, nothing fashionable about this man.
*  He just and I think his dad is pretty sick.
*  And so he I think wants to make humans live forever very soon.
*  So his dad can stick around.
*  It's actually like there's a lot more nobility to it when I talk to him
*  than when I just read articles about him.
*  Isn't it interesting that you would be skeptical about a person
*  who wants to live longer? Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah. Well, a billionaire who wants to live forever sounds
*  those things together sound evil genius like Lex Luthor.
*  Right. But it also makes people's like, no, everybody's going to die.
*  Yeah. It's like especially poor people that don't have the money
*  to do all the shit that he's doing, because what he's doing is cost
*  like millions every year.
*  Yeah, two million, I think a year on his body. Yeah.
*  That's crazy. Yeah.
*  LeBron's one's a million a year.
*  And this guy's not even an athlete, but two million a year. Yeah.
*  I mean, he looks OK.
*  He looks great, dude.
*  And he looks he looks better.
*  He's in better shape, obviously, than he was five years ago.
*  Yeah. He's also a vegan, though, which I found fascinating
*  because there's not a lot of evidence that that's good.
*  He didn't think that was healthy.
*  He thought he could be as healthy and protect the environment.
*  I believe he thought the environmental cost of meat right now.
*  Yeah, he should read more.
*  That doesn't sound protecting shit.
*  You're encouraging monocrop agriculture.
*  You're encouraging the death of untold numbers of creatures
*  when they fucking when they when they when they cultivate those crops,
*  when they they cut them down and run those fucking combines through them.
*  Everything dies, dude.
*  If you think one life is one life.
*  So if you think like a bison is as important as a mouse.
*  Well, you're a hypocrite because those ground squirrels shrews.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Ground nesting birds, fawns, rabbits.
*  Things get fucking destroyed.
*  If you talk to farmers, one of the things you see
*  after they run a combine through the field is vultures, vultures
*  and crows flying over the field because they know everything got fucked up.
*  Yeah. So if one life is one life.
*  Yeah. And this is not to say that this not there's not a horrific loss of life
*  every day with like chickens.
*  Yeah. The number of chickens that get killed in this country every year
*  is in the billions. Yeah. It's in the billions. Yeah.
*  How many chickens do we kill every year? Let's find out.
*  I was watching this thing on all the different animals that get killed.
*  Like, what's the highest number of animals to get killed?
*  Is it chickens? Got to be chickens. Chickens is high up there.
*  I don't know if it's number one, but there's a there's a lot.
*  A lot of different things get fucking killed and eaten by people. Yeah.
*  But monocrop agriculture is terrible for the environment.
*  It's not good.
*  It's bad because you you just like topsoil.
*  You're not supposed to have one 17 billion.
*  I think that's a billion. What's that?
*  That was animals. Oh, eight billion chickens.
*  Chickens, eight billion chickens every year.
*  U.S. U.S. 214 million turkeys.
*  That's ridiculous. Turkeys.
*  They're like they only exist because of Thanksgiving.
*  Yeah. Wildly overrated meat. Very overrated.
*  Yeah. I'm amazed that there's eight times more.
*  Look at the shellfish. Oh, my God.
*  Forty three billion. No, that's fire.
*  I love shellfish. That one. They they got it.
*  Three billion fish.
*  Twenty three billion million ducks.
*  Yeah. Twenty three million ducks.
*  Worldwide chicken said that was like 70 billion.
*  70 billion.
*  Oh, every year. That's crazy.
*  Every year we kill 70 billion chickens.
*  Makes sense, though, if there's eight billion people.
*  We all probably about nine chickens a year on average.
*  You know what I mean? Chicken the other day.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Meanwhile, I have chickens.
*  I have chickens in the suite. They're my pets.
*  Really weird. Yeah.
*  I have like 15 chickens and they they make eggs.
*  I eat their eggs, but they're they're not worried about me at all.
*  I'm like, hey, ladies.
*  Yeah. Come by, give them food.
*  They get excited to see you.
*  You got a lot of land out there then.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Are you raising any other animals in the full farm or just the chickens?
*  No, just chickens and trying to keep my dog from eating the chickens.
*  My dog would be terrified.
*  My dog is seven pounds.
*  You'd be terrified of your dog and chickens.
*  Both freaking out.
*  That's funny. What kind of dog is it?
*  It's a multi-poo. Happy. Oh, I love them, dude.
*  I didn't want a small dog.
*  My wife made me get a small dog and I'm so happy.
*  Anybody who doesn't like small dogs, I say, meet Carl.
*  Yeah, he's fantastic.
*  Is he in your lap? Yeah.
*  Look at this guy, dude.
*  Oh, Carl. Look at little Carl.
*  Yeah, the best.
*  Yeah. Dogs don't get any cuter than Carl.
*  Yeah. They just get different.
*  Yeah. Wonderful.
*  Just traveling with a small dog is so much better than.
*  Yeah, they're great little buddies. Yeah.
*  They're little pals.
*  Dude, I got the full sling.
*  I'm going to send Jamie a link.
*  I got the full sling. I put him in there.
*  Just walk around. It's the best thing.
*  Don't get punched. Oh, yeah.
*  What if you fell and crushed the dog?
*  No, I could never. I would have to fall.
*  It's like a mother holding the son.
*  You know, you got instincts.
*  I mean, I'm falling. Cracked.
*  Oh, if I get cracked, saying like that Chinese lady I saw today.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I'm probably about as strong as her.
*  So, yeah, she was a big lady.
*  Oh, then definitely.
*  Why? She got waylaid.
*  It's the dude just stood over her after he waylaid her.
*  He just stood over her and pretended like nothing happened.
*  He was talking to somebody else.
*  You know, young enough.
*  Yeah, I feel like young kids scare me the most
*  because they don't know the value of a life yet.
*  No, they don't get it.
*  I saw one kid that died in New York City.
*  These guys just walked up to him and cracked him
*  and he fell backwards over the curb
*  and fell back and slammed his head on the street.
*  Oh, yeah. And died for nothing for 20 bucks.
*  They robbed him from $20.
*  That's all he had on him.
*  I know it's crazy.
*  It's just crazy that there's that our society is so fucked up
*  that we've been spending so much money on shit like wars overseas.
*  Yeah. And not nearly enough money on
*  trying to figure out a way to have the minimal amount of people
*  grow up to want to punch people in the face on the street.
*  Yeah. Yeah. The barely put a stop to feel like they need to punch people.
*  Right. Well, figure out a way to mitigate that.
*  Like there's there's got to be a science behind it.
*  Like, what is the problem?
*  Well, abuse at home, violence in their neighborhood, poverty,
*  drugs, gangs, all that stuff.
*  If they can pump money at that, what would the like the downstream
*  effects of a lack of crime and violence?
*  If you could like give people hope and educate them at an early age
*  and set people up saying, I'm going to help you, I'm going to mentor you.
*  I'm going to get you along in life.
*  Yeah. The amount of money that we would spend to do that
*  would pay for itself four or five, six times over and less crime,
*  less bullshit, less losers, less problems, less prisons.
*  Yeah. I just so much of it seems like it just starts at home
*  and there's a generational trauma thing that you hear about a lot.
*  And it's like, yeah, like we're talking about with the East Coast.
*  There's a little bit of generational trauma there.
*  Yeah, I had so much I had to think about my dad's struggle with alcohol
*  abuse, struggle with a lot of stuff.
*  And I had to understand what his life was supposed to be in India
*  and then what it was going to be here in India.
*  He was like set.
*  He'd passed this exam that like five million people apply for
*  and they select like 200.
*  Like he was going to be a millionaire, bare minimum, 24 years old.
*  And he's at another family member's wedding.
*  And his little cousins are like, hey, you're getting married today, too.
*  He had no idea. Arrange marriage.
*  Getting fitted for clothes on his way to the wedding.
*  She's and then they're like, you're also moving to America.
*  That's because in the 70s in India, they're just thinking,
*  oh, if he's successful in India, he'll be even more successful in America.
*  The language barrier you never think about.
*  And I I thought about somebody, one of my cousins.
*  It struck me because he goes, your dad is so funny.
*  And I was like, what? What are you talking about?
*  He's the least funny because your dad's not funny in English.
*  He's so funny in Hindi.
*  And I was like, oh, this guy doesn't this language.
*  He's not that good at and he couldn't navigate the world the way he could in India.
*  He was supposed to be a superstar.
*  Then he comes here and he's in Texas as a brown guy in the 70s,
*  probably less than to all these people.
*  And he's used to being a star.
*  And he can't be funny and he can't be himself.
*  And that just sucks the life out of you slowly day by day.
*  What did he do in India?
*  He was it's called a PCS officer.
*  So there's a movie called 12th Fail, a Bollywood movie.
*  I love Bollywood, but it's about a different post, but equally competitive.
*  That one is like I.S.
*  And then PCS is like a government officer, kind of like state police, I guess.
*  But like you are at the very least well respected.
*  And if you want to be rich and take some bribes, you can do that.
*  And my dad would have done all of that.
*  He would have taken all the bribes, all the bribes.
*  And in India, he just kind of knew that's how he knew the culture.
*  He knew how to navigate.
*  He knew how how to grease the wheels and all of that,
*  how to talk to people to get what you want here.
*  He's not charming because he doesn't know English well enough.
*  There he can get anything he wants here.
*  He's just struggling trying to figure it all out.
*  And so I've become keenly aware of like, I don't know if we as immigrant kids
*  appreciate everything our parents had to go through to get here for us.
*  I'm not here without that.
*  Well, if my grandparents there, it was actually my grandparents, parents
*  that moved here, but if they weren't the type of people that were so gangster,
*  they were willing to get on that boat.
*  Yeah, I would be in Europe some.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Be in Europe, hanging out in a cafe, smoking cigarettes, talking shit.
*  Yeah, I would be a fat spoiled piece of shit.
*  And it would have been fun.
*  I'd have been a rich kid.
*  But growing up in India, I wouldn't have been this what I am here.
*  I know that. Yeah.
*  You want your own ability to carve a path.
*  And there's a lot of countries where that's not an option.
*  You can't really carve a path to do whatever you want to do.
*  Yeah, that's not available to everybody everywhere.
*  Yeah, man. Hopeless poverty.
*  I have I'm not saying there's not extreme poverty in America.
*  There is. But I've seen hopeless poverty in India where it's just like,
*  I don't know how you'll get out of this in three generations even.
*  Yeah, when you fly into Brazil, one of the things that happens when you fly
*  into Rio, we would do UFC's there.
*  You go through the favelas, the airport and the drive from the airport
*  to the to where the beach where we're staying.
*  Yeah. You drive straight through the favela.
*  So all to the right of you is shanty towns and you see extreme poverty.
*  Yeah. And if you have you ever seen that movie, The City of God?
*  Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Whoa. Yeah.
*  My friend, Hedy Bravo, said that makes boys in the hood look like Sesame Street.
*  Truly. I remember thinking it was going to be an uplifting film.
*  So I was horrified watching the whole thing.
*  But yeah, it's crazy, man.
*  And my friends from Brazil say that's exactly what it's like.
*  That's exactly what it's like in the favelas.
*  It's bad. The runts, the kids that take over like nine years old
*  and they end up killing people. Yeah.
*  Unbelievable. They have no respect for life. No understanding.
*  I mean, their frontal cortex isn't even beginning to form.
*  Yeah. They're not.
*  You're 25 before you figure out what the fuck you're even doing with yourself.
*  I remember riding a train in India with my mom.
*  My mom has like fibromyalgia, all these joint issues.
*  And then they like that we had to move train stations.
*  All this stuff are like platforms or whatever.
*  And everybody's just rushing and people are like screaming, trying to get off the plane.
*  A train. So many people are getting on.
*  People are like screaming like, please just let me get off.
*  And I'm like, you know, people are going to die doing this.
*  And then we talked to a family in India and they might have been saying it flippantly,
*  but they said the cheapest thing in India is a man's life.
*  They said in Hindi, but like the idea that you just grow up around so much trauma and whatever that it's it is what it is.
*  When there's a billion people, that's what India has.
*  Yeah. A billion.
*  On a land a quarter the size of America.
*  So a quarter the size of America, three times the population.
*  Yeah. That's nuts.
*  Dude, the point four of India's population, one point four billion, is bigger than America.
*  That's nuts. So bigger plus a billion.
*  That's nuts. Yeah.
*  You have to think a quarter the size of America and three times the population.
*  If you really put that all together, you just crazy.
*  Yeah. What? Yeah.
*  It's madness.
*  And I love India and I love going back.
*  And I also just understand how privileged I am that I was raised here.
*  And I feel like we as immigrant kids take that for granted sometimes.
*  Isn't it interesting how like some places just I guess it's the older ones, right?
*  Like think about high population places.
*  It's China, which is like our oldest civilization.
*  Yeah. China has thrived economically for four thousand years.
*  Yeah. Four thousand years.
*  Yeah.
*  So of course they have a billion people.
*  Yeah, true.
*  They mean obviously there's serious poverty and all sorts of problems in China.
*  But the point is they've been a unit for four thousand years.
*  So people have been fucking.
*  They've been fucking for four thousand years so much that they had to say you could only have one kid.
*  Yeah. And then they ruined everything.
*  That's stupid idea.
*  They then they ruined everything.
*  So there's so many more men than there are women.
*  So now they have like a real problem.
*  And then they realize that they're going to have a real problem.
*  So they started changing it and say you could have more kids.
*  I think you can have three now. Right.
*  Is that what China's policy is now?
*  Are you not worried about China as a threat to America for global dominance?
*  I guess is I can't think of a better way to say it.
*  But are you worried about China?
*  I think they've already won.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  They've infiltrated all of our universities.
*  They give grant money.
*  They pay for things.
*  They buy up farmland.
*  So they've been buying up farmland around military bases.
*  They sell America cheap cell phone towers and Internet routers.
*  They sell them cell phone towers at a discounted rate so that they can have
*  their cell phone towers around military bases so they could listen to everything
*  that everybody fucking says.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  And then they get caught using like third party access to like Huawei got kicked out of America.
*  Oh, that's right. You can't.
*  I forgot about this story.
*  I was ready to buy a Huawei phone because Huawei at one point in time have the dopest phones.
*  Oh, really?
*  Bro, their phones are so dope.
*  Their phones are incredible.
*  They had cameras and batteries that were so much better than iPhones or anything that was
*  available in America at one point in time.
*  And they were just making these insane phones.
*  And I remember they made a Porsche design phone.
*  It was a Porsche design Huawei phone.
*  I'm like, this is the craziest phone I've ever seen.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then all of a sudden they put a ban on them.
*  And I'm like, there must be some real shit going down if the United States government.
*  We let them get away with a lot.
*  What does it say here, Jamie?
*  There's a fine when you or there was a social upbringing fee or a social maintenance fee.
*  Oh, in China, if you had more than one kid.
*  And then it says the Sichuan province abolished the three child policy, making it completely.
*  Lair parents illegally have as many children as they want.
*  The real problem is the lack of women.
*  It's the different.
*  What is the population difference between men and women in China?
*  I think it's like 60 something percent men.
*  Yeah, that's yeah, that's a problem.
*  That's a real problem.
*  Because the reality, at least in America,
*  America has a very high level of men who are single and have no sex.
*  Yeah, it's pretty high.
*  I was one of those for a long time.
*  Here it is.
*  Seven hundred twenty male inhabitants and six hundred and eighty nine female.
*  That's not too bad.
*  That is what is that about?
*  That's not 60 percent.
*  No, it's a little over 50.
*  I think like 54, probably 53, if I had to guess.
*  OK, that's not too bad.
*  Yeah.
*  China's total population decreased for the first time in decades in 2022,
*  and population decline is expected to accelerate in the upcoming years.
*  And that's because of the population of women versus men.
*  Yeah. And then the sorry, the gap in genders could increase because the older people
*  that didn't have the one child policy, they're going to start dying.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  And so in America, like what was there was some study recently
*  that they were talking about the amount of single men and men who don't have girlfriends.
*  Yeah. And it's crazy high.
*  Yeah. Because everybody's got super high standards.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  A chart that shows the distribution from China from 1950 to 22.
*  And it seems like it's almost the same the whole time.
*  Interesting. Even after they had the one child policy, didn't change at all.
*  So it's only a 51 to 48.
*  Pretty much the entire time. Yeah.
*  Interesting. Yeah, I would think it would continue to go down.
*  You're getting this data from who? I don't know.
*  From China. Yeah, that's fair.
*  That's fair also. No, we did it perfect.
*  Yeah, that's fair. Nobody died from COVID.
*  Nobody died from COVID. We didn't create COVID.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Why are you calling it the China virus?
*  Yeah. Fucking racist. Yeah.
*  Yeah. No one's even mad at China for killing a billion people.
*  Yeah. The idea, there's this idea that if I criticize a government, I'm criticizing the people.
*  Like the idea if you criticize Israel, you're anti-Semitic.
*  It's like, guys, let's let go.
*  You know, I criticize the Chinese government, Israeli government.
*  I have no problem with US groups of people.
*  Y'all are wonderful. Government.
*  Y'all are a little nuts. Of course.
*  Yeah. Even with America.
*  Yes, absolutely. Like if you have an American flag, you're racist.
*  Shut up. Yeah. America is all of us.
*  You can't let the corrupt government take your fucking flag and decide that that's a colonizer's flag.
*  That's so stupid. That's all of us. The children of immigrants.
*  Yes, thousand percent. And if I go to Europe and they make fun of America, I don't think they're making fun of me.
*  I don't think they hate Americans. I'm not like, how dare you?
*  Meanwhile, you're probably accurate. I'll probably laugh along with you.
*  Yeah. Tell me more shit. Yeah, you're probably right.
*  What do you guys think is funny about us? Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  We're killing everyone with our food. Sure. Yeah. Yes. Let's go.
*  We are definitely doing that. Yeah, I hate that I've become that guy, but I've become that guy.
*  Well, Russia doesn't allow GMO foods. They don't allow it. Yeah.
*  You have to everything has to be organic in Russia.
*  I hate that. But I went to Europe and then I tasted like the food there and not that they're the best chefs,
*  but the quality of everything is just so much more clean and pure.
*  And then you taste the stuff in America and you're like, oh, this is they're right.
*  This stuff sucks. It's killing us. Well, we just have so much fast, cheap food.
*  Yeah. Fast, cheap food that's terrible for you and that you never get satisfied.
*  You want to keep eating it. But like Will Sylvaince was telling me years ago, he went to London in like 07.
*  I just moved to New York. We were talking and he was like, the chicken in London is actually white.
*  In America, it's called white meat, but it's kind of like yellowish.
*  You ever notice? And I'm like, I guess.
*  And then he goes, if you go to London or France or wherever and eat the chicken,
*  it's purely white because they don't allow you to fuck with it like they do in America.
*  What are they doing in America to make it yellow? I don't know what they're doing exactly.
*  You're the guy that researches. I'm the guy that just talks shit.
*  But my friend Mike Alvin is talking about the exact thing.
*  Unrelated. We were just talking. He was like, dude, if you buy frozen chicken breast in America
*  and you look at the ingredients list, it's way more than just chicken and breast.
*  You know what I mean? It's yeah, it's like whatever nitrate, whatever preservative, whatever.
*  It's just like a whole you can do anything.
*  The preservatives are what really fuck you. You got to imagine what is a preservative?
*  A preservative is something that discourages bacteria from eating food.
*  So what does it do to the absorption of the nutrients in your body?
*  What does it do to your gut microbiome? What does it do to all those things?
*  Yeah. And that's something that people don't take into consideration when you eat something
*  that has preservatives in it. You're taking into your body a thing that discourages living things.
*  Yeah. And your food is not supposed to last on a shelf.
*  Like if you eat you, I'm sure you've seen those McDonald's cheeseburgers that people take.
*  Yeah. And they put them on a shelf.
*  Yeah. It's just sitting there ready to be eaten.
*  Some dude has one from what was the oldest one the dude had from the 80s, I think.
*  I think so. Like 30 years ago.
*  It looks perfect. Yeah, it's yeah.
*  It looks like he bought it at like at noon and it's 6 p.m.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It looks like a six hour old cheeseburger.
*  It doesn't look like a cheeseburger that's 30 years old.
*  And I hate but that is a thing I think about if I'm like, where do I want to?
*  God willing, we have a kid, my wife and me, where do I want to raise them?
*  I'm like, oh, at the foundation, the food here is fucked.
*  Do we need to leave just to get better food?
*  You can get good food here.
*  You just you don't have to.
*  Do I have to hunt to like 95?
*  That's bonkers, too.
*  That's so crazy. It doesn't look that bad.
*  Yo, it looks fantastic.
*  That's this guy. 29 years.
*  Look at that, dude. He's all happy with himself.
*  Look, I got it saved.
*  Oh, is he eating it? Is that the only eating?
*  He only eats that.
*  Yeah. I think he's going to eat it.
*  No, he's he's faking it.
*  He's not. Yeah. But that's crazy.
*  He looks terrible. Yeah.
*  Poor guy. He's been eating McDonald's his whole life.
*  Yeah. But you know, it doesn't look terrible.
*  That hamburger doesn't look bad.
*  Looks perfect, especially for that old.
*  Yeah, that's old as fuck.
*  It's a 30 year old burger.
*  That's crazy, dude.
*  That's crazy. A 30 year old burger should not.
*  A 30 day old burger should not last.
*  It should be gone. Yes.
*  I mean, it should be gone.
*  Like, how long would it last?
*  Like if rats never ate it and you left it in an apartment
*  and then like society collapsed and then, you know,
*  there's fries and a burger from 96, it says. Wow.
*  Wow. That's crazy.
*  What is wrong with these people that they're keeping a burger?
*  Yeah, that's actually a great point.
*  Yeah. Like what kind of people are these?
*  Also, are they trustworthy? How the fuck?
*  That's what I was just thinking.
*  They could be from Monday.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Bags of shit. Yeah.
*  Probably shit hoarders.
*  Got to be, dude. Got to be.
*  Colostomy bags all the way to the roof.
*  Have you ever seen that episode of Hoarders
*  where the lady was a shit hoarder?
*  No, that would make me vomit for sure.
*  It almost made me vomit.
*  I hosted Fear Factor, but Gillis showed it to me.
*  It's horrific.
*  I don't want to show it because we've showed it before.
*  But watch shit hoarders.
*  This one lady was a shit hoarder.
*  I'm going to be honest, I will not watch that.
*  But yeah, she was eating the shit.
*  Oh, dude, I can't do it.
*  I can't do it. I'm getting a little.
*  Oh, but if you watch it, it's it's really but
*  one last meal in there.
*  Yeah, she won't have one last meal when they were about to clean out the place.
*  She's like, I've been eating poop for 20 years.
*  Oh, God. Oh, my God.
*  What is her gut microbiome?
*  Like probably better than that guy.
*  McDonald's. That's the thing.
*  So I'm going to throw up.
*  You guys are hearing about it. I'm going to throw up.
*  I know it's rough. Oh, God.
*  Something about eating shit like your body is just like, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Like, have you ever done your mom's house? No.
*  OK. Your mom's house podcast.
*  They do a live
*  pay per view show multiple times a year
*  where they show things on camera.
*  They curate these things and bring comics on and they do sketches.
*  It's really fun. Yeah.
*  They show you things that you cannot see any other way.
*  You would never be able to show it on YouTube.
*  It would be illegal. You'd go to jail.
*  Yeah. But you could do it in this thing because everybody's agree.
*  And these people eating their own shit, shitting on a plate,
*  smearing it on their dick and jerking off.
*  Oh, did they ever send you the thing they made for you?
*  I think I'm not watching.
*  Yeah. I was just curious if you saw it.
*  I heard them talk about it, I think.
*  I don't even remember what it was, but yeah, they wasted their energy on that.
*  I think they had someone to make you like a special, you know, kick a cameo type stuff.
*  Yeah, fuck off. I'm not watching that.
*  You know, shitting on yourself for Rogan is crazy.
*  Yeah, I'm sure it exists and good luck.
*  I'm not seeing it. Yeah, I don't need to see that.
*  I'm busy. I think it was for you.
*  Yeah, I'm sure it was, dude, because he knows I throw up.
*  Yeah, because when he had me on the show,
*  I almost threw up like three or four times.
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can't handle it.
*  They're eating pizza and shit.
*  They're so desensitized to it.
*  It's like it's nothing. That's weird.
*  Yeah, they've been your mom's house has been like highlighting
*  some of the most fucked up human beings
*  that they could find on the Internet for quite a long time.
*  What a misleading title.
*  I know my mom's house is such a comforting place.
*  I mean, yeah, I don't know why they came up with your mom's house.
*  Where were you? I was at your mom's house.
*  Oh, there you go. There you go.
*  It's a talk and shit.
*  It's a fun podcast. Yeah, it's really good podcast.
*  Maybe Tom and Christina are both hilarious.
*  Yeah. But that pay per view show that they do is rough.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Whoa, it's rough.
*  And then the normal part is not like that.
*  That's just a pay per view.
*  Yeah. But in normal pod, they'll show you some fucked up things.
*  OK, OK. They'll show you some fucked up things.
*  OK. They talk shit.
*  But it's a crazy thing, dude.
*  Yeah. These subcultures are so funny.
*  Well, there's so many humans out there that are out of their fucking minds
*  that they can gather together and get a community now.
*  Yeah. You know, if you're a guy who ate shit, good luck finding your peers.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Who's your who's your colleagues?
*  You hide that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Now there's Reddit and you just find a guy who's like, me too.
*  I want for chant to get the real shit.
*  Oh, that's true. Yeah. You want to get the real shit.
*  Yeah. But yeah, I put on a play.
*  I'm censored. I tuck a bib in.
*  I get a knife and fork. And then I.
*  Dude, I mean, shit, they cut it up and scoop it up.
*  Choking on it was going down.
*  OK. Yeah.
*  You see it stuck in between his teeth.
*  Oh, God, you in the shit.
*  Please, please, please, please. Let's move on.
*  I can't I can't do it. I can't do it.
*  But meanwhile, for some guys like, oh, anybody upload any new shit eating content?
*  I'm really excited.
*  They get home and they're pumped for it.
*  Yeah. The the variability of human beings is so extreme.
*  There's so many different kinds of people.
*  That's one of the things that you realize when you do a podcast, for sure.
*  Yeah. Because you talk to so many different people.
*  Yeah. So many different conversations.
*  And you realize, oh, this guy thinks different.
*  Yeah. Oh, she's she just has a different upbringing.
*  She's she has a way of looking at the world that I didn't consider.
*  Yeah. And then it's like it adds to your palate.
*  You know, it adds to your understanding of people.
*  Because if you just live in a small town
*  and hang around with the same people and you don't like to go online,
*  you go to the same bar, whatever the fuck you do.
*  You don't know how much people vary.
*  People vary so much, man.
*  Yeah. There's so much variety on what it means to be a human being.
*  Yeah, that's actually yeah, that's very profound.
*  Yeah, I don't think you could be some amazing person
*  who is out there like Jose Andres going to these crisis areas
*  and feeding people in Palestine.
*  And you know that guy Jose Andres, the chef? No.
*  Amazing. Oh, I know.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He owns my favorite restaurant in Vegas, which is Bizarre Meats.
*  I don't know if you've ever eaten there before.
*  And now I have not.
*  Bro, next time you go to Vegas. Yeah.
*  That place is insane.
*  It's a full honey pot, because when you walk in,
*  they have those Argentine grills.
*  You know what a grill works grill is?
*  It's like these Argentine grills where they crank them
*  and they raise and lower over a live hardwood.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So they have fire with real hardwood.
*  Yeah. So the coals and the fires crackling, the steaks are searing
*  and they raise them and lower them depending upon like what
*  what point in the cook it is.
*  The beginning of the cook, you start off high, like way above the flames,
*  and you slowly lower it down to sear it.
*  You walk in the smell.
*  Oh, it's amazing.
*  It's so good.
*  Well, that guy who runs that place is an incredible chef.
*  And he goes he went to Ukraine.
*  He was feeding people in Poland when the Ukrainian refugees were making
*  when they were trying to flee Ukraine during the beginning of the war
*  and Russia invaded.
*  And he's over in Palestine right now.
*  Where is he now?
*  He's not in. Is he in the West Bank?
*  But anyway, so this guy goes over there and feeds people.
*  So you have this guy who is this incredible chef,
*  who's this beautiful human being, who's like really doing something
*  that's selfless, really doing something that's just real charity.
*  Yeah. Feeding people.
*  Yeah. Delicious food, because he's an incredible chef.
*  And then you have shit eaters
*  on your mom's house.
*  You have people that are punching ladies for no reason.
*  Yeah. You have chaos.
*  Yeah. You have like
*  the wide spectrum of humans.
*  And there's so little thought and engineering in society
*  of trying to figure out a way to mitigate all of our problems.
*  Yeah. Instead, we just put band aids here and band aids there
*  and spend more money and hire more government workers and spend, spend, spend.
*  And nothing gets fixed.
*  Yeah. No progress at all.
*  If the government was the private sector,
*  like the government was a business
*  and other people could compete to be the government,
*  if like, you know, like, if if if iPhones sucked,
*  Androids would just take over. Yeah.
*  They would, you know, but the reason why Androids are so good
*  is because iPhones are so good and everybody for it.
*  But if you had to have a fucking iPhone bitch, you'd have an iPhone one.
*  Yeah. They wouldn't even they have no reason to innovate.
*  Exactly. If everybody had to buy an iPhone,
*  our phones would suck dick. Yeah.
*  They'd be terrible. Yeah.
*  The reason why they're good is because of competition.
*  Yeah. And government doesn't have competition.
*  Doesn't have competition.
*  The only competition they have is other government, which is horseshit.
*  Yeah. Because it's fake.
*  It's all like funded by the same people.
*  You know, and it's not even profit driven.
*  Like I worked at a non for profit, a not for profit organization
*  for a few months, just as I was a comic trying to make money.
*  And I was like, oh, no one works hard because there's no bottom line.
*  There's no fear of losing your job.
*  No incentives. The government is the same.
*  Government employees, they just take whatever time off they want.
*  They don't get fired.
*  It's the cushiest job.
*  Every holiday off.
*  That was super evident during the lockdowns in Los Angeles,
*  because the government was so flippant about closing people's businesses
*  because they didn't lose any money.
*  Yeah. My thought was like, listen, if you're managing a city,
*  how about this? You want an incentive?
*  How about your income is based entirely on what the GDP of your city is?
*  Oh, that's sick. Yeah. Entirely.
*  So if you go in and whatever the GDP is, let's say the GDP is,
*  you know, one billion dollars, whatever it is.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  Let's say it's that if it dips below that, you lose money.
*  And if it goes above that, you probably get a little piece.
*  You get a little taste. Yeah.
*  Get a little taste.
*  And you're not allowed to make speeches for $250,000
*  when you're out of office. It's done.
*  Yeah. No, Hillary.
*  Yeah. Nobody wants to hear you talk for a quarter million.
*  What a fucking. That's crazy.
*  Yeah. That's bribery.
*  No one. You guys made deals.
*  Yeah. Even if it's not a said deal, it's an understanding.
*  I also I don't know if this is a reason.
*  None of these, I don't know if they're reasonable,
*  but the idea of getting reelected.
*  I was like at some point, I was like, oh, they're just
*  they don't care about making the city better.
*  They just want to get reelected.
*  So I'll go to these special interest groups who I know will vote for me.
*  This voting block that I know vote for me.
*  I'll make them happy and I'll get reelected.
*  If you just gave a president or whoever one six to eight year term,
*  but one term and then you're out,
*  I think it would help mitigate a lot of the useless stuff that they do.
*  Slightly. But you would still get the vice president taking over afterwards.
*  They would set that person up.
*  They would make sure they maintain power.
*  They try to keep the same staff.
*  The thing about Biden right now, people like, why does Biden want to run again?
*  Even if he doesn't really want to run again, his staff wants him to run again,
*  because if he doesn't run again, if he doesn't win, they're all out of jobs.
*  So, yeah, if you're that lady who's the White House press secretary, you're fucked.
*  Yeah. It's like who the hell is going to hire you?
*  The next person is not going to hire you to be the White House press secretary.
*  Yeah, you're terrible. Yeah.
*  You have to stay there.
*  But you get a job doing something from White House press secretary.
*  They're not going to be like, hey, Walmart is hiring greeters.
*  There's a lot of them female admirals, those fucking fake female admirals.
*  A lot of those people that you see in the White House,
*  like the head of health, whatever the fuck that person is.
*  Like that person getting a job after Biden gets rid of him.
*  You think Trump's going to hire that guy?
*  Yeah, I just figure there's something out maybe outside of government, but something.
*  They got to keep that job.
*  They want to keep that job.
*  All those people that are working in the administration,
*  they're working very hard to keep that job.
*  And that's why you see all this crazy pressure on Trump.
*  That's a big part of it.
*  Big part of it is because he's going to crack heads.
*  So there's a lot of united people trying to keep him out.
*  Yeah, I think I was saying this on stage or something, but Trump.
*  I didn't have a problem with Trump, but the noise that Trump brought,
*  I was like, I don't want it anymore.
*  I don't. It's just too much infighting.
*  I feel like there's he's learned there's like a Trump 2.0 as of now,
*  where he's like, let me just not say the race baiting shit and let me just keep it here.
*  And I think most people, the casuals are like, I could get on board with this guy.
*  Well, also, the race baiting shit is a little bit more effective now
*  if they let in 30 million people.
*  Oh, fair enough.
*  If you want to talk about the fears of immigration.
*  Yeah. Now people see it.
*  They see the real consequences.
*  I mean, they're letting murderers out. No bail.
*  That's the whole thing is wild.
*  Yeah. Getting accused of murder.
*  They're getting arrested and then they let them right out. Yeah.
*  This is a wild fucking time.
*  And no one wants to be in law enforcement.
*  No one wants that job. Yeah.
*  It's a hard job. Nobody cares about you.
*  They treat you like you're the fucking enemy.
*  Nobody respects you.
*  I'm taking your word for all this.
*  People respect.
*  I'm very blissfully ignorant, so I'm just taking your word for all this right now.
*  Really? You're selling me.
*  I don't know.
*  Well, you know, the defund the police thing.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that was crazy.
*  And so then there's this attitude that the police were the problem.
*  Yeah. And it crazy like one instance captured by one person to the camera.
*  And it just starts a fire keg.
*  Yeah. Well, look, I've been with a I was with Damian Lemon,
*  black comedian friend of mine, and he got like I was with him when we got racially profiled.
*  He was going they pulled him over.
*  They're like, you're doing 24 search the car, brought other cops.
*  They were searching me like, do you have any drugs?
*  I was like, I've never done a drug in my life.
*  And he was like, you better be honest right now.
*  This is your chance. They set us on the curb.
*  We go home. And then I look up, I'm like, they kept saying we're doing 24.
*  What's the thing with 24?
*  I looked up and just Google 24 miles an hour in New York City.
*  The speed limit was 25.
*  So he was under the speed limit.
*  And they still pulled us over.
*  Whole thing. Now, he had one of these.
*  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
*  It pulled him over for going under the speed.
*  Here's what Bob.
*  It's not a 20. There's not a 20 zone.
*  Apparently, it's 25 from what I Google those 25, but even 24 to 20.
*  It's like crazy. Yeah.
*  Who's pulling you over? How do you know?
*  Yeah. Especially if you have a fast car like you.
*  You got to look down every five seconds.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And so the one thing I think they were bothered by is a fan of his who was a cop
*  gave him like the New York City vest that you can like park wherever you want to.
*  And so he was just parking and they were upset about that.
*  But like 24 and then calling backup cars and all that.
*  I was like, there's something here racial going on.
*  I've never had this.
*  I've had a racist thing after 9-11, maybe one or two.
*  But like that, I was like, oh, I see why this is.
*  And he was just this was not that unusual for him.
*  I was like, this is crazy.
*  And he was like, what can you do?
*  Racial profiling is 100 percent legit. Yeah.
*  There's no doubt.
*  So I think when you see these stories, Philan O'Castile, I think was his name
*  and the George Floyd or whatever, I think black people are like,
*  I've been through that and I've been trying to tell you that happens.
*  And y'all don't want to listen to me.
*  Now you're seeing it.
*  And then the storm comes.
*  Anybody that denies it happens, you're denying humans,
*  you're denying human nature.
*  You know how people are. Yeah.
*  The real root of that is poverty and crime and gangs and drugs.
*  And no one's doing anything to stop that. Yeah.
*  They're not doing a goddamn thing to stop that.
*  Yeah. And hiring more cops is, you know, train them better.
*  Yeah. Do do everything you have to do.
*  Make sure that the cops are taken care of. But.
*  Got to fix the problem.
*  If you don't fix the problem, it's just going to keep happening
*  over and over and over again. Yeah.
*  We had this guy on a long time ago that was a cop in Baltimore.
*  And while he was a cop in Baltimore and his whole thing was about understanding
*  the systemic racism involved in policing and that he didn't really realize it.
*  He was pretty honest about it.
*  I was one of the bad guys until it like dawned on me what was going on.
*  I was the cop that didn't give a shit about the people.
*  You know, I was a guy would chase people down and yell at them.
*  But then over time, one of the things that they found, they found a police ledger,
*  like they found a, you know, like a report of crime in the area in the 1970s.
*  It was like some old file. Yeah.
*  And he's going through this old files like, oh, my God, it's the same crimes
*  in the same place. But it's.
*  40 years ago, huh?
*  Like, this is fucking insane. Yeah, this is insane.
*  Like, how is this possible? Yeah.
*  How is it like 1970, the same crimes are here today?
*  This is nuts.
*  And then he realized, like, oh, my God, this is like this is a broken system.
*  And then there's the whole redlining thing.
*  Yeah. You wouldn't if you were black, you couldn't buy homes in certain areas.
*  Like they had systemic racist practices and then they never did anything about it.
*  And then they had horrible policing.
*  And then, you know, the wire, you got fucking gangs and drugs.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And he realized it.
*  It was like, oh, my God, like, this is this is a broken system.
*  So then he just started talking, going on podcasts and talking to people about it.
*  What was it? Did he have a proposed solution to fixing the system?
*  I mean, he's a cop. I mean, I don't know if that's his thing.
*  He probably had some ideas.
*  I don't remember. Honestly, I've talked to too many people, but someone's got to do something.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what you would do to do it, but it would be a long process.
*  If you think about like you got to go all the way back to Jim Crow.
*  So you go to slavery. And then what happens after slavery?
*  Well, they don't have slavery anymore.
*  But you know what they do do?
*  They lock up black men for almost nothing and then force them to be slaves in prison.
*  Yeah. And they create things.
*  They work on the fucking chain gang. Yeah.
*  All that shit is slavery. Yeah.
*  It's just and they would find ways to process.
*  Look, we know marijuana.
*  I've done a ton of podcasts with Josh Dubin, who used to work with the Innocence Project.
*  And now he's got his own thing with the Perlmutter Center.
*  But they they find people that are wrongfully convicted and help them get out.
*  We've got a bunch of those guys come on the podcast, including one guy who came on,
*  who was actually guilty.
*  He was guilty before and we knew he was guilty.
*  He got 50 years. Right.
*  And then he was talking about he turned his life around.
*  And it's like a month after he was on the podcast.
*  How long was it after he was on the podcast?
*  Two months, maybe two months.
*  Cut some dude's head off. Yeah.
*  And he was wearing a blonde wig and a homey didn't understand new HD security cameras.
*  Like this dude put a blonde wig on crystal clear footage of him
*  was goatee on wearing a blonde wig, carrying some dude's head.
*  How sold were you in the room with him?
*  How good was he at selling himself as this reformed person?
*  Well, you know, what does it mean?
*  OK, so he didn't kill anybody in jail.
*  And then he's out now and he's got this new lease on life.
*  And he's out and he, you know, he's trying to do something different in his life.
*  When you listen to his explanation of what happened, why he went to jail.
*  So he was a drug dealer. Right.
*  And he had gone to jail before and some dude owed him money.
*  Some dude, some drug deal.
*  And the guy was like, fuck you.
*  So he found the guy and he pistol whipped him and he robbed him.
*  OK. And he got 50 years for that. Right.
*  And it was it was he was a habitual criminal for sure.
*  So should he have gotten 50 years for that?
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I mean, it seems like it seems like when he got out,
*  he was kind of a bad guy.
*  But was he was that because he spent 25 fucking years in jail?
*  Because it was 20.
*  I think he did 25 years before they let 24 before they let him out,
*  which is an insane amount of time to be locked up in a prison
*  and then expect to acclimate.
*  So you're saying did prison make him much worse?
*  Prison make him much worse because it certainly can with some people.
*  But we've had people on that were innocent and prison made them amazing.
*  I mean, something about like the constant studying
*  and the accepting your situation in life, even though you were innocent.
*  And then a lot of those guys got released.
*  And it's crazy to see them like they lost 20 years of their life
*  for something that was bullshit, complete bullshit.
*  And then you find out the cops and the prosecutors
*  who were involved in their case had done that to many, many, many people.
*  That's another thing that people need to take into consideration.
*  How fucking dirty some people involved in prosecuting and convicting people are.
*  Yeah. You remember that guy in Pennsylvania?
*  There was a guy in Pennsylvania who was a judge and went to jail
*  because it turns out that he was getting paid to have kids arrested
*  and sentence them into juvenile centers.
*  Wow. So he was getting a kickback.
*  He was getting kicked back from the center.
*  So the state has to pay for the population. Right.
*  And then you have private prisons, which is even more sinister.
*  Because then it's not just the incentive of the people
*  that are working in the prison and the prison guards union, which is a real thing.
*  Prison guards unions work to stop marijuana laws from being.
*  Really? Yeah, because they want people to get arrested
*  so that people go to jail.
*  So they have jobs, which is fucking crazy to think.
*  But private prisons make money off people being incarcerated.
*  If you make money off a person being incarcerated,
*  now you have an incentive for incarcerating people.
*  Just like pharmaceutical drug companies have an incentive
*  to give you drugs you might not even need.
*  Yeah, a thousand percent. Because they make money doing that.
*  And if you're a private prison, you don't even have to treat them that well
*  because they're prisoners.
*  Who's really going to get upset on their behalf?
*  A few people that we're not going to take seriously.
*  So if I don't if their conditions suck, it's prison.
*  They're prisoners. Why do I need to treat them well?
*  Nobody cares. Yeah.
*  I mean, there's people that complain, but listen, there's some horrific
*  conditions in prison right now in this country. Yeah.
*  And different prisons have different conditions and people know it.
*  And they try to get transferred to a prison that's lighter. Yeah.
*  It's not really a necessarily correctional facility.
*  It's called that. But the aim is not correcting.
*  It's it's crazy. Yeah.
*  It's crazy when you look at the rest of the world,
*  like how many more people the United States incarcerates.
*  There is a business.
*  Capitalism has flaws.
*  And one of the flaws of capitalism is that if you have something
*  that generates income from a specific action, it's going to encourage that action.
*  It wants more of that.
*  And then if it's making tremendous amounts of money, like the private prison complex,
*  you're going to be able to manipulate things.
*  You're going to be able to farm. Yeah.
*  Like you said, that same thing.
*  Yeah. Everybody's got to take the drug.
*  And then every other drug demonize it.
*  Go on television, tell people it's veterinary medicine.
*  We saw it. We saw it in real time.
*  We saw we saw the devil.
*  We really saw the devil.
*  We saw the real thing. Yeah.
*  And you know, and now they're forced to admit it.
*  I mean, even the fucking CDC had to take down
*  some insane amount of tweets that they were talking about.
*  Ivermectin. Really?
*  They had a debt that they lost in court.
*  They had to take it down. Yeah.
*  The whole the whole thing was the FDA or CDC.
*  I also don't I'm not sure that they well, they took down a bunch of them.
*  What are you thinking?
*  What's going through your brain when CNN is doing that, like in real time,
*  when you're looking at you and being like, that's not what I looked like.
*  What are you thinking in that moment as it's happening?
*  Like the first thought is your first thought is like this is
*  this will work for a little bit until I start talking. OK.
*  Because this is not going to work.
*  First of all, this is they didn't understand that I had way more people
*  listen to my podcast than they have way more.
*  Yeah. So also a multiplier.
*  Yeah. Also, like that's crazy.
*  If you think you're going to make me look yellow, like the video
*  still on my Instagram, you fucking idiot.
*  Yeah. Everybody could see what I really looked like.
*  I was better in three days. Yeah.
*  Like and you're upset.
*  But because one of the medications that my fucking doctor prescribed.
*  Yeah. I talked about a stack of medications that I took.
*  I wasn't on TV saying, hey, kids, you don't need to get vaccinated.
*  Just take Ivermectin. Yeah.
*  No. All I said was I got covid.
*  I can't go to the I was doing shows with Chappelle that weekend.
*  I can't go because I have covid, but I feel great.
*  I took this. We threw the kitchen sink at it and I feel better.
*  And then I was like, Rogan's taking veterinary medication.
*  You were canceling the show, which is what you're supposed to do.
*  Yeah. I immediately realized like, wow, this is how dirty it really is.
*  Yeah. It was the same verbiage everywhere.
*  Horse dewormer.
*  It was something that was they were saying it to make you look foolish.
*  They weren't saying a medicine that won the Nobel Prize, a medicine
*  that's been used in it's part of the World Health Organization's
*  list of essential medicines, a medicine that's been prescribed billions of times.
*  They weren't saying that.
*  I'm messing with this.
*  Say one of the safest drug profiles known.
*  Yeah, we're saying that.
*  I didn't even know any of this worst.
*  You were. Yeah, because the cash they were they were banking on the idea
*  that the casual observer doesn't understand how corrupt everything is
*  and that they could just feed them bad information.
*  But in the age of the Internet, when the government says things
*  and everybody knows that it's not true or when the media says things
*  and everybody knows it's not true.
*  It doesn't work forever.
*  It works in the beginning.
*  And there's still people out there that think I took veterinary medicine.
*  There's still people that think I was an idiot for taking ivermectin.
*  There's yeah, there's a bunch of people that do they their surface level readers.
*  They read headlines.
*  They watch a quick clip on CNN.
*  That's their consumption of media. Right.
*  But most people are not like that anymore.
*  Most people have a real keen understanding
*  that these people are like viciously corrupt and coordinated.
*  And when they coordinated in that way, it was such a dumb checkers move.
*  Yeah. A chess game. Yeah.
*  It's just a stupid move. You're playing tic tac toe.
*  This is retarded.
*  Similar to what people are feeling about the Trump prosecution.
*  Like you're trying to make this guy look bad and it's only going to make me like him more.
*  Also, you're doing it in a city that's overrun with crime
*  where women are getting punched in the face on the street.
*  You're you're you're you know, you've got people pushing people in front of trains.
*  You've got so many real criminals that you're just letting out of jail with no bail.
*  Like this is so fun because we we talk about this on the pod.
*  And I don't again, I see what I will see is like I see more people
*  just doing heroin on the street, which is crazy.
*  You see him doing heroin. You see him actively shooting up.
*  I don't feel super unsafe.
*  There's a couple of blocks in Manhattan, lower, I guess, the lower, like not like
*  one hundred and below where I'm like I walk around a lot and I'm like,
*  I'd be careful in these blocks.
*  But for the most part, I don't feel it.
*  You remember back in the day when you go to the McDonald's on
*  McDougal right by the cellar? Mm hmm.
*  You'd walk into there and you'd be like, keep just have your head on a swivel.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There's a few blocks in New York where I feel that way now, but largely I feel OK.
*  I don't. And again, I'm a guy that's like I'm a mark.
*  So let's let's have your head on a swivel.
*  But I don't feel that as much walking through the city.
*  It is definitely the heroin thing is wild, but it is different, right?
*  It feels different.
*  I also think maybe I was privileged to move in the safest time New York has
*  probably ever seen. Like I moved in 08.
*  I would walk home from New York Comedy Club, which is on like twenty third
*  and second to my apartment on 50th and eighth at one in the morning.
*  Barely even think about.
*  Damn, you'd walk that far. Yeah, it's just how long that take.
*  That forty five minutes like a forty five minute walk.
*  Nothing crazy. Yeah.
*  Yeah. A little exercise.
*  You just walk off kind of the adrenaline or just whatever.
*  I said it's probably good for going over your material.
*  Yeah. And then you kind of you're going over your set.
*  You're just taking it all in.
*  Taking some time. It was a great walk.
*  It's peaceful at night.
*  It's New York is rarely peaceful.
*  So it's just quiet.
*  Now, I don't know if I would do that.
*  But back then, it was just like wasn't even a thought.
*  And it was so safe.
*  I really probably took for granted how safe New York was back then.
*  And now I don't think it's as safe, but I don't.
*  It's not the 70s or 80s for sure.
*  Yeah, it's not the 70s.
*  I went there in the 80s.
*  I went there for a karate tournament in like 19.
*  How to be like 86, 87 somewhere around then.
*  And I remember thinking like this place is nuts.
*  Yeah, we went through Times Square.
*  I was like, this is I heard Times Square was just like hookers and it was all like
*  keep shows. Yeah, just weirdos.
*  Yeah. And now it's an Eminem store.
*  You ever see that movie?
*  Was it what was the movie with Dustin Hoffman and John Voight?
*  I don't know. Midnight Cowboy.
*  Was about like gay hustlers in New York.
*  Yeah, Midnight Cowboy.
*  But that's like Times Square.
*  When people thought of Times Square, they thought of like these nudie
*  movie theaters and peep shows and just seedy drug dealers, weirdos.
*  Now it's all like fucking.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  Good fucking movie, man.
*  I haven't watched that movie in forever.
*  Small time con, man.
*  You know, they made some artistic movies back then that I just didn't realize.
*  It's like Serpico. What's the movie?
*  Serpico.
*  Not just Serpico.
*  There's a one where Al Pacino is a dog day afternoon, maybe where he's robbing
*  the bank or something.
*  And he's trying to pay for his boyfriend's sex change operations.
*  I'm like, that movie being around back then blew my mind because I assume
*  they were so conservative that movie would not be an Al Pacino led film.
*  Well, that was actually a true story.
*  I didn't know that.
*  But yeah, Dog Day Afternoon is based on a true story.
*  I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  In my brain, this was such a puritanical time in entertainment that a movie,
*  even if it's a true story like this, would never get made.
*  Well, I think you could make that movie today.
*  Today, for sure. But again, we you think society's gotten so much more progressive
*  and entertainment has gotten so much more liberal.
*  Now this movie makes perfect sense.
*  And it's about trans acceptance and all this stuff.
*  And this was just a movie.
*  It's not just that. Now it's in vogue.
*  You know, it's like Hollywood has no soul.
*  They're not like, you know, like we're being more progressive.
*  They just like think this is all the winds going that way.
*  Let's go that way. Everyone should be trans.
*  Like South Park said, make it a chick and make it gay.
*  Yeah, absolutely, dude. Absolutely.
*  I am. I'm so glad we have as comics realize we don't need that validation anymore.
*  We got lucky, dude.
*  We got lucky because of this thing that's going on right now.
*  Well, actually, I think this thing that's going on right now couldn't be going on
*  right now without the influence of the Internet. Right.
*  The Internet has created this mind virus that's sweeping through college campuses.
*  And yeah, and also the universities and the Marxist philosophies
*  that they've been pushing in universities because of they've all been infiltrated by Russia,
*  by the former Soviet Union and now by China and Russia together.
*  For sure, they're influencing all they they they they they push the woken
*  teachers, the woken professors, the nuttiest policies.
*  And they're literally doing it to deteriorate the fabric of American democracy.
*  They have like plans for it.
*  They've thought about like Yuri Besmanov talked about this in 1984.
*  I've seen that clip. It's crazy.
*  Crazy. It's crazy.
*  When you watch it today, they were right.
*  It's very prophetic. He did it.
*  Yeah. They did it.
*  Thousand percent, thousand percent.
*  But, you know, the Internet came along and threw gasoline on all those plans
*  and made it much more chaotic.
*  But in doing so, it also created this other thing.
*  Luckily, because I think this other thing that we're doing right now,
*  podcasts being completely unregulated and being on even platforms
*  that are corporate platforms like YouTube, pretty fucking unregulated.
*  No one's in flagrant.
*  No one's sitting down with you guys, making sure you don't say anything wild.
*  Correct. You upload it.
*  And if you say something too wild, they'll flag it or they'll demonetize you.
*  But that's just that could not have existed.
*  Yeah. In any other time.
*  And so in the time where you have the most extreme polar social issues
*  and then you also have the most freedom of speech.
*  Yeah.
*  And even though like they're trying to crack down on it with a lot of these
*  a lot of I mean, I don't know how much you paid attention to the Twitter files.
*  Did you pay attention to that?
*  A little bit. A little bit.
*  Fucking government was literally trying to censor true information.
*  Yeah. That was on Twitter and they were successful.
*  They infiltrated the intelligence agencies, infiltrated various different
*  social media platforms.
*  And if it wasn't for Elon, we wouldn't know.
*  We would not know if it wasn't for Matt Taibbi and all those people that like
*  and Michael Schellenberger, Barry Weiss and all those people who went through
*  the Twitter files and like, look at this. This is crazy.
*  Yeah. This is crazy.
*  You wouldn't know that the actual government itself
*  is trying to sculpt the way people are allowed to disseminate information
*  and see the world.
*  Yeah, because they've always been able to control everything.
*  Right. And now it's like, well, we can control a little bit here and there.
*  See what we can do.
*  Tucker Carlson on the other day and explained to me Watergate.
*  Yeah. And I was like, what?
*  Like Watergate, there was an intelligence officer
*  who became a reporter, and that's Bob Woodward.
*  Oh, I didn't know he was an intelligence officer.
*  Young guy. Wow.
*  Became a reporter like right away.
*  First assignment. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which never happens.
*  Yeah, never happens. Yeah.
*  The people that broke into the office, CIA agents,
*  CIA informants, CIA employees.
*  And then Gerald Ford was on the Warren Commission,
*  and he was the only one that they would accept
*  for Richard Nixon's vice president.
*  The other guy, Spiro Agnew, they hit him with I think was tax evasion.
*  So he's out. They get rid of him.
*  And then they get Nixon in there.
*  And then they get him with this whole Watergate.
*  Yeah. And they get rid of him.
*  And then he was the most apparently he was the most popular president
*  in U.S. history.
*  And he won the election by the largest margin in U.S. history.
*  Wow. And they got rid of him in two years.
*  And it was a complete coup.
*  Like they they took him out. Nixon. Yes. Wow.
*  And one of the well, what Tucker was saying, I don't know if this is true,
*  but what Tucker was saying was that Nixon was he was very interested
*  in the Kennedy assassination.
*  And he had said to the head of the CIA, I know why they killed JFK.
*  Wow. And he said nothing.
*  He just stared at him.
*  Really? Apparently, it's on video or it's on video or audio or whatever it is.
*  You could you could.
*  So he was just explaining to me, I'd never known that.
*  I thought Nixon was corrupt.
*  These intrepid reporters, these fucking go getters.
*  Yeah. They busted them and they printed this thing.
*  And wow, we caught him. He's a crook.
*  I still tend to believe that one more.
*  I was I'm not going to research, I'll be honest.
*  I want to pretend I'm going to research.
*  But you don't have to research it.
*  If you just listen to what Tucker said.
*  Yeah. Just listen to what he actually said about it.
*  We play it for you. Do we have a clip of that?
*  Is there a clip of that?
*  If you want, if you listen to what he's saying, you're like, wait, what?
*  Like, I didn't know that.
*  I remember watching all the president's men and being like, oh,
*  I see how journalism was important.
*  These two guys just changed the course of global history.
*  Bro, that might as well be a Chuck Norris movie.
*  That shit's straight fiction, son.
*  All right, dude, my wife got a master's in journalism.
*  I'm like, yo, what an important job this could be.
*  It is an important job.
*  No, journal real journalism is very important.
*  And real journalism journalism is critical for people to understand.
*  But I think a lot of the real journalism now is happening independently.
*  It's these people that they publish on sub stack and they have a large following
*  because people like Glenn Greenwald, people know that they can trust them.
*  They're going to give you the straight dope, whether or not it's uncomfortable
*  for you or not. That's real journalism.
*  That's really important.
*  But as soon as you start working for a massive corporate entity
*  like the New York Times or any other one, Washington Post, figure out what it is.
*  And that's where the Woodward and Bernstein.
*  That's what they were working for the Washington Post.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Do you find it?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  OK, check this out.
*  Well, the New York Times does that all the time.
*  But but bizarre that they wouldn't have an issue with the government
*  tapping into your phone.
*  They work for the government.
*  Are you kidding? Right.
*  The New York Times.
*  Yeah, the New York Times is a conduit for the lies of government.
*  That's what it is. It's their tool.
*  And they're perfectly aware of that.
*  I mean, I used to write for the New York Times as a freelancer.
*  I mean, I've been around the New York Times a lot.
*  And there are.
*  Yeah, there are a lot of really smart people there.
*  For sure. Even now, I would less so now.
*  But there's still, I think, smart people there.
*  There are. I know some.
*  And they know.
*  But they think that that, you know, it's worth it
*  because they're bringing information or I don't know what they think, actually.
*  But no, they're they're tools of power.
*  And that's like the one thing that you're not allowed to be.
*  Even if you think the power is good, like maybe they all support
*  the agenda of the US government destabilizing the world
*  and impoverishing their own population.
*  Maybe they're on board with that.
*  Even if they are, they shouldn't do it because the job of the media,
*  the press is to keep power in check.
*  You are kind of like the seat belt, right?
*  You know, you make sure that.
*  Things don't go too far. So
*  and they're not doing that, they're acting as a willing handmaiden.
*  When do you think that's switched?
*  I think it's been the case for a long time.
*  I mean, if you look at what happened to Richard Nixon,
*  which I, of course, did not understand at all.
*  Richard Nixon was taken out by the FBI and CIA and
*  with the help of Bob Woodward, who was a Washington Post reporter
*  who had been a naval intelligence officer
*  working in the White House, working in the Nixon White House.
*  And then he shows up like a year later.
*  And he's this brand new reporter.
*  He'd never been a journalist at all.
*  He's a naval intel officer.
*  The famous Bob Woodward, we all revere.
*  And he's at the Washington Post.
*  And somehow he gets the biggest story in the history of the Washington
*  Post. He's the lead guy in that story.
*  Well, I worked in a newspaper.
*  I've been in the news business my whole life.
*  That is not how it works.
*  You don't take a kid like his first day from a totally unrelated business
*  and put him on the biggest story.
*  But he was he was that guy.
*  And who is his main source for watergate?
*  Oh, the number two guy at the FBI.
*  Oh, so you have the naval intelligence officer
*  working with the FBI official to destroy the president.
*  OK, so that's a deep state coup.
*  What else? How would you describe that?
*  If that happened in Guatemala, what would you say?
*  And yet the way it was framed and the way that I accepted for decades was,
*  oh, this intrepid reporter fought power.
*  No, no, no. This intrepid reporter, Bob Woodward, was a tool of power,
*  secret power, which is the most threatening kind to bounce
*  the single most popular president in American history,
*  Richard Nixon, from office before the end of his term and replace him with who?
*  Oh, Gerald Ford, who sat on the Warren Commission.
*  Now, how did Gerald Ford get to be Richard Nixon's vice president?
*  Well, because Carl Albert, the Democrat speaker of the House,
*  told him, you must choose him.
*  We will only confirm him when they sent the actual elected vice president away
*  for tax evasion, Spiro Agnew of Maryland.
*  So you have a complete setup like an absolute.
*  Gerald Ford, the only unelected president
*  in American history, actually sat on the Warren Commission.
*  Something else that I accepted at face value until I looked at it,
*  I was like, that's completely insane.
*  You didn't want to interview Jack Ruby in your investigation
*  of the assassination. OK, you're fake.
*  Yeah, he was on the Warren Commission.
*  And so sorry for the long story, but the point is like that
*  that happened in front of all of us.
*  But the way it was framed cloaked the obvious reality of it.
*  The people who broke into the Watergate office building
*  from which the name is taken Watergate.
*  I think it was six of them or seven of them.
*  All but one was a CIA employee.
*  That that's real. It's like look it up on Google.
*  So the whole thing, Richard Nixon was elected by more votes
*  than any president in American history in the 1972 election.
*  He was the most popular by votes, which is the only way
*  we can really measure popularity, the most popular president.
*  In his reelection campaign and two years later, he's gone.
*  Undone by a naval intel officer.
*  The number two guy at the FBI and a bunch of CIA employees.
*  You tell me what that is.
*  Those are the facts. Those are not disputed facts.
*  That's not crackpot. Why?
*  Yeah, I mean, I need to I need to look into this. I just.
*  Yeah, I need to look into it, too.
*  He said it. I'm taking it at face value and I'm just telling everybody.
*  I'm not taking it at face value.
*  I'm not taking it at face value because he said it.
*  It's been confirmed by other people to me.
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's true.
*  It's crazy. He didn't lie.
*  If he lied, he'd be in real trouble and the people would be saying
*  what he's saying is not true.
*  That's fair. Bunch of stories written about it.
*  That's fair. No, that's actually what happened.
*  I we talk about this on Flake.
*  We had Vivek Ramaswamy on the pod.
*  And again, he's great.
*  I think he's a very poor communicator of his message. Really?
*  Yeah, because you'll talk about the deep state and all these things that when
*  if you're like me, who is a casual guy, who I think is a larger percentage
*  of guys that really want than who really want to do the research.
*  They're like, this is deep state, deep state.
*  And he'll talk about it as if it's just conspiratorial, dark, sinister,
*  rub their hands together, kind of.
*  And he's like, no, basically, it's just bureaucracy.
*  There's a lot of unnecessary jobs in the government.
*  I just want to cut the fat out.
*  And we might lose some muscle by cutting it out.
*  But I think these people are just kind of like they're parasites,
*  bureaucrats, just unnecessary jobs.
*  And they are controlling things in a way that is just for self-preservation.
*  And they think they know what's best for us, but they don't.
*  And it's kind of arrogant, but it's like well-meaning, well-intended.
*  I think they frame it in that it's best for us.
*  He's like, I really self-preservation.
*  Yeah. But he said, I think they truly believe.
*  And it's kind of like an elitist thing where they're like,
*  these people don't know what's good for them.
*  We know what's good for them, which is very snobby.
*  But the intention is we know what's good for them.
*  Let's do this. And maybe at the root, it's self-interest.
*  But if he called it the managerial class or bureaucracy instead of the deep state,
*  I think people would listen more.
*  They'd be more inclined to be like, let's see what this guy has to say.
*  But a president talking about the deep state is a tough sell to the large majority of people.
*  It is, but it like rings true with Trump people.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Deep state.
*  Like that's a good statement.
*  Yeah. I like that sound.
*  And if he can get on a platform where he can really put his thought,
*  because I think his brain just functions at a high level.
*  I think he thinks this is how we're going to hear it.
*  He's like, I mean, like, OK, these people aren't as smart.
*  I mean, they need to hear deep state. That's what's going to work.
*  Well, he's also what is he? 38?
*  Yeah, he's 38, I think.
*  It's very young. Yes.
*  Incredibly young.
*  So he's learning this.
*  This is his first jaunt, right?
*  This is his first expedition into public speaking in front of the whole world about important issues.
*  Yeah. He's going to learn from that.
*  Just like we were saying, there's Trump 2.0,
*  Vivek 2.0 in, you know, 2028.
*  Vivek 2.0. Great. Vivek 3.0.
*  That guy's going to be fantastic.
*  Also, Vivek 2.0 will be in his 40s, which is easier to accept.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got a little gray in his hair.
*  That's what I like. A little bit of life experience.
*  A little life experience.
*  Because I'm 39, I don't know shit.
*  You know what I mean?
*  How can a guy your age be president? That's crazy.
*  Buddy, I could barely run a household. What are we talking about?
*  Exactly, right?
*  This guy's younger than you and he wants to be the president of the United States.
*  Insane. Insane.
*  Yeah, but I do think once he put it like that, I was like, oh, that's a guy I would vote for.
*  I just want to get rid of the unnecessary jobs.
*  My wife's both parents work for the government, state government.
*  They don't do anything.
*  The thing is, if all that stuff that Tucker's saying was true in the 1970s, 1972 or 74,
*  they're still doing that. They're going to do it to him.
*  Yeah. It's probably what they're doing to Trump.
*  Yeah.
*  There's an element of that, folks.
*  Even if you fucking hate Trump, you should be very concerned about this stuff, because
*  if this sets a precedent, if you can prosecute your political opponents and Republicans start doing it,
*  you're going to be furious too.
*  Yeah.
*  If all of a sudden, so he gets out and then there's a new political guy and let's imagine that Trump wins
*  and then it's Gavin Newsom.
*  And then the Trump administration starts going after Gavin Newsom.
*  And bringing him into court.
*  Yeah.
*  And having Republican judges run him up on charges.
*  Like if that and Republican prosecutors go after him, that's not good.
*  Yeah.
*  That's not good for the country.
*  That's not good for anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're all going to feel the same, the same people who are in 2016, like Hillary got the election
*  stolen because of Russia in 2020.
*  We're like, shut up, Trump supporters.
*  You guys are crazy.
*  And it just flips.
*  Yep.
*  And you guys are going to feel the exact same way if whoever you like on the Democrat side wins.
*  And then they do this.
*  People have to understand that almost every election for the past 20 years has been disputed.
*  There was the John Kerry election that was disputed.
*  I remember Trump.
*  Oh, no, sorry.
*  Sorry.
*  Bush and care and Al Gore.
*  Gore.
*  Yeah.
*  The dangling participles.
*  Right.
*  Is that what it was?
*  Hanging chads.
*  Hanging chads.
*  Dangling participles.
*  It's a word phrase.
*  That's hilarious.
*  It sounds just as dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The hanging chads.
*  Oh, that's stupid shit.
*  You know what's crazy?
*  I think they said Bush won Florida by like 500 votes.
*  And I think about like domino effect and the domino effect of that is insane.
*  Because eight years of Bush has what got us eight years of Obama.
*  I think people were so done with Bush that they were like, let's give a black guy a shot.
*  And then eight years of that, the white people that were kind of angry about Obama getting elected were like, fuck this.
*  Let's go to the guy that's going to piss them off the most.
*  Trump gets elected.
*  I feel like the domino effect of those 533 votes is crazy.
*  It's also Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  Oh, yes.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the invasion, the initial invasion of Afghanistan, initial invasion of Iraq.
*  Iraq for sure.
*  Absolutely.
*  No proof of that whatsoever.
*  Just 533 votes changed history forever.
*  Yeah.
*  That's one of the wildest ones that's ever been done.
*  Yeah.
*  The weapons of mass destruction.
*  That's a wild one.
*  Yeah.
*  And that no one went to jail for that.
*  No one got in trouble for that.
*  Like, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  How can you do that?
*  Yeah.
*  None of us questioned.
*  Can you imagine?
*  I remember in college one guy being like, this isn't real.
*  And we were all like, what are you talking about?
*  He was like, this is George Bush senior.
*  What war did his dad fight?
*  He got up and we're like, oh, fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't think about that.
*  Right.
*  And then you have George Bush, the one that won in whatever it was with the dangly chads.
*  Then you have 9-11.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So he was a super unpopular president in September.
*  And he gets 9-11 happens and then all of a sudden everybody's on his side and the whole
*  country's united.
*  And then all of a sudden we're invading Iraq like a year later.
*  Like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, what the fuck is going on?
*  And that is, I remember when the election was happening, they were like, no wartime
*  president loses.
*  Bush is going to win a second term.
*  And he won.
*  And when Bush's dad was in office, you know, when the first initial invasion of Iraq,
*  that was a weird one too, because it was like Iraq invaded Kuwait and then we invaded
*  Iraq and then we stopped short of overthrowing them.
*  Yeah.
*  It was weird.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, we'll leave you there.
*  We're going to get out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  I was just, you know, a term just struck me.
*  Remember Patriot missiles?
*  I was five years old and we got to hear about Patriot missiles.
*  And I was like, that's fucking awesome, man.
*  Patriot missiles.
*  We're such good guys.
*  And they had Scuds, which sounds wack.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Scud.
*  Yeah.
*  The marketing of.
*  Shitty ass missiles.
*  Great marketing though, honestly.
*  In 1990, Patriot missiles.
*  Yeah, we're going to kill thousands of innocent people, but patriotism.
*  They also, they did a lot of practicing then.
*  Yeah.
*  They, they, they use stuff that they know they weren't supposed to use.
*  And one of the things they did was these depleted uranium rounds.
*  Really?
*  Which is go right through tanks.
*  They fucked tanks up.
*  But the problem with depleted uranium rounds is it creates horrific radiation.
*  And all these soldiers were like going through the wreckage of these things and picking up
*  pieces of it and bringing it home as souvenirs and radiation sickness was a giant factor.
*  They called it Gulf War Syndrome after the first war, after Desert Storm.
*  For our soldiers?
*  For our soldiers.
*  Massive amounts of miscarriages and child birth defects and people got sick and they
*  called it Gulf War Syndrome and they were denied.
*  They were denied, but they were denying that it was real until investigative journalists
*  dug into it and found out that it was most likely the result of depleted uranium rounds.
*  Jesus Christ, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Apparently depleted uranium is the shit.
*  If you want to like fuck up tanks and stuff, like it just shoots right through them.
*  Used as weapons because it's so dense.
*  It self-ignites at high temperatures and pressures.
*  And because it becomes sharper as it penetrates armor plating, according to the
*  International Atomic Energy Agency, as depleted uranium penetrator strikes a target,
*  its surface temperature increases dramatically according to Oak Ridge Associated
*  Universities Museum of Radiation and Radioactivity.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  So it's like the ultimate round for like stopping tanks.
*  Just goes through them like butter.
*  Boom.
*  But the problem is it's depleted uranium is like insanely toxic.
*  Yeah.
*  And so Google like whatever happened with Gulf War Syndrome.
*  What I'm looking at is from recent, we sent some to Ukraine recently.
*  What does it say?
*  Oh, we sent some to Ukraine.
*  Of course.
*  We probably got a bunch laying around when they made it illegal.
*  Yeah.
*  Pentagon said it will send depleted uranium armor piercing ammunition to Ukraine as a
*  part of its new assistant package.
*  A step senior Russian official called a criminal act.
*  Here's a look at the concerns.
*  Wow.
*  And then I just, there's a lot of big gaps in here.
*  So this is now, but Google Gulf War Syndrome cause.
*  Man, the fallout from just serving our side in war.
*  Chemical warfare, particularly nerve gas.
*  Okay.
*  Possible causes of Gulf War Syndrome.
*  Possible causes include chemical warfare agents, particularly nerve gas or pry.
*  What's that word?
*  Pry it.
*  Do stick mean bromide, which is given as a preventive measure to soldiers likely to be
*  exposed to chemical warfare agents.
*  So that might've fucked them up too.
*  Psychological factors such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
*  But what about Google Gulf War Syndrome depleted uranium?
*  Just do instead of cause just depleted uranium.
*  Yeah.
*  Depleted uranium is both a chemotoxic and radio toxic element.
*  Depleted uranium may be one of the causes for the so-called Gulf War illness.
*  Proposed effects of depleted uranium may be especially harmful if
*  mitochondrial DNA is damaged.
*  Did depleted uranium cause Gulf War Syndrome?
*  Click on that.
*  What does that say?
*  The illness suffered by soldiers who took part in the Gulf War Syndrome was not caused
*  by inhaling depleted uranium, according to a scientific study.
*  Instead, researchers believe Gulf War Syndrome may be due to soldiers being exposed to
*  the nerve agent sarin.
*  So there's probably a bunch of misinformation that's put out by official people in
*  regards to that.
*  But I would imagine that would play a factor if depleted uranium was used.
*  And I know that a lot of the people, one of the things that they talked about, there
*  was a documentary done on Gulf War Syndrome and these people that were actually going
*  through the wreckage of tanks, wound up getting it.
*  And they were talking about it that they didn't know.
*  Yeah, the burn pits that John Stewart talked about.
*  That's a big one.
*  Yeah, that's a big one.
*  He's such a hero for like actually bringing attention to that.
*  That guy's the greatest.
*  That's fucking terrifying that they would burn all their stuff and anybody would be
*  downwind of that.
*  It would be breathing in toxic fumes.
*  Yeah.
*  I have some buddies who served over there and they would talk about how horrific it
*  was.
*  Really?
*  Man, that's what I'm saying.
*  Even if you survive war, you come home, who knows you're going to have Gulf War
*  Syndrome.
*  Also, like how little do they give a fuck about you if they burn toxic shit and it
*  goes downwind and just runs through the camp?
*  Being a being a government, I think this is why there's like some level of
*  sociopathy involved is you have to be OK with this baseline level of innocent
*  death, I think.
*  It's just what it is.
*  And that's a crazy thought.
*  Well, that's the justification for Israel bombing Palestine.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  You have to be this is war and this is Hamas's fault that those innocent people
*  are there.
*  I'm like, yo.
*  Yeah, not our fault.
*  That is a crazy way to think.
*  Hey, this is what war is all about.
*  Like, says who?
*  Yeah.
*  Says the only way to do war is just the only way that this can actually done.
*  There's no other way that takes longer and kills less innocent people.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  This is it.
*  The only way.
*  Yeah.
*  You want a swat of fly, you got a swat of fly with a fly swatter.
*  That's it.
*  It's also easy to talk like that when you're on the winning side of it.
*  Or you're not anywhere near it.
*  Or not.
*  You're here.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You're here in America.
*  Yeah.
*  I was watching some video footage that I thought was legit and it's not.
*  And it's I sent it to Shane Gillis and then I realized after I sent it to him,
*  Hey, man, I think this is a fucking video game.
*  I think.
*  But let me let me show you because it's so crazy because it seems so it's YouTube,
*  but it seems so realistic.
*  I'm stunned by how good video games are now.
*  Check this out, Jamie.
*  I just sent it to you.
*  Remember the Ghost of Keev we were reading about when the Ukraine and Russia war started?
*  It was a fucking video game.
*  Video game footage.
*  I bought in.
*  I was like, this guy's awesome.
*  Bro, this looks so good.
*  This looks so good.
*  I thought this was like some high resolution government footage where they were just showing you what they can do now.
*  Look at this.
*  Go full screen.
*  Because this is this looks so dope.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh shit.
*  It looks like a video game for sure.
*  Yeah, that was going to wake.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  It sounds crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  This makes me want to play video games though.
*  Yeah, I want to play this game.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  How good are fucking video games now?
*  It's only going to get better, dude.
*  That's a real problem.
*  You're going to live in that in five years.
*  100%.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're going to love it.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to be happy.
*  But there was some stuff.
*  Back it up a little bit, Jamie, because they go back and forth from black and white.
*  They show the rockets headed towards it.
*  A little further.
*  Yeah, right there.
*  Back it right there.
*  Watch.
*  Check this out.
*  Look at this.
*  When they show like the whatever sensors that they're using in this video game to track
*  missiles.
*  Check this out.
*  Oh, this is crazy.
*  And then they have a camera on the missile.
*  Wow.
*  Now this seems crazy real.
*  It's crazy real.
*  This looks like you're looking at it through.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at this shit.
*  Wow.
*  So they're going through different filters, different ways of looking at it.
*  And then later on, they show the actual missiles headed towards it.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  See if you get the where the actual missiles are.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's it.
*  Back up right there, right there.
*  Where it's black and white.
*  This is crazy.
*  This is wild shit, man.
*  Yeah.
*  The fact that this has been being done through this isn't the transition that I saw earlier.
*  I don't know when it is.
*  It's a long ass video.
*  But it's pretty incredible.
*  Now it looks so realistic.
*  Yeah, we're going to be the matrix where you're just plugged into a thing and you're just
*  living.
*  100 percent.
*  I just hope my life is good in that matrix.
*  That's well, it's going to be better than the matrix because it's not going to be like a
*  regular life.
*  You're going to be on a dragon.
*  You're going to be in fucking you're going to be living in Never Neverland.
*  You're going to be living in some crazy Narnia world.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to be able to do anything you want.
*  What is the game?
*  Arma 3.
*  I don't even.
*  Arma 3.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this is brand new.
*  April 21st.
*  I don't even know what that game is.
*  Literally this video came out yesterday.
*  It's fucking nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  I just stumbled across my feed and I thought it was legit.
*  Yeah.
*  For like 38 seconds.
*  Son, that game is I mean, it's crazy what video games are doing.
*  There's now like I watch the NFL a lot when a guy scores a touchdown, they use like a
*  6K camera and you look at that and you're like, oh, that looks like a video game.
*  6K the more crisp reality looks like the video game.
*  No, I was watching a video yesterday on YouTube that was a review of the Google
*  Pixel 8 Pro and apparently it has AI in it that can give a smile for your kid's face.
*  Oh, that's creepy.
*  It's correct because he said the guy was reviewing.
*  He said, my one kid is never paying attention, never looked well, then get a picture of
*  him not paying attention.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a fucking weirdo.
*  Like you're, you're changing your kid's personality to be like this smiley guy who
*  stares at the camera.
*  It's a scary thought.
*  You can manipulate people's faces so you can swap their face around.
*  I saw someone, Lex tweeted yesterday, this picture.
*  Yeah.
*  Response.
*  Someone made that look smiling and it looks pretty cool.
*  Well, have you seen the new Microsoft software where they can take a photograph, just a
*  photograph and then with your voice, have you say all kinds of shit in video and it
*  looks seamless.
*  Wow.
*  Seem I'll send you that Jamie.
*  It looks fucking seamless.
*  So you see it.
*  You're like, this is incredible.
*  How is this that good?
*  It's so fucking good now.
*  It's going to be really fun.
*  Here it is.
*  I'll send it to Jamie.
*  I think, I think, yeah, we're going to.
*  Got it.
*  Yeah, this is it.
*  All my tension, all my time on listening.
*  So instead of doing something else, I just listened, listened and listened because I'm
*  a true believer that if you're really bad at something like listening, for example,
*  it only shows you that, hey, you have to practice listening.
*  The sound is not synced correctly in this video.
*  I think it's.
*  It's going to get better and better.
*  Yeah, but this is not how it looked on my phone.
*  My phone, it looked different.
*  There's there's like a little disconnect here.
*  You keep blaming your phone for.
*  What's that?
*  You're blaming your phone for these wrong things.
*  Yeah, no, no, no.
*  He's it's just it's going from the computer.
*  I'm kidding.
*  Okay.
*  But also, even if it's not perfect, this is the worst it will ever be.
*  Right.
*  That's what I always think about.
*  Right.
*  Oh, it's not, it's not.
*  You can tell this is the worst it will ever be.
*  And it will get exponentially better and better, faster and faster.
*  And I think they only need 30 seconds of you talking.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  The the Mona Lisa is rapping.
*  Look at this.
*  Give me some of that.
*  That's crazy, bro.
*  That's Mona Lisa.
*  That's crazy.
*  And it looks pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  And you would not have imagined this five years ago.
*  Five years ago, five years ago, you'd be like, what is that?
*  How do these, that must cost a billion dollars to do.
*  I think three years from now, you're not going to be able to tell at all.
*  No, especially guys like you or I.
*  We've had so many hours of us talking.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many hours of you talking.
*  But the good thing now then is probably we can just say whatever we want to.
*  And I'm like, that was fake.
*  It's crazy hateful stuff, but that was fake.
*  I wonder if there'll be a way to tell.
*  I wonder if I think eventually there won't be.
*  I think there's probably going to be a way to tell for a little bit, but then
*  eventually there won't be.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we just don't take it that seriously, hopefully.
*  Well, because there's a lot of other things you could edit on a phone now.
*  Like with the Samsung phones, you could delete things from the background.
*  It has AI.
*  So like if someone's in the background, like fuck that dude.
*  Just put a circle around them.
*  Yeah.
*  Guy goes away.
*  Yeah.
*  Now he's not in your picture anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they could, they could literally move the position that you're in.
*  So if you're in the center of the thing, you're like, I want to be behind that
*  park bench, they just put you behind the park bench, dude, for my special.
*  Luckily we got prize picks to help me pay for the cost.
*  And then we did like an ad read in the middle, the background.
*  We'd filmed it on a green screen and my guy, Kev created that background in like
*  30 seconds and you can't tell the difference.
*  It looks like maybe slightly different with so many people.
*  Like, did he stop the middle of his taping to do an ad read?
*  It looks so good.
*  It just added this stuff into, which probably before your guy got to it, but
*  this has just been added to video editing software, some of the AI stuff we've
*  been talking about some built into the actual editing software.
*  It's like, what just happened on screen was this, they changed the small amount
*  of diamonds into a large amount of diamonds.
*  And it now like works in the video that they're using.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, like just changing things, leading things right out of there.
*  That would take hours before.
*  Wow.
*  It might take a few people to do it.
*  And now it's instantaneous.
*  Didn't even know it was supposed to be there.
*  The videos now most send you this Jamie, cause this, this video is entirely AI.
*  The whole thing is a sci-fi trailer for a movie.
*  It's entirely AI and you would never believe it.
*  And again, what you just said is only going to get better.
*  This is the worst it's ever been.
*  Worst it's ever going to be.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to, it's going to get better real quick, but this is this whole trailer
*  that we're going to watch is entirely generated by AI.
*  There's no actors.
*  There's no scenes.
*  This is all done on a computer.
*  This is not a sci-fi movie.
*  What the fuck?
*  Dude, closeups.
*  Dude, the people look completely real.
*  Look at the ocean, the Amalfi coast.
*  That's beautiful.
*  It's not a drone shot from the Amalfi coast.
*  Wow.
*  Look at the people moving.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything looks real.
*  This is not a snippet from a natural geographic documentary.
*  I mean, what the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  That looks crazy.
*  The dog, man.
*  That's crazy.
*  Do you remember how bad the dogs looked in I am Legend?
*  Yeah.
*  The tigers, the lions rather.
*  Do you remember that scene?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  There's a scene when Will Smith is going through New York City and the lions are out
*  and the lion takes out a deer in front of him and see if you can find it.
*  It looks so CGI.
*  It's so corny.
*  They shouldn't even put it in the movie.
*  It's I wonder if at the time you think it looks real and then you go back and you're
*  like, this is the worst.
*  Now I remember at the time I was like, get the fuck out of here.
*  Because I will I watch a movie like 10 years later.
*  This deer look fake.
*  Dope Mustang.
*  Now look at that Mustang.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Driving around a Shelby.
*  Yeah.
*  So watch this.
*  He's hanging out here and he sees this deer and he's about to shoot this deer
*  because he wants some food.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Watch this lion.
*  Look how fake this looks.
*  Yeah, it looks terrible.
*  Look at me.
*  It looks so bad.
*  It looks so fake.
*  It looks almost as fake as his marriage.
*  Almost not quite.
*  Not quite.
*  Almost.
*  Some people live in hell.
*  They really do.
*  They stay living in hell.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, what a sad case that was, man.
*  He meant so much to me as a kid.
*  And now it's just.
*  All with one moment where he couldn't take a joke.
*  Yeah.
*  Or she couldn't take a joke.
*  Yeah.
*  One moment and the whole guy's reputation is gone now.
*  All they had to do is just laugh it off.
*  I know.
*  Mild shit.
*  And he was laughing.
*  G.I.Jane.
*  Mild shit.
*  Not even remotely.
*  And this is a one.
*  It would have been one thing if she wasn't trying to be famous and he just brought her
*  into a joke if she wasn't a celebrity.
*  But he's not making fun of your wife.
*  He's making fun of a celebrity.
*  Not only that.
*  G.I.Jane was a bad ass movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, she's fucking awesome in that movie.
*  Yeah.
*  She's in like Navy Seals she's training for in that movie.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  God forbid.
*  She's a beast.
*  Yeah.
*  God forbid you compare my wife to a Navy Seal.
*  How dare you.
*  That was like a big thing in the movie where Demi Moore said suck my dick.
*  Did she really?
*  That's fire.
*  Dude.
*  She's in the movie.
*  That's fire.
*  Yeah.
*  She's a beast.
*  Yeah.
*  I would love for my wife to compare to this Navy Seal saying suck my dick.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Also, she's still hot in the movie.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember that.
*  She's still hot bald.
*  She looks great.
*  Yeah.
*  What's the big deal?
*  Yeah.
*  Jane still looks great.
*  I don't know if she really's got that.
*  Whatever.
*  Alopecia.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Looks pretty uniform.
*  What drove me crazy is I saw a video when we were talking about it on Flagrant.
*  You're looking at stuff, right?
*  You're researching and there was a video of her being like all I can do is laugh about it now.
*  That's all I can do.
*  So then someone made a joke.
*  That's your opportunity to laugh about it.
*  But you just took it so poorly.
*  Well, she just rolled her eyes, gave sideways face and then will whatever's wrong with them.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it was.
*  Like whatever is disfunt whatever he's trying to prove to her.
*  Whatever chaos is in that relationship.
*  And maybe it is Alopecia.
*  Maybe it's like that's just so sensitive that he realized, fuck, I got to go slap him.
*  It's like the hot button topic around the house.
*  I don't know.
*  But either way, like what a terrible decision.
*  Yeah.
*  What a terrible.
*  And also, but also it showed you how vacant Hollywood is that they gave him a standing ovation.
*  Just moments afterwards.
*  Insane.
*  For playing a guy who there are abuse allegations around.
*  Yeah.
*  Richard Williams.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  There's yeah.
*  Just what a crazy fucking thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Just the whole thing was nuts and it just showed how insane Hollywood is.
*  How disconnected they are.
*  And then it took the next day or so for the rest of the world to be like, hey, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  And then it all fell apart.
*  Yeah.
*  But those dummies were willing to go along with it.
*  Like clapping.
*  Yeah, that was crazy.
*  Even though you just smacked a guy and ruined the Oscars.
*  Yeah.
*  Assaulted a guy who's what half a foot shorter than you maybe.
*  And weighs eight pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  Chris Rock said he's the least intimidating guy that's ever held a mic.
*  Well, I have something to say about that.
*  I think you might fuck him up.
*  Really?
*  I think so.
*  Okay.
*  Fair enough.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't want to find out.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe he'll get you.
*  But the point is it's like he's this is not a threatening guy and to go up and physically
*  assault him.
*  It's just crazy.
*  But it's just, you know, people lose their minds, man.
*  They lose their minds.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember.
*  I remember thinking about this in like 07.
*  I did like a student film.
*  Obviously nothing.
*  I barely got paid anything.
*  But I remember I went to go get Chipotle and then the people freaked out.
*  They're like, hey, if you want something, you just tell us.
*  We'll go get it for you.
*  You don't need to.
*  And I remember being like, oh, I could just ask for anything I want.
*  You know, I would get it.
*  And they were like, yeah.
*  And I was like, that's crazy.
*  So imagine actually being famous.
*  Imagine being Will Smith.
*  Right.
*  No one says no to you ever.
*  If Will Smith was like, fly to Columbia, buy me coffee beans every day before I shoot.
*  They would find a guy to do that.
*  Right.
*  How do you come out normal?
*  There's no way to be normal and healthy and all.
*  It just, I can't see it.
*  Well, you have to not participate in that.
*  You have to not be that guy.
*  You have to recognize that that's a dangerous road to go down.
*  You lose your humanity.
*  It's hard though.
*  I imagine.
*  And the one good thing about comedy is you will get humbled.
*  I will bomb at some point eventually and it will remind me.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not better than anybody else.
*  Yeah.
*  Comedy is a different animal.
*  If it's very hard to be that cocky, be a comedian.
*  Yeah.
*  You get humbled.
*  That's one of the reasons why fighters are so nice.
*  Oh dude.
*  Oh dude.
*  I was, yeah, I hung out with Henry Cejudo and Kelvin Gastel and they came to my shows in Tempe.
*  Just the best hang.
*  The greatest guys.
*  Every fighter's great.
*  Henry Cejudo is hilarious by the way.
*  Like he's giving you shit.
*  He's taking shit.
*  He has five minutes of stand up.
*  It's actually not that bad.
*  I kept telling him, I was like, dude, I've seen more of your stand up than I have your fights.
*  And it was pretty good.
*  Kelvin just the nicest guy.
*  But yeah, there's a humility to, maybe Chris Rock got a lot more humble.
*  I mean, maybe a lot of people are hoping that happens to me.
*  Well, Chris Rock woke up for sure because Chris Rock's stand up got better.
*  Yeah.
*  Like everybody that saw him after that, like Tom Sgr went to see him when he did the arena in town.
*  He goes, bro, he was on fire.
*  Really?
*  He goes, it was like bring the pain, Chris Rock.
*  It was like he was like markedly better than he had been before.
*  Oh really?
*  He goes, it was amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  It was amazing.
*  And that's what it was.
*  It was like, he realized like, fuck those people.
*  I was trying to get those people to like me.
*  I was trying to do movies and I got slapped and they applauded that guy afterwards.
*  Fuck them.
*  Yeah.
*  He's too good for that gig anyway.
*  That gig sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he had to try to go do jokes after he got smacked.
*  Yeah.
*  Which was the worst.
*  Saying I'm not going to address it.
*  I mean, that is the worst.
*  When he tried to like do material after he got smacked, the whole thing was crazy.
*  We're not, we're not talking about anything else, Chris.
*  You're my hero.
*  We're not talking about anything else.
*  Well, you didn't know what to do.
*  You probably never would have imagined that that would have happened.
*  There was a moment when, in the moment where he goes, Will said something, he goes, boy, I could.
*  And then he just goes on and finishes giving the award.
*  I know why he didn't.
*  And that was the mature thing, but I wish he had just unloaded.
*  Yeah.
*  I wish he had just gone it because I'm positive.
*  I thought crossed his mind and then he decided against it.
*  And I would love to see Chris Rock just.
*  I think the best thing would have been to do was be to say, no one's going to do anything about that.
*  Like someone could just come up here and hit me and you guys don't do shit.
*  Yeah.
*  And you want me to host your awards?
*  Yeah.
*  Like say something real in the moment.
*  Yeah.
*  But how that's Monday morning quarterback.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows what.
*  And you risk looking like a bitch being like, nobody's going to help me.
*  Which true.
*  You will miss a big dude.
*  Yeah.
*  You're not.
*  But it's still you look like a bigger bitch getting slapped.
*  I mean, like, are you guys not going to do anything about this?
*  You look like a Karen or whatever.
*  Well, you can't mean it's like Jim Carrey said he should sue Will Smith for like 50 million dollars.
*  And I was like, yeah, that's you're on board with that.
*  This guy's career is forever altered because of that.
*  Yeah.
*  This guy made some of the greatest comedy specials in the history of the world.
*  And we're going to talk about the slap right there with that, if not before that.
*  But the comedy, like his audiences went way up.
*  His ticket sales went through the roof.
*  Well, that's good.
*  They went through the roof.
*  I was talking to the people that handle his shit and they were like, dude, it was crazy.
*  Everything was just selling out immediately.
*  That's great, at least.
*  Because everybody wanted to see him and they wanted to see what he had to say.
*  Yeah.
*  And for a while he wasn't even talking about it.
*  Yeah.
*  He's because Chris is smart.
*  Right.
*  He's not going to just come out with material right away and start talking about people
*  going to film it and record it and tell everybody.
*  So he waited.
*  He waited until he really developed the material.
*  Yeah.
*  Really figured out what to say.
*  Yeah.
*  He is my comedy.
*  Him and Chappelle and Patrice, I found when I got older, but I remember being kids and being
*  like, oh, fuck, this is what standup can be.
*  And that's a big reason I even entered standup in the first place.
*  Yeah.
*  His first two specials were insane.
*  Bigger and Blacker and Bring the Pain are two of the best of all time.
*  Dude, Bigger and Blacker coming a year, like a year and a half after Bring the Pain.
*  It's unbelievable how good it is to have come out with all your best stuff that you've been
*  doing for 12 hours long years of comic, probably 12, 15 years at that point.
*  Bring the Pain, historic.
*  And then a year and a half you have a special that's arguably better.
*  Insane, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I think about that all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are two of the bangers to like, if you go and look at like all time greatest
*  specials, those two are definitely up there.
*  Yeah.
*  To see a guy like that just get smacked.
*  Also to see a guy like that hosting the Oscars.
*  Like, do you imagine Sam Kinison or Richard Pryor hosting the Oscars?
*  Like, get the fuck out of here.
*  Like, why are you doing that?
*  You shouldn't be doing that anyway.
*  I mean, that was the path back then, right?
*  I think this is a little bit of Monday morning quarterbacking where back then it was
*  Eddie Murphy, do standup, be a legend, go to movies, be a legend, do whatever you want
*  to after that.
*  And Chris was doing, the standup was still insane.
*  I think, even Never Scared, fantastic.
*  You watched that.
*  You're just like, wow, four specials that are just like, or was it this third special,
*  but all just historically great.
*  And then you got the movies and you got that.
*  And now you're just like, I do whatever I want.
*  He was right there.
*  That was the path.
*  But the thing is they all wanted to be in with Hollywood.
*  Everybody wanted a movie or a television show.
*  They all wanted that Hollywood money because that's the only path that existed
*  before the internet.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  This is a very interesting time for media.
*  It's a very interesting time for what people consume.
*  Yeah.
*  I think now we might not have as much fame or power or whatever, and that's fine because
*  we get to kind of do what we want.
*  And that's great.
*  I don't know.
*  I think people are more famous now.
*  There's more guys doing arenas now than ever before.
*  That's true.
*  Yeah.
*  Standups had a real boom.
*  Hinchcliffe sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row in an hour.
*  I mean, Kill Tony.
*  I did Kill Tony after I did Rogan the first time.
*  I was like, I think the last time I was in Austin, but I remember watching him.
*  And Tony and I started around the same time and I'm watching him and Kill Tony.
*  And I'm just like, holy fuck.
*  You are amazing at this.
*  He's the best ever.
*  He's the best host of those kind of shows ever.
*  He's so quick.
*  Yeah.
*  I took Tucker to Kill Tony.
*  Yeah.
*  That moment with him and Cam Patterson was so great.
*  Tucker didn't even know he was going on stage.
*  He had no idea.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  I wasn't even going to bring him on stage.
*  I showed up with him.
*  I'm like, we were having dinner.
*  Yeah.
*  And I said, me, him and Lex Friedman.
*  And I said, do you want to see the club?
*  And he's like, yeah.
*  You guys got nothing going on tonight?
*  Let's go Kill Tony's there tonight.
*  It'd be awesome.
*  It's a crazy show to watch.
*  It's like one of the best live shows you can go see.
*  So we get there, we're backstage and I text Tony, hey, I'm coming.
*  I'm bringing Tucker Carlson.
*  And so we get backstage and he texts me and he's like, come on stage.
*  Wow.
*  And I was like, really?
*  I go, all right.
*  I did it once before with Post Malone.
*  Yeah.
*  Post Malone had no idea he was going to be on Kill Tony.
*  I just brought him to the club and then brought him right on stage.
*  And he was like, this is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what we did with Tucker too.
*  Just brought him on stage and he goes out there, ladies and gentlemen, Joe
*  Rogan and Tucker Carlson.
*  Wow.
*  The place went nuts and he was great.
*  Yeah, he seemed really good.
*  It the way he handled the camp thing.
*  Both of them handled that so well.
*  I thought it was hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Post was amazing.
*  Post is amazing.
*  He was great at it.
*  I've heard he's the nicest guy too.
*  I wonder how he is in that format.
*  He's so sweet.
*  Yeah.
*  He's so sincere.
*  David Lucas said he looked like an unemployed crocodile hunter.
*  It's good.
*  That's good, dude.
*  Amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Amazing.
*  And he just takes the jokes and he's good.
*  Oh, he's great.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a sweetheart of a guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Him and Jelly Roll.
*  Jelly Roll has been on it.
*  Jelly Roll is my favorite, man.
*  I love that guy.
*  Such a beautiful human being.
*  Truly.
*  Like a beautiful soul.
*  Yeah.
*  Him and that Mexican OT are like kindred spirits to me.
*  We had them both on separately on the pod and I was like, I said, OT, I was like,
*  you need to collab with that guy.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That Mexican OT and Jelly Roll would be amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  And that Mexican OT's manager and I are fairly cool.
*  Greg, get out Jelly Roll, dude, because that guy.
*  That'll happen.
*  I got Mexican OT as my intro for my special and I didn't realize what a pain in the ass
*  that can be.
*  And luckily, OT's manager, Greg, was like, we're going to push, we're going to get this done.
*  We're going to get this done.
*  We're going to get this done.
*  That's the only reason I could get it cleared from, I think, UMG or whatever the label was.
*  So, yeah.
*  But OT was also like, he hit me up afterward.
*  Like, hey, man, I love the special.
*  I love the dance.
*  Thank you for using my song that way.
*  Just like so sweet.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you did me the biggest favor.
*  Right.
*  Ever.
*  And then to thank me is just like, what a sweet kid, man.
*  Yeah, he's a dope guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I like him a lot.
*  I like him a lot.
*  Also got the Texas manners.
*  Yes, sir.
*  I remember he asked us a question.
*  He said, may I show you something?
*  And I was like, what a well-mannered sweet kid, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Who sings gangster rap.
*  Who will, yeah.
*  Who will probably beat the shit out of you.
*  It's like a country flavor.
*  Yeah.
*  Country flavor to his rapping.
*  Yeah.
*  He's very unique.
*  Yes.
*  And Comfort.
*  Cowboy Killer was the first song that I ever heard.
*  Tony played it for me.
*  Really?
*  He's like, you got to hear this.
*  You ever heard of that Mexican OT?
*  I'm like, no.
*  He played it for me.
*  I'm like, oh shit.
*  I was like, this is good.
*  And then I started listening to his other stuff.
*  They're all bad.
*  Fantastic.
*  It's like an artist.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Who just grew up in rap and that's what he knew.
*  And now I think he's going to expand more and more and more.
*  Yeah.
*  I love that kid.
*  Yeah.
*  He's great.
*  And he's young too, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Massive future.
*  Yeah, truly.
*  Mega talent.
*  Him and Jelly both.
*  Isn't that cool thing about doing a podcast too, that you get to meet all these
*  interesting people?
*  Yes.
*  The Brian Johnson guy was fascinating and you have these ideas of these people.
*  And then you sit down and talk with them and you're like, oh, that was completely
*  wrong.
*  I guess that's probably most human beings, but you get this idea of a person and
*  then you talk to them.
*  You're like, wow.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's also like other people get that too.
*  Like you're doing a service for other people and it kind of like informs other
*  people like, Hey, maybe I have misconceptions about people just because I see this
*  public image and I think that's who they are.
*  Yeah.
*  It's exactly ties into what we were saying earlier is about like letting other
*  people's opinions affect you.
*  I was listening to some podcasts.
*  I forget what it's called, but the guy goes, most people are very flippant with
*  their opinions.
*  They just throw it out there.
*  Oh, I hate that guy.
*  I love that guy.
*  They don't really think much.
*  And then we take it so seriously, good and bad, but most people just throw a
*  thing out there, not really being informed and they don't really care.
*  It's not that big a deal.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just talk.
*  Louis CK told me this once.
*  He goes, it's just talk.
*  He goes, but when it's written down, it seems like it's more than just talk, but
*  it's like kind of the same way people have always talked.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  You see it written down or we see someone saying it in a video.
*  What did he say about me?
*  Yeah, it's just talk.
*  People talk shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Louis was another one.
*  I, I even said this to him when he was getting so much love.
*  I was like, oh, fucking Louie.
*  And then we had him on the pod.
*  He was great.
*  He's obviously so smart, but I remember even I told him that he was like, a lot of
*  the craze, the praise was like overdone.
*  And I'm sure some comics didn't like me.
*  I was like, I was one of them.
*  He was like, I don't blame you.
*  And I was like, what a cool, honest moment we had where I didn't have to pretend.
*  And yeah, it was just, I think that's the, one of the best things about the podcast
*  thing is talking to people and being like, oh, I had a pre preconceived notion of you
*  and you're very different than I thought.
*  Yeah.
*  We get informed.
*  The more people we talk to, the more people we talk to and the more conversations we
*  have, we get more informed as a human being.
*  I think one of the things that limits people is the access they have to other
*  interesting people.
*  And I think that's also one of the things that is really exciting to people about
*  podcasts, why they like it so much.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause now they can listen to interesting people talk.
*  They can listen to cool people talk.
*  Yeah.
*  And they kind of get in on these conversations and they see a real conversation where
*  it's not planned out.
*  You don't know what you're going to talk about.
*  You're just talking.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I, how much prep do you do typically for interviews?
*  Cause sometimes I'll prep for days and it's just like endless.
*  And then sometimes I'm like, I think I'm okay.
*  It completely depends on the subject matter.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like if there there's been people that I've had to read books on
*  astrophysics.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and, and string theory and try to understand what the fuck they're talking
*  about or, or AI and you know, it depends.
*  You know, some people I've read their entire book and I knew they were coming on
*  months in advance.
*  So I prepared for it.
*  And then other people I'm just, I can't wait to talk to that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that Mexican OT zero prep.
*  What's up?
*  I love your music.
*  Yeah.
*  It was easy.
*  I wanted to just get to know him in the moment.
*  I don't want to like, I heard when you were a child, like, no, I wanted to come
*  out like organically.
*  I want to have a real conversation with him.
*  Well, you know, I'm sure you've heard this Larry King like does just did no prep
*  for any interview ever.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  There's a clip of him and Seinfeld talking.
*  It's so funny where he clearly doesn't know who Seinfeld is.
*  This is at the height of Seinfeld's fame and Seinfeld is like, yeah, my show is
*  going off the, you've never watched an episode.
*  It's kind of a big deal.
*  And Larry's like, no, I didn't, I didn't know.
*  And, and Schultz is always like, that's just his excuse to be lazy, but I truly
*  think he's like, maybe.
*  But he was also like, I know the best, most organic conversations.
*  If I learn all about this guy right here and my skillset will allow for the best
*  interview to happen that way.
*  Well, the worst conversations are conversations that are canned, right?
*  Where when someone's talking to you, they don't really care, but they're
*  pretending they care and asking you these things because they have like
*  bullet points that you want to hit.
*  Yeah.
*  And those seem canned.
*  They look, they seem bullshit.
*  You're probably better off doing it the Larry King way with some stuff, but
*  Larry King didn't interview theoretical physicists.
*  You know, like if you're, I need to know something about what you're talking
*  about to be able to have my own questions.
*  I can't, cause there's some things that are so nuanced and they're so complicated
*  that you, you, you should have some understanding of them before you talk
*  about it, but then other times it's like, Oh, guys, a comic, you know, like
*  let's talk, that'd be easy.
*  I love comics.
*  Let's have, let's talk some shit.
*  How do you write?
*  What do you do?
*  How do you do it?
*  You know, where'd you start?
*  Yeah.
*  I want to know, you know, it's like, and having genuine curiosity, I
*  think that's a major, that's a major key.
*  It's like actually be curious.
*  And some people aren't really curious.
*  They really just want to wait for their turn to talk.
*  Yeah.
*  They can't wait.
*  When's it going to be my turn to talk?
*  You know, but you ruin your own show that way.
*  Even by being selfish, you're actually going against yourself.
*  You're not realizing it at the time, but you're actually poisoning
*  your own show by being selfish.
*  Yeah.
*  The best thing that I've learned in life is try to actually listen,
*  especially in the more nervous you are.
*  Like even this pod, I come on, I'm like, just try to listen and respond to what
*  he's saying in the moment and just stay in your own body and do that.
*  With everything, man, with, with other people too, like when I'm, you know,
*  hanging out with someone, just a regular person, I'm so much better at
*  talking to people now than I was before I did a podcast because I'm so much
*  better at not talking over someone, waiting for them to talk, trying to get
*  the most out of what they're trying to say, trying to instead of just listening
*  and then just me talking, trying to figure out what, how did you come to that
*  conclusion?
*  Did you always think that way?
*  Like when, when did you, what did you learn?
*  How'd you learn this stuff?
*  Yeah.
*  Like what, what inspired you to start doing that?
*  You know, it's like that, that's interesting to me.
*  So now when I have conversations with people that suck at having conversations,
*  like I can't wait to, I got trapped at my fucking club by a buddy of mine,
*  brought one of his buddies from high school and his buddy from high school was
*  drunk and he's rich and he kept wanting to tell me about this business that he
*  started.
*  It was, you know, blah, blah, blah.
*  And I dissed and that, and I turned it into a hundred million dollar business.
*  And this and that, I'm just telling you, just so you know who I am.
*  So like, Oh my God.
*  He was so bad at talking.
*  It was just the clunkiest, shittiest, braggiest.
*  And then I eventually go, I gotta go.
*  Yeah.
*  I wasn't even talking.
*  I was like, you're just talking at me.
*  Like, I don't care about any of these things.
*  He just needed to impress you that badly.
*  Yeah.
*  He needed to let me know that he was successful.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, within seconds of meeting him, he's telling me all this stuff.
*  It's exhausting.
*  So I get, I used to get really irritated at that stuff.
*  And then I think what Schultz said to me one time, cause this kid at a diner like
*  started interrupting our conversation and telling us about his education and how
*  smart he was.
*  And then I was like, so annoyed when he, when we left and Andrew was like, yeah,
*  but you got to feel good about yourself that that guy, for whatever reason, felt
*  insecure around you and felt he needed to impress you that much.
*  Right.
*  So then you look at someone knows someone from something, right?
*  If they know you and you don't know them, they need to let you know they're a
*  big deal.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's insecurity.
*  And it's like, I used to take it as malicious and now I'm like, Oh, that guy,
*  I'm not great at it, but I try to remind myself, Oh, that guy is meeting probably,
*  he's probably listened to you thousands of hours in his head and he wants so
*  badly for you to like him.
*  And he just doesn't know how to do that.
*  And he doesn't know, Hey, if I just have a real conversation with Joe, he'll walk
*  away being like, that's a nice guy.
*  And then he just overcompensates with, let me impress him.
*  Cause I did all these things and show them what I've done.
*  And if you there's like, Oh, okay.
*  Well, I feel bad for that guy a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not great at it by any stretch, but that's why I try to remember.
*  You definitely should feel bad for him.
*  Cause it sucks to be that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  It has to do that.
*  And it doesn't feel good.
*  Like there's no, that never works.
*  Like no one ever walks away going, that guy's amazing.
*  Like you walk out there, it feels like that guy just jizzed all over me.
*  You know, it's really what it's like.
*  Do you know that guy's worth a hundred million dollars.
*  You know what else doesn't work that people still do is a name dropping.
*  Uh, does that shit work at all?
*  No, no, no, that's a rough one.
*  That's a rough one.
*  We were partying with Leo and you know, like what, what are we doing?
*  My God.
*  What?
*  Yeah, please, please don't do it.
*  Please, please don't do that to me.
*  I couldn't care less.
*  I couldn't care less.
*  Does it work on anybody?
*  It might be one of the least effective strategies for getting people to think
*  you're cool name dropping.
*  Yeah, it's truly, I think it works on like people who don't know anyone.
*  And they're like, Oh, this guy knows so-and-so, but even after about the third
*  name, you're like, Oh, he doesn't know anybody.
*  The more names you name, the less those people like you.
*  Yeah.
*  People turn on you too.
*  If you're that guy that name drops like on podcasts or named out, like people
*  like, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They really got to talk.
*  So everybody, yeah, I used to do it way more.
*  I said like early pocket.
*  I just wasn't good at it.
*  So you have a thought in your head.
*  Just want to get it out.
*  Right.
*  Not even, even if you're not even being selfish, it's like you just looking for a
*  chance to, and then I took me time to just look at the big picture of it and go,
*  this is not smart.
*  And then that's when I started using pads to this is big too, because sometimes I
*  have a thing I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to forget this.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this guy's on this rant.
*  So I just look over here, scribble and write it down.
*  And if I do that, I'm good.
*  Yeah.
*  You just got to learn how to, it's a skill.
*  You're learn.
*  It's a skill like any other skill.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you'll learn how to negotiate a conversation and get the most out of the
*  person I want to, I want that person to shine.
*  I want them to have the most interesting thing that they could say.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to help them say it.
*  I think about that because sometimes they'll get mad because I don't feel nearly as
*  confident in podcasting as I do in standup.
*  And then I just remember, Oh, standup is something I've been doing 17 years now or
*  whatever podcasting.
*  I've been on five, six, whatever.
*  Like it's going to take a while.
*  Also, you guys have a unique setup when there's a lot of folks there.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there's, there's four of you.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's a guest.
*  Yeah.
*  When you got five people talking and no one knows when they can chime in and when
*  they should chime in is hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Being a team player is big.
*  It's like, I could try to get my thought.
*  I try to remember, I could try to get my thought out now, but is that if I'm just
*  going to be talking with everybody, is that going to add the best podcast or do I
*  just fall back and wait?
*  Headphones.
*  Yeah.
*  Headphones are a huge key.
*  Yeah.
*  Because then you don't talk over each other.
*  Overtalk is terrible to listen to.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like Ari, when he comes on the podcast, we do protect our parks.
*  As soon as he gets drunk, takes the headphones off, starts talking over
*  everybody like Ari, you can't have two separate conversations.
*  This is a podcast.
*  Millions of people are going to hear this.
*  Oh, I need to give Ari his flowers too.
*  Jew is amazing.
*  I mean, it was one of the big like, amputation.
*  I looked at that and I was like, Oh, this guy didn't shop this at a streamer.
*  He just put it online and it looks better than pretty much anything I've seen on
*  Netflix.
*  It was cool because of all the candles and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  A gorgeous special.
*  I told him this.
*  I was like, this is, I just, once I saw it, I was like, Oh, this is the bar now.
*  That's what's it's set there.
*  Well, it was also for me, uh, it was very important to see because Ari had been
*  telling me these things for decades and had never figured out a way to do it on
*  stage and decided to do it all in one special.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause he was telling me all this stuff about his upbringing cause he had a
*  crazy upbringing, man.
*  Like super religious, went to Israel, stayed in a kibbutz or whatever the fuck it
*  was and reading the Talmud all day.
*  He was all in.
*  And then he's like, this is bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  What am I doing?
*  Yeah.
*  And then it becomes a comic, which is wild.
*  And when I met him, it was like, I guess it was the nineties and he was like,
*  Joe, maybe I'm here.
*  Did Ari start working at the store?
*  It might've, I think I was on, that might've been to fear factor days.
*  I don't remember, but it was like, he was a young, young guy who was just
*  starting to do standup.
*  And then the more I got to know him, like, what did you do?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I'm like, why don't you talk about that on stage?
*  He just didn't have the chops.
*  Yeah.
*  And so it took a decade plus two decades before he developed the chops to be a
*  little real solid state.
*  And I'm glad he did because then he became a great comic and then he realized how
*  to do that material as a comic, which was perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's one thing.
*  I used to try to push myself to do this material that was personal.
*  Like, I hope I can make my dad's story into a bit or something to end a special
*  with or whatever, but now I realize I don't need to push.
*  I wasn't good enough to do that back then.
*  And now as I'm getting better, I think I can dig deeper, be more honest, be more
*  personal, tell more personal things or whatever.
*  And then I'm ready now.
*  I feel like.
*  Yeah.
*  You could figure out a way to make it good.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a tricky job, man.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a tricky fucking slippery job.
*  Especially like somewhat potentially painful things that you're trying to make
*  funny. I remember I would see some comics come up and be just so awkward, say all
*  these horrible things they went through and they'd be like, I don't care if y'all
*  laugh. This is therapy for me.
*  And I know you're just saying that because you're nervous because you're not
*  doing well, but you got to understand how fundamentally wrong this is not therapy.
*  We're not here to help you through this.
*  Go to therapy, make it funny and then come bring it to us.
*  I remember there was some dispute at Just for Laughs and some comic yelled at
*  some other comic that if you're not using your comedy to promote social justice,
*  you can go fuck yourself.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  That is a layer.
*  That's a person that can't possibly be good.
*  There's no way you're good.
*  You must be terrible on stage.
*  Your comedy must be awful.
*  I think you also, that's probably a young comic probably because I know I had these
*  ideas of what funny was.
*  And I remember watching, I think it was called Talking Funny or Funny People or
*  whatever with Ricky Gervais, Chris Rock, Louis CK and Jerry Seinfeld.
*  And then there's a moment where Ricky, who's the youngest comic in the room, is
*  talking about these jokes and like, I don't want to do those jokes because those
*  jokes are easy.
*  I want to impress guys like you.
*  And then Jerry goes, you know what would impress me?
*  Leave that joke in.
*  Don't take that joke up.
*  Leave that stupid joke in.
*  I'm impressed.
*  Just kill.
*  I like stupid jokes.
*  Yes.
*  If stupid jokes, like, Attelle.
*  Attelle's brilliant and silly at the same time.
*  These aren't like super complicated jokes where you're like, oh my God, this
*  guy's changing the world.
*  Thousand percent.
*  But amazing.
*  Thousand percent.
*  I just want to laugh.
*  Just make us laugh.
*  That's your job.
*  Just make us laugh.
*  And then if you can make us laugh on your terms the way you want to, God
*  bless.
*  That's a better level, sure.
*  Sure.
*  But is shooing laughs just because I don't want to?
*  No.
*  Fuck that.
*  Get the laughs.
*  You're only doing that because you can't get laughs.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  Anybody who's like trying to educate these people, bro, you're 28 years old.
*  You live in a duplex.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  You're not going to fix the world.
*  I know you think you're going to, but also like that was a thing that Hicks
*  brought to comedy that was like a real problem in the nineties.
*  Yeah.
*  I hated Hicks for a long time because of this.
*  I still won't listen to Hicks just because the ripple effect of Bill Hicks is like,
*  buddy, you created a monster.
*  He did create a monster.
*  There were so many fucking people that wanted to be Hicks.
*  Yeah.
*  It was so much so that the punchline in Atlanta used to have a green room and on
*  the back of the green room, people would write on the wall and it said, quit
*  trying to be Hicks.
*  Thank God.
*  And when they tore that down, Jamie kept saying he was going to, Jamie, the owner
*  kept saying he was going to get me that fucking, cause they took the wood down.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, get me that.
*  Get just the plank that says don't be Hicks.
*  Just quit trying to be Hicks.
*  Let me put that up here.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I remember that like, ah, there's so many guys, so many guys who wanted to
*  be that guy, you know, cause he was, he just left you feeling like even, even
*  Richard Jennings, he was like one of the all time greats.
*  I remember Richard Jennings saw Hicks and he was like, I watched him.
*  I was like, I gotta do more stuff like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you don't.
*  Yeah.
*  You really don't.
*  I actually remember though, uh, God, who's the comic?
*  His name is escaping me.
*  He's a clean comic.
*  He's massive.
*  Super funny.
*  Brian Regan.
*  He was saying, uh, he was on somebody else's podcast and that guy was saying
*  about Brian Regan, I remember Hicks was really dying to go see you at X, Y, and Z.
*  So Hicks loves Brian Regan.
*  Yeah.
*  So you don't need to be Hicks.
*  Just be funny.
*  And Hicks will be looking down at you being like, that guy's funny.
*  Well, Hicks really was that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Hicks was talking about stuff in the nineties before the internet.
*  Right.
*  So he's talking about all these really esoteric subjects and interesting things.
*  Cause he was just reading a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  So it was like real, he really understood what he was talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  That's actually that guy.
*  If you're not that guy, don't be that guy.
*  It's just be who you are.
*  But people like that, like, you know, occasionally someone will come along
*  and they influence everybody.
*  You know, Kinnison for sure did that.
*  They come along and they're so mind blowing.
*  You're like, Jesus Christ.
*  You know, Joey Diaz influenced everybody around him.
*  Cause everybody like he was, he was so quick with his punchlines, a setup
*  punchline was so fast, rapid fire.
*  He got to it so quickly.
*  Like, God damn, I got to pick up my speed.
*  Yeah.
*  I got to pick up my game.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that where you picked up from?
*  I learned a lot from Joey for sure.
*  I learned a lot from also having to follow him because I would bring Joey on the
*  road with him because I couldn't follow him.
*  So I was like, this is the best way to figure out how to follow this guy.
*  Bring him with me everywhere.
*  He was fucking killing.
*  He was killing.
*  And also I wanted to laugh.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and when you're around Joey, it's just a party.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  He's awesome.
*  He's the best.
*  Yeah.
*  We had him on the pod ones and I was like, this guy is awesome.
*  He was just here for 420 weekend.
*  It was fucking glorious.
*  It was amazing.
*  He's on fire because he comes to the club and he gets so much love that he's so
*  free and loose.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The moments when he went on stage, it was incredible because the audience didn't
*  know he was there unless they had paid attention to the Instagram.
*  So Friday night, they definitely didn't know he was there.
*  When I do those Joe Rogan and friends show, I don't let anybody know.
*  So Schultz will pop in.
*  Shane Gillis shows up.
*  Gaffigan shows up.
*  No one knows who's going to be there.
*  And they go up there and everybody's like, this is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that's what's fun about it.
*  And so when Joey goes up, they didn't know who it was going to be.
*  And then they, Joey Diaz, everybody was like, is he thinking about moving here or
*  no?
*  Yeah, we're working on him.
*  That's great.
*  We're working on him.
*  That's great.
*  He's going to love it.
*  He's just too happy here.
*  And the problem with New Jersey is it's like, there's too much road bullshit,
*  hacky fucking comedy there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's good comics in New Jersey for sure.
*  There's great comics.
*  Boss lives in Jersey.
*  Bonnie McFarland lives in Jersey.
*  This is great comics in New Jersey, no doubt about it.
*  But there's also a lot of scrubs and a lot of like just real, just dumb comedy.
*  Just dumb.
*  I was at the mothership yesterday and I'm watching this open mic and just seeing
*  all the comics.
*  First of all, I remembered I don't miss open mics at all.
*  I just remembered that pain sitting there waiting.
*  Horrible.
*  But I was thinking, I was like, yo, Joe fucking did it, man.
*  He made this.
*  I was thinking if I'm a young comic, Austin wasn't even a place I was thinking of in
*  2007 or eight or whatever when I started.
*  Now LA is not even a place I'm thinking of.
*  It's either Austin or New York and Austin is easier to survive.
*  It's better weather.
*  It's nicer people.
*  I think I would come to Austin.
*  It's also a more supportive environment because the environment, especially at our
*  club, is specifically designed to foster talent.
*  It's designed that way.
*  There's two nights of open mic nights.
*  It's designed.
*  Kill Tony's there.
*  It's designed for that.
*  So from the ground up, you have a chance to go.
*  You have a chance as a person who's just getting on stage the first time ever to go
*  up in the best club in the world.
*  And you have a chance to go and work the same stage that Joey Diaz goes up in, that
*  Dave Chappelle went up in.
*  You get to go into that.
*  The little boy, that room is amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  That is a tight little room, man.
*  And you could get that itch.
*  The little boy felt like the belly room.
*  It's like the belly room and the O.R.
*  had a baby.
*  Yeah.
*  And the fat man is like the main room and the O.R.
*  had a baby.
*  Okay, I see that.
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  It's a perfect place.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I was hyped.
*  I've always said Comedy Works is the best club in the country in Denver.
*  Still love it.
*  I just got back from there this weekend.
*  Amazing.
*  I am excited to kill Tony and then I'm excited to see.
*  This is my first time in Austin since you built the club, so I'm excited to see the
*  whole thing.
*  It's a wild place.
*  How many days are you in town?
*  Uh, how many days you want me to be in town?
*  You know what I mean?
*  You decide.
*  Come by tomorrow.
*  Do I say tomorrow?
*  Okay, absolutely.
*  Done.
*  I got a show tomorrow at seven o'clock, but we got, um, I mean, we have big name
*  headliners are coming in every weekend, which is great.
*  So the local guys get to see the people that are there and all the door staff.
*  They're all comics.
*  They audition with their act, you know, so it's like a development process.
*  Like the store was, but more organized.
*  Yeah.
*  Not as chaotic and run by a comedian.
*  Yes.
*  And run by a comedian that doesn't have business partners.
*  I don't have anybody else.
*  And you're not, you're, you don't rely on that for income, which is like, it's a,
*  it's a mitzvah what you're doing.
*  It had to have happened the way it happened.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it had to, it had to be this crazy moment in history where the whole country
*  gets shut down except Texas.
*  And so we move here and all of a sudden I'm doing shows with Chappelle.
*  We're doing these outdoor shows or everybody's getting tested.
*  And then we started doing indoor shows.
*  And then we started doing indoor show.
*  I'm like, I gotta, I gotta open up a club.
*  I'm like, we need a hangout.
*  We need, we had the Vulcan, which is a great place.
*  Vulcan's a great, Vulcan's awesome.
*  Oh, I did the Vulcan right after you came on flagrant the next day.
*  That was the last time I was in Austin.
*  It's a great club.
*  Vulcan's great.
*  It's a great club to kill in too.
*  Yeah.
*  But I was like, this is an hours, you know, they have like techno music there
*  and EDM some nights and it's like, I want, we need to set something up.
*  And I had that Spotify money and I'm like, listen, if anybody's going to do it,
*  it's gotta be me.
*  And if any time is there is a time to do it, it's now because people were willing
*  to move so that they could go on stage because LA shut everything down for so
*  long that so many comics, like you guys are doing shows and then guys like Derek
*  and Assan, they came out early.
*  Brian Simpson, he came out there early.
*  Derek Poston is so goddamn funny.
*  He's getting so good, dude.
*  He's getting so good.
*  I saw him before Mothership because he, I saw him host Andrew show.
*  He's a good host.
*  He's a good host.
*  And I was like, Oh, I'll bring them on the road.
*  And then I thought, you know, one thing I try to do to pay forward how Schultz
*  helped me is that once I get to know you and I think I know how you're funny, I'm
*  like, Hey, well, let's watch your set if you want and I'll see if I can give you
*  some advice.
*  I'm not the end all be all, but I'll try to help you how I can.
*  So I had Derek feature one show and then I watched the set and I was like, buddy,
*  I barely got, I got some tags for you, but I don't see like structurally, Oh, you
*  could do this.
*  You could do X, Y, Z.
*  It's you're so fucking funny.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Well, the level of the guys coming up is very high.
*  And there's also in Austin, there's so many places to perform just on the block
*  where the mothership is.
*  Yeah.
*  So you have the mothership right down the street.
*  You have the sunset strip club, you have Brian Red Band's club right over there.
*  You have the creek in the cave right over there.
*  You had the Vulcan, you had the Velveeta room.
*  There's some place called the green room.
*  Then you have cap city.
*  You have a bunch of different clubs on the East side.
*  There's like hipster clubs and lesbian shows and there's like fucking comedies
*  everywhere.
*  Dude, you haven't made this a comedy hub.
*  It's a marvelous thing, like an insane thing that you've done.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  It's insane to move LA over to Austin is crazy.
*  But to make it better.
*  Yeah, I truly make it better and make it completely disconnected from all those
*  people that'll poison your act with their fucking Hollywood bullshit.
*  And I actually, I said LA to be honest, I meant New York.
*  This is what I heard New York was.
*  When I went to New York, it wasn't friendly, but it was you have to pay to go to
*  most open mics, five dollars in the free open mics.
*  This is when the alt scene was kind of running things.
*  So if you talked about anything that wasn't like a video game or anime, they
*  would judge the fuck out of it and be brutal.
*  There was no support built in.
*  So you've taken the best parts of New York and brought it to Austin.
*  And again, a city that's much cheaper and much less harsh.
*  Being poor in New York is rough.
*  Being poor in Austin, it's not that bad.
*  It's not bad.
*  You can get around.
*  Traffic's not bad at all.
*  It's very light.
*  It's very easy.
*  And the people are cool.
*  And the traffic, the clubs is all this little, like you said, all this little
*  radius LA, if I want to hit three spots, I'm driving three, four hours.
*  Well, you can go to the improv.
*  You can go to the Laugh Factory.
*  If you're not that, if you're doing the store improv.
*  If you're in at all three.
*  But when I was, I started in LA.
*  Open mics, you're driving all over the place.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all spread out.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're doing open mics, you're fucked.
*  There's not a lot of open mics in LA.
*  I mean, there's a good amount, but not in comparison to the amount of comics.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of comics and a lot of wannabe comics.
*  And there's also in LA, you have those people that really want to be actors.
*  And they think that this is their platform.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway, brother, great to have you on.
*  Tell everybody about your special, where they can get your second special.
*  Second special is Gaslit.
*  It's on YouTube right now.
*  I'm very proud of it.
*  I think hopefully this is my next evolution as a comic and just making the
*  things I truly believe funny instead of just doing contrary.
*  This is dope.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  I try to do it big.
*  That's...
*  Oh, look at this, man.
*  So this is traditional Indian dance called Bharat Natyam.
*  It's a South Indian dance.
*  And then it's to that Mexican OT.
*  Oh, that's amazing.
*  So yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So check it out on YouTube.
*  Please support.
*  Thank you guys so much.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  My pleasure, brother.
*  Tell everybody your social media.
*  Oh, it's Akash Singh, A-K-Double-A-S-H.
*  Akash Singh Comedy on TikTok.
*  Everything else is pretty much Akash Singh.
*  Oh, and YouTube is Akash Singh Comedy.
*  All right.
*  Thank you so much, man.
*  Appreciate it.
*  See you tomorrow night.
*  All right.
*  Bye, everybody.
