# Joe Rogan Experience #2038 - Trae Tha Truth
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up Trey? Good to see you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=12.0s)]
*  Cool, and what's up my brother? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=14.0s)]
*  Hey, I got a question for you. And everyone who wears grills, I got Invisalign on and I'm trying to talk with Invisalign and every time I've tried it I bailed out of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=15.0s)]
*  How the fuck do you talk so clear with a grill on? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=24.0s)]
*  I think we just get used to it, especially from Houston, you know, it's just our culture. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to meet Paul Wall and ask him. He seems like the guy who understands grills more than anybody. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=37.0s)]
*  Because like Post Malone had one on and then you hear him sing and talk and he sounds perfect, but I can hear it in my voice. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=38.0s)]
*  His might be implanted. I don't know if his was a grill. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=45.0s)]
*  Implanted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=48.0s)]
*  Like for deers. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=50.0s)]
*  They dig into your teeth and glue it in there? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=52.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=55.0s)]
*  Yeah, I ain't hit that phase. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=56.0s)]
*  How's yours on? Did your slides in and you could slide it out? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I don't eat with them. I just keep them on throughout the day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=60.0s)]
*  Do you ever leave it somewhere accidentally? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=64.0s)]
*  Never. But that's something people do a lot. They used to always, coming up younger, they used to put them in napkins and put it in their pocket and throw them away and everything. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I already lost one like that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people did. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=77.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't lose a grill. I just lost Invisalign. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=78.0s)]
*  That's the wimpiest version of a grill. So what's happening man? How you doing? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=82.0s)]
*  Man, blessed just in work mode in all aspects, man. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=87.0s)]
*  Work mode. What's work mode for you? What happens? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=91.0s)]
*  It depends on which world because, you know, of course music wise that's my first and foremost, but then the hometown hero side and then just helping people and being a daddy is just work all around the clock. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=94.0s)]
*  Right. Right. What is this hometown hero stuff? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=107.0s)]
*  That's what they label me, you know. Well, they label me that in Houston, but that's got to the point they label me that everywhere just for the help I do, whether it be hurricane disaster, whether it be just assisting with people, whether it be frontline for the community, whether it be fighting for justice, whether it be just assisting and caring for the town the way that I do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=111.0s)]
*  You know, my son named Houston. That's how much Houston I am. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=137.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun seeing you backstage at the Post Malone concert. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of my little brothers, man. People, a lot of people don't realize the history with me and a lot of artists. Like I remember when Post was first coming up. That's how far back we go, man. I've always been supportive and just always had his back. So, you know, it's been that way with a lot of artists. So whenever they see me, it'd be super exciting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's cool. It's cool to see that respect. It's like a thing. You got to stop in and check in with Trey when you come to Houston. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=165.0s)]
*  But you know, it's not the forceful way. It's more of a love way. Yeah, no, it's a nice way. It's a nice way. You were saying you never smoked and you never drank your whole life. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=173.0s)]
*  Yeah, never smoked, never drank, man. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=185.0s)]
*  How did you dodge that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=187.0s)]
*  So crazy story is, man, coming from where I come from, most people smoke and drink, you know, when they tend to go through stuff just dealing with life, you know, that's what kind of put their mind at ease. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=189.0s)]
*  And I was always one of the people I felt like I'm gonna deal with it head up, whatever it hit me at that moment. It can't get no worse than that. So I always just decided to not to because at the end of the day, when I got done smoking or drinking, if that's what I decided to do, the reality is still going to kick in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=200.0s)]
*  So I'd rather just deal with the shit head up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=217.0s)]
*  That's a good mindset. But smoking or drinking is fun. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=219.0s)]
*  I watch everybody around me do it all day, every day. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=224.0s)]
*  Well, there's nothing that sort of illuminates the problems with alcohol like watching someone be drunk and you're sober. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=227.0s)]
*  You know, man, I've always been more of a protector my whole life. So I'm always just watching the atmosphere anyway. So it don't really bother me. I'll be watching out just to make sure everybody's straight at all times. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=234.0s)]
*  Right. So you're like the designated driver. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=245.0s)]
*  I don't want to be classified that way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=248.0s)]
*  I don't mean that way. You know what I'm saying? Just like the wise sober person in the room, keeping everybody together. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is an interesting thing because we all know so many people that have ruined their lives because of that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=264.0s)]
*  You know, just gets away from them. That's all they want to do. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=265.0s)]
*  What do you do? Smoke and drink and your life just kind of gets away from you. You're just escaping it instead of being in it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=269.0s)]
*  You know, man, something that I realized everybody not built to be that strong and everybody not able to deal with a lot of things. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=275.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes that's the escape goat. And I want to one is not to judge. I just if it suits you and that's for you, you know, you got to do what you got to do. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=284.0s)]
*  That's a good way of looking at it, too, because that is true that we all have different levels of ability of handling shit. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=293.0s)]
*  Yeah. And especially when it comes. But when you know, you get into tricky things like like alcohol or pills, pills is a tricky one. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=299.0s)]
*  It feels like anybody can handle those. We had Kurt Angle on the other day from WWE. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=307.0s)]
*  And, you know, he developed a pain pill problem because he broke his neck like five times. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=315.0s)]
*  Damn, I didn't know that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=321.0s)]
*  He got fucked up. His neck is fucked up. It's crazy. And we watched some clips of him doing it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=323.0s)]
*  But I mean, this guy won the gold medal in the Olympics with a broken neck and he still got hooked on pills. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=327.0s)]
*  I could imagine only because once you get used to that pain and that's what's putting you at ease, you got to, you know, you go from a couple to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=335.0s)]
*  let me just go and get a few more in so I can make sure I'm good throughout the day. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=344.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just becomes a part of your body. You can't get away from it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=348.0s)]
*  But you got to be, you got to be cautious, man, because now you got fentanyl and all that other shit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=353.0s)]
*  Every time I see something with that, I rarely see somebody make it through that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. That one for sure going to kill you. So you got to be cautious. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the real problem with getting stuff off the street. You know, if you're trying to get coke off the street, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=366.0s)]
*  they're not making it the Pfizer lab. You know, it's not like you're not getting the same batch every time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=372.0s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you're getting if you don't know the guy who's buying it from the people. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=377.0s)]
*  Like, you don't know what the source is. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah, you even got, it's so crazy. You can even find weed laced with the shit. So it's just- [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=384.0s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=389.0s)]
*  Yeah, everything can be fucked up, man. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=390.0s)]
*  Why would they lace weed with it? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=392.0s)]
*  Never know. Never know. But as many people as this shit affecting are hitting and passing from it, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=396.0s)]
*  it's definitely something that they're doing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=402.0s)]
*  You know, because weed is illegal in a lot of states, 90% of the weed that's grown, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=405.0s)]
*  that's sold in these states where it's illegal, is grown on public land by the cartels. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=411.0s)]
*  Because in the places where weed is legal, like California, it's only a misdemeanor [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=417.0s)]
*  if you're growing weed without a permit. It's not a big deal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=423.0s)]
*  So they just set up shop in the national forests in a place where they're not supposed to be, and they grow weed. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=427.0s)]
*  Because if they get caught, it's not that big of a deal, but they want to protect their product too. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=432.0s)]
*  So these guys who used to be like game wardens, now they have like tactical teams with dogs and shit [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=438.0s)]
*  and MP4s and machine guns, and they're going through the woods fighting the cartel. It's wild. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=445.0s)]
*  You know, you see it in the movies, but that's what happens in real life, for real, for real. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=452.0s)]
*  For real, for real. And he was explaining to me how it's really dangerous because they use all these super toxic pesticides [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=456.0s)]
*  and shit that no one else is allowed to use. You can't really use that if you're growing, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=464.0s)]
*  especially if you're growing something organically, which is ideal. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=468.0s)]
*  So they're using all kinds of shit that's super toxic. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then that means it's going to weigh down and affect the people, for sure, for sure. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=475.0s)]
*  Yeah, and isn't it crazy that all that is just because it's illegal? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=480.0s)]
*  Man, I'm not sure when, but I'm assuming they're going to have to make it illegal in Texas at some point, man. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=484.0s)]
*  At some point. It seems silly, especially because Texas is supposed to be all about freedom. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=492.0s)]
*  You know, I had a conversation with this guy, Alex Berenson, yesterday. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=497.0s)]
*  He's a reporter. He used to work for the New York Times, and he's, you know, he pointed out, it's like everybody wants freedom, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=502.0s)]
*  but if you get that freedom and everything's legal, you're going to have a bunch of drug overdoses you wouldn't have. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=509.0s)]
*  You're going to have a bunch of people that are addicted you wouldn't have gotten addicted if it was illegal. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=514.0s)]
*  They wouldn't have bought it. And because it's legal, you're going to have to deal with that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=518.0s)]
*  And it's true. But it's an uncomfortable truth. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=522.0s)]
*  The flip side of that is, I've yet to see anybody really pass away from weed. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=524.0s)]
*  Yeah, even from cancer, right? Right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=529.0s)]
*  They're smoking it every day. They're not getting lung cancer. That's crazy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=533.0s)]
*  Right. So that's the only part they get it confused why they haven't made it legal as fast. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=536.0s)]
*  I mean, if there's things like, you know, the opiates, if they're legal, you can get those, but you can't get weed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=541.0s)]
*  That seems silly. That just seems silly. Doesn't make any sense. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=549.0s)]
*  I think honestly, man, the reason why it's probably not just because they haven't figured out a way to monetize off of it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=553.0s)]
*  Well, the problem is you can't patent it. Right. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=559.0s)]
*  So like if you're selling, you know, whatever it is, some thyroid medication or something, you can patent that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=562.0s)]
*  And then it's your medication that you invented. And then you own the patents. You get all the profits from it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=569.0s)]
*  But when it's a plant, that whole model gets like thrown into the bushes like you can't do shit. Everybody can grow it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=574.0s)]
*  All you need is dirt and water and you can get the drug and then a name. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=581.0s)]
*  Yeah. You can rename it as much as you want. Yeah. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=585.0s)]
*  And then it's you can name as many strains as you want. It's the Wild West out there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=589.0s)]
*  But you couldn't if it was patented, you know, maybe that's what they would want to do is make like a genetic strain, like a Monsanto type weed where they can completely control it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=594.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. Because that's the you know, because they know there's going to be the moneymaker. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=606.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it's just such a conundrum because I, you know, I admire people like you that know no alcohol, no weed, no nothing, just discipline. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=611.0s)]
*  I admire that. It just it builds us to be a little stronger, you know, because man, I've been through so much shit in life and watched a lot of people go through stuff, stuff that make them may take their life because it may be real crucial. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=623.0s)]
*  But when you get to get into the point of why you deal with everything, hit up, it's like it ain't really much. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=639.0s)]
*  It ain't like it's a breeze or a cakewalk every time. But for the most part, we'd be like, man, it'll be ideal with it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=645.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's what keep me going. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=652.0s)]
*  I guess also if you get used to just dealing with shit, then you get strong at dealing with shit. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=655.0s)]
*  Whereas if you just drown and get out all the time, then that becomes a habit. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=661.0s)]
*  But it's so crazy. It's a it became even a bigger habit for me. Right. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=664.0s)]
*  I don't know how long ago it was when I got shot. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=668.0s)]
*  But when I got shot, they ended up on the actually crazy thing is they never they didn't do surgery or anything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=671.0s)]
*  Right. I got shot. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=679.0s)]
*  It was so many people outside the hospital that they were like, man, we need to get him out of here because they never seen them like that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=680.0s)]
*  So they don't know if the people outside was against me or was for me. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=687.0s)]
*  They just never seen it. So long story short, left, got home, cleaned around, it just got the bleeding to stop. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=691.0s)]
*  But days later, they tried to prescribe me medicine. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=702.0s)]
*  I think I took the medicine probably for the first five, six days. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=706.0s)]
*  And then once I decided that I could make it through half a day without it, I just like, man, fuck it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=711.0s)]
*  I'm just it can't get no worse than this. You know what I'm saying? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=717.0s)]
*  You know, to get better. So dealing with that, that's just it developed a habit or anything. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=720.0s)]
*  I do. I just go at it about that way. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=727.0s)]
*  I don't know if you ever seen on YouTube, I took the bullet out myself. Jesus. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. But it's just where did you get shot? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=734.0s)]
*  I got shot directly in my back and it shattered my shoulder blade and spent to my shoulder. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=737.0s)]
*  So I sat there for like four or five years. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=745.0s)]
*  And it's so crazy, right? When you hear people tell you the stories. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=747.0s)]
*  There it is. Yeah. So that's me taking it out. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=750.0s)]
*  So it was pushing out. How long after you got shot? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=753.0s)]
*  Yeah, about five. It could have been like five years. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=757.0s)]
*  Five years. So the bullet was still it was working its way out of your skin for five years. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=760.0s)]
*  Wow. That's crazy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=765.0s)]
*  And went on and continue my day. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=769.0s)]
*  Did you get it stitched up at least? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=773.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=775.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=776.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it healed like it was supposed to. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=777.0s)]
*  The fact that I'm not doing surgery, I mean, when I got shot and it healed, that was a cakewalk at that point. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=779.0s)]
*  Why didn't they want to do surgery? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=787.0s)]
*  One, I don't know if for them not have I guess for how many people was there so fast and then them not being able to go in [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=789.0s)]
*  and know if it's somewhere that was damaging or however you want to put the words. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=799.0s)]
*  But they were like, man, we got to get them up out of here. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=804.0s)]
*  And that was just the reality of it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=808.0s)]
*  But the only bad thing is because they didn't move it and it was there, it got tangled up in a lot of my nerves and muscle. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=810.0s)]
*  So like if you ever pay attention to me, like I can't lift my arm directly straight up or do a lot of different things [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=819.0s)]
*  because it was sitting in there for so many years. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=827.0s)]
*  That's got to piss you off because they could have just pulled that out. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=830.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=834.0s)]
*  Definitely because it was so close to the edge. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=835.0s)]
*  Because from the time I got shot to the time it came out, you could always feel it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=838.0s)]
*  So it was that close. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=844.0s)]
*  That's the thing about doctors. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=846.0s)]
*  Like you get a really good doctor or you can get a doctor that's like, no, fucking leave it in there. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=847.0s)]
*  And it's crazy, right, man, because I help a lot of kids in life and you watch some of these doctors, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=852.0s)]
*  they take a personal liking and loving to these kids and just trying to figure out ways to help them. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=858.0s)]
*  Or even some of the elders and then you got some people like shit, it ain't going to work, they ain't going to make it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=865.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=872.0s)]
*  That's the fucked up part about it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=873.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I think some people get real calloused, unfortunately. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=874.0s)]
*  I see a lot of people die and then they lose their feeling for it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=878.0s)]
*  And other people never do. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=881.0s)]
*  That's the best thing about great doctors is you just really appreciate them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=883.0s)]
*  If someone really cares, you really appreciate them. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=888.0s)]
*  That extra, let's try one more time, sometimes can change everything as opposed to there's nothing else we can do. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=891.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially when someone's got a bullet in their shoulder. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=902.0s)]
*  Just get it out of there, man. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=905.0s)]
*  Especially if it's right there. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=908.0s)]
*  Like how far below the surface was it when you first went in? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=909.0s)]
*  No, so when I first went in, it was literally, it was just bulging. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=912.0s)]
*  So like at the skin? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=919.0s)]
*  Yeah, so if you do this, you could always feel it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=921.0s)]
*  So when you look at the video that was on YouTube, by that point it broke the skin on its own. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=924.0s)]
*  Because you know, you'll hear stories like bullets going down, pushed their way out. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=930.0s)]
*  You'll hear the stories during rain or cold weather that'll make you feel some way. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=935.0s)]
*  That's really for real. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=941.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=943.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a piece of metal in you. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=944.0s)]
*  That's what everybody says that has like broken arms when they get plates. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=946.0s)]
*  They get plates in their arms or in their legs. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=949.0s)]
*  A lot of fighters say that when it's cold out it just sucks. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=951.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even think of it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=954.0s)]
*  I ain't never had a broken bone. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=956.0s)]
*  So yeah, I didn't. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=957.0s)]
*  When they break, you know, a lot of times like when you break your forearm, they have to do that. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=959.0s)]
*  They have to screw it in. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=965.0s)]
*  It's pretty gnarly, man. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=967.0s)]
*  You ever seen anybody get it done? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=969.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=970.0s)]
*  A lot of people, they do it from a spinning back fist. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=971.0s)]
*  They throw a spinning back fist and they hit the forearm. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=974.0s)]
*  Shout it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=977.0s)]
*  Yeah, they hit their forearm on someone's forehead and it snaps that way. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=978.0s)]
*  Or they're blocking kicks. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=982.0s)]
*  But when they do it, man, the whole arm has to be cut open. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=984.0s)]
*  They got to put a bar in there and screws and tighten it all together. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=987.0s)]
*  They take it back out or just stay there forever? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=991.0s)]
*  It depends. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=993.0s)]
*  You can get it taken back out. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=994.0s)]
*  Some guys have to get it taken back out because the screws start backing out and they start poking through the skin. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=995.0s)]
*  It makes it really painful, you know, especially if you're trying to kick or block kicks or punch or anything like that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1000.0s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1005.0s)]
*  Much as a diehard UFC fan, my one thing about that is watching them kick. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1006.0s)]
*  I don't understand how they don't break their leg every time they kick, even though I know they do different procedures to make it hard. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1013.0s)]
*  Yeah, the different procedures don't really prevent it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1020.0s)]
*  It makes it definitely tougher. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1024.0s)]
*  Like there's some Thai guys who have crazy shins because they've been like kicking bamboo trees and, you know, kicking pads and heavy bags and bags with sand in them. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1027.0s)]
*  They've been doing that their whole lives. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1036.0s)]
*  So they have like really dense, like really dense shin bones and they just swap people with those like they're baseball bats. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1037.0s)]
*  This dude, I think his name is Malapai and he was fighting in a lion fight and this dude would just go shin to shin with everybody. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1046.0s)]
*  Just kick him in the shins. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1056.0s)]
*  Just kick him in the shins. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1057.0s)]
*  They just couldn't tolerate it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1058.0s)]
*  He would hit so fucking hard and just his bones were just so dense because he'd been doing it forever. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1060.0s)]
*  But even those guys, like they have to be careful. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1066.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm sure Anderson Silva has very dense bones. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1069.0s)]
*  I was just going to say that was one of the ones. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1072.0s)]
*  That kick was crazy. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1075.0s)]
*  That was crazy to watch like an all time great snap his leg like that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1076.0s)]
*  Like no. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1080.0s)]
*  Ah. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1082.0s)]
*  You know, that was one of the favorites, still one of the favorites though. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1084.0s)]
*  He's one of the greatest of all time. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1087.0s)]
*  One of the greatest of all time. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1089.0s)]
*  He was a master at finding people's chins. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1090.0s)]
*  He's just a master. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1092.0s)]
*  Master at like finding when's the opening. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1094.0s)]
*  He was so good. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1097.0s)]
*  You know, somebody that people slept on that if you had to be original UFC fan, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1099.0s)]
*  Vitor Belfort Hands was probably some of the coldest when he was young coming in. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1109.0s)]
*  Nobody had hands like him at 19. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1110.0s)]
*  He fought Trey Tellegman. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1112.0s)]
*  That was his first fight in UFC. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1114.0s)]
*  I remember. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1115.0s)]
*  He from Texas, right? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1116.0s)]
*  From Dallas. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1119.0s)]
*  Yeah, I believe so. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1120.0s)]
*  He was one of the Lions Den guys. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1121.0s)]
*  Fucking Jack, big huge dude. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1124.0s)]
*  And they thought Vitor because he was a black belt in Jiu Jitsu from the Carls and Gracie family, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1126.0s)]
*  they thought that he was just going to do Jiu Jitsu. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1130.0s)]
*  And this dude just comes out and puts on a boxing clinic and you're like, whoa. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1132.0s)]
*  He couldn't get away from him. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1136.0s)]
*  And who was that? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1138.0s)]
*  Did he get Vanderlei Silva? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1139.0s)]
*  Scott Feroza was the next fight he had. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1140.0s)]
*  And then yeah, he fought Vanderlei Silva. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1142.0s)]
*  He ran across the ring and just blitzed him with punches. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1143.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1145.0s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1146.0s)]
*  Vitor Belfort versus Vanderlei Silva. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1147.0s)]
*  I mean, this is great. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1149.0s)]
*  And you know, so crazy at the time, it didn't do Vanderlei justice because nobody knew. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1150.0s)]
*  He ended up turning out to be good as can be. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1157.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1159.0s)]
*  But Belfort flushed right through that shit. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1160.0s)]
*  Well, he just, he caught him and kept him caught. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1162.0s)]
*  He just banged once and then Vitor will just flurry. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1165.0s)]
*  He flurried. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1168.0s)]
*  But yeah, you're right because Vanderlei did become an all time great after that too. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1170.0s)]
*  Yeah, but see then people didn't know. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1174.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1176.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just a blitz. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1177.0s)]
*  I mean, Vitor had some crazy hands, just crazy hands. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1179.0s)]
*  And he was terrified of Vanderlei. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1184.0s)]
*  Everybody was terrified of Vanderlei. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1186.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1187.0s)]
*  That's why they called him the axe murderer. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1188.0s)]
*  That was his nickname. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1189.0s)]
*  I didn't know that at all. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1190.0s)]
*  Vanderlei would just stare at you like this and do this shit with his hands before the fights. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1191.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, oh, this fucking guy. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1195.0s)]
*  I think Vitor, man, once he gained all the weight, that's when he ended up taking the first ill. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1197.0s)]
*  Well, he got way too big. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1203.0s)]
*  But the problem with Vitor at that time, I think, was that you're starting to see this emergence of these big giant wrestlers. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1205.0s)]
*  So like Mark Coleman was the best example. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1212.0s)]
*  And Mark Coleman was like, you know, 260, solid as a rock, giant jacked, super athletic wrestler. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1215.0s)]
*  They took everybody down and everybody's like, oh my God, this guy's so big. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1222.0s)]
*  I got to get big too. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1225.0s)]
*  They felt like that was the only way to beat Mark Coleman. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1226.0s)]
*  So there was like a bunch of guys who started getting really big. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1229.0s)]
*  But, you know, that comes with a gas tank problem. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1233.0s)]
*  You can't get that big with that frame. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1236.0s)]
*  He just couldn't survive. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1238.0s)]
*  And then when he fought Randy Couture, Randy just outworked him. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1240.0s)]
*  Randy was good. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1243.0s)]
*  Randy was very good. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1244.0s)]
*  Randy was very good. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1246.0s)]
*  A lot of people don't, man. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1247.0s)]
*  I used to, that's how far back I go. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1249.0s)]
*  I used to have the VHSs to win when they were doing the tournaments the whole day where you fight more than once. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1256.0s)]
*  So I've been, I used to watch UFC like crazy, man. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1257.0s)]
*  The tournaments were wild. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1261.0s)]
*  They fought more than once in a night. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1262.0s)]
*  I don't think they could do that no more. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1264.0s)]
*  Well, they did it in glory kickboxing a few years back. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1266.0s)]
*  They did it in LA. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1271.0s)]
*  I think it was called Last Man Standing. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1272.0s)]
*  And I think those guys, I want to say they fought three times in a night against world class kickboxers. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1274.0s)]
*  You know, just bananas. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1280.0s)]
*  Who else was, Tank was good back then. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1283.0s)]
*  Tank had to knock out. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1287.0s)]
*  Oh, Tank Gabbitt, yeah. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1288.0s)]
*  Oh, he was an animal. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1290.0s)]
*  He was the first guy to figure out to wrap your hands. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1291.0s)]
*  Tank Gabbitt was the first guy to figure out like if you have MMA gloves on, you actually could punch harder. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1294.0s)]
*  Because like it's harder to punch someone bare knuckle. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1300.0s)]
*  You break your hands easier. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1302.0s)]
*  But if you could really wrap your hands up and put gloves on, it's probably better. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1303.0s)]
*  And so Tank would, he was one of the first guys to put those gloves. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1307.0s)]
*  He might have been the first guy, but he's definitely one of the first guys who was like a big power puncher who put gloves on. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1311.0s)]
*  Yeah, when he did the dude with the dudes hanging with his neck down. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1318.0s)]
*  You remember that one? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1321.0s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. Scott Nelmark, I believe. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1322.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1325.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, he was an animal. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1326.0s)]
*  He was the worst case scenario. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1328.0s)]
*  A guy who liked to drink, talked a lot of shit, and couldn't fight. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1330.0s)]
*  Like, God damn it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1334.0s)]
*  And he fought anybody. He didn't give a fuck. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1337.0s)]
*  Just fought anybody, whoever. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1339.0s)]
*  He fought anybody they put in front of him. Never said no. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1341.0s)]
*  Yeah. Tank was one of them. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1343.0s)]
*  He was one of those guys too. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1345.0s)]
*  When he would show up, people would go crazy. They loved it. They loved that Tank was there. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1346.0s)]
*  You know somebody else like these, even though he's my brother, but still the Beast, the same way people love him no matter what. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1350.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We were just talking about him when we had Kurt Angle on. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1356.0s)]
*  I was saying if anybody could transition from their MMA career into pro wrestling, it's the Beast. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1359.0s)]
*  He could do it. Derek Lewis could 100% be a superstar pro wrestler. 100%. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1365.0s)]
*  If he decided to retire from fighting, he would be huge. He's hilarious. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1371.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1375.0s)]
*  And he's gigantic. He's got all the qualities that you need to be a good pro wrestler. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1376.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the people love him. You know it's so crazy, me and him, we saved a lot of lives together during Hurricane Harvey. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1382.0s)]
*  We went and took care of Beaumont, Port Arthur. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1388.0s)]
*  Matter of fact, it's so crazy. I got my lifted truck out there. That's the reason I bought it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1393.0s)]
*  I bought it because of him. At first I was doing rescues and boats and doing different stuff, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1397.0s)]
*  but then Derek came through in a lifted truck and we were going past the boats in the water. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1402.0s)]
*  So at that point I ended up buying a truck, but we saved a lot of people together. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1407.0s)]
*  That's one of my close, close brothers. That's why whenever y'all see me at the fights and he fighting, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1412.0s)]
*  everybody be looking because I be on my feet yelling like crazy. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1416.0s)]
*  No, Derek's a man. He's hilarious. I'll never forget when he took his shorts off. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1420.0s)]
*  I'm like, Derek, why are your shorts off? My balls is off. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1425.0s)]
*  But it paid off because they ain't got a manscape commercial. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1428.0s)]
*  He should have a manscape commercial. He should have a whole campaign. He's hilarious. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of sport, huh? I mean, that's how I got to meet you from you coming to the fights. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1436.0s)]
*  But I appreciate that you enjoy it too. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1443.0s)]
*  Yeah, shout out John Anik too. He for sure was like, man, you and Joe, I got to get you all two together, man. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1446.0s)]
*  Did he say that? Yeah, John Anik is the man. I love that dude. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1453.0s)]
*  I love that dude. That guy's the best play by play commentator in the history of sport. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1457.0s)]
*  He's the best. He's the goat. He's so smooth, man. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1462.0s)]
*  When he called that Leon Edwards head kick right before Leon landed it on Kamaru Usman, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1465.0s)]
*  because they were saying, we were talking about it like, you know, he's down in this fight and, you know, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1471.0s)]
*  it's like, you know, his corners yelling at him, don't give up, Rock, go get him. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1476.0s)]
*  And John Anik goes, but that is not the cloth from which he's cut. And then boom, he lands a head shot. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1481.0s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. It's like a scene. Like if that was in a movie, you'd go like, that's too dead on. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1488.0s)]
*  No one would make a call like that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1494.0s)]
*  But y'all see it so much. It's probably, man, y'all see a lot of stuff come. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1497.0s)]
*  Well, no, because I watch y'all expressions. Some shit y'all don't be seeing. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1502.0s)]
*  I didn't see that coming, man. I did not see that coming. That was crazy. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1506.0s)]
*  See if you find that play that because it's it's it's like a historical moment when Anik says it. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1510.0s)]
*  It's like he captured it. It's really like a scene in a movie. It doesn't it's like see show it to it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1516.0s)]
*  Show it. That's got music behind it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1526.0s)]
*  OK. Oh, you have two things going on at the same time. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1533.0s)]
*  The tank video going on and did not have music. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1536.0s)]
*  OK. So listen to this, because this is crazy that he nails it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1539.0s)]
*  But that is not the cloth from which he is cut. I mean, that is a dejected. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1543.0s)]
*  Some of the guy. Yeah, they got you. Everybody's got to edit everything. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1550.0s)]
*  These motherfuckers, they can't just leave shit alone. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1555.0s)]
*  I mean, I linked it from an article about the call to. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1558.0s)]
*  Well, that's it. Yeah. John Anik's man. He's just so smooth. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1562.0s)]
*  That's a hard job, man. The job of the color commentator is way easier. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1568.0s)]
*  The job of like my job and Daniel's job. Like when DC and I do it, we're just having fun. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1574.0s)]
*  Like we don't have to do any traffic like he's like directing traffic and this brought to you by Modelo. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1580.0s)]
*  He's got to do all that stuff. And I never noticed the difference. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1586.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. If you notice the difference, if you pay attention, it's like he does much more work. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1589.0s)]
*  He's way better. Like he's like coordinated. He's got notes and he's got index cards and shit. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1595.0s)]
*  You know, he has to say certain things at certain times, you know, about prime energy drink. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1603.0s)]
*  And, you know, this movie's coming up and this and that. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1608.0s)]
*  Like there's little things you have to jump in. Toyo tires. Like you have to jump in with all that stuff. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1611.0s)]
*  I thought that was all. Yeah. I didn't know it was just him. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1616.0s)]
*  DC and I are like eating snacks and having a good time watching the fights. Yeah. See, he's got cards and shit. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1619.0s)]
*  Look at him all jazzed up. Yeah. He gets excited. He's the man. Love that, dude. The three of us together. So much fun. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1629.0s)]
*  Definitely, man. I watch a lot of the time. Man, you know, my wishes that I really want to see, I want to see Derek get a championship. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1637.0s)]
*  And I want to see Dustin Poirier get one of them too. Two of my closest, man. I just, I, they'd be right there at the edge, man. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like even the time that the thing with Derek, I don't, most people ain't going to be able to withstand the flurry once he gets you. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1655.0s)]
*  Once he hits you. Yeah, but a couple of people got lucky and got through it and just threw me out. But that's what I want. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1666.0s)]
*  I want at least them to at least get their chance to beat Champ one time, man. Well, listen, Derek can knock anybody out. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1673.0s)]
*  I mean, that crazy flying knee that he opened up his last fight. It was worth it. He practiced it. Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1681.0s)]
*  He just nailed them right out the gate. And if Derek does that to anybody that are on skates, he hits so hard. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1688.0s)]
*  He's got the most knockouts of anyone in the history of the division. Yeah, definitely do. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1695.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing with him, it can be at the end of the fight. Yeah. All it takes is one for him. He's always got it. Yeah. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1701.0s)]
*  Yeah, he carries that power league. I thought Dustin even was going to win this last fight. They just, that kick came, you know, but Dustin, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1708.0s)]
*  I feel like boxing wise, Dustin still, he mastered that from his weave game to everything. He's very good. He's very, very good. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1716.0s)]
*  But so is Gagey. Yeah, yeah. Not to take nothing from him. And Dustin got him in the first fight. The first fight, Dustin got him. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1724.0s)]
*  And it was a, Dustin rather got him. And it was a hell of a war. And Gagey got him in this one. But the way he got him, like, oh my God, that head kick. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1731.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing was it's in the same arena in Salt Lake City. That they had the first one. A year later from the Kamaru Usman knockout. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1739.0s)]
*  It's basically the same knockout. It's the same knockout. The way Leon Edwards knocks out Kamaru with the left leg is exactly what Justin Gage did with the right leg. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1746.0s)]
*  Same thing. It shows the punch, the kicks behind the punch. Same thing. Amazing. Yeah, crazy. I didn't know that. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1754.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's, somebody played a video or somebody made a video of the two of them back to back. See if you can find that. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1761.0s)]
*  It's like you could see one plays out and then the other one plays out. And it's almost identical. Just mirrored. Just the different legs. Left leg versus right leg. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1767.0s)]
*  But Justin's a monster, man. Justin Gagey's, he's on fire right now. He's on fire. You know, I mean, he's only lost to the best in the division. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1776.0s)]
*  You know, like Charles Olivera and Khabib and a couple other guys like Dustin. But right now he's on fire. He's on fire. Especially that last fight. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1785.0s)]
*  And then the fight before that with Fazeev. That guy's a beast too. That was an amazing fight. So Justin is like, he's at the top of the heap. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1794.0s)]
*  I would love to see him fight for the title. Whoever wins this weekend with the, or when is that? October 21st, right? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1804.0s)]
*  Now when is the Olivera one? October 21st. When that card takes place. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1812.0s)]
*  Like that is, that's going to be a very interesting thing to see who gets the next shot at it. Because Justin Gagey versus the winner. That would be really interesting. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1820.0s)]
*  Look at this. So here's Leon's kick on the left and then Justin's on the right. Same exact thing. Wild, right? Wild. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1829.0s)]
*  And that's two head kicks to win the title. You know, a year apart from each other in Salt Lake City. Like Salt Lake City's got some magic in the air. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1838.0s)]
*  Definitely. If that happened back to back in the arena. Yes. Yeah. It's a crazy sport, man. When did you first start getting into it? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1846.0s)]
*  Oh man. Since way back then with the Gracies and the Ken Shanrocks. I used to get them from Blockbuster. That's when I, I still probably got them big chess tapes, man. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1857.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So it was in the beginning phases, man. That's how I got interested to it too. I got UFC 2. Picked it up at like Hollywood Video. And I was like, what is this? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1874.0s)]
*  And I remember immediately thinking, oh my God, I have to learn Jiu Jitsu. Like these guys are all getting killed. When you watch Hoist Gracie strangle everybody and break everybody's arms. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1889.0s)]
*  And people, he was, I don't know how tall he is in person, but he was probably one of the smallest people it seemed like looking at it from a fan standpoint. He's skinny too, right? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1900.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Hoist was 176 pounds when he was tapping out guys like Dan Severn, who was like a beast 250 pound wrestler. He was so good, man. And no one knew what to do. They had never seen Gracie Jiu Jitsu before. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1909.0s)]
*  And Hoist just, he was the perfect advertisement for Jiu Jitsu too. Cause it wasn't like he was built, like he wasn't like jacked like Tyron Woodley or something or someone like super jacked Brock Lesnar. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1923.0s)]
*  No, he's like a thin normal looking guy who fucked everybody up. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1935.0s)]
*  I'm talking about literally with choked the shit out of people. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1939.0s)]
*  And he was doing it to everybody, man. It was interesting. It was really interesting because so many people just didn't know what to do with him. And he was fighting with that Gi-On, which I think they let him keep fighting with the Gi-On. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1944.0s)]
*  I think in a lot of his future fights he would have had more better results too. Cause he had some fights with no Gi. And it's like, man, Hoist with the Gi was just a master. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1954.0s)]
*  Master at choking you with it, a master at getting you to grab it so he could initiate grappling exchanges. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1964.0s)]
*  Yep, that was his story. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1970.0s)]
*  That one family, particularly Hoist, but that one family, they changed martial arts forever. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1972.0s)]
*  Do any of them still fight? None of them fight? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1979.0s)]
*  No, no, none of them. I mean they're all quite a bit older. But talk about a family that had all time great Jiu Jitsu people coming out of it. I mean that's insane. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1982.0s)]
*  That one family really influenced the way martial arts is expressed all over the world. People are learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Russia. They're learning it in France and they're learning it in Ireland. It's one family. It's crazy, man. It's really crazy. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=1992.0s)]
*  If anybody learned it from him, it would be him. People need to go do their research and go back and watch some of his fights. Looking at him, you would have no idea. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2010.0s)]
*  Yeah, Hoist was something really special because we had never seen that before. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2019.0s)]
*  It was the first time we had ever seen something where the martial art was more important in size and strength. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2024.0s)]
*  If you were actually a smaller person who was proficient in this martial art, because that's what most martial arts promise you, that you would be able to beat a bigger person. But there's some physical issues. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2030.0s)]
*  Like if you're a 135 pound guy and you're fighting Derrick Lewis, you got a real problem. You got a real problem. You got a real problem, a size problem that I don't think you're going to be able to surmount. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2042.0s)]
*  He's going to slap your ass across that ring. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2052.0s)]
*  He hits you once you're in a coma. There's no way. He's too big. You're not going to be able to just take him down. It's going to be wild. He's going to throw you off him. He's going to kick you. He's going to punch you. You're fucked. He's too big. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2054.0s)]
*  He's too big. But with Jiu Jitsu, it became if he didn't know Jiu Jitsu and Hoist got a hold of him, he could avoid the damage, drag him to the ground and submit him. And we had never seen that before. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2065.0s)]
*  It was always if you saw two guys slugging it out, you know, generally they were either the same size. It was like a boxing or kickboxing fight. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2078.0s)]
*  Or if they weren't, the big guy always killed the small guy. Always. And the UFC was the first time we saw this one guy who was like normal size guy, not crazy muscles, nothing. Just dominate everybody. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2087.0s)]
*  We were like, what is he doing? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2099.0s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely was one of the faces. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2101.0s)]
*  Yeah, what is he doing? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2103.0s)]
*  Then when you first went to see one live, when was that? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2111.0s)]
*  Crazy, I think. Derrick had me come out to, it was in Houston. That was my first time. It was him. I was with him and John Jones. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2117.0s)]
*  And we were giving out, we actually gave out bump boxes too. And from there, me and Dana got real close. And just the whole team. And it's been that way since. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2128.0s)]
*  I ended up doing a deal with Dana not long after, as far as the licensing and stuff with bump boxes. So that's why you see UFC across a lot of our stuff and a lot of our stuff within what they got going on. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2140.0s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. So you guys got a collaboration together. Yeah, that's beautiful. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2154.0s)]
*  That's why you see me every time at the fights. You'll see me backstage. But like when we do the weigh-ins and stuff, we make sure we take care of all the fighters and other stuff. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2158.0s)]
*  You know what's great that you gave me? That Tumblr that has a speaker at the bottom of it. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2168.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We did a partnership with Gronkowski. And it's actually growing. People really still ain't even realizing it's a speaker on the cup. They're just thinking it's a cool shaker cup. But nah, it's something dope, man. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2172.0s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2185.0s)]
*  Well actually, you know, you got the first, and Post's probably going to be mad because I got to get his, but you got the first cornhole with the speakers. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2186.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2194.0s)]
*  So we own the rights to that. Any cornhole that has any type of music on it, that's us. So we had a first official cornhole with speakers on it and you can pair them together. So as you're playing the game, you can just vibe out. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2195.0s)]
*  Alright. That's a great beach game. But I can't believe it's on ESPN now. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2210.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tailgate and Beach. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2217.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2219.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a sport now on TV? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2220.0s)]
*  I think it's on TV. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2222.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. There's people that are surprisingly really good at it. They can do a lot of shit. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2223.0s)]
*  Let me see some fucking pro cornhole. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2228.0s)]
*  Like what do you win? A bunch of money or? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2230.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do like tournaments in Vegas I think at the end of the day. But let's see if I can find a lot of views. I've seen they're calling out what they need to do and they just do it. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2232.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2242.0s)]
*  It's like the whole three hours. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2244.0s)]
*  Your bump box been man. It's been a blessing for us. You know, shout out to all my partners there. We took the company from just a few radios, just you know, getting them out there to NAS, worldwide. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2246.0s)]
*  So here's the World Championships, American Cornhole League. Okay, this is a top shots. Let's see. These guys stand around a lot. One in the hole. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2261.0s)]
*  He did it without hitting the other bags, which is kind of like, that's pretty fucking tough to do. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2274.0s)]
*  Is that better? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2279.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they're probably those bags are probably tied to the other team. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2280.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2284.0s)]
*  So if you knock them in, they get the points. If you don't do that, then you get the points. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2285.0s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. This guy's doing it with the mask on. I hope I missed. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2288.0s)]
*  So you see how it's standing up with the. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2294.0s)]
*  Everybody has a med. This must have been during COVID. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They probably forced him to wear that mask. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2300.0s)]
*  You heard me Joe. You see how it's standing up with the legs. So wherever the legs are, those are actual speakers. Nice. What a great idea. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2306.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're making these people wear masks. How stupid is this? But we're going to look back on the masks and go, what the fuck were we doing? What the fuck were we doing? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2314.0s)]
*  But COVID fucked up a lot of shit for everything. At this point, I realized just from helping so many people in the community in general, I realized how damaging it was business wise. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2323.0s)]
*  I watched how damaging it was because now if you pay attention, some of the new movies that come out, it just goes straight to streaming at this point. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2336.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2345.0s)]
*  Yes. So I don't know if that helped money for the movie, but it seemed like it definitely hurt. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2346.0s)]
*  I don't think it does. And I don't think it's good for the actors either. I think that's part of the strike. I'm kind of speaking out of turn here because I don't really know what the fuck I'm talking about. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2351.0s)]
*  Is that part of it? Is that they want more money from streaming? Yeah, but it's a lot of the actors that are not top build type people. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2360.0s)]
*  You know, they can pay one fee and then they're never going to get residuals. Right. So that they're trying to get some of those residuals and stuff is getting resold. That's definitely part of it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2369.0s)]
*  You know what they're doing that's wild? They're trying. Some of these studios are trying to make people sign contracts. If you do background work where they could use your likeness from then on so they could repurpose you in other background scenes as CGI. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2378.0s)]
*  They're like kind of like them licensing your name. Yeah. So permanently, I guess you would say. For like nothing. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2393.0s)]
*  That's the culture of, you know, people that aren't stars over there and movies, though, you know, extras are not. They don't think about it that way. It's really interesting because like they're going to be able to make movies with it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2400.0s)]
*  They're going to be able to make a movie with you. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2415.0s)]
*  Or you speak Chinese and you, you know, you run an army somewhere. I mean, they can do whatever they want. They can with CGI and with this new AI voice stuff. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2417.0s)]
*  They could literally do whatever they want and they could turn any person who's already been in a bunch of films where they have your face. They could put you in all kinds of scenes. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2428.0s)]
*  Like we're real close to them not needing actors anymore, which is kind of weird. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2438.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's even just not just the actors, just even with us with music, you know, like at first when they say something about it and they may say something about you can put a Michael Jackson to somebody else on the same record. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2443.0s)]
*  You know, of course you'd be curious to be like, shit, dope. I wonder what that sound like. But then we start thinking about it. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2456.0s)]
*  They damn they won't really need us at some point because now they they making your voice sound the same and making you look the same. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2462.0s)]
*  Like it's just the shit weird. But one thing I know, man, the bigger companies, they don't find a way to block this shit somehow, someway, because that's taking all the money. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2468.0s)]
*  It's definitely going to change things, right? Like that Drake song that got put out, that was a fake Drake song. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2481.0s)]
*  The songs that AI created Drake song, people loved it. Yeah. They can do wild shit now, man. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2489.0s)]
*  It's good. It's like we're not that far away from them being able to replicate full movies, all fake people. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2496.0s)]
*  You know, I'll be watching from a distance like I'm watching a lot of the robot stuff start to really come to life now, you know, and it's just. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2504.0s)]
*  Does that freak you out? Yeah. So for two reasons. One, because definitely at this point shit. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2515.0s)]
*  Anything, if anything go wrong at this point, we damn the fuck because they build them down there invincible. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2521.0s)]
*  But to the other part that freaked me out is they show this shit in movies years back and everything that they show is coming to be that exact. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2529.0s)]
*  Think about it, even with COVID, right? If you go look at some of the other movies where you have different pandemics, same shit. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2540.0s)]
*  So then when you go to seeing shit with the robot, what year Will Smith came out with that movie? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2547.0s)]
*  That was. I robot. Yeah, that was great. That could have been, was that 10 years ago? Maybe. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2553.0s)]
*  Maybe more. Yeah, but to see that shit now is like, it's like they be knowing. It's crazy. What was it? 20 years ago. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2558.0s)]
*  That's even crazy. 20 years ago and not looking what we we're dealing with right now. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2566.0s)]
*  So yeah, we're about 10 years away from that being real. You know, they've already developed these very lifelike robots. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2570.0s)]
*  We're doing the human first human Neuralink. Oh, my God. And this is what Elon just tweeted an hour ago that with that, when a Neuralink is combined with Optimus robot limbs, the Luke Skywalker solution can be real, can become real. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2577.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. Click on that, man. Let me see that. This is actually showing like what it would look like. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2592.0s)]
*  I thought it really was that. Not yet. Probably one day they'll just have a fake hand. Yeah, they're getting the first person. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2600.0s)]
*  They're looking for someone with quadriplegia right now. Whether or not they found that person over the last few days, I don't know. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2608.0s)]
*  Whoa, we are watching something. We are. We're watching the seeds of something that's going to overcome the human race. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2614.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that shit is not good. That shit is just when you think about it. But of course, you know, you think that should have been far gone past our time. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2622.0s)]
*  But then you still got to think of our kids and those generations because it's definitely going to be dangerous. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2632.0s)]
*  It's definitely going to be dangerous. But yeah, they're going to have our kids and their kids are going to have a totally different world that they live in. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2638.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially with the who you watch movies with the flying car shit. Now they really technically getting it together. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2645.0s)]
*  That is the last thing you want. People have a hard enough time just slamming into each other on the street on the ground. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2652.0s)]
*  I just announced yesterday that there's a flying taxi warehouse opening up in Ohio next month or next year. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2658.0s)]
*  Whoa, I don't know where they're going to fly them. Are you going to fly into one of those things? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2664.0s)]
*  I have no idea. Do they have one in New York already? That's not true. Did they start doing that in New York? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2670.0s)]
*  I don't know why they would do it in New York. There is one right there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2675.0s)]
*  Yeah, New York definitely has like the Blade system, which is like Uber helicopter kind of thing. I don't know if they have something like this. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2678.0s)]
*  Uber helicopter. They have that. And that's in the they use that. That's part of what the problem was in that cut gems. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2684.0s)]
*  Like that wasn't around then. Remember, he uses that helicopter to fly from. Oh, yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2689.0s)]
*  Do it from like the from Manhattan to the airport and just get there in 20 minutes. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2694.0s)]
*  Helicopters freak me out. I don't know about these. I went up with Bill Burr. It was a lot of fun. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2698.0s)]
*  Bill Burr is a helicopter pilot. He's one of my favorite comedians. I don't know if it's his voice or what. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2704.0s)]
*  Oh, he's hilarious. So good. Such a good guy. But he's a pilot. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2711.0s)]
*  And so he took me in the helicopter around downtown. You can kind of go wherever you want. It is like a flying car. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2716.0s)]
*  That's what they thought the flying car was going to be. They thought helicopters when they first invented them, they thought it was going to be a flying car. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2721.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. Yeah, that was the CV. Find the original helicopter because I think that's literally what they were selling it as. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2727.0s)]
*  What do you mean? The original helicopter that was just right. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2735.0s)]
*  Invention of Da Vinci. Oh, yeah. Right. He wrote it down. Right. He wrote it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2739.0s)]
*  Original flying car. See if it says that because I think that's that's kind of the concept. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2745.0s)]
*  They thought, oh, we'll get helicopters and then people just fly around in helicopters. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2753.0s)]
*  And then I think they bailed on that because I think they realized like you want knuckleheads banging blades 10,000 feet above cities. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2757.0s)]
*  If you watch people bump in traffic now and just exactly someone's on their phone flying around in a helicopter. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2767.0s)]
*  Tweeting the text. Yeah, not good. Definitely not good. Yeah, it's. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2776.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. I'm all for freedom, but I don't want people falling out of the sky and of people's houses either. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2782.0s)]
*  I don't know that helicopters. I don't really feel comfortable in helicopters. I'm more cool with a plane. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2789.0s)]
*  Do you ever do tour bus thing? Do you do tour buses ever? Yeah, yeah, sometimes, man. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2797.0s)]
*  But, you know, we get we so comfortable now we just jump in a load of suburban and get to where we got to go. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2803.0s)]
*  Because, you know, even when I think my last tour me and T.I. did, we were on tour bus. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2813.0s)]
*  But even then, you know, it's more so just when we trying to get to the next city, because ideally we still going to go to a hotel and do what we got to do. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2819.0s)]
*  So you don't sleep on the tour bus? You do. If you're going from a city and you may have a six to eight hour stretch, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2827.0s)]
*  you got somewhere to lay down as opposed to having to sit up sleeping in the suburban or something. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2836.0s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable sleeping in those things, because I feel like if this thing crashes, I don't want to be asleep in this bunk bed. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2840.0s)]
*  I ain't never thought of it that way. No? Yeah, no. That would be bad. That's bad. Very bad. Real bad. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2846.0s)]
*  Isn't that how Gloria Estefan broke her back? How do I know that? I think that's true. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2853.0s)]
*  I think that's true. I think her tour bus crashed. What happened? Yeah. That's what happened? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2860.0s)]
*  Snow covered highways, Grand, Pennsylvania, semi truck, four hours of surgery, spinal surgery. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2871.0s)]
*  You just opened my eyes to that? I literally just talked to somebody two days ago at Drake concert who has tour buses. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2882.0s)]
*  He was like, man, next time you want to go out, whether it's touring, because my album is getting ready to come out. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2893.0s)]
*  So either that or even if you want to take the tour bus when you're going to go help during disasters, you can take the bus out. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2899.0s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. But you're going to make me think, it depends on how far that drive is. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2907.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just don't lay down. It seems like you should be in a seatbelt. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2911.0s)]
*  Because that's the thing about tour buses too, people are driving around. It's almost like they're in a green room. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2915.0s)]
*  It's like, bro, we're moving. Put the fucking seatbelt on. Let's not die. You don't do that in a regular car, right? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2920.0s)]
*  Definitely don't. For a good reason. Because you don't want to go through the windshield. So put your fucking seatbelt on, bro. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2927.0s)]
*  But everybody wants to have a good time. That's the weird thing about limos and tour buses. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2934.0s)]
*  One of the things I heard about limos is when they crash, the real scary thing is people's heads slam into each other. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2940.0s)]
*  I can see that because limos, you rarely ever see seatbelts. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2946.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, if they are, people aren't wearing them. And then when they slam on the brakes, you go flying. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2951.0s)]
*  And you go flying into each other. And you could fucking headbutt each other at 35 miles an hour. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2957.0s)]
*  It's like, not good. You think of the abrupt stop of the violent action of some accidents. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2963.0s)]
*  If you're not in a seatbelt and you're in a limo together, you could get fucked up. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2970.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you've got to realize on a time of impact, usually when you see something coming, you can brace yourself. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2975.0s)]
*  But when it's unexpected, it's a wrap. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2981.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're not even bracing. You just feel the driver hit the brakes. You don't know what to do. And then bam. Not good. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2983.0s)]
*  Wear your seatbelt, kids. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2992.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely do that. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2993.0s)]
*  I was trying to find what you're asking me to look for and I can't find it. And there's someone across this. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=2998.0s)]
*  There's something called a Model A Aleph. Aleph? Aleph? Have you seen this? It's a flying car. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3002.0s)]
*  And they're saying it's available now. It's 300 grand. I haven't found a video of it flying. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3007.0s)]
*  But this is at the Detroit car show. It's got wheels here on like normal size with the wheels. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3012.0s)]
*  But the rest of the car is made up of eight fans and it says it can fly like 110 miles. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3018.0s)]
*  What? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3023.0s)]
*  I'll show you a different video. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3024.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3025.0s)]
*  What? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3026.0s)]
*  I saw this one. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3027.0s)]
*  Really? So it looks like a car and flies like that just with the fans? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3028.0s)]
*  There's wheels there and there's the whole rest of the body and this like the cockpit where you are turns. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3034.0s)]
*  Yo, how do you steer that thing? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3039.0s)]
*  I wonder if they make you go to flight school for these type cars. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3042.0s)]
*  You definitely should. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3046.0s)]
*  Take off that. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3047.0s)]
*  That was an interesting video but this doesn't show it flying. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3050.0s)]
*  Oh, this thing. Does that show it's flying? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3056.0s)]
*  Well, this is like their video of it. So it's not accurate but that's what they're saying it's going to look like. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3059.0s)]
*  Oh, so you're going to go like sideways. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3065.0s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3067.0s)]
*  Look at all those flying above the... [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3068.0s)]
*  What? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3070.0s)]
*  I wouldn't fuck with it at all. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3071.0s)]
*  What? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3072.0s)]
*  So I thought it was saying that the cockpit turns so the fans are behind you. Is that what happened? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3074.0s)]
*  It says street legal e-vetel which means a vertical takeoff. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3079.0s)]
*  Oh, look at that. There's an accident. He flies. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3082.0s)]
*  He just skips over it and goes back. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3085.0s)]
*  Yo. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3087.0s)]
*  That would definitely have a lot of people running into each other but... [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3088.0s)]
*  They'd land on each other. Fuck you bitch. This is my lane. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3091.0s)]
*  But the way that looked, this has like the blades, you know, you can't hit anything with it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3093.0s)]
*  They're all protected. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3099.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3100.0s)]
*  So that problem is gone. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3101.0s)]
*  But a fender bender, the blades would slam into the fucking structure and then you'd be dead. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3102.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think I want to be part of that in no time. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3107.0s)]
*  No, not for the first few generations of it. Let's sort that out first. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3112.0s)]
*  They got to get the kinks out first. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3116.0s)]
*  You ever fuck with electric cars? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3117.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3119.0s)]
*  You ever fuck with electric cars? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3120.0s)]
*  I mean, I got a Tesla but nothing major. I still haven't let it auto drive me though. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3122.0s)]
*  No, that's scary. I do it a little. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3129.0s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3132.0s)]
*  I go doodoo and I just like kind of barely hold onto the wheel but it makes me feel weird. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3133.0s)]
*  Never went to sleep though in the midst of it? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3137.0s)]
*  No. Yeah, I was watching a guy on video, somebody captured him from the cell phone. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3139.0s)]
*  It was asleep in his Tesla in bumper to bumper highway, just out cold. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3143.0s)]
*  And the car moves forward, stops, moves forward and stops and he's just snoring. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3147.0s)]
*  All it takes is one wrong malfunction and everybody... [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3152.0s)]
*  Yeah, that can happen. It's not all worked out yet. Don't go to sleep, bro. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3157.0s)]
*  But you know, man, it's so crazy you sit there because I was saying I was going to find somebody tied in a Tesla. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3163.0s)]
*  I wanted to just get the Tesla truck just because I don't know why. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3170.0s)]
*  It looks amazing. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3173.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think more so for the looks. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3174.0s)]
*  Oh, it looks amazing. I saw one in real life and I was blown away because the pictures look good. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3176.0s)]
*  But when you're there in real life, it's big. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3182.0s)]
*  Oh, it is? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3185.0s)]
*  It's big and it's stamped steel. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3186.0s)]
*  Like that's not like a regular door. That's a door that can stop a 45 round. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3188.0s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing is stamped steel and it raises and lowers. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3193.0s)]
*  So it hits a button and it goes... [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3197.0s)]
*  It gets up like, I think it raises like 16 inches or something crazy like that. I might be wrong. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3200.0s)]
*  But it has insane horsepower. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3205.0s)]
*  It goes zero to 16 in like three and a half seconds. This giant thing made of stamped steel. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3208.0s)]
*  It's a car of the future. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3213.0s)]
*  They were telling me you have to be selected to be... [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3215.0s)]
*  I mean, even though they say you can put money down on what you have to be, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3218.0s)]
*  I think they're doing certain selected people that they'll get it early because I sure was trying to get one. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3222.0s)]
*  I think they started delivering them because there was a truck that someone filmed on the highway that had cyber trucks in it. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3227.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3235.0s)]
*  And they were delivering them somewhere. I don't know if it's delivering them to the final production. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3236.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's delivering them to the actual owners. Are people driving those things yet? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3239.0s)]
*  I have seen and heard a lot of the stuff you're just saying. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3244.0s)]
*  And right now it says like someone might have leaked the event. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3247.0s)]
*  They've sent out emails saying people might be able to come get them soon. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3253.0s)]
*  Upcoming delivery event in Austin. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3257.0s)]
*  Doesn't say when it is. It could be next month or next year. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3260.0s)]
*  They finished building the factory out here already? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3263.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Gigafactory. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3265.0s)]
*  You know, I bought... It was so crazy right before they did it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3267.0s)]
*  I bought 15 acres in Thrall, Texas, not far from here. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3270.0s)]
*  And then they just told me the price of my land down there almost doubled just because of the Tesla factory. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3275.0s)]
*  That makes sense. That's a great investment. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3281.0s)]
*  Yeah, that factory is nuts. Have you ever seen it? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3284.0s)]
*  That's where they showed us the cyber truck. It's huge. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3287.0s)]
*  Like the factory looks like the Death Star. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3290.0s)]
*  Like as you're pulling up to it, you're like, what are they making here? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3293.0s)]
*  I think it's the biggest building I've ever been in. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3296.0s)]
*  That's crazy. They brought it right to Texas. That's a good thing. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3302.0s)]
*  Everything bigger in Texas. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3303.0s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't it one of the biggest car production buildings ever or something like that? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3304.0s)]
*  It's something crazy like that. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3309.0s)]
*  Tesla, if you hear us right now, we want a cyber truck. We definitely want one. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3311.0s)]
*  Yeah, we need to get that. That thing looks amazing. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3315.0s)]
*  Second largest building by volume in the world. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3318.0s)]
*  10 million square feet of floor space. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3321.0s)]
*  That means a lot of people got jobs now. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3323.0s)]
*  A lot of people got jobs. A lot of cars getting made. They're getting made right here. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3325.0s)]
*  When you see if you could Google cyber truck. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3329.0s)]
*  Let me see what it looks like when it's driving around. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3333.0s)]
*  Do they have a video of anybody driving it? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3336.0s)]
*  YouTube shorts has quite. There's a few videos. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3338.0s)]
*  There's like an inside video someone has here. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3340.0s)]
*  There's one driving around LA here. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3344.0s)]
*  When you see it in real life, man, it's sick. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3348.0s)]
*  It really does look like something from the future. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3351.0s)]
*  I mean, that looks like a future car. Look at that thing. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3354.0s)]
*  Like if you were like looking at a movie from 2023 and like 1984, you would think this. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3357.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to have like future looking spacecraft trucks. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3363.0s)]
*  When you see it in real life, it's undeniable. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3370.0s)]
*  You see it in real life. I thought it was cool looking in pictures, but you see it in real life. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3373.0s)]
*  This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. It's amazing. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3377.0s)]
*  And there's no reason for it. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3381.0s)]
*  There's no reason to make a bulletproof electric vehicle with stamped steel. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3383.0s)]
*  Like why are you doing that? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3389.0s)]
*  That's the cool thing about Eid line. He does whatever the fuck he wants. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3391.0s)]
*  I was just going to say it just seemed like he being able to live his childhood out at this point. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3393.0s)]
*  He does whatever he feels. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3397.0s)]
*  He does whatever he wants. Yeah, he does whatever he wants. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3398.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's got enough money and ability to get things done. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3402.0s)]
*  You know, I mean that dude made his rocket extra pointy to be more like space balls, right? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3409.0s)]
*  Wasn't it space balls? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3415.0s)]
*  He loves space balls. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3418.0s)]
*  He loves that movie. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3419.0s)]
*  So he made the rocket extra pointy to be like the rocket from space balls. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3421.0s)]
*  That shit probably cost him a few millions to do that shit. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3425.0s)]
*  Fuck. He's having fun. I like when billionaires have fun. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3428.0s)]
*  You know, do you use X? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3433.0s)]
*  I mean here and there. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3437.0s)]
*  Most of the stuff that I put on Instagram, I just rehab it on there. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3439.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do you fuck with TikTok or any of the other ones too? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3445.0s)]
*  I'm learning it, man. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3449.0s)]
*  So I've been more of a hands on Instagram. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3450.0s)]
*  So I have people that do like my TikTok. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3453.0s)]
*  I can get on it if I want to. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3457.0s)]
*  I still don't even know nothing about Facebook. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3459.0s)]
*  I have people doing that for me too. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3462.0s)]
*  I literally can, whatever I post from Instagram, I just take it there. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3464.0s)]
*  Because I don't know, I built my Instagram following to that's just who I'm used to. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3469.0s)]
*  What do you use more? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3476.0s)]
*  I use Instagram most. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3478.0s)]
*  But I love X for information. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3480.0s)]
*  I still feel weird saying X. Twitter. Whatever. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3483.0s)]
*  I like that for information. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3487.0s)]
*  It's always interesting. Always interesting stuff coming up. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3489.0s)]
*  I use threads sometimes too. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3492.0s)]
*  At this point I just got to keep up with the times. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3494.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's the weird thing, right? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3497.0s)]
*  It's like there's always going to be some new thing that you have to keep up with. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3499.0s)]
*  And you won't know about it until it's too late. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3502.0s)]
*  Like what's that? What are you guys doing over there? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3504.0s)]
*  See the reason it worked out for us, I got my... [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3507.0s)]
*  And it's so crazy, I don't really get to put albums out. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3511.0s)]
*  I love my music, but every time I get ready to put an album out, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3514.0s)]
*  a disaster hit or something happens. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3520.0s)]
*  My energy and everything shifts to that. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3523.0s)]
*  So the music always gets lost in the shuffle. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3526.0s)]
*  And this is the first time in a minute that nothing is really just distracting me. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3528.0s)]
*  My album came out on October 20th, as a matter of fact. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3534.0s)]
*  It's called Stuck in Motion. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3538.0s)]
*  Being able to have the X, the TikTok, these are all different platforms that you really can use to promote. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3541.0s)]
*  Because everybody don't use... [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3549.0s)]
*  You got some people that don't mess with Instagram and only use TikTok. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3551.0s)]
*  Some people, now that... [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3555.0s)]
*  I don't know how heavy people are in the threads, but some people only use X. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3557.0s)]
*  So we found ways, we just use it for our benefit. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3561.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3565.0s)]
*  Just use everything. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3566.0s)]
*  Yeah. Everything we can at this moment. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3567.0s)]
*  Everything. Just keep throwing it out there. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3569.0s)]
*  That's great. It's great you've had that time to concentrate on your album too. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3571.0s)]
*  That must be very exciting. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3575.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is man. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3576.0s)]
*  Because you know... [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3577.0s)]
*  So this is the catch to the smoke part, right? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3579.0s)]
*  So you know, everybody also have their thing, whatever. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3581.0s)]
*  Some people may like to go work out to get out their frustration or whatever. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3586.0s)]
*  Mine is I can bend through my music. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3591.0s)]
*  I done bend through so much. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3593.0s)]
*  I mastered just releasing it through my music. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3595.0s)]
*  And the way I paint the picture, you know, you have people actually feeling exactly how I feel at that moment. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3599.0s)]
*  Because I'm not good at sitting up here like, man, Joe, I had a terrible day today. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3605.0s)]
*  This is going on. I don't feel comfortable. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3610.0s)]
*  But if I do it through the music, it's just more relatable. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3613.0s)]
*  I'm excited about it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3617.0s)]
*  Now the funny thing I'm going to show you probably when we get off. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3619.0s)]
*  I just did, I released a song called First Class, one of the first singles. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3622.0s)]
*  Because I'm releasing singles every two weeks leading up to it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3627.0s)]
*  And in First Class, I had my bro, Philly Flyboy shot it. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3630.0s)]
*  And I had some people, White Rhino, VFX, they're from San Antonio. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3636.0s)]
*  They edited my old school Cadillac drop until I'm flying around on the cloud. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3641.0s)]
*  So it's just crazy. We just talking about that shit. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3648.0s)]
*  But super dope, man. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3651.0s)]
*  Oh, that is cool. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3652.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3653.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3654.0s)]
*  When you release this, is that the beginning of a tour? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3655.0s)]
*  Right now, hopefully. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3659.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, man, believe it or not, even if we've been in the game for as long as we do, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3661.0s)]
*  we still be nervous and don't really know what comes about. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3668.0s)]
*  You never know what record, like when I released the album, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3671.0s)]
*  you never know what record people are going to take to. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3674.0s)]
*  We don't know if we're going to take off or if you got to build it up. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3676.0s)]
*  But realistically, the goal is when it comes out to get ready to get on the road. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3679.0s)]
*  You know, I love, that's one thing I love. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3685.0s)]
*  My two main things or three is my kids, the music and just helping people, man. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3687.0s)]
*  So, you know, like those are three things that excite me. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3694.0s)]
*  But other than that, I like I just I venture off and just try everything. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3698.0s)]
*  I feel like you get zero results if you don't try it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3701.0s)]
*  You know, that's a beautiful philosophy. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3705.0s)]
*  The way you balance it all out. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3708.0s)]
*  That's a good thing, because, you know, a lot of us can get caught up in maybe one thing too much. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3710.0s)]
*  You know, that just to have this idea of like your family, your job, everything. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3716.0s)]
*  It's all everything deserves equal attention. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3720.0s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, man, it's with life, like I just be so realistic with everything, man, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3723.0s)]
*  because, you know, we all have our good days. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3729.0s)]
*  We all have our bad days. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3731.0s)]
*  We all mess up time to time, you know. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3733.0s)]
*  And for me, it's just how we bounce back. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3735.0s)]
*  And even with some of the hiccups I've had within the last year or two, you know, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3738.0s)]
*  I've had a lot of learning experiences, but I feel like even with this album, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3744.0s)]
*  the reason I named it Stuck in Motion was rather than me be dwelling on [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3749.0s)]
*  shit that I could have done different or shit I could have done better or to be just held back or sad or just trying to, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3754.0s)]
*  you know, a lot of times we complain about a bunch of shit. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3762.0s)]
*  And I feel like I'm at a point in my life now. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3765.0s)]
*  It's like, man, you just got to accept stuff for what it is. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3767.0s)]
*  So the reason I named it Stuck in Motion is regardless of what I'm going through, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3769.0s)]
*  I'm still moving. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3773.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep it moving whichever direction I'm aimed at, that's where I'm going. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3774.0s)]
*  So I'm Stuck in Motion. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3778.0s)]
*  That was the purpose of it, man. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3779.0s)]
*  That's a good name for it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3781.0s)]
*  So when you say you never know, like, how it's going to be received, like, but is this your favorite? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3782.0s)]
*  I think it's definitely, it's going to be an important one in my catalog because, you know, I'm from the streets. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3789.0s)]
*  So most of my music is always going to be that this album is more just good vibe. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3797.0s)]
*  I think it's more growth and more universal where you could just, for those who smoke, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3803.0s)]
*  you can put it on and just light your blunt up or you just get in your car and ride. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3808.0s)]
*  So for me, it's important because I just feel like it's an album of growth. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3813.0s)]
*  You know, I'm just showing I'm unbothered, I'm living life, I'm enjoying life. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3817.0s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of people don't really understand, man. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3822.0s)]
*  It's not just about money, they enjoy life, you know, it's what different things you had that bring peace to you. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3824.0s)]
*  So I just think I'm at a point in life where I'm just enjoying life, you know, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3831.0s)]
*  and that's why I think it's going to be so, so important for me. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3835.0s)]
*  And what I'm doing to it, what I'm doing with it also that's going to make it different is I don't know if you've seen, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3839.0s)]
*  they say you can put out, like I'm shooting a video for every song, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3846.0s)]
*  but in between the songs I want to do little short movie skits so it'll be like from a start to a finish, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3852.0s)]
*  like a whole project where I'm making, put it on Amazon or something like that. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3859.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3863.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm just trying to think of just different creative shit with this. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3864.0s)]
*  I like that. I like that idea. Yeah. Yeah, just tie it in together, make a movie out of it. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3867.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3873.0s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3874.0s)]
*  I got a movie coming too, but this is just going to be focused on the music, you know, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3875.0s)]
*  because you have different people, man. For me, you have different fans from different things. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3880.0s)]
*  And music wise, I want to make sure I'll make sure I set that one apart. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3884.0s)]
*  But it's definitely exciting. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3889.0s)]
*  One of my bros, he one of the main DJs out of Houston, you know, that kind of can shift the culture, DJ Mr. Rogers. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3893.0s)]
*  I had him executive producer, you know, just from a musical standpoint to find records that he think people would take to, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3904.0s)]
*  you know, which at the end of the day, we chose all the records I did. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3912.0s)]
*  So it worked out. But that putting all the visuals together to make it dope. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3915.0s)]
*  And what I'm going to do too, that's going to be creative. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3921.0s)]
*  So when I was talking about the movie part, I'm going to actually get actors for different roles, you know, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3924.0s)]
*  so it'll just be something bigger than me just going to stand on the corner and have one of my homeboys talking to me. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3931.0s)]
*  That's a great idea. Are you going to write it out after the music? Like the music's done, right? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3938.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3945.0s)]
*  So are you now thinking about like how you're going to put together a movie that ties in with all the songs? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3946.0s)]
*  So right now, I guess the way that I'm really envisioning it is I just each part, I just create different scenarios. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3952.0s)]
*  So at that point, you don't really make it as I have to really write it out. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3961.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Just in between these skits, what scenario it may be, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3965.0s)]
*  it may be me and Amir having a conversation with myself, but the reflection of Amir may be a whole another actor that's, you know, good, good, bad guy. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3969.0s)]
*  So you just create different scenarios and then I just figure out how to tie it in. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3978.0s)]
*  But for the most part, it's just simple. I don't think it'll take too, too much. I just I'm just excited to be doing it like I leave. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3983.0s)]
*  It's so it's so crazy when I was just telling you also that I have so many different people that support me in different ways. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=3993.0s)]
*  So when I leave here today, I fly to L.A. for the BMAC Awards and they're giving me the change agent award. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4001.0s)]
*  Speaking of awards, I'm not sure if you know, I got probably every award you could think of from anything you think of from helping, fighting, whatever the situation may be, man. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4009.0s)]
*  And that's a blessing. Like I'm at a point now I'd be like, man, I don't really you ain't got to give me a war. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4022.0s)]
*  I'm going to do the work regardless. But it's nice to be recognized. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4027.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's you don't want to kind of go against God's blessings because if you feel like, hey, I want you to be recognized for it. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4030.0s)]
*  Who am I to say like, I don't need this shit like I can't do that. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4037.0s)]
*  No, that's beautiful. You said you were doing another movie. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4040.0s)]
*  So the movie is done. It's called Soul. And it's a crazy story. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4044.0s)]
*  My my godfelliflyboy and Richie Rich out of Houston, they were just getting people to send in scripts and they found one that they like. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4051.0s)]
*  It's Soul. It's about a shoe store. But my father went to jail. He was a hustler. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4060.0s)]
*  I ended up coming across some money and I got a shoe store. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4068.0s)]
*  But when my father went to jail, he had two million dollars that was unaccounted for, shall we say. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4072.0s)]
*  And so the whole movie everybody it's a comedy, but everybody trying to get at me and get to me and harm me to try and figure out where the money is. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4080.0s)]
*  But it's just it's more some funny stuff. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4088.0s)]
*  Man, like I said, I'm at a point now I'm just trying different stuff like so that's going to be dope. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4091.0s)]
*  And it actually come out any day on Tubi. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4098.0s)]
*  I don't really understand the process of it because I thought they'd give me a time and a date where I could promote it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4100.0s)]
*  But they just like you never know when it'll pop up. When it pop up, you just get to promoting it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4106.0s)]
*  But I'm doing that. The reason what I was getting to what I'm going to tell you, I'm at a point of having fun. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4111.0s)]

*  I got Batman, Deadpool, Lightning McQueen. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4125.0s)]
*  So in that video, I'm an actual superhero in that video. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4131.0s)]
*  So I'm just trying different stuff, just having fun and just living life at this point. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4134.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. Just being creative. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4139.0s)]
*  Having a good time. Definitely, man. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4142.0s)]
*  But yeah, the music that's that's my go to, you know, either that or just getting out the house. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4145.0s)]
*  I don't know why I'd be I'd be overexcited when I when I help people, man, just to see the fact that I'm not by theyself. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4152.0s)]
*  And the fact that I'm not somebody actually care that kind of give me my excitement to you. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4160.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. That's excitement. We all should be seeking, right? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4165.0s)]
*  You know, helping people. It's nice. Feels good. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4168.0s)]
*  Definitely does, man. And you you dedicate a lot of time to it and you should be rewarded for that. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4173.0s)]
*  Beautiful. But you know, you never really do it for the rewards. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4178.0s)]
*  Of course. Well, your rewards are spiritual, emotional, which you get from people. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4182.0s)]
*  And you know, different blessings come. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4187.0s)]
*  You know, man, I didn't when I tell you, I didn't just my career alone. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4190.0s)]
*  I've been through a lot of shit. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4195.0s)]
*  I don't have decades of bumping my head. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4197.0s)]
*  And then you may have the whole world turned against you. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4203.0s)]
*  Then you have to just keep pushing. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4206.0s)]
*  It's like I deal with so much different stuff, but that's one thing I don't stop doing. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4207.0s)]
*  And every time I bless and get bigger and bigger, which I honestly think God put me through some of these processes because I feel like for me to go to the next level, you have to see if I'm really ready. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4212.0s)]
*  So even now, like one of my biggest things that's hard for me now is to imagine just not reacting to people like, you know, because I want to be. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4225.0s)]
*  Because I want to be. You definitely can get under my skin like imagine you at a UFC and somebody just you walk by somebody like fuck you, Joe. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4234.0s)]
*  You see, like they might not even do one or two things you can you can ignore it or you can be like, man, hold on. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4243.0s)]
*  You got me fucked up. So so so dealing with phases of getting through. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4251.0s)]
*  That's all part of growth for what he got playing for me in the future, man. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4257.0s)]
*  And that's that's definitely a process of dealing. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4261.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a part of the thing that comes with fame, right? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4264.0s)]
*  It's going to be a certain bunch of people to get mad at you. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4270.0s)]
*  Yeah, for whatever reason, whether it's valid or not. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4273.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think, man, that the hard part is. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4276.0s)]
*  Dealing with it because you have to deal with it, but the reality of it is, man, sometimes you got to get to a point. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4281.0s)]
*  They don't think what they want to think regardless. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4288.0s)]
*  Yes. And you got to just you got to just keep it moving, you know, even if you know they direct opinion or they direct thought may not necessarily be true. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4290.0s)]
*  Or it could be partially true. It may not even be. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4300.0s)]
*  It could be five percent true, but at the end of this, like you can't really waste your time just over explaining it because it's still going to be somebody out there that don't want to hear. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4303.0s)]
*  You're going to be interacting with too many people. That's the problem. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4311.0s)]
*  You can't be considering all the opinions of all these different people at a certain point in time. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4314.0s)]
*  You got to let that go. And if people are critical or they're shitty or mean to you, what? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4319.0s)]
*  I don't mean that. You got no time. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4325.0s)]
*  See, that's the growth part because that is not going to learn that right. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4327.0s)]
*  That shit is not easy. Not easy. It's not easy to not read the comments. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4331.0s)]
*  But for your mental health, you really should because you know, and also like there's a lot of accounts online that aren't real people. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4336.0s)]
*  There's a lot. There's a lot, man. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4346.0s)]
*  That's one of the things that I do do on X. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4351.0s)]
*  I'll go in and a controversial subject like, you know, whatever it is, climate change or whatever the fuck it is. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4353.0s)]
*  And I'll just go reading into the comments and see, you know, how people and you'll find these outrageous comments and you're like, what is this? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4359.0s)]
*  And you click on it's just a bunch of letters and a few numbers for the name. And then you click on it. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4367.0s)]
*  Oh, this is a fake account. This is account that just retweets things and says outrageous shit and just provokes people fighting with each other. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4372.0s)]
*  And like how many of those are out there, man? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4380.0s)]
*  A lot. Definitely. It would be to the point now, but I take the time to block all the people that be like, I gained this fortune from here. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4382.0s)]
*  Some of that shit be like, man, it's too much. Like it'd be damn near 30 of them comments about how to get some money. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4396.0s)]
*  And they'd be like, no, my favorite of the ones that are pretending to be girls looking for a boyfriend. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4403.0s)]
*  I get them a lot too. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4408.0s)]
*  Because it's like who's followed for that? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4411.0s)]
*  I need a boyfriend. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4414.0s)]

*  You got to then they have two followers on that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4420.0s)]
*  Maybe not even that. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4423.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4424.0s)]

*  How the fuck do they even find our pages? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4440.0s)]
*  Well, I think when you get a page that has a lot of people on it, they just glom onto it. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4442.0s)]
*  And every time you post, they post immediately. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4446.0s)]
*  They probably have some sort of a computer program. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4449.0s)]
*  Right? Does that make sense? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4452.0s)]

*  Speaking of that, have you ever, I've yet to figure out how when you're randomly thinking about something on Instagram [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4549.0s)]
*  or say something and all the fuck, the ads just start popping up for that shit. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4556.0s)]
*  Yeah, people want to deny that's real. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4560.0s)]
*  I definitely know it's real. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4562.0s)]
*  That seems very real. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4564.0s)]
*  But it's either one day they're listening to what we're doing, but sometimes what if you're just thinking [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4565.0s)]
*  and you just start seeing the shit so it's still weird. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4570.0s)]
*  I've never had that happen. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4573.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4575.0s)]
*  No, I've never been thinking about it and then it just pops up. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4576.0s)]
*  I literally can be. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4578.0s)]
*  You've had a jamie? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4580.0s)]
*  Yeah, I literally be thinking about it may be clothes or anything and then it just randomly just, I don't understand that shit man. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4581.0s)]
*  You've had that jamie? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4587.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4588.0s)]
*  You should test it this week somehow. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4589.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4592.0s)]
*  Don't use your phone to look, think of a random product. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4593.0s)]
*  Maybe talk to someone about it. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4596.0s)]
*  You can't just think about something random and it's going to show up. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4598.0s)]
*  I don't mean it that drastically, but don't Google search anything. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4600.0s)]
*  Try to think of something super random and you'll start getting ads for it. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4604.0s)]
*  Is this evidence of the Matrix? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4607.0s)]
*  What is this? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4608.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4609.0s)]
*  If you start thinking about it and then you get it on your phone. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4610.0s)]
*  That shit is. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4613.0s)]
*  And then, so I have to actually, I have to think back to think that I even say something to somebody or did I click on something. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4614.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4621.0s)]
*  But honestly, it just would have been a thought in my brain and then this shit just, it don't be one ad, it be multiple ads popping up. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4622.0s)]
*  And sometimes it make me fall into buying shit. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4630.0s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4633.0s)]
*  I just think that those thoughts, it knows what you've been listening to and watching and that you're eventually going to think of this kind of thing. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4635.0s)]
*  I kind of think that's what it is. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4640.0s)]
*  It's just like deduction. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4642.0s)]
*  Man, the internet is dangerous. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4643.0s)]
*  Fuck, that's crazy. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4644.0s)]
*  It plays us. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4646.0s)]
*  I buy more shit on Amazon that I probably wouldn't buy just because you can just click, click, click. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4648.0s)]
*  I haven't bought toothpaste in a store in forever. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4655.0s)]
*  Just click. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4658.0s)]
*  One click, it's on its way. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4660.0s)]
*  Yay. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4662.0s)]
*  I don't have to think. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4663.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4664.0s)]
*  Internet is definitely something different. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4665.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4667.0s)]
*  Just wait until you just 3D print things in your house. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4668.0s)]
*  That's going to happen too. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4670.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4672.0s)]
*  People are going to have supplies of materials. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4673.0s)]
*  They'll have silicone and metals and all these different things. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4677.0s)]
*  And they're going to be able to 3D print things. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4682.0s)]
*  Because right now they can 3D print a lot of shit. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4685.0s)]
*  They can make all sorts of pla- they can make guns. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4688.0s)]
*  They can 3D print guns. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4692.0s)]
*  They can 3D print a lot of stuff. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4694.0s)]
*  They can 3D print houses. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4695.0s)]
*  They 3D print sections of houses and then they stack them all together and build a house with it. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4697.0s)]
*  And if you had a 3D printer in your home and you had all these materials, like for at least some things, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4702.0s)]
*  I would imagine you'd be able to 3D print objects in your house now. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4709.0s)]
*  Instead of buying them, you'd just like buy the plans or buy like a license to print it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4713.0s)]
*  But that- with that, that print shit may cost a arm and a leg. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4719.0s)]
*  Initially it probably will. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4723.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4724.0s)]
*  It probably always will. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4725.0s)]
*  It's pretty complicated. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4726.0s)]
*  It's pretty complicated. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4727.0s)]
*  But the idea of like going somewhere and getting a thing, it's probably going to be less and less. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4728.0s)]
*  You're probably making the thing in your house when these things get more sophisticated. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4734.0s)]
*  That's just a guess though. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4738.0s)]
*  Is that possible? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4739.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4740.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4741.0s)]
*  But I still have wondered what- to what extent? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4742.0s)]
*  Because most of the stuff I see people 3D printing, it's a bunch of like- it's mostly junk. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4745.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4749.0s)]
*  It's just like trinkets and plastic and things that you don't need. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4750.0s)]
*  Could you make a knife, you know? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4754.0s)]
*  Could you make an awesome knife that a blacksmith couldn't make that way? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4756.0s)]
*  I don't think you could. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4760.0s)]
*  You can make car parts though. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4762.0s)]
*  I know they 3D print car parts. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4764.0s)]
*  Like metal, like renewal. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4766.0s)]
*  I don't know what they can 3D print. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4768.0s)]
*  Can they 3D print metal? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4770.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4772.0s)]
*  I mean I'm looking like there's a copper at least. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4773.0s)]
*  I don't know how- like once you 3D print something, there's still a process you have to do to make it look good and pretty usable. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4775.0s)]
*  You have to dunk it in some sort of water solution. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4782.0s)]
*  I don't know what you do with the metal. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4784.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4786.0s)]
*  You know that's what Bob Lazar thinks that spaceship that he worked on was made with. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4787.0s)]
*  He thinks it was somehow 3D printed because it has no seams. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4792.0s)]
*  You paying attention to this UFO shit? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4797.0s)]
*  No? Good for you. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4799.0s)]
*  No, but I know you do so I'm going to ask because I- it's like this shit just- there's so much shit that's just coming out now. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4801.0s)]
*  I don't understand what's the motive behind it just randomly coming out now. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4809.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm super suspicious. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4815.0s)]
*  So what's the place? Area- [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4817.0s)]
*  51? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4819.0s)]
*  Area 51. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4820.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4821.0s)]
*  Like I'm assuming that shit has been real? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4822.0s)]
*  That's real. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4826.0s)]
*  But Area 51 was used for all sorts of training purposes. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4827.0s)]
*  They had all sorts of programs that were running out there. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4832.0s)]
*  I think that's where they developed the B-52. Is that where they developed it? Area 51? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4836.0s)]
*  They developed a bunch of different military technologies out there. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4840.0s)]
*  So nothing was true about the- [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4845.0s)]
*  We don't know. We don't know. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4847.0s)]
*  They're all just guessing about whether or not they're working on UFOs. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4849.0s)]
*  But they were definitely working on other stuff too. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4851.0s)]
*  It's a legitimate military base. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4853.0s)]
*  So you think these videos are real? That's coming out? Or you think it's- [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4855.0s)]
*  I think the videos are real. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4859.0s)]
*  What they're filming, I don't know what that is. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4861.0s)]
*  It could be that it's some super sophisticated US-controlled drone that was built in some sort of program that's top secret. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4864.0s)]
*  And it has some new super sophisticated propulsion system that they don't want us to know about. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4876.0s)]
*  And so they pretend it's coming from another world. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4882.0s)]
*  And they say, oh, these are off-world crafts, exhibiting behavior that's impossible to replicate in America. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4886.0s)]
*  I wonder. I wonder. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4892.0s)]
*  Because if they're talking about it like that, they're literally saying off-world. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4894.0s)]
*  Like, boy, I get suspicious. I get suspicious. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4897.0s)]
*  Because they're not super honest about anything. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4901.0s)]
*  Why would they be honest about spaceships? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4904.0s)]
*  Then it just randomly happens now. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4906.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's another nice distraction. Gets people all excited. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4909.0s)]
*  You know, the fucking fake little Mexican UFO, baby. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4913.0s)]
*  They're doubling down. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4916.0s)]
*  No, they're not. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4917.0s)]
*  They took it. This is from the MRI yesterday. They said it's one skeleton. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4918.0s)]
*  What did they find out? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4922.0s)]
*  They're trying to other American scientists are saying, well, let people test samples of it or something. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4924.0s)]
*  Well, did they have images from the MRI? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4929.0s)]
*  I don't know that they showed those actual images, but the doctor that took it, they said right here, they belonged to a single skeleton that has not been joined to other pieces. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4932.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4939.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4940.0s)]
*  Footage from the team carrying out the tests shows one of the bodies bearing an elongated head, a small upturned nose, and two slanted eyes. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4941.0s)]
*  The subjects look tiny when held up by the doctors examining for the watching journalists. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4949.0s)]
*  Then this also is like this person says that I think it's the doctor has claimed that he talks to the Virgin of Guadalupe, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4955.0s)]
*  and the extraterrestrials will not talk to her like they talk to him because she doesn't believe in them. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4962.0s)]
*  Maybe he does drugs. Maybe he's telling the truth. Maybe he did talk to the Virgin of Guadalupe. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4968.0s)]
*  So that's what it's supposed to be. I want to see what those images look like. They don't have them. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4976.0s)]
*  You ever notice how none of the images be clear? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4985.0s)]
*  Like that you really want to see? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4986.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a real problem. I talked to this one guy, Christopher Mellon. He used to be an intelligence agent, and he said that they do have clear footage. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4988.0s)]
*  It just hasn't been leaked, but that he's aware of it. And some of it is pretty mind-blowing. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=4996.0s)]
*  He said, show me. Until I see it, I don't know, man. I feel like a dummy because I want to believe in it so bad. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5000.0s)]
*  That's the problem because it's so fun. You know, the idea of spaceships coming here from another galaxy. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5009.0s)]
*  I don't know how fun, especially if they ain't friendly. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5016.0s)]
*  Well, if they weren't friendly, we'd already be fucked, right? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5020.0s)]
*  I mean, if they've been coming here forever, supposedly, and they haven't heard us yet, we're probably okay. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5024.0s)]
*  You know, I think they're probably observing us. They're probably, if they are coming from another world, they're probably making sure we don't blow ourselves up. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5031.0s)]
*  They're probably realizing that we're at this convergence of the evolution of the biology and then science and technology and its abilities that far surpass [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5040.0s)]
*  the speed that the biology evolves. Like the biology evolves very slowly, relatively compared to these computers. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5052.0s)]
*  The things that they're able to do, these spaceships and the flying cars. It's like we have so much ability now and we're still the same kind of creature. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5060.0s)]
*  We're still humans, you know, but now we have this insane ability to blow up a whole country. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5069.0s)]
*  Like we have nuclear bombs. We're all pointing them at each other and there's enough to wipe out the whole world. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5076.0s)]
*  Like if I was an alien, I'd be like, let's keep an eye on these crazy fucks. You know, people are wild. Let's keep an eye on them. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5082.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. Definitely. I'm going to keep my distance from that. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5090.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5097.0s)]
*  I don't want to fly to Mars. I don't want to do none of that shit. I just, man, live my life. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5099.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be a long time before people get comfortable moving to Mars. I don't know how long that's going to be, but that's a fucking commitment. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5104.0s)]
*  Didn't they have somebody recently go? Are they letting people go now? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5114.0s)]
*  No, they haven't let people go yet. They've sent drones. So they have the Mars Rover that goes around on Mars, but that's just a robot. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5117.0s)]
*  But the idea is to have people on Mars. I think, didn't Elon say by like 2035 or something like that he wants a manned trip to Mars? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5127.0s)]
*  That's crazy. He keeps saying his name. He's the only, he's doing whatever the fuck he wants to do at this point. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5137.0s)]
*  He's a wild fella. It's a crazy thing to do. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5143.0s)]
*  Definitely is. Might wake up some shit we don't need to wake up. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5147.0s)]
*  Elon Musk speaks at COO said manned mission will reach Mars by 2030. NASA says otherwise. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5152.0s)]
*  It's probably somewhere in the middle because like most of these things take longer than you think they're going to take. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5161.0s)]
*  Like even his cars, like they thought that cyber truck was already going to be out. And then there was that roadster. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5167.0s)]
*  Like where's that fucking thing? You know, those things take a long ass time to develop. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5173.0s)]
*  You got to get all the kinks out. You got to make sure. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5178.0s)]
*  Because he's going to be responsible for people going over there. If they can't actually be there or live there, he's going to be responsible for a bunch of people. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5181.0s)]
*  You got to like a whole city in Mars and the air breaks. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5190.0s)]
*  I don't like that he said you can only go twice a year. The trip can only happen on like two days out of the year. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5194.0s)]
*  You have to wait six months if you miss the window. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5201.0s)]
*  What if the window like a storm rolls through? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5205.0s)]
*  Six months. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5207.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5209.0s)]
*  See? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5213.0s)]
*  Bro. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5214.0s)]
*  Yeah. A bunch of money going to be wasted. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5215.0s)]
*  Not just money. It's just scary. The idea of being a six month journey to another planet. That's how long it takes to get there. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5218.0s)]
*  Oh, that's how long it takes to get there. I thought you were saying he only go up. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5226.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's a window of six months, but that's how long it takes. Doesn't it take six months to get there? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5229.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck no. I for sure would never. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5234.0s)]
*  It took the Apollo mission two, I think two weeks to get to moon. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5237.0s)]
*  It could even be seven months. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5241.0s)]
*  So it might be seven months. Seven months in a spaceship. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5242.0s)]
*  Traveling at 24,600 miles an hour. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5245.0s)]
*  What does that feel like? You probably don't even notice it. You probably look out the window and you don't see shit. Like are we there yet? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5251.0s)]
*  I'm just saying the food, everything would be horrible. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5257.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5260.0s)]
*  Fuck no, I can't. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5261.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's going to be no barbecue. If you're flying how many thousands of miles an hour? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5263.0s)]
*  Almost 25,000. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5269.0s)]
*  Almost 25,000 miles an hour. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5270.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5273.0s)]
*  What does that feel like? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5275.0s)]
*  Very uncomfortable. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5277.0s)]
*  And knowing you can't turn around. You can't take a month in and go, you know what guys, I'm going to pull over at this rest stop and I can't do this anymore. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5279.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not only that, everybody revolves around phones and the internet. No, it ain't going to be that shit up there. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5289.0s)]
*  Yeah, you will have no idea what's going on on earth. They must have some communication, right? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5296.0s)]
*  I'd imagine the Starlink is going to go with it, but what if it doesn't work? I don't know. Have they been able to go test it? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5301.0s)]
*  Test the speeds? Report back? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5309.0s)]
*  Imagine being the first dude to try to touch down on Mars. Oh my God. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5311.0s)]
*  Oh my God. But there's going to be people that do it. Just like there's people that go to Everest. People that want to climb K2. There's going to be people that do it, no matter what it is. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5315.0s)]
*  I just won't be one of them, bro. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5327.0s)]
*  I definitely won't be one of the first. I'm definitely not going to do that six month thing. Fuck that. You only live a hundred years. You got to take a half of a year to go to the other planet that sucks. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5331.0s)]
*  Is it people going to the moon already? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5343.0s)]
*  Well, the Apollo astronauts. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5345.0s)]
*  This thing says they're going back. The article that was pulled up about NASA said they have a plan to go back to the moon 2025. The south pole of the moon. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5349.0s)]
*  Oh wow. That'd be interesting. I wonder if it looks better than the original footage. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5357.0s)]
*  These days they better have good cameras. They got everything else. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5363.0s)]
*  That's going to be interesting. They pulled that off. That will crush the moon hoax deniers. But I don't know. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5368.0s)]
*  You say the hoax? Yeah, the people that think that we never went to the moon. That's a fun one. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5376.0s)]
*  But we did though. Yeah, but there's people that believe it was a hoax. And if you go down that rabbit hole online. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5382.0s)]
*  I hate YouTube hoax man. I'd be in that shit for hours. People got the original shit I was looking up. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5391.0s)]
*  YouTube hoax. Definitely. Especially with something like that. They'll take you down a dark, dark road. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5401.0s)]
*  And you start thinking, I don't think we went to the moon. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5409.0s)]
*  They definitely will. They got to wear brainwashing. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5412.0s)]
*  Well there's so many conspiracy theories you can get into. If you just don't care and just want to go in a rabbit hole. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5417.0s)]
*  There's so many rabbit holes to go down. The Rockefellers. There's so many rabbit holes that you can go down. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5425.0s)]
*  Engineering of America. Oh Jesus. You don't want to think about it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5432.0s)]
*  And they take their time to make it believable what they're saying. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5437.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's hard to know. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5442.0s)]
*  So, you've been watching the UFC for a long time. Do you train at all? Do you do any jiu-jitsu? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5445.0s)]
*  Man, believe it or not, I did. It was a long time ago. They were going to do where you switch from a rapper to a UFC fighter. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5455.0s)]
*  And I'll never forget I did the training. I was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5464.0s)]
*  At Jackson Winkle? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5469.0s)]
*  I don't know the exact place. Who was the... [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5471.0s)]
*  Damn. Is that where Sanchez used to train? I forgot. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5477.0s)]
*  Diego? Yeah. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5481.0s)]
*  So wherever that gym was. Yeah, Greg Jackson's. Jackson Winkle, John. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5482.0s)]
*  Trained the whole day. By the end I was throwing up in the middle of the ring. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5487.0s)]
*  And when I did they told me, okay now you officially had a good workout. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5491.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck this. I never. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5495.0s)]
*  But then, so that's when I was learning about the leg part, right? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5498.0s)]
*  So they had like these bamboo sticks, kind of. It's like some kind of sticks. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5502.0s)]
*  And they would just tap my shin. And they were like, this is what you do to start hardening. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5507.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I'm good on all that, man. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5512.0s)]
*  And all the other time is with Derrick, you know, I go mess around and play with him at the gym. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5515.0s)]
*  But that's it, man. That's a lot of work. I'm not down with throwing up every time I work out. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5520.0s)]
*  You look like fit and strong, so you must be doing some kind of work now. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5526.0s)]
*  I work out here and there, which I feel I've been slacking lately because I've been so focused on just filming and getting ready for this album, man. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5529.0s)]
*  But yeah, definitely. I like to work out. I don't like to do the. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5537.0s)]
*  I've always said I wanted to learn the submission side of stuff, because man, you know, you can watch some people that you get ready to fight and they just drop to the ground. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5541.0s)]
*  And they hope that they can get you there. Yeah. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5552.0s)]
*  And whether it may be the break summer, whether it may be the put you to sleep. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5554.0s)]
*  So I've always been curious to figure that out. Definitely. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5557.0s)]
*  But that's it. That work out is some little intense man. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5561.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it'll start off like if you go to a beginner's class, it'll be fun. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5565.0s)]
*  How long you've been doing? Enjoy it. I started doing it in 90. Seriously, in 98. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5569.0s)]
*  Yeah, I took a couple of classes before that, but not much. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5578.0s)]
*  And then in night, you know, I did like a little bit of Carlson Gracie's. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5583.0s)]
*  But then in 98, I joined John Jock Machado's. And that's when I really started training. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5587.0s)]
*  No, we really did it to fight just to train. Just to train. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5591.0s)]
*  I was already 30. It's like, I don't need to be getting my ass kicked. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5594.0s)]
*  I'm busy doing other shit. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5598.0s)]
*  When you see the sacrifice that fighters put in and what it does to their body [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5600.0s)]
*  and the amount of attention that they have to put to their craft, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5605.0s)]
*  you don't dabble in that. I don't want to dabble in that. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5609.0s)]
*  What they're doing, I wouldn't, you know. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5613.0s)]
*  What you're doing with a professional fighter, you're taking one of the riskiest paths in all of life. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5616.0s)]
*  You're going to gamble your body and the function of your body to make your living [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5621.0s)]
*  and the function of your body while you're going against other trained killers [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5627.0s)]
*  and just throwing bones at each other, slamming shins and elbows into heads [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5630.0s)]
*  and strangling people and taking arm bars and like, whoa. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5635.0s)]
*  So probably what would be the average, now the average age, anywhere from what, 25 to 35 maybe? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5639.0s)]
*  For pro fighters? Yeah. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5646.0s)]
*  Well, you got Raul Rosas Jr., who is like 18 years old. Yeah, of course. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5648.0s)]
*  He's the youngest guy. And you know he's good too. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5653.0s)]
*  He's really good. He's got a massive potential. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5656.0s)]
*  You're getting a lot of pretty good guys in their early 20s now, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5659.0s)]
*  which is interesting because in the early days, it took guys a while to put all the pieces together. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5664.0s)]
*  They maybe started as a wrestler and then they learned how to strike [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5671.0s)]
*  or they started as a striker and they learned how to wrestle. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5676.0s)]
*  You're seeing these kids coming up that are 20 years old. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5678.0s)]
*  They're like proficient in everything. Submissions, kickboxing, they put it all together beautifully. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5681.0s)]
*  They're trained in MMA from a very young age. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5687.0s)]
*  Instead of adapting a previous skill set like boxing or wrestling to MMA, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5691.0s)]
*  they're learning the whole thing from the jump. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5697.0s)]
*  And I think those guys have a giant advantage. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5699.0s)]
*  And they're also like every generation, there's always going to be the greats, right? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5702.0s)]
*  You're always going to have your Mike Tysons, your Michael Jordans. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5707.0s)]
*  You're always going to have your greats. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5710.0s)]
*  But every generation seems to develop more and more high level athletes in every sport. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5711.0s)]
*  And in MMA, that's no different. It's maybe even more prevalent in MMA. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5719.0s)]
*  It's exploding now. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5725.0s)]
*  So you see in like Dana White's Tuesday Night Contenders series, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5727.0s)]
*  you'll see guys on that show that are just straight up killers. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5730.0s)]
*  And you're like, this guy is an absolute UFC caliber fighter, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5735.0s)]
*  and they're fighting to get a shot on the show. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5739.0s)]
*  So these guys that are coming up are already really good. Really good. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5741.0s)]
*  So yeah, I've watched... [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5746.0s)]
*  One thing I came to understand, man, like I will watch... [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5749.0s)]
*  Like even now, I still...I go support all fights. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5753.0s)]
*  Like I go do the Fury fighting in Houston and other things. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5755.0s)]
*  But you watch some fighters go from there to the UFC. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5759.0s)]
*  And I don't think people really understand how qualified the UFC... [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5763.0s)]
*  It's a different type of monster. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5770.0s)]
*  You know, it's just as if somebody coming from college that jump into the pros. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5772.0s)]
*  They're really good at what they do. And that shit counts. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5778.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it counts. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5781.0s)]
*  It's...at the top of the heap, you know, there's guys in the UFC that aren't like any organization ever. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5783.0s)]
*  At the top of the heap. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5791.0s)]
*  But there's some other organizations right now, like Bellator has some really good fighters, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5792.0s)]
*  and One FC has some really good fighters. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5796.0s)]
*  There's guys that are like commensurate, that they could probably get to the UFC. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5798.0s)]
*  But when they come, it's still hard for them though. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5802.0s)]
*  It's hard. It's hard for everybody in the UFC. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5804.0s)]
*  I mean, look, we're talking about Dustin Poirier and Justin Gaethje. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5806.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5809.0s)]
*  Those guys are the top cream of the crop. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5810.0s)]
*  And when they go at it like that, you know, one guy could get cracked, and that's what we saw. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5812.0s)]
*  And that's how good they are. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5816.0s)]
*  I mean, at that level, that's really, you know, one guy can win, one guy can lose. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5818.0s)]
*  It's like, they're that good. Like, almost anything can happen. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5823.0s)]
*  That's why that next fight between Oliveira and Isla Makachev is very interesting. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5826.0s)]
*  Because Islam got him in the first fight and submitted him. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5832.0s)]
*  And Oliveira is like hell-bent on getting that title back. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5836.0s)]
*  And I want to say... [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5839.0s)]
*  He's good. You can't take nothing from him. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5840.0s)]
*  Oliveira's a beast. He's a beast. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5842.0s)]
*  And I think watching him struggle with Volkanovsky, you know, he won that decision, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5845.0s)]
*  but it was a very close fight where a lot of people thought he was going to roll him over, smash him, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5850.0s)]
*  because he was so much bigger, probably gave a lot of people some ideas that, oh, he's vulnerable. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5854.0s)]
*  He's not completely invincible like he's looked in all of his fights. He's human. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5860.0s)]
*  So maybe Oliveira will have more confidence coming into this fight. Who knows? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5865.0s)]
*  But it's an exciting fight. Islam's a beast. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5869.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. I mean, look at the camp he came from. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5872.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a crazy camp. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5875.0s)]
*  And they're so filled with elite, high-level grappling. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5877.0s)]
*  Those guys are just killers on the ground. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5881.0s)]
*  And a bunch of them are like great at stand-up, too. A bunch of them are like killer strikers, too. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5883.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, definitely, man. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5888.0s)]
*  You know, I was excited for John Jones to come back, too. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5890.0s)]
*  You know, he's one of my brothers, man. He's definitely... His legacy is already marked. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5894.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, he became the heavyweight champion. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5900.0s)]
*  He went from light heavyweight to heavyweight, you know, and if he defends it... [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5903.0s)]
*  But my hope, this is my hope. Francis Ngono has his big payday, fights Tyson Fury, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5909.0s)]
*  and then the UFC coaxes him back to fight John Jones. That's my hope. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5916.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's possible. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5921.0s)]
*  I mean, they both my homies, but John's different than they... John wanted that one. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5923.0s)]
*  That's the one. That's the one. That's the former... [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5926.0s)]
*  I thought he was not with UFC anymore. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5929.0s)]
*  Well, he's not with UFC right now because he's going to fight Tyson Fury, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5931.0s)]
*  but I don't know if he signed a contract with someone else. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5935.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened. I don't know what the deal is. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5938.0s)]
*  Or maybe they could give him a one-fight exemption away from that contract to fight John Jones and the UFC, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5940.0s)]
*  but they probably wouldn't do that. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5946.0s)]
*  But that's the fight you want to see, though. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5948.0s)]
*  You want to see the guy who was the heavyweight champion, who relinquished the crown, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5951.0s)]
*  come back and fight the guy who won it in his absence. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5955.0s)]
*  That's the perfect fight to see what... [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5958.0s)]
*  And it's also... it's the perfect fight skillfully, too, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5960.0s)]
*  because you see as skillful John is and as dangerous as Francis is. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5964.0s)]
*  Yeah. Francis is definitely super dangerous with his hands. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5969.0s)]
*  With everything. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5972.0s)]
*  But people have to understand John has hands, but John has a little bit of everything, too, man. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5973.0s)]
*  John's got everything. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5979.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5980.0s)]
*  But Francis is as big a heavyweight as there is [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5981.0s)]
*  and as scary a striker in the heavyweight division as there is. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5985.0s)]
*  I would be very curious to see how that fight goes down. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5989.0s)]
*  I think it would be very interesting, and I really wish they could pull that off, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5992.0s)]
*  because I think that's a legacy fight. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5995.0s)]
*  And if John retires after that and if he wins, oh my God, he goes down as the all-time great. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=5997.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6002.0s)]
*  I don't know why people always give him his flowers as the all-time great, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6003.0s)]
*  because he definitely is that. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6007.0s)]
*  I think kind of everybody does now after he won the heavyweight title. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6010.0s)]
*  If you look at his accomplishments, he never really lost. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6013.0s)]
*  He really lost that one fight by disqualification. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6017.0s)]
*  That's it. Every other fight he's won. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6020.0s)]
*  And he's fought against the highest level competition from the time he was 21 years old, 22 years old. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6022.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6029.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, man. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6030.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to deny. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6031.0s)]
*  And he beat really good guys. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6033.0s)]
*  He beat guys that were in their prime. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6036.0s)]
*  John was something special and still is. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6040.0s)]
*  That would be the big fight. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6043.0s)]
*  But I'm interested to see him fight Stipe, too. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6045.0s)]
*  Stipe's been out for a long time, and he's coming back to try to reclaim the title. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6047.0s)]
*  That's interesting, too. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6052.0s)]
*  Not to discredit him, but I'm not sure if he's going to. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6053.0s)]
*  John ain't no easy. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6057.0s)]
*  No, he's not easy. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6058.0s)]
*  At all. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6059.0s)]
*  Well, I think for sure it'll be a John would be the favorite in that fight, the betting favorite. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6060.0s)]
*  But, you know, Stipe is the most decorated heavyweight of all time. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6068.0s)]
*  He defended the title more than anybody. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6072.0s)]
*  He beat so many good people, former champions, Junior dos Santos, Fabricio Verduem. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6074.0s)]
*  He knocked him out to win the title. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6079.0s)]
*  He's a monster. He's really good. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6081.0s)]
*  And, you know, he's had time to relax and recover. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6084.0s)]
*  You know, after that Francis knockout, you want someone to really recover from something like that. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6087.0s)]
*  That was a rough one. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6092.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6093.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6094.0s)]
*  Let's see how this goes, buddy. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6096.0s)]
*  See how it goes. It's exciting, though, right? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6098.0s)]
*  Definitely, man. Definitely. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6100.0s)]
*  I'm the... [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6102.0s)]
*  So I say the power of Francis, even against Tyson, definitely... [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6104.0s)]
*  Fear is definitely going to... [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6111.0s)]
*  I don't know how it's going to count, but I just don't know how it's going to be with the... [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6113.0s)]
*  Because when you always watch these two worlds collide, it's just a little different. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6116.0s)]
*  Well, Tyson Fury is one of the greatest boxers of all time. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6121.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to give him his credit. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6124.0s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6125.0s)]
*  And Francis can punch really hard, and he can box, but can he box with Tyson Fury? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6126.0s)]
*  Right. That's why I say it's always... [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6131.0s)]
*  I don't know something about it. It's just different. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6133.0s)]
*  Well, it's going to be interesting. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6136.0s)]
*  I'm interested to see how it plays out. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6139.0s)]
*  I'm definitely curious to see what approach Francis takes, what approach Tyson Fury takes, how they handle it. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6143.0s)]
*  I'm interested. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6150.0s)]
*  I think the other thing that's going to be a factor is if Francis' chin is strong enough, that's going to be the thing. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6152.0s)]
*  Because he can box, period, but you got to be able to take it. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6160.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, Fury can crack you with punches you don't see coming to. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6165.0s)]
*  He's sneaky with uppercuts and hooks, and he's very clever. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6169.0s)]
*  He's so good with his feet. His footwork is so good, and he's so long. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6174.0s)]
*  And he doesn't have to hit you with the haymakers right off the bat. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6178.0s)]
*  You just start popping him with the jab, popping you, moving, sticking you. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6181.0s)]
*  It's going to be very interesting. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6186.0s)]
*  I'm curious to see what Mike Tyson is training Francis. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6188.0s)]
*  That's interesting, too. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6192.0s)]
*  I always love to see him. Shout out to Tyson. That's my brother, man. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6193.0s)]
*  I always love to see him work. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6196.0s)]
*  Even if you watch him, well, it's just him training. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6198.0s)]
*  He's still exciting just to watch him, man. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6201.0s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6204.0s)]
*  And his style of just charging forward and switching stances and ripping to the body and ripping to the head, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6206.0s)]
*  if he can get Francis involved in that style, it would be very interesting to see what Francis does. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6213.0s)]
*  If you watch him training together, it's pretty exciting. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6219.0s)]
*  Is he quick in that standpoint? Is he quick like how Tyson is? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6222.0s)]
*  It's hard to say. He's not as quick as Tyson. Tyson was a lot smaller. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6227.0s)]
*  We've got to realize when Tyson was in his prime, he was like 220. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6231.0s)]
*  But he was so fast. Just bobbing and weaving and moving in. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6234.0s)]
*  And hitting hard. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6239.0s)]
*  Oh my God. And fast. Hard and fast. It wasn't just hard. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6240.0s)]
*  It was hard, and you couldn't get away from it. You couldn't block it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6244.0s)]
*  He would just come flying in at people. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6247.0s)]
*  And Francis is not as fast as that, but he's a lot bigger. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6250.0s)]
*  Francis is a natural 265. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6254.0s)]
*  He used to have to lose weight to make the 265-pound heavyweight weight class. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6257.0s)]
*  So they got a cap on? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6262.0s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't that crazy? It's 265. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6264.0s)]
*  Anything over that? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6267.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a super heavyweight. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6268.0s)]
*  And super heavyweight division has never really been established. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6270.0s)]
*  Who do we got this super heavyweight? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6273.0s)]
*  Nobody. Nobody. We don't have a super heavyweight division in the UFC. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6275.0s)]
*  But it does exist. That's why there's a... [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6279.0s)]
*  So it can be done. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6281.0s)]
*  Yeah, it can be done. But that's why there's a 265-pound weight limit. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6282.0s)]
*  Which is kind of...seems kind of silly. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6286.0s)]
*  I'm curious to see what a super heavyweight will look like. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6289.0s)]
*  There's probably not that many of them. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6292.0s)]
*  Because there's a small amount of heavyweights. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6294.0s)]
*  If you think about the size of the UFC roster and the heavyweight division, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6296.0s)]
*  it's so much smaller than the middleweight or the welterweight or the lightweight. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6300.0s)]
*  Heavyweight's a very small division because there's not that many really skilled big men at the top of the heap. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6304.0s)]
*  It's hard, man. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6309.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of the elite athletes that are that big, they go into the NFL, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6311.0s)]
*  go into the NBA, go into somewhere else and make money. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6315.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6318.0s)]
*  You got to want to do that. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6319.0s)]
*  MMA can't be like, maybe I'll try that. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6322.0s)]
*  It's got to be like, if you're going to compete with those guys, it's got to be something you want to do. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6325.0s)]
*  And then you got to find a competition. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6330.0s)]
*  There's only two of y'all in that league at this point. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6332.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6335.0s)]
*  What do you think about Charlo and Canelo? That's exciting, isn't it? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6337.0s)]
*  Man, definitely. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6339.0s)]
*  Charlo from the town. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6341.0s)]
*  One thing about Houston, we always going to support Houston. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6343.0s)]
*  I think it's definitely...this is definitely going to be a big, big look for him, man. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6346.0s)]
*  Canelo definitely...he's still... [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6353.0s)]
*  If he's not still sitting in his prime, he's just on the outskirts of leaving it. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6359.0s)]
*  But he can't think that Charlo's on his heart. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6364.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6370.0s)]
*  Charlo is hard. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6371.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got to know that. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6372.0s)]
*  So it's definitely going to be interesting. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6373.0s)]
*  Just of course, we're going to root for our town regardless, man. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6375.0s)]
*  But definitely it's going to be a big fight. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6378.0s)]
*  It's such a wild move for Charlo to jump up two weight classes. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6383.0s)]
*  I didn't know he jumped up two weight classes. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6387.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6391.0s)]
*  Wasn't he junior middleweight? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6392.0s)]
*  And this is at 168, isn't that correct? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6394.0s)]
*  But that's only like how many pounds, maybe? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6397.0s)]
*  12. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6400.0s)]
*  Super middleweight? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6401.0s)]
*  Super middleweight. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6402.0s)]
*  That's what this fight is, right? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6404.0s)]
*  And what is he the champion at? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6405.0s)]
*  Isn't he the champion at junior middleweight? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6406.0s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6410.0s)]
*  But you got to remember, Canelo started out that light too, you know? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6414.0s)]
*  And went all the way up to win the light heavyweight. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6420.0s)]
*  Yeah, it says the Iron Man is stepping up two weight divisions to have his chance at adding the super middleweight crown to his undisputed super welterweight champion. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6422.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6429.0s)]
*  Super welterweight or junior middleweight, same thing. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6430.0s)]
*  Depending on which organizing body. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6433.0s)]
*  Yeah, the fight world has been exciting. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6436.0s)]
*  Definitely, man. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6439.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6442.0s)]
*  Do you follow all boxing? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6443.0s)]
*  For the most part. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6445.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, the crazy thing, man, I'd be so overwhelmed with life I barely get to watch TV. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6447.0s)]
*  But in the process, I'll be trying to catch a lot. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6455.0s)]
*  Who you finna bring up, or what you thinking? [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6458.0s)]
*  Terrence Crawford. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6461.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6462.0s)]
*  So Terrence the homie. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6463.0s)]
*  You know, Aero is like my brother too. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6465.0s)]
*  And me and Terrence, I just seen Terrence probably like two, three days ago. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6467.0s)]
*  And man, that was a fight. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6471.0s)]
*  Virtuoso. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6476.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6477.0s)]
*  Virtuoso performance. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6478.0s)]
*  The thing is you can't discredit Crawford at all. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6479.0s)]
*  I don't think people really gave him his credit. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6486.0s)]
*  But for me, like I told him, from just a homeboy standpoint as far as him and Earl, I just appreciate how he handled it. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6488.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6498.0s)]
*  That was solid the way he handled it. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6500.0s)]
*  And it's just, because he could have went about it a different way. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6503.0s)]
*  And then you gotta realize, man, the Internet and fans can make stuff way more cruel. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6508.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6514.0s)]
*  And then the fact that they got action to run it back. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6515.0s)]
*  I think in any situation everybody learned from what mistakes, everybody learned from what moves you made to start trying to sharpen it up for the next one. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6519.0s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see if Aero can make an adjustment. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6531.0s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6534.0s)]
*  But man, Terrence is good. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6535.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he definitely is. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6537.0s)]
*  And he has that magical ability to switch hands. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6538.0s)]
*  The switching of stances is something that is hilarious because when I had him on the podcast, he was telling me, his coach was telling him, stop fucking around. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6543.0s)]
*  Stop fucking around, switch his stances. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6551.0s)]
*  And he's like, oh man, I'm going to figure this out. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6553.0s)]
*  And he figured it out. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6555.0s)]
*  And now he's the best switch hitter since Marvin Hagler. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6556.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, he's amazing at it. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6559.0s)]
*  The way he's able to fucking just cut angles and throw just as hard from the left as he does from the right with equal proficiency. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6561.0s)]
*  And he knows where to be at all times. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6569.0s)]
*  He knows where you're going to be at all times. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6571.0s)]
*  Like, man, when you watch a guy that's that good at anything, but especially that good at something so dangerous as boxing, you really appreciate how hard it must be to get there. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6573.0s)]
*  Yeah, even looking at the wins, he got a nice amount of wins as far as, you know, as far as what is undefeated record man. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6584.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that one, the Aero Spence one was the big one. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6594.0s)]
*  That was the big one because that was the test. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6598.0s)]
*  He's as good as everybody thinks he is. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6600.0s)]
*  And he's even better. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6601.0s)]
*  He's even better. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6602.0s)]
*  In my book, he's an all time great. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6603.0s)]
*  Like, I would have loved to see him versus Sugar Ray Leonard. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6606.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6609.0s)]
*  Like, in their prime. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6610.0s)]
*  In their primes, yeah. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6611.0s)]
*  In their primes. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6612.0s)]
*  Which is one of the most amazing things about boxing is you get to think like that. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6613.0s)]
*  You know, compare guys like Roberto Duran in his prime. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6617.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6621.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was a monster too, man. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6624.0s)]
*  Man, but they even think back, all the heavyweights from back then was monsters. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6625.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6628.0s)]
*  That was probably, back then heavyweight probably was the ideal boxing size, you know? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6629.0s)]
*  But now, of course, you know, you got so many different divisions. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6639.0s)]
*  But you got to think of just all of them from back then, man. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6640.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6643.0s)]
*  I watch old heavyweight fights sometimes. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6644.0s)]
*  The other day I watched Ernie Shavers versus George Foreman. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6646.0s)]
*  You ever see that? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6649.0s)]
*  Mm-mm. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6650.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6651.0s)]
*  And they're big as hell. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6652.0s)]
*  They're so big and they're both two of the biggest punchers that have ever fought in [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6653.0s)]
*  the heavyweight division. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6658.0s)]
*  And those dudes just walloped on each other. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6659.0s)]
*  It was a crazy fight. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6662.0s)]
*  One thing I can say about the heavyweights from back then, they definitely, it definitely [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6664.0s)]
*  did some damage. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6668.0s)]
*  Let me see some of that, Jamie. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6669.0s)]
*  That's the one to see. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6671.0s)]
*  Yeah, like it definitely does some real permanent damage to it. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6672.0s)]
*  Like they was really, I was just, man, if you look at some of the hits that Tyson put [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6675.0s)]
*  on people, I don't, you can't even imagine how they made it through it. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6680.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're probably never the same again, some of those knockouts. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6684.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6687.0s)]
*  Some of them. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6688.0s)]
*  Like the Marvis Frazier one, that was a bad one. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6689.0s)]
*  Did you find Ernie Shavers and George Foreman? [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6692.0s)]
*  No, I'm only seeing videos that are video games. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6694.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6696.0s)]
*  It says they never fought. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6697.0s)]
*  What? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6698.0s)]
*  Who did George Foreman's last fight before he came back? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6699.0s)]
*  It wasn't, no, it wasn't Ernie Shavers. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6702.0s)]
*  Was it Ken? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6704.0s)]
*  Here's his last opponents. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6706.0s)]
*  You gotta go way back, way back to when he retired and came back. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6710.0s)]
*  So before Dwight Muhammad Kawee, because I know that was at heavyweight, so keep going down. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6715.0s)]
*  All right, so Wyn Joe Frazier, Scott LeDoux, keep going up. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6719.0s)]
*  Jimmy Young, loss to Jimmy Young, what year is that? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6724.0s)]
*  77, keep going. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6727.0s)]
*  So it's a 10-year gap right there. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6730.0s)]
*  All right, so who was the last one that he fought after he fought, oh, Ron Lyle. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6732.0s)]
*  That's what it was. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6738.0s)]
*  He fought Ron Lyle, that's what it was. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6739.0s)]
*  That was another guy that could fucking crack. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6741.0s)]
*  That was a crazy fight. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6743.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6745.0s)]
*  Have you been in tune? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6747.0s)]
*  I haven't really got the follow-up on him, but Ali's family tree. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6748.0s)]
*  How they been doing? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6752.0s)]
*  His family tree? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6754.0s)]
*  Yeah, as far as the nephews or the grandsons that's boxing. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6755.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6758.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing well. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6759.0s)]
*  I think he's undefeated, right? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6760.0s)]
*  Man, these are big fellas. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6763.0s)]
*  Georgia had such a unique style, too. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6766.0s)]
*  Oh! [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6770.0s)]
*  Oh! [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6771.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is it. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6773.0s)]
*  Shit. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6774.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6776.0s)]
*  This is a crazy fight, man. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6778.0s)]
*  Caesar's Palace outside Las Vegas. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6780.0s)]
*  Who won that fight? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6788.0s)]
*  I believe George won. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6789.0s)]
*  I think he knocked him out in, I think it was like the seventh. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6790.0s)]
*  But it was a war, man. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6794.0s)]
*  He got dropped, he got rocked. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6795.0s)]
*  Just stopped the fight. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6802.0s)]
*  Bro, they didn't stop fights for nothing back then. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6804.0s)]
*  No, I was like, I'm not fighting back at all. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6806.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6807.0s)]
*  And they're going to count. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6808.0s)]
*  That old man wasn't doing anything. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6810.0s)]
*  They're going to count, bro. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6811.0s)]
*  They're going to give him a count. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6812.0s)]
*  Look. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6814.0s)]
*  The referee just waddled over. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6815.0s)]
*  He's not... [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6822.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6823.0s)]
*  They would have let him get up. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6824.0s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6826.0s)]
*  He was out. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6827.0s)]
*  That's a crazy fight. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6831.0s)]
*  Them were some big dudes, though. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6832.0s)]
*  That was his first fight, I think, after he lost to Ali. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6834.0s)]
*  Ali was something special. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6839.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6840.0s)]
*  Ali was something special. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6841.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6842.0s)]
*  And not just special. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6843.0s)]
*  And big. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6845.0s)]
*  I didn't realize how big he was. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6846.0s)]
*  Yeah, not just special because of his abilities, but when the Vietnam War came out, he said, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6848.0s)]
*  I'm not going to fight Vietnam. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6853.0s)]
*  Yeah, he said that. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6854.0s)]
*  I said, I'm not going to fight Vietnam. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6855.0s)]
*  Yeah, he stood for something. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6856.0s)]
*  For what? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6857.0s)]
*  What am I doing? [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6858.0s)]
*  Why do you want me fighting these Viet Cong people? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6859.0s)]
*  I don't know them. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6862.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6863.0s)]
*  And everybody just... [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6864.0s)]
*  I mean, they stripped him of his title and his prime. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6865.0s)]
*  He was at the very peak of his abilities. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6868.0s)]
*  One of my favorite fights is right before they stripped him. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6871.0s)]
*  It was he fought Cleveland Big Cat Williams. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6874.0s)]
*  And Cleveland was like this big muscular power puncher. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6877.0s)]
*  And Ali just boxed this beautiful dance and just pieced him up. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6882.0s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6887.0s)]
*  It's one of my all-time favorite boxing performances because it's where you get to see Ali... [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6889.0s)]
*  Before they stripped him of his title and then he came back. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6895.0s)]
*  He was kind of a different fighter when he came back. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6897.0s)]
*  But before they stripped him, he would box like a middleweight. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6899.0s)]
*  But he was a heavyweight, a big tall dude. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6903.0s)]
*  His weave game was amazing. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6906.0s)]
*  Against who, sorry? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6908.0s)]
*  Cleveland Big Cat Williams. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6909.0s)]
*  So they robbed us of the real Ali because during those three years where they stripped him of his title and he couldn't box, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6912.0s)]
*  that was the years where he was still at its best. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6918.0s)]
*  And he really didn't train during those years. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6920.0s)]
*  So when he came back, he just wasn't the same guy. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6922.0s)]
*  He didn't move like he moved when he was younger. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6925.0s)]
*  And this is like him in his fucking prime. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6930.0s)]
*  Just scooch ahead a little, see some of this action. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6933.0s)]
*  And Cleveland's a jacked dude. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6938.0s)]
*  I mean, look at the muscles on Cleveland. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6940.0s)]
*  And he's moving forward and Ali's just boxing him up. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6942.0s)]
*  I mean, what fucking heavyweight moved like this before him? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6946.0s)]
*  Like, look at his footwork. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6949.0s)]
*  I mean, imagine fighting a guy like that. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6953.0s)]
*  They didn't exist before him. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6955.0s)]
*  In the heavyweight division? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6957.0s)]
*  I mean, look at him move. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6958.0s)]
*  Still to this day, if you saw this guy and he was on HBO today, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6961.0s)]
*  you'd be like, whoa, who is this new dude? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6966.0s)]
*  Like, oh my God, what kind of movement? [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6969.0s)]
*  And you got to think, you know, we're talking about the 1960s. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6972.0s)]
*  I think this was 67. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6975.0s)]
*  And there had been nothing like that before. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6979.0s)]
*  What year was it, Jamie, does it say? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6981.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6984.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's 67. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6985.0s)]
*  Now, go a little further ahead so when he starts getting them. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6987.0s)]
*  I mean, Cleveland just has to try to chase him down. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6994.0s)]
*  And every time Ali would just stop and pop the jab, look at that one, two, [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=6997.0s)]
*  one, two moving away. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7001.0s)]
*  I mean, moving away. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7003.0s)]
*  I mean, the fucking hand speed, the combinations, the volume. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7018.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7024.0s)]
*  He just stands over him with his hands raised. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7025.0s)]
*  Amazing fight. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7031.0s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7043.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7046.0s)]
*  They picked them up and put him back on the stool like you're going to get back out there, kid. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7055.0s)]
*  You got to kill him. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7060.0s)]
*  So he came back off the stool and box some more. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7062.0s)]
*  They could have easily stopped that fight, right? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7066.0s)]
*  They just didn't stop fights the same way back then. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7069.0s)]
*  Today, they would look at this and go, that's enough. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7071.0s)]
*  That's enough. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7073.0s)]
*  But back then, they're like, one, two, three, and they like go to the corner and he starts back again. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7074.0s)]
*  Four, five. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7081.0s)]
*  I mean, this poor dude needs to be saved. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7085.0s)]
*  He's still getting up front. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7087.0s)]
*  They probably didn't have rules about recovery time. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7089.0s)]
*  Oh, there were no rules, bro. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7091.0s)]
*  You fight next weekend. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7092.0s)]
*  They didn't care about people. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7094.0s)]
*  They just, you know, they wanted you to fight so they could make money. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7096.0s)]
*  Look at that right hand. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7100.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7102.0s)]
*  I mean, just playing with him. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7103.0s)]
*  Look at that jab. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7106.0s)]
*  I mean, he was just a complete, unique fighter. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7108.0s)]
*  He moved like Sugar Ray Robinson, but he was a heavyweight. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7111.0s)]
*  The referee finally saves him. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7114.0s)]
*  Finally. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7116.0s)]
*  He could have stopped that fight a long, long fucking time ago. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7117.0s)]
*  They were different back then, the way they stopped fights. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7122.0s)]
*  I think in any sports, they were a lot more rougher back then. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7126.0s)]
*  Yeah, football certainly was. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7129.0s)]
*  Yeah, basketball, everything. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7131.0s)]
*  Everything was. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7134.0s)]
*  Different times, man. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7135.0s)]
*  Very different. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7137.0s)]
*  It's probably better today. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7138.0s)]
*  It's probably better today. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7140.0s)]
*  People are looking out for you more. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7141.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely different times, man. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7143.0s)]
*  Especially when it comes to fighters. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7146.0s)]
*  You know, someone's got to look out for them. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7148.0s)]
*  They don't want to stop. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7150.0s)]
*  And sometimes you've got to save them from themselves. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7152.0s)]
*  This video went around, or this guy had to play an NBA with a broken neck. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7154.0s)]
*  What? [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7158.0s)]
*  He said if you could walk, you can play. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7159.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7161.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7162.0s)]
*  1980. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7163.0s)]
*  That's the year I was born. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7164.0s)]
*  He played multiple NBA games in a neck brace after he broke his neck. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7165.0s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure how it happened. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7169.0s)]
*  I don't know if it was in game, but there's a few stuff in the 80s like this. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7171.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7175.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7176.0s)]
*  I know for a fact they were a lot rougher back then. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7177.0s)]
*  Humans were tougher. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7180.0s)]
*  They dealt with more adversity. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7181.0s)]
*  It's like the world wasn't as easy. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7183.0s)]
*  It's crazy because it was just different, right? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7185.0s)]
*  Because back then, when you have people 30 and 40, that was really old. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7188.0s)]
*  Really old. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7195.0s)]
*  30 and 40, now it's like, shit, I'm 43, you know what I'm saying? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7196.0s)]
*  So it's just normal now. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7201.0s)]
*  That shit was, everything was just different back then. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7202.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm 56. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7204.0s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7206.0s)]
*  56 year old guys were like halfway dead. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7207.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7209.0s)]
*  It's like nobody knew how to work out. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7210.0s)]
*  Nobody knew how to eat right. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7212.0s)]
*  There's no vitamins. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7213.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7217.0s)]
*  Shit was different, man. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7220.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's better now in that sense. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7221.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7224.0s)]
*  Definitely better now. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7225.0s)]
*  Yeah, but so my son, I trained him with boxing. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7227.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he's going to go to doing the MMA stuff just to learn. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7233.0s)]
*  But I'm big on being able to protect yourself, handle your business. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7239.0s)]
*  That's good. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7245.0s)]
*  He loved football and that. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7246.0s)]
*  So I'm just letting him do his thing. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7247.0s)]
*  And then so crazy, speaking of football and all, man, you can make more in college than you can in the MMA. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7251.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7256.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7257.0s)]
*  But isn't that a good thing though? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7258.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they tried to stop it for so long, man. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7259.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7262.0s)]
*  You are making money and the athletes aren't. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7263.0s)]
*  And how many athletes, because it's so hard to do, how many athletes blow their knees out in college and never make it? [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7266.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, they made millions of dollars for the city or for the university rather. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7273.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7277.0s)]
*  They should get some money. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7278.0s)]
*  How much are those guys making? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7279.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7281.0s)]
*  They're making a lot. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7282.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7283.0s)]
*  They're making a lot because I think being just good and notarized, well, you can make people be saying millions. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7284.0s)]
*  You know, it could be one, two, that's a lot for a college student as opposed to if you're getting all these different deals. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7294.0s)]
*  Now, if you go to thinking about maybe LSU, they're probably getting, Reese is probably getting crazy money at this point. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7302.0s)]
*  Do you know, Jamie? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7309.0s)]
*  How much like top college athletes get paid? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7311.0s)]
*  I think LeBron's son right now, Bronny James is arguable to be the top deal. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7314.0s)]
*  He's got a couple of million dollar deal. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7320.0s)]
*  Some of them, I don't know how much they don't have to be fully disclosed either, which is kind of strange. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7323.0s)]
*  That is kind of strange. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7328.0s)]
*  It's a imagine if you graduated four years ago and you're like, fuck, I could be rich as shit. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7330.0s)]
*  In a way, they really kind of owe those people. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7338.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7341.0s)]
*  But you know, they do, they deserve it because you got to realize you got a lot of people who support college games and that. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7342.0s)]
*  So you have some of them stars that deserve to get it. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7350.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, those college alumni people go ham. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7353.0s)]
*  They donate a lot. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7356.0s)]
*  They go crazy with that stuff. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7358.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7360.0s)]
*  Definitely, man. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7362.0s)]
*  I mean, they make fucking billions of dollars, right? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7364.0s)]
*  Shout out to them, man. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7367.0s)]
*  A lot of talent, man. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7369.0s)]
*  A lot of talent. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7371.0s)]
*  What changed that they had to pay the athletes now? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7373.0s)]
*  There's a big push. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7376.0s)]
*  So Ed O'Bannon, who was a basketball player from UCLA in the 90s, they put a lawsuit through to get like a. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7378.0s)]
*  The big deal for them was the NCAA basketball and football games because it was when you played them is from EA Sports. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7387.0s)]
*  There's a lot like Madden, but they couldn't put their names in it. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7393.0s)]
*  And then it became an easy way. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7396.0s)]
*  You could download the rosters and put the names on them. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7397.0s)]
*  It was already you could tell who the player was. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7401.0s)]
*  They just didn't have their name on it. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7403.0s)]
*  So they gave them their full stats and full abilities and all that. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7404.0s)]
*  And a lot of people, it was a very popular game, were buying it for those reasons. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7407.0s)]
*  They got that pushed through like through courts. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7412.0s)]
*  And then once that happened, I think the you know, it's Wild West. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7415.0s)]
*  Isn't that dirty that they did that? [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7418.0s)]
*  That's not everybody, man. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7421.0s)]
*  Everybody do whatever they can to keep the money as much as they can. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7423.0s)]
*  I know in every business. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7427.0s)]
*  Just dirty, just dirty. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7429.0s)]
*  You know, some people, they don't really think it's bad business to do that. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7432.0s)]
*  They think that's, you know, they think that's the way to be for me. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7436.0s)]
*  I just never been. I ain't the selfish type man. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7439.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna get mine regardless. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7441.0s)]
*  That's good for you. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7444.0s)]
*  That's a good perspective. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7445.0s)]
*  Like I said, you're very balanced. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7448.0s)]
*  You know, it's like. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7449.0s)]
*  Something I forgot to tell you too. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7450.0s)]
*  You know, I got my cartoon. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7451.0s)]
*  I haven't, we haven't took it to a network, but. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7453.0s)]
*  So I had my cartoon that was out. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7456.0s)]
*  Carla Vences of Trey. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7459.0s)]
*  And I ended up doing a, well now you know everybody on strike, but. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7465.0s)]
*  I partnered with the very, very. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7466.0s)]
*  I don't even know what I'm supposed to say. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7472.0s)]
*  I just say a very, very big movie slash comedian for the new cartoon. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7474.0s)]
*  But everything kind of is on hold just to figure out where I'm gonna go. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7479.0s)]
*  I always thought I would have ended up on adult swim, but they didn't, they didn't come get me. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7483.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7487.0s)]
*  So is everything is still frozen? [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7488.0s)]
*  Are they, when they gonna work that out? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7490.0s)]
*  Are they close to figuring that out? That strike thing? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7492.0s)]
*  Because I think Bill Maher was about to redo his show without the writers. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7496.0s)]
*  Because he just wanted to employ everybody else. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7500.0s)]
*  And then he said something on Twitter that it seems that they're going to restart it. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7502.0s)]
*  Resume negotiations and I guess that they had decided for a long time they were not gonna be resuming. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7509.0s)]
*  So that's why people were starting to make other plans. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7514.0s)]
*  Damn. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7517.0s)]
*  They're waiting people out. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7518.0s)]
*  Because you got the writers and the actors on strike. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7520.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna hurt the production. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7523.0s)]
*  The actors have not talked about resume negotiations. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7526.0s)]
*  There's just no writers I guess. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7529.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7531.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7532.0s)]
*  How long has it been? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7534.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7536.0s)]
*  I figured this would say right here. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7538.0s)]
*  This doesn't say. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7542.0s)]
*  I'll check. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7544.0s)]
*  Has to be like a few months, right? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7545.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7547.0s)]
*  I would have met. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7550.0s)]
*  May 2nd started. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7551.0s)]
*  Second month? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7553.0s)]
*  No, May 2nd. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7554.0s)]
*  May 2nd, what? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7555.0s)]
*  5 months? 4 months? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7557.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7559.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7560.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they're gonna have to find a way to figure it out. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7561.0s)]
*  I wouldn't even say from an actor standpoint. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7565.0s)]
*  Realistically, they're gonna have to pay him. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7567.0s)]
*  They need him. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7569.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7571.0s)]
*  Well, the actors and then also all the people that are involved in production that can't work either. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7572.0s)]
*  Because if you're a grip or you're a lighting guy or whatever you're doing. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7578.0s)]
*  And that's all you do. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7582.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, those people can work. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7583.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7585.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they're gonna have to make it. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7586.0s)]
*  I don't see it dragging too. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7588.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7590.0s)]
*  I mean, it can maybe drag to the end of the year. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7591.0s)]
*  But at some point, they're gonna have to give in to give them what they want. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7593.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck is happening. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7597.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7599.0s)]
*  But they've talked about doing that with the UFC. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7600.0s)]
*  Like a fighter's union. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7602.0s)]
*  But I don't think that would work. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7604.0s)]
*  Fighters are too individual. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7607.0s)]
*  Like if someone offered someone a fight, like a big fight. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7609.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7614.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7615.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7616.0s)]
*  What would the union be to do it? [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7617.0s)]
*  The union would be to negotiate minimum contracts. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7619.0s)]
*  Maybe tweak health care. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7624.0s)]
*  Maybe put together some sort of retirement plan. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7627.0s)]
*  401K plan for fighters. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7631.0s)]
*  All those are good ideas. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7633.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7634.0s)]
*  You know, just to be able to take care of family afterwards. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7635.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7638.0s)]
*  That definitely is important. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7639.0s)]
*  But there's never been like a fighter's union that worked. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7640.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's because it can't work. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7643.0s)]
*  I've never heard of one working. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7645.0s)]
*  Like the boxers, did they have a boxing union? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7647.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7650.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7651.0s)]
*  It seems like it only works in some industries. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7653.0s)]
*  But man, these fucking strikes. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7655.0s)]
*  If you're in that business, like that's hard. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7657.0s)]
*  Especially coming right off the pandemic where everybody didn't work for a long time already. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7659.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7663.0s)]
*  See, man, even though I'm glad, well I ain't gonna say I'm glad I'm not in the work. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7664.0s)]
*  Because I'm planning on trying to get in the acting world at some point. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7668.0s)]
*  But even just everything with the pandemic, like I just had to figure different ways, man. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7671.0s)]
*  Like our company Bump Box, it ended up soaring through the pandemic. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7677.0s)]
*  Because now you have everybody at home. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7684.0s)]
*  Everybody want to jam music. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7686.0s)]
*  Everybody want to do different type stuff. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7688.0s)]
*  So different stuff like that was dope. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7690.0s)]
*  I just, I've always been a hustler. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7693.0s)]
*  Now, you know, I got food trucks now. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7697.0s)]
*  I got 18 Willa. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7699.0s)]
*  Man, I do a little bit of everything. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7701.0s)]
*  So it was a crazy story. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7704.0s)]
*  You know, Popeyes had a run where they had a chicken sandwich, right? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7707.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7710.0s)]
*  You remember, everybody was going crazy over it. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7711.0s)]
*  So my personal chef, I used to always just have him make random stuff. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7713.0s)]
*  And one day I'm like, man, I'm not waiting in that line. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7717.0s)]
*  I want to make my own chicken sandwich. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7719.0s)]
*  And we did it. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7722.0s)]
*  And the way that he made it, it was, I don't know, it was just different, man. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7723.0s)]
*  And it got to the point everybody just started calling it the truth chicken sandwich. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7727.0s)]
*  So now it's just like, man, we're just going to do the truth truck. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7731.0s)]
*  It'll be chicken sandwich. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7734.0s)]
*  It'll be chicken suya tacos. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7736.0s)]
*  He got this, the Spanish corn he do. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7740.0s)]
*  It's like no other, man. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7743.0s)]
*  It's just a bunch of different stuff. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7745.0s)]
*  So where can people get this? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7746.0s)]
*  So right now we've been going for to figure out, like I'm one of them people, man. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7748.0s)]
*  I'm cool with adapting the stuff, but I like to push it to the limit. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7755.0s)]
*  So lately we've just been going back and forth, figuring out what we want to make a permanent location. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7760.0s)]
*  But knowing me, I'm going to try and find a lot and create my own food park at that point. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7766.0s)]
*  Nice. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7771.0s)]
*  So right now there's no permanent spot, but that's what I'm looking for. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7772.0s)]
*  One day. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-sACrk9V2A&t=7776.0s)]
