# Joe Rogan Experience #2091 - Diana Walsh Pasulka
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY)
*  It's a scary podcast for me because I feel like you're because I know a lot of the things [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=0.0s)]
*  that you've said and I've related to them and I've said okay this makes sense. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=17.6s)]
*  Why is that scary? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=21.6s)]
*  Okay so it's scary because it's not consensus reality and you know because it's not consensus [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=24.2s)]
*  reality we could talk about it over hot chocolate in the fire you know near a fire or something [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=30.88s)]
*  but here we're talking about it and lots of people are going to be listening. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=37.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=40.84s)]
*  So that is somewhat scary. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=41.84s)]
*  That's the hurdle that we all have to get over and the good thing about this is it really [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  is just us talking. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=50.56s)]
*  And there are a lot of people that are going to listen but they're just people too. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=51.92s)]
*  That's true and they've probably had these experiences. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  Some of them have. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=58.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  The experiences are that are available through psychedelics that I've always wondered I mean [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  the thing that it's always struck me about the UFO experience particularly the abduction [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  experience is that it always happens when people are asleep. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=73.12s)]
*  It always happens at night. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=77.6s)]
*  It either happens on the road when people are tired and it's late at night or it happens [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=79.36s)]
*  like why does it have to happen at night. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=83.48s)]
*  The universe doesn't give a shit what where the sun is in position to the planet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=85.5s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense that all these UFO abduction experiences would happen only [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=92.4s)]
*  when the sun is on the other side. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=97.44s)]
*  That's so dumb. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=100.0s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=101.0s)]
*  It's literally it's such an egocentric earth centric perspective that and not even earth [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=102.94s)]
*  centric hemispherical centric. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=109.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=113.38s)]
*  It depends on where the sun is in position to the earth for that to be the only time [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=114.38s)]
*  that UFOs come. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=119.86s)]
*  I was always like this seems like horseshit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  There's something about it seems like horseshit but there's also something about it that seems [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=124.38s)]
*  real when you listen like Betty and Barney Hill when they're they're talking. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=127.86s)]
*  Boy that sounds like people talking about a real thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=133.06s)]
*  Boy that sounds like a real experience. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=136.18s)]
*  It really does. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=138.38s)]
*  And these people like the Whitley Stribers these people that talk about these experiences [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=140.42s)]
*  that happen at night. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=143.98s)]
*  We know for a fact that when you are sleeping your brain is producing endogenous psychedelic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=146.56s)]
*  chemicals. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=153.34s)]
*  We have no idea why. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=154.9s)]
*  We have no idea what the purpose of those things are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=156.38s)]
*  We have no idea what the quantity is. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=159.22s)]
*  We used to think until recently they weren't even exactly sure like where it was being [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=161.78s)]
*  produced. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=167.02s)]
*  But now through Strausman's work and through the work of the Cottonwood Research Foundation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=168.02s)]
*  the the the people that do those DMT studies they know that now your brain is producing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=173.02s)]
*  this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=177.66s)]
*  And so is your brain is it a is it producing a chemical gateway into another dimension. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=179.02s)]
*  And is that why these people are experiencing these abduction you know air quote abduction [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=187.22s)]
*  experiences. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=192.58s)]
*  These these encounters which let's say encounters. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=193.58s)]
*  Is that why they're happening at night. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=196.54s)]
*  Is that where they're happening whether lying in bed because that seems to make way more [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=198.14s)]
*  sense. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=201.66s)]
*  Yeah that's a great question. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=202.66s)]
*  I can talk a little bit about this please. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=204.42s)]
*  OK so I think that I think we're starting weird. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=206.74s)]
*  Can we just start with how did you get involved in this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=210.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=214.38s)]
*  And please just tell people your background. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=215.38s)]
*  OK sure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  So I'm a professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina Wilmington [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  and I grew up in California and I've always I've always been interested in these experiences [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=221.73999999999998s)]
*  but religion. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  And also I grew up I was going to graduate school during the dot com boom. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  So I saw how technology was changing everything. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=233.62s)]
*  Our schools were the first to adopt computers and that type of thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  So what I did was I was very interested in. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=240.14s)]
*  I was working. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=244.17999999999998s)]
*  Your parents you tell them you want to study religion and they're like why not be a doctor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=245.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=249.34s)]
*  So I was going to college but I kept taking courses in religion and philosophy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=250.34s)]
*  And when I got out I got a job doing technology and things like that and I made all right [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=255.74s)]
*  money but I still read about religion and philosophy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=260.14s)]
*  So I figured if I could get scholarships to continue that I would. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=263.1s)]
*  And I kept getting scholarships and that's how I got my PhD in religion in religious [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=267.38s)]
*  studies by the way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=272.9s)]
*  So actually we're not ministers or anything like that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=273.94s)]
*  We don't advocate for any religious tradition. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=275.82s)]
*  We study them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=277.82s)]
*  And since most people in the world are religious in some way it's a good thing to know. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=278.94s)]
*  But how did I get into studying UFOs. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=284.29999999999995s)]
*  So I studied Christian history and that's what I did for a long time until I was what's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=286.17999999999995s)]
*  called a full professor. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=291.06s)]
*  You can't go any higher. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  You're a full professor. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=293.94s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=294.94s)]
*  And I started I studied these things called ascent narratives. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=295.94s)]
*  So ascent narratives are when people levitate in the Christian tradition people either levitate [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  or they have they see things that they call angels or demons and things like this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  And I always studied them from a historical perspective. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  And I found that going through looking at these ascent narratives through the historical [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  record at the Vatican actually I kept coming across aerial phenomena in the historical [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  records from a thousand years ago from 500 years ago from very recently. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=324.38s)]
*  I recognize that this was happening in UFO literature. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=330.14s)]
*  And so I started to look at abductions and UFO sightings and things like that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  And I wanted to do a cross cultural analysis of this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  And that was in 2012. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=343.94s)]
*  And that's how I got into this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  I just want to point out that not all abductions happen in your sleep. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=347.86s)]
*  A lot of abductions actually happen in daylight. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=352.18s)]
*  But I do agree with you that something's happening in your brain and you're perceiving something [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=355.78s)]
*  and you called it is there some type of mental gateway. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=361.97999999999996s)]
*  And I think there's absolutely a mental gateway. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  Does this discount that this is objective of us? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=369.34s)]
*  Like you know the question is is this something subjective or is this something objective [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  of us? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  My opinion at this point is it's something that is objective of us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=378.34s)]
*  There's something that we're accessing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=383.98s)]
*  And I don't think it's within our space time reality to tell you the truth. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=386.3s)]
*  So you think it's from somewhere else? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=392.42s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=394.38s)]
*  But that doesn't I mean it doesn't have to be a location you know geography. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=395.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  That's where it gets weird. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=401.94s)]
*  It gets totally weird but so does quantum physics. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=402.94s)]
*  Quantum physics is totally weird. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  It's the weirdest stuff ever. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=406.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=407.86s)]
*  And it's completely accepted that you could have something that exists in one place and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=408.86s)]
*  also in another place. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=413.94s)]
*  Now it is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=414.94s)]
*  Now it's completely accepted. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=415.94s)]
*  And also still. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=416.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=417.94s)]
*  The Nobel Prize in what was it? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=418.94s)]
*  2022 was about that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=420.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=422.3s)]
*  Which is like what are you saying? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=423.3s)]
*  You're saying witchcraft's real? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=424.3s)]
*  Like what are you saying? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=425.3s)]
*  Magic is real? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=426.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=427.3s)]
*  I think so. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=428.3s)]
*  Quantum physics is the nuttiest stuff of all time. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=429.3s)]
*  I've had a hundred people explain it to me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=431.14s)]
*  I don't get it still. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=433.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=434.14s)]
*  Okay so you were talking about accessing this space and if I can go back to something you [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  were talking about about and I'm going to say this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  So what I found was and I had this experience too when I was around 13 years old. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  I felt like the world was going to end. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=448.9s)]
*  I felt like there was going to be some kind of war and it was a visceral feeling. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=451.58s)]
*  It wasn't something that it was something that made me depressed as a child. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=455.97999999999996s)]
*  And it was real. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=460.5s)]
*  I believed it was going to happen. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=463.14s)]
*  And I believed it was going to happen at any time. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=464.66s)]
*  Well this after studying religion and studying by the way this kind of prompted me into studying [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=467.74s)]
*  religion and recognizing that you know if you look at say Christianity or even other [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=472.66s)]
*  religions people had ideas that the world was going to end and extinction events have [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=477.98s)]
*  happened and things like that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=483.62s)]
*  So it could very well be that information like this is coming to us but it's out of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=485.74s)]
*  our space time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=490.82000000000005s)]
*  To us it seems like it's going to happen now because our sense is of linear time right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=492.26s)]
*  So if we get a feeling and it's not from any of the input that we're getting like our [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=498.09999999999997s)]
*  you know people telling us this is actually going to happen the news telling us this is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=504.46s)]
*  actually going to happen but it's coming to us is this feeling that you and I were just [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=507.41999999999996s)]
*  talking about. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=511.9s)]
*  It could be coming from that space that we've just identified as you know people are talking [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=513.9s)]
*  about. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=518.42s)]
*  And yeah I think that we're at the very beginning of doing a taxonomy or you know looking at [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=520.5s)]
*  this space in terms of the scientists that you just referenced and people that I think [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=527.62s)]
*  that actually people have you know indigenous cultures talk about this space. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=533.1s)]
*  They have language about this space. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  I talked about this in encounters that you know religious traditions do talk about these [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  spaces but in secular culture we've lost that language. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=544.5s)]
*  Well it is interesting that that language exists when you're discussing things like [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=549.3s)]
*  quantum physics because that is a language of like you know it's a bizarre non tangible [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=553.78s)]
*  impossible to understand to the lay person when you're explaining that these things are [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=565.3s)]
*  all interacting with each other without physical contact. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=571.58s)]
*  Like what do you like what do you mean. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=575.8199999999999s)]
*  What are you saying. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=577.7s)]
*  Like can you show me these things. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=578.78s)]
*  There are photos of them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=580.3s)]
*  No we're just drawing you were writing it down on paper. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  We're pretty sure we have these equations and we know what it is like. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=583.86s)]
*  What. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=586.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=587.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=588.46s)]
*  Why am I supposed to believe you because you guys are PhDs like what this is nuts. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  But because this is like a field of science this is a field of study that's universally [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  accepted. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=601.42s)]
*  We have we've like given them a pass to talk about crazy stuff. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=603.02s)]
*  But if you want to talk about crazy things in terms of encountering some sort of thing [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=607.98s)]
*  some entity some consciousness that exists in an alternative realm that has access to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  this realm occasionally or perhaps that you can transcend your normal state of consciousness [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=624.06s)]
*  and access this other realm occasionally through some methods whether it's through meditation [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=633.7399999999999s)]
*  through psychedelic trips through something near death experiences something happens that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  perturbs the normal state of reality and you have brief access to this transcendent [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=647.18s)]
*  experience that everyone has talked about all of the great prophets all of the great [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  saints and religious figures have talked about from the beginning of written history. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=660.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=667.78s)]
*  So I think that it's not just that we give those physics guys a pass and girls. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  OK. We just don't what they produce actually is creates our world right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=675.78s)]
*  The computers we look at and the technologies we use even the structures we live in. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=682.46s)]
*  And so this is what prompted me to go back into our historical record like and look at [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  like the writings of Plato again and some of you know some of these people that you're [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=695.62s)]
*  talking about like the great minds right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=699.5s)]
*  And I recognize that say Plato who writes about his mentor Socrates who's by the way [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=702.38s)]
*  killed by his country you know is killed by Athens the town he lives in not the town but [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=709.5400000000001s)]
*  the state he lives in and he's he's he's executed for being an atheist by the way. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=715.4200000000001s)]
*  And if you look at what he's talking about he's actually talking about this space. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  He's actually talking about having a vision of something that we can't see and he calls [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=727.0999999999999s)]
*  it the good and he says it's it's the best thing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=732.9799999999999s)]
*  OK. And he says it makes you do things that are just and you don't do them because they're [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=736.0999999999999s)]
*  the right thing to do you do them because you really want to do them. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  And so to me this is I thought this was fascinating. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=744.9799999999999s)]
*  So I went back and I recognized that he was what's called a math realist. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=747.26s)]
*  So he believed that and he was one of the first people well not just him but people you [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=752.2199999999999s)]
*  know were talking about the you know three hundreds before the common era. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=758.5s)]
*  So many many many years ago he's already identifying these things called platonic solids [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=761.9399999999999s)]
*  that now we can prove exist but we weren't able to prove them. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=768.9s)]
*  So he was using and he even has this language to Joe. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=773.9s)]
*  He has this language. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=777.9799999999999s)]
*  He says that we can actually we can actually perceive these through our minds but it's [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=779.06s)]
*  not normal intellect. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=786.34s)]
*  It's not your normal abstract thinking but it's a type of thinking and he relates it to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=787.9s)]
*  protocols like physical protocols like did you know he was a wrestler. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=794.34s)]
*  No I didn't. Yeah. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=798.46s)]
*  Oh I did know that. Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  In fact his name even means that he's really not just a wrestler but an awesome wrestler. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=801.34s)]
*  So Socrates that name. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=806.86s)]
*  No no Plato. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=808.7s)]
*  Oh sorry. Yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=809.82s)]
*  These guys were all physical. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  They were all they it was basically this like philosophy almost like a fight club I think. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=813.14s)]
*  These guys you know they were like they were wrestlers and you know they believe that this [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=818.5s)]
*  was good. They believe that these protocols help help them use their brains to access [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=823.5s)]
*  this the good. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=829.14s)]
*  So what was the methodology behind that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=830.7s)]
*  Was it the breaking down of the normal states of consciousness through rigorous exercise [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=833.9s)]
*  and exertion. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=840.5s)]
*  That's my opinion like a runner's high. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=841.62s)]
*  Yeah that's my opinion. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=845.74s)]
*  Yeah. So I when I talk about it because I like to teach my students about this because [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=846.02s)]
*  honestly think that this is what progresses civilization this kind of thing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=849.58s)]
*  This kind of thing. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=854.74s)]
*  So I think when I did American Cosmic which is the first book about UFOs again which I [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  never thought I'd be studying I encountered this man Tyler and and he's he works for the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=862.5799999999999s)]
*  Space Force and he's been working for the Space Force since the whole space shuttle [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=870.14s)]
*  program. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=874.3s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=875.0999999999999s)]
*  And he's a special kind of person. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=876.02s)]
*  He's a mission controller but he does a lot of other things too. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=878.2199999999999s)]
*  But he's also a multimillionaire space rocket scientist. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=881.1400000000001s)]
*  I mean just so strange. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=885.46s)]
*  And and I called him Tyler after the character in Fight Club because that's who reminded [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=888.1s)]
*  me of he reminded me of that character in Fight Club because he had this. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=893.26s)]
*  First of all he is more than 44 patents and they're all related to space and and the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=897.86s)]
*  Space Force has a special place for him like he's special. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=904.5400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=908.4200000000001s)]
*  What I found was that he was practicing these types of protocols. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=909.5s)]
*  I called them protocols because they reminded me of Plato and monastic traditions the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=912.66s)]
*  traditions of monks and things. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=916.94s)]
*  So he would make sure that he got sunshine. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=918.74s)]
*  He would make sure that he got plenty of sleep. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=922.42s)]
*  He would not have too much caffeine. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=925.46s)]
*  He exercised a lot. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=928.1800000000001s)]
*  He boxed. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=930.22s)]
*  Right. So he was also a fighter and he tried to stay away from people. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=931.3s)]
*  I know it sounds weird but that's what monks do. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=934.86s)]
*  They try to stay. You know they try to like monitor their input of people because those [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=936.6999999999999s)]
*  people can actually take them off their game or something like that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=941.5799999999999s)]
*  But so this guy was put into a another mental state. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=945.18s)]
*  And during this mental state he said that he could receive calculations he could [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=949.2199999999999s)]
*  receive information he could receive things and then he could gather a group of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=954.38s)]
*  scientists and he wouldn't tell them where he came from because he honestly thought [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=959.98s)]
*  they were coming from these things outside of space time kind of like E.T.s or [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=963.7s)]
*  something off planet intelligences. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=969.1800000000001s)]
*  Which Tesla also believed. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=971.22s)]
*  And are the people who started our own space force believed it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=972.94s)]
*  So this isn't common knowledge. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=976.6600000000001s)]
*  That's what I found is like a lot of people aren't they don't know this history of the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=978.22s)]
*  American Space Force and the Russian Space Force very much the same. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=982.22s)]
*  These people were doing these things and this allowed them. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=986.26s)]
*  You see this in sports. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=989.7s)]
*  Right. So people. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=991.46s)]
*  I was just using this example in a class yesterday. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=992.74s)]
*  I saw this basketball game two or three years ago with Steph Curry. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=995.34s)]
*  And you know the way they were playing it was almost as if there was an emergent [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=998.7800000000001s)]
*  phenomenon that was bigger than each of the people because they somehow anticipated [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  what the other guy was going to do. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1008.7800000000001s)]
*  And I used to do sports and I know that this is something that can be done. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1010.86s)]
*  There's a flow state. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1015.1800000000001s)]
*  Right. And I think that this is what Plato was trying to get his his group into [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1016.5s)]
*  through these protocols. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1021.94s)]
*  Well that makes sense. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1023.74s)]
*  It's one of the things that happens in flow state is that you stop being there. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1024.98s)]
*  That's right. Yeah it's not you. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1030.18s)]
*  Yeah. And you're just experiencing this. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1032.14s)]
*  Totally. Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1034.54s)]
*  Yeah. You experience it on stage doing stand up. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1035.78s)]
*  I imagine you do it right. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1041.06s)]
*  Yeah. You get it right. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1042.54s)]
*  You're on a ride like you're just like sort of like making sure that OK feed this into [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1043.78s)]
*  the machine and go and it goes and you're sort of like you're in tune with what [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1049.7s)]
*  you're saying but you're almost outside of yourself. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1055.5s)]
*  That's exactly right. And you know there is science that shows that this is the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1059.3000000000002s)]
*  case. Right. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1062.46s)]
*  With brain waves. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1064.66s)]
*  Yeah. The problem is is that they're like when Joe's out there on stage they're not [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1066.0600000000002s)]
*  going to hook you up to an MRI right. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1071.5800000000002s)]
*  They can't do that kind of because when it's happening it's happening [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1074.14s)]
*  spontaneously it just happens and no one can actually predict when it's going to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1078.3400000000001s)]
*  happen. But you hope that it happens. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1081.7s)]
*  And also if they did hook you up to it you would also be aware that you're being [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1083.38s)]
*  monitored and would change. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1086.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like when you're in a lucid dream and you go oh my God I'm in a [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1088.66s)]
*  lucid dream and then wake up. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1092.5s)]
*  Yeah. Damn it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1094.14s)]
*  I've had that happen so many times. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1095.6200000000001s)]
*  Like wow. I know there's a way to facilitate lucid dreams. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1097.82s)]
*  I know there's a study behind it but I've never for whatever reason it seems so [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1103.5s)]
*  stupid that I've never done it but I've never even had the desire to do it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1108.3799999999999s)]
*  I just like wanted to come to me when it comes to me which is dumb. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1112.1s)]
*  Not necessarily. I respect that. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1116.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah but part of me doesn't. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1118.3s)]
*  Part of me is like you're just lazy. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1119.6599999999999s)]
*  Why don't you just like go like start the practice and study it and figure out how [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1121.06s)]
*  to make it happen more often. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1125.4199999999998s)]
*  You know. But for whatever reason I have zero desire. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1128.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1132.54s)]
*  I would. There might be some wisdom there. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1134.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1137.26s)]
*  I go back and forth with whether or not it's laziness. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1139.9799999999998s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  You know but there's there's obviously a fascinating aspect to lucid dreaming to [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1144.54s)]
*  what is going on there. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1150.7399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. How are you. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1152.62s)]
*  Oh definitely. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1153.58s)]
*  Managing this weird thing that for most of us you wake up you go God what the hell [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1154.2199999999998s)]
*  was that. Why was God's in my dream. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1159.54s)]
*  Why was on a skateboard. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1162.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1164.06s)]
*  It's just like weirdness to it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1165.06s)]
*  And then there's people that try to interpret that with like far too much confidence. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1167.22s)]
*  Yes I think so too. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1172.3s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1173.62s)]
*  So in in Tibet there's a Tibetan dream yoga and that's what they do. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1174.7s)]
*  They basically teach you how to do and you have to have a teacher by the way because [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1180.5s)]
*  they say it can be dangerous. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1184.54s)]
*  Yeah. So I think that's probably why you think you're not doing it because I don't [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1186.9399999999998s)]
*  think you're lazy frankly. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1190.78s)]
*  Like I know the kinds of things you do. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1192.06s)]
*  I know that that's not part. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1193.34s)]
*  Yeah but I am lazy. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1195.6999999999998s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1196.98s)]
*  Well I really am. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1198.54s)]
*  I'm lazy but I'm disciplined. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1199.78s)]
*  OK. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1201.74s)]
*  I'm both of those things. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1202.26s)]
*  Like I do all the things that I'm supposed to do but God it's a sludge. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1203.9399999999998s)]
*  It's a struggle. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1208.3s)]
*  It's like. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1209.2199999999998s)]
*  But I always do them. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1210.4599999999998s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1211.5s)]
*  OK. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1212.7s)]
*  Well that's that you'd be up for Plato's. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1213.22s)]
*  He'd invite you to his school. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1216.3000000000002s)]
*  The only time things are not a struggle is when like like when I was competing when I [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1218.5s)]
*  was competing then my discipline wasn't a struggle. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1225.3400000000001s)]
*  Then it was an obsession. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1228.7800000000002s)]
*  So it was like people say God he's so disciplined like no I'm mentally ill. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1230.22s)]
*  I'm crazy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1234.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah I understand. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1235.5s)]
*  There's a giant difference between discipline. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1236.5800000000002s)]
*  Like Mike Tyson said this on the podcast he said discipline is doing something you hate [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1239.54s)]
*  but doing it like you love it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1243.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1246.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1246.78s)]
*  So when you love it it's not really discipline. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1247.5s)]
*  No it's not. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1249.94s)]
*  It's obsession. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1250.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1251.7s)]
*  There's a different thing to that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1252.26s)]
*  That's what I was telling you about when I saw your picture out there of Jimi Hendrix. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1254.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1258.7s)]
*  And I was when I was a kid I was an artist I really liked to do art. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1259.38s)]
*  And I remember the first time I became obsessed was when I was doing this this drawing of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1263.74s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix and I was I went on it went on for about a week and my parents were like [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1270.3799999999999s)]
*  what are you doing you know and I was I was just obsessed with getting it correct. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1278.34s)]
*  It had to be absolutely correct and I did get it corrected. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1281.74s)]
*  It was pretty amazing and I gave it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1284.54s)]
*  Do you have it? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1286.02s)]
*  No I always give my stuff away. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1286.74s)]
*  Do you have a photo of it or anything? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1288.62s)]
*  No no no. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1289.74s)]
*  This was like pre cell phones. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1290.6599999999999s)]
*  So I gave it to my best friend and I don't I don't regret it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1292.38s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1297.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1297.74s)]
*  But I mean it was the experience though that was the best part of it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1298.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1302.26s)]
*  I the reason why this podcast is called the Joe Rogan Experience is because I think Jimi [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1302.94s)]
*  Hendrix is a religious figure. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1308.6200000000001s)]
*  He is. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1310.5s)]
*  He absolutely is. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1311.78s)]
*  I think I mean the guy died at 27 which when I was 27 I was a fucking moron. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1312.7s)]
*  I had never done anything good. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1319.02s)]
*  This guy had transcended the normal boundaries of what music was and had tapped into [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1320.7800000000002s)]
*  something whatever it was. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1329.94s)]
*  But when you listen to Voodoo Child to this day I've listened to that song thousands of [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1332.42s)]
*  times but like if I'm on my way to go do something cool and I listen that song like loud [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1338.1000000000001s)]
*  It's just like it's it's there's he tapped into something that was just out of this realm [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1344.3799999999999s)]
*  inaccessible to the average person that plays a guitar inaccessible to the average artist. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1353.82s)]
*  He hit some crazy vibration and I've always got that feeling when I listen to his stuff. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1360.02s)]
*  It's always like moved me in a very weird way where I'm just completely captivated. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1366.54s)]
*  Like immersed in the sounds immersed in his in his music. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1373.8999999999999s)]
*  Me too. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1378.54s)]
*  So he I think he knew that he was doing that. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1380.5s)]
*  So he as you know I'm sure you know this but you know he had a guitar when he was five [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1384.42s)]
*  and he he was so good at it. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1389.18s)]
*  He was immediately like he he streamed sacred information through his music and he knew he [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1392.02s)]
*  did. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1400.06s)]
*  He called it his electric church. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1400.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1403.9399999999998s)]
*  So he knew he did that. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1404.8999999999999s)]
*  And how incredible. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1406.26s)]
*  And yes we can hear it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1409.02s)]
*  And I think and I think I think probably part of the reason I felt that when I listened to [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1410.6599999999999s)]
*  his music and I somehow put that into his that picture that that drawing that I made [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1416.26s)]
*  and and it last and it was a beautiful experience. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1424.54s)]
*  And that was you know I mean I mean it sounds so strange but that's part of the reason why [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1427.66s)]
*  I was interested in studying religion and things like that because of of that experience. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1431.26s)]
*  Yeah that you're tapping into something that's higher than normal consciousness. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1437.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes and it's pretty cool. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1442.98s)]
*  It's exactly what Plato said it was. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1445.9s)]
*  It's it's you do it for its own sake. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1447.5800000000002s)]
*  You don't do it for anything else. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1450.66s)]
*  You do it because of it. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1452.22s)]
*  You don't do it because after this I'm going to make up a lot of money. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1453.9s)]
*  Or you know after this it'll make my parents happy or after you don't do it for those [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1456.82s)]
*  reasons you do it for in and of itself. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1461.62s)]
*  Well the people that I know that do do it for those reasons I'm going to be famous I'm [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1463.74s)]
*  going to be this I'm going to be that they never make it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1467.6999999999998s)]
*  There's something about it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1469.74s)]
*  They just don't they just don't. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1470.86s)]
*  Maybe some of them will become pop stars like someone will plug them into the right songwriter [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1472.82s)]
*  and the right producer and and they'll figure it out but it'll never be transcendent. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1477.82s)]
*  It might be catchy it might be OK. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1482.6999999999998s)]
*  But there's not it's not Hendrix. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1484.9s)]
*  No no. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1488.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1489.34s)]
*  There that that kind of what we like to call genius. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1490.3s)]
*  Like what what is that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1494.18s)]
*  But it's not I mean clearly it's him. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1496.14s)]
*  He's a vessel. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1500.54s)]
*  He's a receiver an antenna whatever he is. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1501.7s)]
*  But he's getting something from a higher state. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1506.18s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1509.98s)]
*  And the wildest thing with people what I always want to tell people about Hendrix and a lot [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1510.74s)]
*  of the particularly impactful people from the 1960s is that you have to understand how [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1516.22s)]
*  different the 60s were from the 50s. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  Like the difference between 2014 and 2024 is nil. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1527.6999999999998s)]
*  There's very little difference other than ubiquitous technology AI things that are much [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1533.1799999999998s)]
*  more powerful than they ever were before the impact of social media. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1539.7s)]
*  But there was an impact of social media even 10 years ago. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1543.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1545.94s)]
*  There's something about the 60s that were very different than the 50s. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1546.8200000000002s)]
*  And I connected to psychedelic use because all of those people were doing psychedelics. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1554.02s)]
*  All of them all those transcendent people all the Beatles when the Beatles from their [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1559.18s)]
*  early days to the psychedelic days was a completely different band like completely [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1563.6200000000001s)]
*  different style of music. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1567.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1568.8600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1569.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1570.34s)]
*  Completely different impact. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1570.62s)]
*  There was something about it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1571.82s)]
*  What what what had happened in the 1960s was a stunning revolution in culture. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1572.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1580.06s)]
*  And it's hard for us to understand it because we didn't we weren't teenagers when that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1580.3s)]
*  was happening. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1584.86s)]
*  You know I was I wasn't even born when Hendrix was in his prime or it was just you know a [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1585.8999999999999s)]
*  baby. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1591.86s)]
*  When you listen to that now it's hard to put it into context of how revolutionary that [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1593.1399999999999s)]
*  was. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1598.1s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1599.3799999999999s)]
*  For most people I think that's unless you live through it. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1600.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1604.5s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1605.22s)]
*  And that's also the terrifying aspect of what government can do because through the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1606.06s)]
*  sweeping psychedelics act of 1970 they made everything illegal and they did it to squash [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1611.18s)]
*  dissent. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1617.1399999999999s)]
*  They did it to stop the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement and they did it to [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1617.6599999999999s)]
*  so that they could arrest all these people that were involved in all these groups because [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1622.98s)]
*  all of them were involved in drugs. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1627.26s)]
*  And so they figured well this is the best way to just make everything it was obviously [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1631.38s)]
*  as people are doing acid and ruining our country. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1635.74s)]
*  Let's let's make everything illegal and then lock everybody up that does it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1638.1000000000001s)]
*  And then you get the 80s and the 80s is like this confused child that was raised improperly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1643.3s)]
*  was then cast out into the world with a distorted sense of values that was like expressing [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1651.02s)]
*  these values in like some of the most clumsy and goofy art human beings have ever done. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1656.98s)]
*  And the drugs changed. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1663.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1665.46s)]
*  Ego driven drugs the worst kind of drugs. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1667.02s)]
*  So you know it's really interesting because that wouldn't be that the 60s wouldn't be the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1669.42s)]
*  only culture that's informed by psychedelics right or entheogens you know as they're called [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1673.98s)]
*  and Native American churches or you know that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1679.82s)]
*  But what's interesting to me and I don't know if you have any ideas about this is that most [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1683.1s)]
*  likely it was through the government that the drugs became available. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1689.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1693.58s)]
*  And then once the effects seem to be counter to how who knows maybe there were just two [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1694.4199999999998s)]
*  factions of government one that was pro you know let's see what happens you know let's do [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1700.86s)]
*  this experiment and then the other was you know push back and you know let's let's change the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1707.06s)]
*  though you know change the culture through taking you know making these illegal. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1713.3s)]
*  But what you see now is you definitely see you know using these for therapeutic purposes. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1718.66s)]
*  Yeah the the MK ultra experiments when you realize what the government was involved with [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1726.18s)]
*  and what they were doing how they were running the hate Ashbury free clinic and they were [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1734.94s)]
*  administering psychedelics to people in brothels without their knowledge and observing them and [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1740.18s)]
*  what they did with Charles Manson that's very well detailed. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1746.66s)]
*  I don't know if you've read Tom O'Neill's book chaos. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1750.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah you read that. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1753.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1753.9s)]
*  Insane. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1754.74s)]
*  I know it's insane because Tom is so detail oriented. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1755.74s)]
*  I mean he's so crazy that he studied this one thing for 20 years like really kind of like tanked [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1760.62s)]
*  his life you know and then finally got the book out there and the book is just holy shit. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1765.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1771.22s)]
*  Because it's what the facts the absolute undeniable facts in that book just those alone forget [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1771.86s)]
*  speculation but forget theory just the facts alone are insane. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1778.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1782.34s)]
*  Most likely created Charles Manson most likely gave him psychedelics gave him LSD taught him how to [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1782.62s)]
*  mind control influential young people or easily influenced young people and get them to do [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1789.62s)]
*  horrific things and demonize the hippie movement. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1797.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah it makes you wonder doesn't it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1800.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1802.6999999999998s)]
*  Like what's going on right now. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1803.1s)]
*  That's exactly what I think. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1804.26s)]
*  I don't think there is good right now. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1805.78s)]
*  I think right now they're they're baffled by this thing called the Internet. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1807.62s)]
*  I think the Internet threw a giant monkey wrench in propaganda because it it made people so much [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1812.22s)]
*  more resistant to bullshit. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1818.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1820.94s)]
*  And then the when you see things like especially coming out of the pandemic when you see how [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1821.6200000000001s)]
*  incompetent these people that are supposed to be leaders are and how foolhardy they are and how [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1828.74s)]
*  stupid their decisions were and then you just look at the undeniable transfer of wealth to the upper [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1834.1s)]
*  small area of the country that gained billions of dollars in wealth and how much devastated small [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1841.94s)]
*  businesses and like did you guys do this on purpose. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1848.8600000000001s)]
*  Like do you know what you're doing. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1852.02s)]
*  Are you idiots. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1853.42s)]
*  Like why are you telling us what to do. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1854.5800000000002s)]
*  You guys are fools and especially when it comes to like is does anybody believe that Joe Biden's [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1857.3400000000001s)]
*  ever had a transcendent experience. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1864.3s)]
*  Does anybody believe that Joe Biden has ever met God and came back with a message for mankind. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1866.18s)]
*  No it's like everything is like bizarre ego driven narrative driven lies and propaganda and just [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1871.8600000000001s)]
*  nonsense that's supposed to make it look like they're doing the right thing always. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1880.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah that's the that's a terrible idea of justice. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1886.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1889.66s)]
*  But it's the appearance of justice. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1890.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1891.94s)]
*  Without actually doing the right thing. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1892.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1893.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's it's it's just it means it's also very it's got all the aspects of a cult all the people [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1894.26s)]
*  that go along with it no matter what the evidence shows that people that people that aren't like [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1900.8200000000002s)]
*  stepping back and going wait a minute we are we are being run by people that have zero feelings for [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1905.66s)]
*  the actual populace and all they're trying to do is feed this machine that's got them to where they [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1912.94s)]
*  are in the first place. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1919.74s)]
*  Yeah it's terrible. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1921.14s)]
*  It's terrible and it's it as it moves forward it creates the need for resistance and it creates [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1922.9s)]
*  the and that's what I've always thought about evil and negative things in the first place like they [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1930.3000000000002s)]
*  are necessary because they motivate change and they motivate evolution they motivate expression of [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1936.9s)]
*  dis of disdain of of people that are completely displeased people that are very upset with the way [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1946.94s)]
*  things are they know this is the wrong way. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1955.5s)]
*  It motivates the zeitgeist to move into a different direction which I think is happening. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1957.78s)]
*  I hear that. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1964.98s)]
*  This was actually a comment from a student the exact same comment that you just said is that you [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1966.46s)]
*  know there's this structural evil right. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1971.46s)]
*  There's this evil and it actually does some good in the sense that it motivates people to transform. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1973.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1980.74s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1981.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean yeah I agree with you and I'm at the same point. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1983.18s)]
*  So through through my looking at the UFO phenomena and you know I knew all of this. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1988.5s)]
*  I grew up in Northern California you know there was there were the the grove the I can't think of [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=1994.22s)]
*  the name it's right above where I live the Bohemian Grove you know so I kind of already had an idea [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2001.6200000000001s)]
*  of this kind of thing you know of the the group the cult as you call it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2007.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2013.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2014.42s)]
*  And it's easy to see. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2014.98s)]
*  Well for those who have who can see it it's easy to see some people don't want to see it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2017.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2021.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2022.3400000000001s)]
*  So once you see it you're like OK. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2022.94s)]
*  But then to live it to this is what I felt like happened to me. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2025.5400000000002s)]
*  So in 2012 after I started the study of UFOs I recognized that the management of that that [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2029.5800000000002s)]
*  message of the UFO for the American public had been organized not just from the 1940s but really [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2036.22s)]
*  from earlier from the early 20th century. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2042.74s)]
*  And once I started to recognize even meet the people who are responsible for managing this in a [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2046.78s)]
*  very cohesive tight way very specific. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2052.62s)]
*  That's when I recognized that it was that you know I felt I felt it I guess that's the difference [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2057.3s)]
*  was that before I just saw it on the sideline you know like we talk about it now you and I and it [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2062.78s)]
*  looks like we're talking about it from the sideline we're saying yeah this is really bad what [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2069.02s)]
*  they're doing and stuff. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2072.34s)]
*  But I was part of it. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2073.5s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2074.94s)]
*  I know those people. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2076.0600000000004s)]
*  They talked to me about it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2077.5s)]
*  They talked to me about why they were doing it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2078.5s)]
*  And they said Diana you you don't want to help these people. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2080.5800000000004s)]
*  They kill you if they if they you had something that they wanted. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2084.78s)]
*  Like these are not good people is what they were saying about these people specifically the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2088.94s)]
*  general population. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2092.86s)]
*  They were talking about the general population the general population would kill you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2094.1400000000003s)]
*  That's what they were saying. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2097.3s)]
*  They were saying that these people only do good because they have to do good. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2098.1400000000003s)]
*  They are actually bad. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2101.58s)]
*  And so this was the argument I was getting. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2103.34s)]
*  So it so it caused me to eject these people from my life for one but also to to do you know to [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2105.54s)]
*  understand more deeply and believe me I've already thought a lot about the problem of evil. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2113.42s)]
*  You know I spend my life reading about it and doing you know talking about it with people and you [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2119.9s)]
*  know what can we do. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2125.26s)]
*  I recognize we can't do anything except work on ourselves. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2126.94s)]
*  And that's where I had to reread some of those texts like the Plato text that I talked about who [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2130.7400000000002s)]
*  he talks about your idea of evil that you know perhaps or he calls it injustice on justice. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2136.46s)]
*  And he says that perhaps people are unjust just because you know there needs to be an injustice [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2142.26s)]
*  for other people to like recognize it and then to do this thing. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2148.6200000000003s)]
*  You know how do we create a just society. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2153.7000000000003s)]
*  That's his question. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2155.3s)]
*  And I don't think he so he doesn't actually answer that question with words but he does it through [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2156.9s)]
*  giving stories. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2162.7000000000003s)]
*  And one of the stories is the allegory of the cave where you know the allegory is it's like the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2164.2200000000003s)]
*  matrix right. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2168.98s)]
*  It's like you know where people are in they're being tied up and there's puppeteers who are [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2169.86s)]
*  showing them these shadows on the wall and they take that for reality. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2174.7000000000003s)]
*  But somehow some person gets out and they see well what he's talking about is this mystical [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2178.98s)]
*  tradition that you and I've talked about early when we started talking. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2184.14s)]
*  We talked about if we do those things that we love and we're carried away and we become we [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2188.18s)]
*  call the you said it was obsessed you know you're obsessed with it and I call it doing it [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2194.86s)]
*  because it's pretty awesome right. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2198.66s)]
*  That's my word for it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2200.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2201.38s)]
*  When you do that justice happens like you're not worried about you know. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2201.8199999999997s)]
*  So so we so it's almost like a an emergent phenomena from these communities that do it and [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2206.58s)]
*  they're small communities. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2212.22s)]
*  So there is structural injustice and their structural evil and it doesn't seem like we can [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2213.86s)]
*  fight. That's what I learned from doing the UFO. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2220.02s)]
*  I learned that there were these things UFOs but more intensely and more personally I learned [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2222.2599999999998s)]
*  that the government was doing this and that's what was upsetting to me most. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2228.66s)]
*  So I want to take it back because a lot of this is probably hard to follow for people that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2232.82s)]
*  aren't like well read in this. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2237.34s)]
*  When you say that they have been engineering or orchestrating public perception of this [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2240.1000000000004s)]
*  experience from the beginning what's the earliest known instance of this. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2249.42s)]
*  OK so the one that is unclassified is Project Blue Book and that's from 1950s 1952. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2254.7400000000002s)]
*  But I know that and I and I have to explain how one knows this. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2262.42s)]
*  So we have documents that talk about Project Blue Book and that's the manage you know they're [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2267.54s)]
*  managing the perception the public perception of UFOs goes back to like 47 even with Roswell [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2272.82s)]
*  and that kind of thing. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2279.14s)]
*  There's another and this is what this is what I've found is that there is an oral tradition [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2282.22s)]
*  that is part of the communities that run this run these programs like the UFO programs [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2291.38s)]
*  right. And that that information is carried within people. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2297.38s)]
*  It's not written down. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2305.22s)]
*  They even have a word for not writing it down when they're going to have these meetings. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2306.54s)]
*  They they have this special term and everybody puts down everything you know. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2310.2999999999997s)]
*  What's the term. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2315.58s)]
*  I don't know. It's called it's called pencils up. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2316.66s)]
*  Pencils up. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2320.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2320.94s)]
*  So pencils up means they're just going to discuss these things. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2321.3s)]
*  And then the that's the only record of it. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2324.98s)]
*  It's yeah it's the oral tradition. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2328.9s)]
*  Now why I was able to look at this is because I had done work looking at oral traditions [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2330.9s)]
*  in religious in religious communities like oral traditions go back 10,000 years whereas [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2336.14s)]
*  you know written traditions are like 2000 years old oral traditions are actually more [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2342.14s)]
*  accurate than we think they are. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2346.74s)]
*  We tend to think of it as telephone game but you can get a lot of information from oral [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2348.2999999999997s)]
*  traditions and this is actually how a lot of classified information is kept through [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2354.9399999999996s)]
*  oral tradition especially in a very disciplined and structured environment like high level [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2359.9399999999996s)]
*  military. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2365.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2366.2599999999998s)]
*  So so they have a perception and one of the things that you said earlier is that they [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2367.2599999999998s)]
*  think that the greater the greater population is not good and that they will turn on you [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2373.22s)]
*  and that they're evil. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2379.74s)]
*  Well that's one faction. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2380.7799999999997s)]
*  So what I found was that there were several different factions within the perception [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2382.4199999999996s)]
*  management of UFOs and one of the factions was responsible for sadly harassing people [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2387.2599999999998s)]
*  who do research. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2396.2999999999997s)]
*  And I found this out by being harassed. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2397.2599999999998s)]
*  How so. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2400.22s)]
*  How were you harassed. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2400.74s)]
*  OK so you know here I am just your average professor doing their work and you know and [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2401.74s)]
*  doing it pretty well at my university. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2409.66s)]
*  I was the chair of my department well regarded by my colleagues and students and never [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2413.66s)]
*  really doing anything weird right. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2419.46s)]
*  And then I start to study UFOs thinking that they're not real thinking that it's just a [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2422.5s)]
*  form a new form of religion. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2426.94s)]
*  And then quickly having people come into my sphere research sphere sphere who are you [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2429.18s)]
*  know part of CIA part of FBI that kind of thing and then getting a shock that you know [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2436.06s)]
*  well this could be dangerous and maybe I shouldn't be doing this and thinking you know [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2441.94s)]
*  but just simply because those people are contacting you or specific reasons why you would [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2446.2999999999997s)]
*  think it's dangerous. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2452.18s)]
*  It indicated to me that there was something that I shouldn't maybe be doing that it could [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2453.2999999999997s)]
*  be dangerous. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2457.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2458.66s)]
*  That you could suffer consequences for your curiosity or for your research. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2459.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2463.1s)]
*  And that they would punish you or you could be punished. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2463.9s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2466.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2467.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2468.2599999999998s)]
*  No most certainly. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2468.3399999999997s)]
*  And plus I had done some research on UFOs by that time of course. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2469.2599999999998s)]
*  But what is it about the research and what is about what you could possibly uncover that [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2473.06s)]
*  would be so dangerous. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2479.2599999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2482.74s)]
*  So of course that's a question that's loaded. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2483.1s)]
*  So I'm going to talk a little bit about I'll answer it in part. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2486.38s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2491.2200000000003s)]
*  So in part this is before the crash retrieval became a term that the Congress used. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2492.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2499.9s)]
*  So I was. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2500.6200000000003s)]
*  What year are we talking about. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2501.6600000000003s)]
*  So I started in 2012. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2502.94s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2504.9s)]
*  By 2015 and 16 I was already in full shock mode of wow this is bigger than I thought. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2505.6600000000003s)]
*  And I was had been invited to go to a crash retrieval spot in New Mexico that was under [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2514.82s)]
*  a no fly zone. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2522.42s)]
*  And I still didn't believe that when UFOs at this point you have to understand that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2523.7400000000002s)]
*  So I did. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2527.42s)]
*  I just thought that this I thought the person inviting me is Tyler. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2527.9s)]
*  He's a scientist. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2531.5400000000004s)]
*  He works for the Space Force. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2532.5800000000004s)]
*  He believes this and I'm wondering how does he even believe that this is real. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2534.82s)]
*  We're we're we're going with Gary Nolan who's from Stanford and he's out. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2538.42s)]
*  But at the time I called him James in my book and I am I'm the one actually who invited [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2543.8599999999997s)]
*  him to go because I didn't really want to go by myself. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2548.4199999999996s)]
*  You know. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2551.8999999999996s)]
*  And so I insisted that Gary go with me and Tyler figured out who Gary was and he said OK. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2552.7s)]
*  So we went out there we had to actually wear blindfolds and it was out in the middle of [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2558.2599999999998s)]
*  this place in New Mexico. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2562.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know where I know what was near it but I don't know where the actual place was. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2564.14s)]
*  And we were looking for parts right that had been put out there and during the time period. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2569.8999999999996s)]
*  So I think part of it was the danger was that parts exist. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2575.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2581.02s)]
*  So things like this do exist and there are anomalous materials. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2581.2599999999998s)]
*  This is what I was finding out and I think that this is what I'm an OK researcher. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2587.54s)]
*  It's not like I would make this up nor would I lie. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2593.18s)]
*  You know I'm publishing with Oxford. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2597.2599999999998s)]
*  So my reputation is at stake right. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2599.26s)]
*  So I'm doing the best I can to kind of adjudicate like am I being fed disinformation or [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2602.58s)]
*  you know what's going on. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2608.26s)]
*  Gary now will be able to identify by taking these parts back and analyzing them through his [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2609.46s)]
*  laboratories whether or not they're engineers or not. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2615.26s)]
*  And and he's been doing that ever since. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2618.94s)]
*  So these are the kinds of things that I would have found out. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2623.1s)]
*  I think part of it was also that I was finding out that there was an oral tradition and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2626.14s)]
*  that the perception management was very tight. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2630.58s)]
*  And I think this is what they were afraid. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2634.18s)]
*  But I've said this now publicly. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2636.2599999999998s)]
*  So. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2638.42s)]
*  I did get harassed though. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2641.1s)]
*  I did get harassed and it still happens. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2642.3799999999997s)]
*  How did you get harassed. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2645.2599999999998s)]
*  Most of it is doxing and email harassment at my university began and both. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2646.7s)]
*  To me and Gary at the same time and people showing up. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2655.7799999999997s)]
*  People. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2660.98s)]
*  Yeah people in my town. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2661.54s)]
*  What kind of people schizophrenics. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2663.8199999999997s)]
*  No but no but people you wouldn't want to meet. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2666.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2670.22s)]
*  Lunes. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2670.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2671.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2671.5s)]
*  Do you think that's targeted. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2672.18s)]
*  Do you think that's for sure. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2673.14s)]
*  But do you think that also that might just be people that are obsessed with this particular [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2674.94s)]
*  subject. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2679.2599999999998s)]
*  These are people that are affiliated with people in those that. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2679.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2685.14s)]
*  I mean there's no doubt. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2685.7400000000002s)]
*  So tell me about the crash retrieval site. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2687.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2690.42s)]
*  So this is in. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2691.2200000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2692.02s)]
*  So now you have to understand this is a long time period. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2692.26s)]
*  So I start this in 2012. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2695.66s)]
*  I get this shock where I'm being you know people are asking me to meet you know people [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2697.5s)]
*  from these programs and from the Space Force. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2703.62s)]
*  And I'm actually not meeting with them because I'm waiting. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2705.98s)]
*  I'm kind of thinking I've got to think this through. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2708.5s)]
*  It wasn't until about 2014 that I actually start to meet the people like the affiliated [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2711.02s)]
*  people and they show me some things and they you know they they asked me to go to this [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2718.42s)]
*  crash retrieval site in New Mexico. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2724.42s)]
*  No this is a recent crash. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2727.1800000000003s)]
*  No it's OK. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2729.26s)]
*  So this crash is part of a series of crashes that happened in the 1940s. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2730.34s)]
*  So the Roswell. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2736.38s)]
*  It wasn't Roswell actually. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2737.38s)]
*  It was one of the crash sites that's near. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2739.1400000000003s)]
*  It's in New Mexico but it's not Roswell. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2742.1400000000003s)]
*  So there was more than one crash in New Mexico. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2744.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah I think they allegedly allegedly. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2746.1000000000004s)]
*  They said that there were probably four maybe even more. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2748.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2751.78s)]
*  What a bunch of shitty UFOs. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2752.5s)]
*  I know I know. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2754.0600000000004s)]
*  Well they don't believe that they crashed. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2755.38s)]
*  They they use that term but they don't they don't think it's a crash. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2756.7400000000002s)]
*  They think that it's they personally I'll tell you from a professor standpoint like [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2760.82s)]
*  their idea of this is that it's a donation. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2766.1800000000003s)]
*  They call it the donation site. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2769.9s)]
*  So they think that these were donated materials and they're going to get information [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2771.6600000000003s)]
*  and they do. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2775.9s)]
*  And that's how Tyler was able to create a lot of of the things that he created in [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2776.9s)]
*  you know through and he would fly these on the space shuttle by the way. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2784.2200000000003s)]
*  These experiments and and so forth. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2787.78s)]
*  It was very very fascinating to me. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2790.02s)]
*  I mean I think anybody would be fascinated with it to tell you the truth. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2792.1s)]
*  When you say fly these you don't mean physical materials. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2794.58s)]
*  So he would have an idea that he would get through these protocols that I told you [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2797.86s)]
*  about. So he practices these protocols and it would be related to something that he [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2802.2599999999998s)]
*  would then want to fly on the space shuttle because this is during the time the space [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2807.54s)]
*  shuttle was happening and the space shuttle had anti-gravity environments and he needed [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2812.02s)]
*  these environments in order to create this. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2818.38s)]
*  And now this is actually a whole field called biologics. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2820.94s)]
*  So there's there's a real field now that where people are doing these experiments in [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2824.2200000000003s)]
*  space and creating things that we can't create here. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2829.38s)]
*  Like what medicine certain types of metals kind of like ceramic metals. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2832.82s)]
*  He created something. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2841.06s)]
*  I actually wrote about this and published about it totally academic paper. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2842.34s)]
*  So you know most general reason we never read it. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2846.3s)]
*  It's because it has academic jargon in it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2849.1000000000004s)]
*  But I talked all about it. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2851.9s)]
*  James got something your research is capitalized on microgravity in space to accelerate [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2854.34s)]
*  drug discovery and development. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2858.06s)]
*  That was one of the speculations about the type of metals that were retrieved supposedly [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2860.46s)]
*  from these crash sites that these whatever these metals were they were layered and that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2869.5800000000004s)]
*  they could only be layered specifically the way they were done in a zero gravity [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2876.8999999999996s)]
*  environment. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2880.54s)]
*  Yeah that's right. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2881.4199999999996s)]
*  They were engineered. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2882.7s)]
*  So I actually did talk to Gary before I came on your podcast because I just wanted to be [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2884.4199999999996s)]
*  sure you know because I don't want to represent his research incorrectly. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2889.4199999999996s)]
*  So I said can you please you know recap it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2893.3399999999997s)]
*  He always thinks I'm an idiot too. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2896.22s)]
*  He's like how many times have I told you this. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2897.5s)]
*  So yeah so he has parts from various of the crash sites that he's been able to do. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2899.7799999999997s)]
*  Are clearly engineered. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2906.8599999999997s)]
*  Not by humans. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2910.22s)]
*  But he doesn't he's not going to jump to the conclusion that is extraterrestrial. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2912.9399999999996s)]
*  He says we just don't know. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2916.54s)]
*  Right. It's just something that is outside of the realm of our current understanding of [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2918.2599999999998s)]
*  how we create physical materials. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2924.62s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2926.8199999999997s)]
*  And how much of this stuff they have. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2928.3799999999997s)]
*  They have full crafts. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2930.54s)]
*  I've never seen any full craft. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2932.9399999999996s)]
*  What did you see when you went to the crash site. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2934.3399999999997s)]
*  So I saw two types of materials. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2936.3s)]
*  One I can say it looks like kind of metallic frog skin and another. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2938.7s)]
*  And this is on the ground at the crash site. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2944.62s)]
*  OK. So that's another thing. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2947.1s)]
*  I have to tell you a little bit about how we came about this. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2948.98s)]
*  Now remember this is the first book that I wrote about this. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2951.18s)]
*  So I've written two books about it and I wasn't a believer. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2954.1s)]
*  So when I went there I even wasn't a believer. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2958.7400000000002s)]
*  I was like I think they're trying to give me misinformation or you know something's going [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2960.54s)]
*  on. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2964.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2964.7s)]
*  Maybe they really believe this. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2965.38s)]
*  Well they both really believed this. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2966.62s)]
*  I know that for sure. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2968.1s)]
*  So we're there and we had to wear blindfolds in order to go me and Gary. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2969.5s)]
*  So Tyler's taking us. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2975.46s)]
*  We drive to a certain place he says put the blindfolds on. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2978.7000000000003s)]
*  We had to leave our cell phones. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2981.86s)]
*  We can take any technology with us. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2983.02s)]
*  And so we go out it takes about an hour to get out to the site. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2985.18s)]
*  We're blindfolded. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2988.98s)]
*  We get out to the site. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2989.62s)]
*  We get out. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2991.34s)]
*  We're wearing different. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2992.98s)]
*  We were wearing like I guess I guess there's rattlesnakes out there. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2993.98s)]
*  And so we have to wear certain boots and you know things like that. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=2997.38s)]
*  So we get out. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3000.42s)]
*  We take our blindfolds off. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3001.3s)]
*  And the first thing I do is I look around because it looks really familiar to me even [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3004.02s)]
*  though I've never been out there. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3007.38s)]
*  And Tyler looked at me and he said looks familiar doesn't it. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3008.94s)]
*  And I said you know yeah. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3011.98s)]
*  And he said it's it's you've seen it in the X files. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3014.9s)]
*  And I was like what. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3019.2599999999998s)]
*  He goes they had an insider on their team. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3021.9s)]
*  And I honestly thought OK this actually fits into my research that you know we learn [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3025.38s)]
*  everything we do about religion from from media like you want to know what you know [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3031.34s)]
*  Moses looked like. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3036.7400000000002s)]
*  You just watch you know the Ten Commandments and things like that. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3037.7000000000003s)]
*  Like it's not true of course but that's how most people learn about their their [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3040.78s)]
*  religions. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3044.34s)]
*  And so this made me understand this is what's going on. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3045.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like people are believing this through this and then I'm coming to this and I'm [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3048.46s)]
*  going to confirm that it indeed looks like this. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3051.86s)]
*  You know and it is a crash site. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3054.98s)]
*  It's just it's just too weird for me but you know this is what I study so I'm going [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3056.54s)]
*  to study. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3061.14s)]
*  But that gets to your point. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3061.94s)]
*  Like how did we get this stuff. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3063.5s)]
*  So he actually did have metal detectors that were configured for specific types of [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3065.7000000000003s)]
*  metals that he had. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3071.9s)]
*  He had these built. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3073.98s)]
*  Is there a scientific term for these particular types of metals. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3075.2599999999998s)]
*  They're called meta materials. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3079.42s)]
*  Metamaterials. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3081.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3082.02s)]
*  I think that's just a fancy word for saying we don't know what this is. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3083.22s)]
*  Frankly because they're meta. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3086.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3089.22s)]
*  And they're layered in some sort of a way where it's like literally like atom upon [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3090.02s)]
*  atom. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3097.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3098.8199999999997s)]
*  Well I don't actually know the science of it. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3099.46s)]
*  I just know what these guys tell me because you know they're doing the research at you [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3102.14s)]
*  know their laboratories. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3108.74s)]
*  People are very cagey about it like Jacques Vallee was very cagey about the way he was [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3110.62s)]
*  willing to describe it and the way he was willing to describe these things. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3115.42s)]
*  It's almost like they don't want to blurt out too much because it'll cut off access. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3119.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3126.7799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3127.4199999999996s)]
*  So that's that could be. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3127.66s)]
*  But I know that the reason that I don't want to is there's some type of national security [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3129.5s)]
*  issue and I am an American. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3136.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3138.2599999999998s)]
*  So there's something like that going on. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3138.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3141.46s)]
*  Especially if someone else can figure out how to use these things. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3142.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3144.9399999999996s)]
*  So when you go to this site do you see the physical ground where this thing hit. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3145.8199999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3151.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3151.8599999999997s)]
*  So what does it look like. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3152.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3153.2999999999997s)]
*  So at this point the whole site is covered with rubble that looks like rusted rubble [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3153.54s)]
*  and it's not sand. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3163.9s)]
*  So there's the sand of the desert right. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3165.46s)]
*  And then there's this rubble everywhere and I'm stepping on the rubble and I'm kind of [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3168.22s)]
*  looking at it and I get these pieces. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3172.14s)]
*  Well this this is all just like less than. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3174.46s)]
*  Yeah it's like gravel it's like. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3177.18s)]
*  And so I asked Tyler what's this and he said that after the government retrieved the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3178.94s)]
*  crash and they didn't want anyone out here looking. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3185.5s)]
*  So what they did was they dropped a bunch of tin cans out here in the 1950s and these [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3188.54s)]
*  have disintegrated down into this rubble. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3192.74s)]
*  And so I put that in my book because that's what he said. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3195.3399999999997s)]
*  And when I put that in my book the editor of my book said to me you can't say this [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3198.7s)]
*  because it's ridiculous. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3204.18s)]
*  And I at the time I was like it is ridiculous but this is what happened and it's data. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3206.7799999999997s)]
*  And even though we don't understand it now and it seems ridiculous we need to keep it [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3212.8599999999997s)]
*  in there. It doesn't seem ridiculous to me at all. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3217.22s)]
*  Well this is a person who absolutely you know the editor who absolutely doesn't believe [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3219.9s)]
*  in UFOs at all but knows that I'm doing good work on a new type of religion therefore is [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3224.18s)]
*  keeping the Oxford brand you know Oxford University straight and narrow. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3231.02s)]
*  But I convinced her I said it's data so we've got to keep it in there and I'm really [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3236.2999999999997s)]
*  happy I did. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3240.02s)]
*  I kept it in there I kept a lot of stuff in there that didn't make sense to me at the [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3241.2599999999998s)]
*  time. But when I look back on it with with everything that's coming out now I'm like [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3244.54s)]
*  OK I'm glad I did that. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3248.8199999999997s)]
*  Well the strategy for disseminating disinformation along with real information is [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3250.62s)]
*  long been used. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3258.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3259.54s)]
*  Where they'll say a bunch of really ridiculous things and connect them to something that's [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3259.94s)]
*  probably real. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3263.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3264.5s)]
*  And that way everything gets thrown out. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3264.8599999999997s)]
*  It's the baby with the bath water. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3267.1s)]
*  The whole thing gets thrown out. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3268.54s)]
*  Totally. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3269.98s)]
*  And if you have a site where they've picked up these anomalous metals that defy our [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3270.42s)]
*  understanding of metallurgy and you're calling them metamaterials no one knows where the [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3277.5s)]
*  hell it comes from. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3281.5s)]
*  What's the best way to confuse people. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3282.46s)]
*  We'll just throw a bunch of regular metal everywhere. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3284.7799999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3287.3s)]
*  That's exactly. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3288.14s)]
*  Just throw 10 cans. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3288.82s)]
*  But we were out there all day. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3289.9s)]
*  So we were out there for probably 10 hours. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3291.1s)]
*  And I know. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3293.02s)]
*  So at many points in the day Gary and I would go aside and kind of confer without Tyler [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3294.54s)]
*  listening and saying you know is this a setup. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3301.5s)]
*  You know. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3304.3s)]
*  And so he goes well let's just try to find some stuff and I'll analyze it and I'll tell [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3304.7400000000002s)]
*  you. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3308.38s)]
*  So are you. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3309.3s)]
*  Do you notice that the ground has been disturbed. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3310.9s)]
*  Is there there an indication that something hit there. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3314.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3318.38s)]
*  So Tyler took us and showed us everywhere like he's been a part of this retrieval site [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3319.18s)]
*  for like 40 years or so. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3326.1s)]
*  He knows the people that like the original people and the story and everything like [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3328.7799999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3335.74s)]
*  So he gave us a tour of the whole place and we did and we found parts by the way and [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3336.38s)]
*  some of the parts were so deep down into the grounds like there are rocks and things [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3342.66s)]
*  like that. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3347.5s)]
*  And Gary I like I'm afraid he's going to get bit by a rattlesnake frankly. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3348.3799999999997s)]
*  He's putting his hand down there and you know spending like hours at this one place [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3352.94s)]
*  trying to get something. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3358.9s)]
*  He found some things there and I thought if people are trying to fool us and put things [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3359.8599999999997s)]
*  down they did a really good job because they would have had to come here like a year ago [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3364.54s)]
*  or something and put that down there. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3369.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't honestly that's my personal opinion is I don't think that this this was put out [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3370.9799999999996s)]
*  there for us. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3378.14s)]
*  They found they did they did find we did find things. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3378.66s)]
*  What's interesting to me is this is that after we found these things and we did all this [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3381.9799999999996s)]
*  kind of data collection and everything at the site you know very much like anthropologists [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3386.2999999999997s)]
*  do by the way you know documenting what we found when we found it you know what it looked [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3391.8599999999997s)]
*  like and things like that putting into special containers. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3396.8199999999997s)]
*  Then I was like I don't want this. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3400.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't want any of this stuff. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3402.9799999999996s)]
*  And they both looked at me and laughed. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3404.58s)]
*  And so Tyler told us what was going to happen when we went back to the airport. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3406.5s)]
*  He said once we get back to the airport Gary said he's going to take the stuff. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3410.9799999999996s)]
*  Gary's going to get stopped. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3416.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh Tyler can go through airports by the way he doesn't get he doesn't have to go through [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3418.7s)]
*  the normal thing that I have to go through like the TSA and everything he just goes [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3422.3799999999997s)]
*  through. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3426.1s)]
*  So he went through that through I had to go through. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3426.8999999999996s)]
*  Gary went through and he did get stopped and everything happened exactly as Tyler said [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3429.54s)]
*  it would. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3435.1800000000003s)]
*  There was going to you know they weren't they were going to look through everything. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3435.98s)]
*  They were going to like take everything apart. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3438.26s)]
*  Then you know all that was was a signal to someone in D.C. that somebody had these parts [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3440.9s)]
*  and this is who. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3446.78s)]
*  That's what he said was so. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3448.5s)]
*  And I don't know if the signal went to D.C. but everything else happened. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3450.1s)]
*  And Gary and I were both sweating right. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3453.58s)]
*  We were like ah. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3455.98s)]
*  So they essentially allow this. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3456.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3460.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3461.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3462.1s)]
*  Is it because they want different perspectives from different academics. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3462.54s)]
*  I think so. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3467.34s)]
*  My personal opinion is that and in fact there was a conference at Stanford like a month [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3468.1s)]
*  ago and I was at that conference and part of what was said was that this is information [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3473.9s)]
*  that we can't keep siloed because it's it's too important and we need to have the best [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3479.7400000000002s)]
*  minds on this this information this data this material. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3484.1s)]
*  And so they're out kind of like outsourcing. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3488.86s)]
*  How big were these pieces. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3491.34s)]
*  So these pieces that I found weren't very big. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3493.02s)]
*  I mean they were about one of them was about like this this big. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3496.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3499.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3500.1800000000003s)]
*  So the size of a pack of gum. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3500.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3502.34s)]
*  And the actual frog skin type thing was probably about this big like a small notebook. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3503.06s)]
*  And we found a couple of those. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3510.06s)]
*  You found a couple of just wandering around this area. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3511.98s)]
*  Well we weren't wandering we were actually digging in right looking. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3514.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3517.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3517.86s)]
*  Wanders bad word. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3518.22s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3519.5s)]
*  Exploring. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3520.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3520.9s)]
*  This frog skin. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3521.54s)]
*  What is it. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3524.2999999999997s)]
*  What. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3524.94s)]
*  What is the. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3525.2999999999997s)]
*  Is it malleable. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3526.02s)]
*  Is it. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3527.62s)]
*  Yes it's malleable and you could crunch it up and it'll go back to its original form. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3528.1s)]
*  I've heard of that before. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3533.7s)]
*  That was something that they talked about it Roswell that there was some bizarre metal [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3534.66s)]
*  that you could crumple up like a piece of paper and it would flatten right back out. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3539.94s)]
*  And that's what you experienced. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3544.42s)]
*  I don't know if it was the same material but. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3546.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3548.02s)]
*  More. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3548.22s)]
*  Yeah it was. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3548.66s)]
*  What is what did that feel like when you did that. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3549.42s)]
*  It's hard to explain because you have to understand I'm I was really resistant to to [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3553.7799999999997s)]
*  the you know 10 years ago. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3560.02s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3561.86s)]
*  This was a time period when we weren't talking about UFOs. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3563.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3566.62s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3566.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3567.54s)]
*  2017. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3567.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3568.82s)]
*  Time story. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3569.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3570.02s)]
*  And my book was impressed during that time. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3570.5s)]
*  So during this time period I'm doing this research and I am not going to believe that [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3572.6200000000003s)]
*  this is this is but so many indicators were telling me that it was yes this is Diana. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3576.2200000000003s)]
*  This is what's going on. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3582.3s)]
*  You know there is something and so much. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3583.5800000000004s)]
*  And when I looked back at the Space Force our Space Force and also the history of that [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3585.94s)]
*  I could see OK there there are so many things that just don't add up here that this is [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3591.0600000000004s)]
*  probably. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3595.7000000000003s)]
*  And I met too many people that had been long timers in the program like seriously long [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3596.5400000000004s)]
*  timers like their whole lives live and die by this live and die by it when they die they [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3602.14s)]
*  die with that information. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3608.14s)]
*  And it's it's traumatizing to them and their family too. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3610.7s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3614.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3614.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3616.2999999999997s)]
*  The the people that worked on Roswell that spoke about it many many years later they [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3616.7s)]
*  have that sort of same weight that they're carrying around with them. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3622.74s)]
*  With Philip Corso and all those other people when they describe the experience like many [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3626.82s)]
*  many years later. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3632.2200000000003s)]
*  So there's a weight to the information that they're carrying. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3633.1400000000003s)]
*  It's almost like they want to tell the world but the world is not going to even believe [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3636.98s)]
*  them. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3639.5s)]
*  And how could they unless they experienced it. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3640.2200000000003s)]
*  And even though they experienced it they're still baffled by it. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3642.94s)]
*  That's exactly the feeling I got it was a weight. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3647.34s)]
*  There was a sense of duty to the American you know to be an American of course and [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3650.3799999999997s)]
*  patriot. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3657.02s)]
*  There's a patriotism there. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3657.66s)]
*  But there was also a sense that these were the true actors in history and we will never [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3659.98s)]
*  know their names. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3664.62s)]
*  So you spend 10 hours at this site and is there any guidance. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3668.14s)]
*  Are they describing things to you. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3673.74s)]
*  Are they telling you what you can and can't do. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3675.54s)]
*  Is there any. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3677.62s)]
*  No it's just me Gary and Tyler. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3678.7400000000002s)]
*  There was no no one else. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3682.7400000000002s)]
*  So who transported you there. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3684.82s)]
*  Well Tyler did because it was a Tyler blindfolded. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3686.86s)]
*  Yeah yeah he's the person who worked on on this site for 40 years. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3689.94s)]
*  So obviously has permission to do this. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3695.1000000000004s)]
*  He does. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3697.1000000000004s)]
*  He had in fact he had to get permission for Gary to go. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3697.78s)]
*  He had already received permission for me to go and he had to get permission for Gary [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3700.82s)]
*  to go. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3705.6200000000003s)]
*  And what kind of information are they giving you in terms of what their conclusions are. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3706.26s)]
*  How many different possibilities that they have surmised like do they have a summary [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3714.34s)]
*  of all the different aspects of this phenomenon that they think it could be or might [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3719.86s)]
*  not be. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3726.38s)]
*  So yes. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3728.2200000000003s)]
*  So the story actually begins there and then I continue to work with Tyler because I'm [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3730.14s)]
*  pretty fascinated by what he does and I'm fascinated about the programs and I'm [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3738.02s)]
*  fascinated by this by the fact that the true actors of history are unknown. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3744.26s)]
*  And I remember that because these are the people that are doing things that actually [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3751.5s)]
*  change history like think of the first people that decided hey let's give these people LSD [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3756.8199999999997s)]
*  and see what happens right. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3762.8599999999997s)]
*  Well they probably weren't Richard Alpert Ram Dass and Timothy Leary. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3764.3399999999997s)]
*  They probably weren't them. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3768.7799999999997s)]
*  But Jolly West. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3770.1s)]
*  There you go. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3771.14s)]
*  OK. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3771.98s)]
*  And most people don't know who that is. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3772.3799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3774.66s)]
*  So what that's what I'm saying is like there's a whole other level to our history and I [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3775.02s)]
*  already knew this anyway being a historian of religion. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3780.42s)]
*  But when it I guess I was a patriot right and I still am. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3783.02s)]
*  And so when I was mine so when I learned about this I was I really wanted to share the [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3787.1000000000004s)]
*  story because I felt like these people even if they remained invisible they should get [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3792.7400000000002s)]
*  their due like because these people keep us safe in ways that we just don't know. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3797.26s)]
*  And they're dedicating their lives and they're getting no recognition for it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3802.1400000000003s)]
*  OK. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3806.5s)]
*  No recognition. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3806.82s)]
*  And so that really prompted me more than anything to to write about it. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3807.98s)]
*  So I was working with with Tyler and I was scheduled to go to the Vatican and and it [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3812.5s)]
*  was at the Vatican where we encountered where where a lot of things happened for Tyler [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3819.62s)]
*  that I saw made him understand that this was something that had been going on historically [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3825.5s)]
*  for a very long time period. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3832.14s)]
*  See we didn't just go to the Vatican we also went to the well we went to the Vatican [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3833.8199999999997s)]
*  Archive which is hard to get into but I could get into it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3837.2599999999998s)]
*  And we also went to the space observatory archive which most people don't even know [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3840.7400000000002s)]
*  that the Vatican has a space observatory and how that all happened was not set up Joe. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3844.58s)]
*  It was not. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3850.5s)]
*  It was so organic because it happened before I even met Tyler and I I put off going [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3851.26s)]
*  there because I have I had at the time very young kids and I didn't want to leave them [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3858.94s)]
*  and go to another country for you know three weeks or whatnot. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3864.02s)]
*  And but I had been invited by Brother Guy Consolmanio to go to the space observatory [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3869.46s)]
*  because I had been studying about the the space you know research and I said does the [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3874.86s)]
*  Vatican have like a lot of space documents you know documents about space and he said [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3880.78s)]
*  every single thing that the Vatican does and they and we do he said comes to where I live [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3884.62s)]
*  which is at the space observatory and we have a scholars residence and you're welcome to [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3890.14s)]
*  stay for as long as you want. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3893.9s)]
*  You have full access to the space observatory archive and what is it like. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3895.5800000000004s)]
*  It's great. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3901.1800000000003s)]
*  It's great. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3902.82s)]
*  Describe it to me. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3903.46s)]
*  OK. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3904.2200000000003s)]
*  Well for me it's great. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3904.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3905.98s)]
*  Many people may think oh how boring right. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3906.26s)]
*  But original Kepler's and Copernicus is and you know every single thing that people [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3908.78s)]
*  scientists from 1200 1300 on up thought about space and about magnetism and propulsion and [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3915.58s)]
*  things like that. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3925.5s)]
*  It's all there. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3926.2200000000003s)]
*  Every one of them. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3927.34s)]
*  And so you go in there and we had full access to it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3928.78s)]
*  Thailand. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3931.98s)]
*  Well the Vatican would have it. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3934.3s)]
*  So because you know who was doing this 500 years ago there was no United States. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3935.7400000000002s)]
*  So of course they're going to have it. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3941.34s)]
*  They also have an amazing meteorite collection. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3942.5s)]
*  They have a lot of really cool things there. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3945.34s)]
*  And they're again there are these monks there astrophysicists monks and they're just [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3947.34s)]
*  hanging out there. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3951.78s)]
*  They've got the best lattes by the way. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3952.78s)]
*  Italians. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3956.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3957.54s)]
*  They know how to eat. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3958.54s)]
*  My experience though of the Vatican itself was different than the archive. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3959.78s)]
*  And I've actually heard you talk about the Vatican and I agree. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3964.62s)]
*  Like you said you were I saw you talking about it and you said you know I'm looking [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3967.78s)]
*  around and I see all this stuff and they stole it from all these countries. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3971.74s)]
*  It was like all this booty you know the Vatican is filled with it. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3976.5s)]
*  That was my experience as well. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3979.2599999999998s)]
*  So when I went you know we did all the we did the scholarship of course but we also [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3980.58s)]
*  did the touristy thing. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3986.18s)]
*  So you know we went and looked at all the museum and everything that and everything [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3987.5s)]
*  I saw seemed to me to be like you know colonization you know the colonization of [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3991.7799999999997s)]
*  these people and taking their stuff and the colonization of these people and taking [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3996.2599999999998s)]
*  their stuff. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=3999.8599999999997s)]
*  And they have it all there. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4000.7400000000002s)]
*  And when you're inside the Vatican by the way it's different than when you're [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4002.1000000000004s)]
*  outside of it because you know when you're outside of it there are those guys that [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4006.1400000000003s)]
*  that the Swiss guards. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4010.46s)]
*  Well those guys are militia when you go inside and they're everywhere. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4012.94s)]
*  The thing that fascinated me about it was the just the volume. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4019.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4023.7000000000003s)]
*  The volume. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4024.42s)]
*  It's like they're hoarders for insane art. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4025.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4028.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean there's stuff that should be in its own room and it's just stacked next to [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4029.38s)]
*  other stuff that also should be in its own room. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4033.5s)]
*  It's almost like they don't have enough space for all the stuff that they have. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4036.02s)]
*  That's what it seems like. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4040.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4040.9s)]
*  It's it's well it's kind of like this place if you see our stack of art that we [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4041.94s)]
*  have out there. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4045.82s)]
*  I have like stuff that I need to put on the walls just like too much of it because [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4046.74s)]
*  so many people send me cool shit. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4050.46s)]
*  This is such an awesome studio. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4052.2599999999998s)]
*  It reminded me immediately when I walked into it I was like OK I want to take [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4054.1s)]
*  photos of everything but I wouldn't. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4057.74s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4059.58s)]
*  But I did want to. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4060.5s)]
*  Well you can. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4061.66s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4062.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4063.5s)]
*  It's just art. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4063.7799999999997s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4065.06s)]
*  You have some really amazing stuff. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4065.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4067.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah it's cool. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4068.14s)]
*  It's cool to be connected to so many fascinating artists that send me stuff or [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4069.18s)]
*  that I buy their stuff like I bought that the Hendrix painting. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4073.54s)]
*  There's the thing about the Vatican. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4076.9799999999996s)]
*  Well I got very fortunate that we had a professor that took us on a tour and my [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4079.8599999999997s)]
*  children were pretty young at the time. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4085.66s)]
*  And when we went we were outside in the this courtyard area and there's where the [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4087.3399999999997s)]
*  pine cone is. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4094.66s)]
*  And he said do you know the significance of the pine cone. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4096.3s)]
*  And I said does it represent the pineal gland. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4100.58s)]
*  And he said yes. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4103.42s)]
*  And so he got so excited. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4105.0199999999995s)]
*  I did not know this. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4105.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4106.62s)]
*  That's why it's also in the Pope's staff. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4107.18s)]
*  If you look at the staff that the Pope carries the staff has a pine. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4110.66s)]
*  See if you get a photo of the staff the Pope cares. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4113.94s)]
*  There's a pine cone in the center of it. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4116.26s)]
*  The pine cone which is in it's depicted in many many ancient pieces of art [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4118.54s)]
*  religious art and it represents the pineal gland because it's similar in [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4126.3s)]
*  appearance to a pine cone. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4131.14s)]
*  And so this pine cone which also I'm sure probably represents the Fibonacci [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4132.98s)]
*  sequence which also represents itself in the pine cone. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4137.78s)]
*  That that's the seed of the soul. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4141.0199999999995s)]
*  That's where DMT is made. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4144.34s)]
*  This might be the gateway place. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4147.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4148.74s)]
*  It's well the reason why they have it an immense pine cone. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4149.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean that's not an accident. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4153.099999999999s)]
*  No of course not. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4154.58s)]
*  No. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4155.26s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4155.7s)]
*  Fascinating. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4156.94s)]
*  So he has it in his staff and that massive pine cone that is the sculpture at the [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4157.7s)]
*  Vatican that that's what that is. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4163.94s)]
*  That's what that is. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4166.0599999999995s)]
*  That that is that it's representative of the pineal gland. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4168.259999999999s)]
*  And this is what this professor was telling me. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4172.54s)]
*  And like you see it there in that ancient Mesopotamian art. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4174.339999999999s)]
*  It's probably Sumerian with that god that has that. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4178.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean that's the Anunnaki carried that thing and that the fact that they're [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4182.66s)]
*  holding it specifically that they're telling you like this is what this is [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4185.82s)]
*  what's up. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4189.82s)]
*  This is this is the connection. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4190.54s)]
*  This is the connection to the gods. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4192.299999999999s)]
*  Did you guess this. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4193.98s)]
*  Well I knew that the pineal gland looked like a pine cone. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4196.339999999999s)]
*  And so when he asked you you just knew this. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4200.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4202.179999999999s)]
*  That's pretty amazing. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4202.7s)]
*  Well I'd already had a lot of experiences with DMT. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4203.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4207.86s)]
*  Sorry I knew I knew there was there's an a realm accessible to anybody that gets in [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4208.219999999999s)]
*  contact with that stuff that is beyond imagination. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4215.58s)]
*  It is more real than reality. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4220.0599999999995s)]
*  And when you go there you've been there before. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4222.259999999999s)]
*  What the most bizarre feeling about it is this terrifying fear while it's [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4225.1s)]
*  happening and then incredible peace when you get in there and a recognition like [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4231.06s)]
*  oh I know this place. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4235.34s)]
*  I've been here. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4237.06s)]
*  I'm here all the time. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4238.18s)]
*  I know these things. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4239.66s)]
*  I know these beings these beings are there. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4241.0199999999995s)]
*  They're truth. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4243.5s)]
*  They're there's something from somewhere else somewhere that's probably around us [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4244.78s)]
*  all the time that's influencing us all the time. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4249.86s)]
*  I know a lot of people have had very negative experiences like horrific [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4254.38s)]
*  experiences of demons and and negative encounters. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4258.86s)]
*  I've had none of a no negative experiences like that. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4262.78s)]
*  My my experiences are all in these very enlightened bizarre creatures that [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4266.22s)]
*  contact you and they seem to know like what's wrong with me like right away. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4273.0599999999995s)]
*  And they seem to like also work on you like there's this bizarre feeling like [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4278.22s)]
*  they're like let me get in there and fix your fucking wires. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4283.14s)]
*  Well that of course sounds like the abduction experience. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4286.700000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4288.820000000001s)]
*  Very very very similar to the abduction experience. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4289.9800000000005s)]
*  I think they're all connected. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4293.18s)]
*  I really do. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4294.740000000001s)]
*  I think that's why I mean I know you're saying that some of them do happen [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4295.54s)]
*  during the day. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4298.34s)]
*  I'm sure I'm sure some of them happen during the day. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4299.5s)]
*  Most of them happen at night. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4302.14s)]
*  The vast majority of them happen during what people are sleeping. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4303.5s)]
*  That's true. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4306.860000000001s)]
*  And that seems to be completely connected to that. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4307.700000000001s)]
*  It's the only explanation that makes sense to me other than an actual you know [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4311.0199999999995s)]
*  like you know Hollywood style UFO landing and then come and get you. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4315.62s)]
*  And which seems so theatrical. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4321.5s)]
*  I think the reality is far more bizarre than that. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4324.46s)]
*  I think that is that's one of the things that McKenna said about DMT and also [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4328.66s)]
*  about mushrooms. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4334.58s)]
*  Terrence McKenna said that they show you themselves in that way to comfort you [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4336.22s)]
*  because the reality of what they are would be too much for you to handle. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4343.5s)]
*  And that what you're seeing even though it's mind blowing it's just a tiny little [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4348.18s)]
*  piece of what it actually is. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4354.54s)]
*  So when I'm at the Vatican and I see this pine cone I'm going OK. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4357.26s)]
*  So there's this recognition that this connection to God this connection to this [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4362.86s)]
*  higher experience is higher power. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4368.74s)]
*  It's available inside of us. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4372.179999999999s)]
*  It's there's some there's a gateway and that's the gateway that pine cone is the [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4374.219999999999s)]
*  gateway. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4378.42s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4380.299999999999s)]
*  And you know my parish priest actually about a year ago gave me a little pine [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4382.62s)]
*  cone a little gold pine cone and I put it on my bag. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4387.7s)]
*  And I didn't know this actually. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4392.02s)]
*  And as I came here to Austin it fell off in the airport and it's not gold or [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4395.26s)]
*  anything but it looks gold and it fell off and it kind of went away and it would [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4402.42s)]
*  be I thought maybe I should just let it go. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4405.78s)]
*  And then I looked at it and I was like nah that's really important for some [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4408.98s)]
*  reason. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4412.78s)]
*  So I picked it up and put it back in the bag. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4413.14s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4416.02s)]
*  I know. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4416.82s)]
*  Yeah it's a strange representation of what I mean it's it's like it's an icon [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4417.66s)]
*  of this thing whatever this thing is that's inside of us that is this gateway. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4424.38s)]
*  And it must have been that Plato in his school was basically they were basically [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4429.18s)]
*  trying to make the body healthy enough for people to you know access through [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4433.02s)]
*  this which is a type of mind like he didn't call it intellectual. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4438.26s)]
*  He had he had another word for it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4443.22s)]
*  They have like Greeks they have different words for knowledge right. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4445.3s)]
*  So gnosis and you know so this was a form of the dialectic which was a certain type [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4450.54s)]
*  of knowledge a certain type of knowing. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4456.18s)]
*  It wasn't like mathematical knowing. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4458.54s)]
*  So this must be this type of thing. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4460.34s)]
*  I'm thinking because you know Plato's Republic actually went and influenced [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4462.860000000001s)]
*  Christians and early Christianity. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4466.780000000001s)]
*  So this idea seems to not be just specifically Christian as you say you saw [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4469.22s)]
*  you know we saw some photos of Egyptians you know with yes fascinating all [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4475.0199999999995s)]
*  throughout history. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4480.179999999999s)]
*  And then all throughout history the use of psychedelics. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4481.54s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware of Brian Murray rescues work. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4484.38s)]
*  Oh yeah I know him. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4487.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4487.9s)]
*  So that whole thing the Illusenian mysteries. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4489.179999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4493.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah that was all about that. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4493.78s)]
*  That's right. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4496.5s)]
*  Are you aware of Maria Sabina. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4498.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes yes. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4499.82s)]
*  OK so when I was young I learned about her and and how you know she worked with [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4500.86s)]
*  psilocybin to heal people and when she died I think it was in the 1980s the [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4509.259999999999s)]
*  president of Mexico announced it. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4514.3s)]
*  So she was actually so in that culture it was well known that and she called the [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4516.34s)]
*  psilocybin the mushrooms little saints. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4520.82s)]
*  Did you ever read John Marco Allegro's work. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4524.86s)]
*  No I haven't. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4527.42s)]
*  Do you know of it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4528.34s)]
*  No I probably have read it. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4529.58s)]
*  You know I think I've read a lot of books so I may have just forgotten. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4531.54s)]
*  John Marco Allegro was an ordained minister who became an agnostic when he [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4535.22s)]
*  started studying theology and he was one of the people that was studying the Dead [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4539.1s)]
*  Sea Scrolls and he studied the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years and he wrote the [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4545.860000000001s)]
*  sacred mushroom in the cross. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4550.06s)]
*  OK yes I do know that book. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4551.42s)]
*  Yes yeah yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4553.22s)]
*  And then he wrote that one got I think he got bought out by the Catholic Church and [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4554.58s)]
*  you can get old copies of it but then it was just re-released a few years back. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4561.34s)]
*  But the then he wrote something in the Christian myth. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4566.14s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4571.82s)]
*  Sacred mushroom in the Christian. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4572.94s)]
*  Sacred mushroom in the cross. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4574.5s)]
*  And then there was another one he wrote that he published after that other one was [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4575.9s)]
*  bought out that you can that's readily available. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4580.54s)]
*  But this guy studied the Dead Sea Scrolls which is the oldest version of the Bible [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4583.139999999999s)]
*  that we know of written in Aramaic and the Dead Sea Scrolls is a particularly [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4588.74s)]
*  meticulous transcription. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4594.179999999999s)]
*  The way they had to transcribe this is very bizarre because it's written on [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4597.34s)]
*  parchment which is animal skin. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4601.0599999999995s)]
*  So they had to do DNA tests on the various pieces of parchment to make sure that they [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4602.54s)]
*  came from the same piece because the idea that they'd be from different cows. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4607.099999999999s)]
*  So they take this parchment skin they they're laying it out. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4611.86s)]
*  They do DNA tests on it to make sure it's all from the same. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4615.26s)]
*  And then they try to piece together what it is and not all of it is even available. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4618.219999999999s)]
*  Jamie chuck me that behind you. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4622.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4624.62s)]
*  And his conclusion after all of this the summary of his conclusion was the entire [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4627.0599999999995s)]
*  Christian religion was all about psychedelic experiences and fertility rituals and that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4633.38s)]
*  this was what all these stories really meant. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4639.14s)]
*  And he even connected the word for Christ to an ancient Sumerian word which meant a [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4641.9400000000005s)]
*  mushroom covered in God's semen and that these ancient people believed that when it [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4647.740000000001s)]
*  rained it was God having an orgasm on the earth and that these mushrooms which if you [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4653.14s)]
*  ever seen mushrooms appear after the rain they come up out of nowhere. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4657.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4662.18s)]
*  And that these mushrooms these people would eat them and they would experience God and [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4662.46s)]
*  that they wrote these things down and or first it was an oral tradition for who knows [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4667.62s)]
*  how long and then they wrote them down and then you know it gets transcribed to Greek [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4672.66s)]
*  and Latin and English and it's all and a lot is missing out of those translations. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4677.66s)]
*  A lot of is missing even from the ancient Hebrew translation because the words in [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4682.0199999999995s)]
*  ancient Hebrew had numerical value. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4687.22s)]
*  Yes that's true. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4689.78s)]
*  Which is it's a very complicated language where like the word law love and the word [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4690.62s)]
*  God have the same numerical value and the numerical value in words is very important [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4695.7s)]
*  to what the meaning of these sentences and what these phrases meant. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4701.18s)]
*  And we lose a lot of that. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4705.3s)]
*  We also lose people's gender through these translations. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4707.0599999999995s)]
*  So some early apostles are called who are women are called men in the translation from [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4710.86s)]
*  Greek to Latin. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4717.98s)]
*  So I'm aware of this idea and of course Brian's work as well. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4720.139999999999s)]
*  And in my field that's that's one we have categories for you know obviously you know [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4724.38s)]
*  like medicine you know has different categories and that's one category is entheogens and [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4729.900000000001s)]
*  different types of religions. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4736.34s)]
*  So the early Christian church I would say that not all I don't agree that all of [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4738.540000000001s)]
*  Christian tradition is is this. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4742.18s)]
*  I would say that there definitely is a lot of it. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4745.740000000001s)]
*  But there are also other types of you know Christian traditions. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4748.620000000001s)]
*  I mean when I look at the Jesus movement in the first century it to me looks like a [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4753.3s)]
*  philosophical school like Plato and you know Plato did the mysteries you know and but I [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4756.86s)]
*  don't know if I think Jesus was part of an asin movement like the John the Baptist is [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4763.0199999999995s)]
*  Jewish he's out in the desert and you know they're practicing these water rights and [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4768.5s)]
*  they basically are you know they have their own community and he looked like he was part [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4773.62s)]
*  of he had been baptized into this community. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4779.46s)]
*  So the Jews in the first century are just trying to survive because Rome is killing [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4781.7s)]
*  them and destroying they're going to destroy their temple. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4787.26s)]
*  So so a lot of these communities you know those. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4790.18s)]
*  So that's one interpretation and I'm not discounting that that's correct for those [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4794.66s)]
*  those traditions. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4799.58s)]
*  But there are other traditions that are not they're not filled with entheogens and [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4801.099999999999s)]
*  things like that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4806.42s)]
*  I'm just letting just being accurate. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4806.9s)]
*  That's what I could do. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4808.74s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4809.5s)]
*  I mean you're. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4811.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah it was super diverse today. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4811.9s)]
*  Look at how diverse it is. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4814.5s)]
*  So I think there are thousands of well there are thousands of Protestant denominations [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4816.42s)]
*  of you know and there's Catholicism and you know so we have so many different even [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4821.66s)]
*  Catholics don't even know what they're supposed to believe. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4826.86s)]
*  So some here believe this some over here believe that they have the same mass that [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4829.38s)]
*  they go to but their belief structures are different. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4833.98s)]
*  So that leads us to one of the most fascinating interpretations of what we're [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4838.34s)]
*  experiencing collectively when it comes to this UFO UAP whatever it is phenomenon [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4844.26s)]
*  that this is not. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4851.5s)]
*  A thing from another planet that comes on a spaceship and lands here to show us how [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4854.74s)]
*  to do things correctly but that they've always been here and that they are the [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4859.54s)]
*  things that are being described in Ezekiel that they they are a phenomenon that is both [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4864.86s)]
*  here and not here at the same time that it's you're you are literally dealing with [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4873.58s)]
*  angels and demons that this is that this this phenomenon is connected to these ancient [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4880.34s)]
*  stories of religion and it's it's not as simple as other beings like us from [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4888.38s)]
*  somewhere else. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4895.22s)]
*  OK. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4897.06s)]
*  Yeah. So so I can respond to that. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4898.02s)]
*  All right. So because you said a huge amount of information in there and I'm going to [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4901.9800000000005s)]
*  parse out some of that and tell you just about what I what I think. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4908.58s)]
*  So part of why I continue to study this was that I saw that the historical record [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4915.06s)]
*  included a lot of these events and these events were weird back then just like they're [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4922.38s)]
*  weird today. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4927.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4928.14s)]
*  And when you look at these events back in that time period you also see a common [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4928.7s)]
*  pattern that happens today. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4932.66s)]
*  And what is that pattern. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4934.42s)]
*  That pattern is that you know let's take St. Francis of Assisi stigmata. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4935.82s)]
*  I don't know if you want to show you know. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4941.9s)]
*  So if you look at his stigmata where it looks like he's being you know basically [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4945.139999999999s)]
*  radiated by UFO. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4949.58s)]
*  That's what my students say when they go and they see this in the Louvre and such. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4951.82s)]
*  If you look at his primary sources for that this happens in the 1200s and you look at [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4957.82s)]
*  what. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4963.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4965.139999999999s)]
*  So that. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4965.42s)]
*  So here you see St. Francis but also over here on the right you see his friend Brother [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4966.700000000001s)]
*  Leo. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4972.02s)]
*  Brother Leo actually at the time is probably 15 or something like that. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4972.620000000001s)]
*  He's 15. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4976.06s)]
*  Yeah he's really young. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4976.740000000001s)]
*  Hard life back then. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4977.540000000001s)]
*  Dude looks 80. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4978.580000000001s)]
*  Well he's he's doesn't actually look like that. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4979.5s)]
*  So the art is. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4982.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4983.580000000001s)]
*  So the artists actually are not getting at the primary sources and that's what similar [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4984.02s)]
*  similar things are happening today. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4989.740000000001s)]
*  So the representations that we get in the media don't look at all like an abduction. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4991.34s)]
*  They don't look at all what people experience. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4996.46s)]
*  And so what I did was I went through a lot of the primary source materials for Teresa [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=4998.34s)]
*  of Avila has a weird experience that looks like an abduction. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5004.06s)]
*  But they look beautiful. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5008.62s)]
*  They're domesticated. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5009.740000000001s)]
*  They're made to look a lot more happy or something like that. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5010.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think part of the reason for that I don't think is intentional. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5015.06s)]
*  I think because it's traumatic. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5017.9400000000005s)]
*  I think because once you recognize the people themselves are traumatized by this in both [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5019.860000000001s)]
*  good and bad ways. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5024.900000000001s)]
*  OK. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5026.42s)]
*  So this experience is still happening. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5026.9800000000005s)]
*  To call it angels and demons is is accurate except for one part. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5030.74s)]
*  And this and because there are bad things that happen sometimes people get hurt. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5035.7s)]
*  Francis died from that wound or he died from wounds that you know were bleeding until. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5039.5s)]
*  So when he had this experience until he died which was about a year and a half later they [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5046.58s)]
*  tried to keep it silent in his monastery because they were they didn't know what happened [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5052.26s)]
*  to him and they were horrified by it. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5057.06s)]
*  OK. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5060.02s)]
*  And so until he died they didn't actually tell anybody. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5060.74s)]
*  So he kept it between him brother Leo and probably another monk. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5063.1s)]
*  So there's this idea of shame almost you know this is like you know shameful. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5066.74s)]
*  But also this idea that since bad things happen and that's why people say well you know [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5070.82s)]
*  demonic or something like that and people do experience these things in different ways. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5075.9s)]
*  And they still do. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5081.7s)]
*  They still do. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5083.219999999999s)]
*  But what should we call it. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5084.099999999999s)]
*  Should we then use the terminology of people from 100 years ago and call it angels and [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5085.42s)]
*  demons. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5090.7s)]
*  I don't think we should. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5091.74s)]
*  I think that what we have to do is we have to take case by case look at patterns and [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5092.54s)]
*  maybe just try to proceed with different language because some of the things really interesting [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5098.58s)]
*  if you do look at say experiences that Catholics have say in the 1960s that have been videotaped. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5103.62s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5109.38s)]
*  So Virgin Mary experiences where the Virgin Mary appears and she reads people's minds [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5109.54s)]
*  and she does you know she's doing these kinds of things levitating people together. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5115.54s)]
*  If you put physics on that case physicists on that case they're going to be able to [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5121.82s)]
*  do physics on that case. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5127.42s)]
*  And if you take you know the work of those people who are working I think it's the [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5128.38s)]
*  University of Washington where they're doing MRI imaging of what people are thinking and [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5131.82s)]
*  they're able to replicate it. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5135.9800000000005s)]
*  So if they're looking at a Van Gogh painting they can replicate that. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5137.34s)]
*  Well this looks like a technology. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5140.66s)]
*  So that's what I'm trying to say is that there's something going on that could possibly [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5143.42s)]
*  be different and we need different language for it. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5147.58s)]
*  And I think we're at the very beginning just like doing this stuff with DMT we're at the [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5151.02s)]
*  beginning of learning about this this other world. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5154.78s)]
*  You know another thing that's fascinating about ancient religious art is the halo. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5159.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5164.82s)]
*  Have you ever seen the earlier depictions of the halo where it looks like a mushroom [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5165.82s)]
*  cap. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5170.14s)]
*  That is wild because it seems to be that what they're trying to say is that this person [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5171.42s)]
*  is under the influence of the entheogens. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5180.099999999999s)]
*  I mean it's a literal representation of a mushroom cap. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5183.3s)]
*  It changes over time and over history and it becomes different and it eventually becomes [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5186.46s)]
*  like a hula hoop around your head. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5191.46s)]
*  But the earlier versions all look like a mushroom cap. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5193.3s)]
*  They have the lines of the mushroom cap. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5197.0199999999995s)]
*  Jesus is depicted there. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5198.98s)]
*  The enlightened ones the saints the the religious figures that are of prominence. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5201.22s)]
*  They all have that mushroom cap experience behind their head. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5207.9s)]
*  Even the Buddha that photo of the Buddha there with the halo. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5212.139999999999s)]
*  Click on that. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5215.38s)]
*  The statue. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5216.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5217.0599999999995s)]
*  Even that. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5217.78s)]
*  I mean they they all have this thing behind them which you could represent. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5219.54s)]
*  I mean you could interpret as these people are under the influence. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5226.26s)]
*  OK. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5232.42s)]
*  I agree with you that there are mushrooms are seen in Catholic churches in near [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5233.62s)]
*  Guatemala. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5240.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5240.820000000001s)]
*  New Mexico down in Mexico and things like that inlaid. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5241.14s)]
*  But I would have to suggest that there might be more going on. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5246.820000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to push back on your interpretation although I'm not going to say that [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5251.900000000001s)]
*  psilocybin and mushrooms are aren't in you know aren't part of that that iconography. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5256.620000000001s)]
*  I would say that a lot of the iconography is going to be something about the the light [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5264.179999999999s)]
*  that emanates from people who are accessing these realms. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5270.7s)]
*  And I say that because there are I've read so many reports and they're not. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5275.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that if some of the monks and nuns who report being lit up right in their cells [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5281.0599999999995s)]
*  and things like that if they were doing psilocybin if they were doing mushrooms they [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5286.139999999999s)]
*  would have said so they would have written it because they write a lot. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5290.259999999999s)]
*  So the Catholics have immense records you know they they took good notes. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5293.06s)]
*  Well I don't think it's the only way to do it. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5297.580000000001s)]
*  Oh I know I was I mean I think it's something that they discovered. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5300.06s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5305.18s)]
*  I think it's a part of it. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5305.860000000001s)]
*  I do. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5307.3s)]
*  Yeah I think that. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5307.780000000001s)]
*  But so the magnetism of the of what's you know this kind of light that's happening. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5308.900000000001s)]
*  You can see that even in the shroud of Turin which is by the way an anomalous artifact [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5316.820000000001s)]
*  that scientists have looked at even atheist scientists have looked at it and it appears to [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5322.459999999999s)]
*  be some type of imprint from radiation onto a cloth. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5327.58s)]
*  So so I think we're talking about forms of light as well. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5334.74s)]
*  But the the shroud of Turin is only 500 years old. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5338.339999999999s)]
*  Well not necessarily. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5341.54s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5342.66s)]
*  So when you. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5343.86s)]
*  So there are certain parts of it that could have been repaired that are 500 years old. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5345.0199999999995s)]
*  So the problem is there is a whole department of this. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5350.42s)]
*  You should get this priest on here on here by the way you'd have a really good discussion [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5354.34s)]
*  with him. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5357.9400000000005s)]
*  He's an expert on the shroud of Turin and he just came out with new research that's been [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5358.9400000000005s)]
*  done about six months ago. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5363.3s)]
*  And there's a whole department in the Vatican just for doing research on the shroud of [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5365.780000000001s)]
*  Turin. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5370.780000000001s)]
*  So that's so it's not necessarily just 500 years old that there are different parts of [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5371.54s)]
*  it. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5377.26s)]
*  You know how you were talking about the parchment. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5377.580000000001s)]
*  Is the shroud of Turin real after all 1988 report wrote off the relic as a medieval fake [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5379.5s)]
*  but now the science seems to be turning. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5385.900000000001s)]
*  Could it have been a miracle all along. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5387.58s)]
*  OK. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5392.34s)]
*  How many hundred seventy peer reviewed academic papers on the shroud have been published in [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5396.74s)]

*  Yeah that mean that would kind of I mean that wouldn't that wouldn't create immaculate [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5758.9s)]
*  conception but it kind of would. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5764.38s)]
*  It seems like it. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5767.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5771.14s)]
*  Similar in that regard. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5772.14s)]
*  But that's one of the things that I had a conversation with Taylor Taylor Sheridan the [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5773.74s)]
*  other day we were discussing like what is the Bible trying to say when it describes [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5776.94s)]
*  certain things. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5780.58s)]
*  But in the beginning there was light and how the you know God created everything in six [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5781.66s)]
*  days like God doesn't that sound like the Big Bang like told through the telephone. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5785.86s)]
*  I think so. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5789.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5791.22s)]
*  So the Catholic Church and science go together. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5791.66s)]
*  Like even Catholics can believe in evolution. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5795.179999999999s)]
*  They don't generally know that they believe in evolution. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5798.259999999999s)]
*  It's just theistic evolution. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5800.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5802.419999999999s)]
*  That's all right. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5803.099999999999s)]
*  And most Catholics don't know that. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5804.0599999999995s)]
*  And I don't know why. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5805.5s)]
*  But Catholics. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5806.58s)]
*  Yeah we're scientific. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5808.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been messing around with this idea over the last few years that the universe itself [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5809.74s)]
*  was God. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5814.179999999999s)]
*  I think. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5815.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah I mean this idea that like God created the universe. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5816.54s)]
*  Yeah maybe it is God. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5820.099999999999s)]
*  I mean if you want to talk about something that's all powerful beyond comprehension is [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5823.26s)]
*  responsible for every single thing in the cosmos it is the universe that that all has [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5831.98s)]
*  some sort of law that keeps it together. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5840.66s)]
*  Like an intelligence. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5843.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5845.46s)]

*  One of the things you talked about in your book that's really fascinating was the Apollo [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5847.54s)]

*  Maybe this has been my new workout music. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5867.5s)]
*  Space music. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5872.86s)]
*  I didn't know you could hear it online. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5873.82s)]
*  It really freaked them out. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5873.9400000000005s)]
*  I would imagine. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5875.5s)]
*  Dr. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5876.86s)]
*  Aya Whiteley. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5877.18s)]
*  She's a space psychologist. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5877.9s)]
*  She's the one who told me about it and said you should put this as a quote before my [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5879.38s)]
*  information because she talked about how they didn't want to report it because it was so [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5883.46s)]
*  weird. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5887.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's the whole idea of this to data set. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5888.82s)]
*  There are two data sets for UFO reporting like pilots will see stuff but they won't [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5891.66s)]
*  report it. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5895.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5896.58s)]
*  Or they'll see stuff and they'll report stuff but they won't. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5897.06s)]
*  Let's listen I guess. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5900.9400000000005s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5901.66s)]
*  You want some more brownies. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5904.02s)]
*  Now. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5905.7s)]
*  I didn't music even sounds outer spacey didn't it. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5910.34s)]
*  Do you hear that whistling sound. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5913.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5919.5s)]
*  It sounds like you know outer space type music. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5921.5s)]
*  Hey Tom is your insulation all burned off here on the front side of your window over [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5928.02s)]
*  here. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5931.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5932.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5933.82s)]
*  Front side of your window over here. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5934.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5935.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5937.02s)]
*  Mine's all burned off. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5940.18s)]
*  And out here. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5942.740000000001s)]
*  Where are you John. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5943.5s)]
*  You might get first of a picture you know someone put this break. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5956.660000000001s)]
*  So. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5960.46s)]
*  It goes on for five minutes. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5962.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5964.14s)]
*  So it's just that sound. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5964.66s)]
*  I think it's the sound. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5967.74s)]
*  There are two tones. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5968.86s)]
*  There's kind of like this high pitched sound and then that sound. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5969.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5972.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5982.34s)]
*  And you're also getting it. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5982.66s)]
*  It's a recording from inside. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5984.74s)]
*  And. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5987.66s)]
*  Obviously it's not going to sound exactly how they were hearing it. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5989.66s)]
*  This video can't be this it's not. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5992.62s)]
*  It's just video I think like stock video of them on the. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5995.179999999999s)]
*  Mission. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5998.7s)]
*  Oh so this is not the video of them experiencing it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=5999.22s)]
*  No way that audio would be recorded separately from this and I think someone just mixed this [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6002.74s)]
*  together so there's something to look at. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6006.58s)]
*  Let's see if there's just a recording of the audio itself with this guy. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6007.94s)]
*  This is the full. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6011.179999999999s)]
*  This is the one that's a full audio. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6011.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6013.42s)]
*  They're like this is from CBS. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6013.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6015.0199999999995s)]
*  That sounds like it. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6016.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6030.139999999999s)]
*  Mystery music heard space. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6031.139999999999s)]
*  What the hell is that. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6037.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6038.38s)]
*  What do they think it is. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6039.139999999999s)]
*  Well what happens now. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6041.62s)]
*  I don't know what they think it is but I do know that they train astronauts for it now. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6043.179999999999s)]
*  To get them. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6046.86s)]
*  They have simulation so when astronauts go into space they're not surprised by stuff. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6047.58s)]
*  So this is a common occurrence. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6051.78s)]
*  There are so many weird things that happen like one thing that happened to them when they [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6053.78s)]
*  were in space. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6057.74s)]
*  Now this is getting back to the two data sets. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6058.26s)]
*  So they've they've worked their whole lives to go into space so they can't indicate that in [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6060.82s)]
*  any way they're mentally unstable. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6066.98s)]
*  So when they go there and they come back certain things happen. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6069.0199999999995s)]
*  So one thing that happened was they were seeing like flashes of light when they came back [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6071.58s)]
*  down to Earth. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6075.86s)]
*  And but they wouldn't tell anybody. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6076.94s)]
*  And then finally a bunch of them said do you see this flash of light like when you close [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6079.7s)]
*  your eyes you see light and everything like that. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6083.0599999999995s)]
*  And they were they agreed that if they all reported it they couldn't get fired. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6085.259999999999s)]
*  So this is how they were. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6089.7s)]
*  They were able to report weird stuff that they saw in space. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6090.86s)]
*  Isn't that crazy that exploring the outside of Earth you have to be careful about what you [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6094.9s)]
*  say because people think you're crazy. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6100.78s)]
*  That's right. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6102.42s)]
*  That's right. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6103.219999999999s)]
*  Isn't that bizarre. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6103.78s)]
*  Well yeah. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6104.74s)]
*  So it's these two data sets. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6105.3s)]
*  So it happens here when people have you know when they see things and then they have these [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6106.54s)]
*  strange things that happen they don't they tell authorities the stuff. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6111.06s)]
*  OK yeah I saw this. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6115.18s)]
*  It was unknown. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6116.26s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6117.14s)]
*  But then they tell their friends and family I actually had this feeling that it was [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6118.42s)]
*  looking at me and this is why I think that. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6122.780000000001s)]
*  And so they tell their subjective kind of weird things you know to their families and [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6124.780000000001s)]
*  their family friends. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6129.54s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6131.02s)]
*  So you get that with astronauts too. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6131.62s)]
*  Who is that the front of the line when it comes to this stuff like who has been studying [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6135.26s)]
*  this the longest that has the greatest body of information available about space and [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6141.660000000001s)]
*  stuff about the emergent phenomenon of some sort of contact. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6148.740000000001s)]
*  OK. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6155.54s)]
*  That's such OK. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6157.38s)]
*  This is a hard question to answer because there is a person but will this person say [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6158.34s)]
*  everything this person knows. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6163.46s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6165.26s)]
*  OK. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6166.9800000000005s)]
*  So but there is an official NASA historian who in my opinion knows way more than he [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6167.3s)]
*  actually writes about. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6173.860000000001s)]
*  But he's written a heck of a lot. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6175.02s)]
*  And he's and his name is Stephen Dick. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6176.820000000001s)]
*  And what an unfortunate name. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6180.22s)]
*  Well yeah but it is his name and he has an amazing body of work that anybody who's [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6181.900000000001s)]
*  interested in this should read. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6187.660000000001s)]
*  He was also at the very beginning kind of in he was part of the initial stages of [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6189.58s)]
*  creating astrobiology and yeah astrobiology. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6195.18s)]
*  And what leads you to believe that he's holding back information. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6199.74s)]
*  Well when I go back and I'm in contact with him and I when I read what he's written I [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6203.9400000000005s)]
*  can see that he was at the forefront of looking at this like AI back like 25 years ago. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6209.34s)]
*  He was already talking about it saying this is this is AI. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6216.3s)]
*  ET is going to be AI and this is why. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6220.580000000001s)]
*  And then kind of doing timelines and things like that. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6223.3s)]
*  So and also just conversations that I've had with them that are you know basically [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6226.26s)]
*  correspondences that indicate to me that I think he probably has some information but [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6234.42s)]
*  he you know a lot of this is classified. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6240.780000000001s)]
*  And probably for good reason. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6243.22s)]
*  What good reason. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6245.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6247.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6250.9s)]
*  They argued since the ancient Greeks extraterrestrial life has been a theme tied to [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6259.1s)]
*  scientific cosmologies including the ancient atom atomist Copernican Cartesian and the [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6263.38s)]
*  Newtonian worldviews. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6272.06s)]
*  Dick argues that from a pistol epistemological point of view the methods of astrobiology [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6273.46s)]
*  in the 20th century are as empirical as in any historical science such as astronomy or [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6280.7s)]
*  geology. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6287.1s)]
*  Dick has also surveyed the field of astrobiology in critical issues in the history philosophy [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6288.34s)]

*  On December 4th 2013 while holding the NASA Library of Congress chair in astrobiology [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6296.86s)]
*  Dick testified on astrobiology before the U.S. House of Representative Committee on [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6303.54s)]
*  Science Space and Technology arguing that SETI funding should be restored and integrated [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6307.82s)]
*  with the NASA astrobiology program. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6314.1s)]
*  Hold on go back to that. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6318.62s)]
*  This part the intelligence prints. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6322.82s)]
*  Yeah this is this is it. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6324.42s)]
*  This is the thing that he worked on like more than 20 years ago is a hypothetical idea of [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6325.58s)]
*  Dicks in the field of cultural evolution outlined is 2003 paper cultural evolution the [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6330.46s)]
*  post biological universe and SETI. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6336.66s)]
*  The intelligence principle describes a potential binding tendency among all intelligent [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6339.18s)]
*  societies both terrestrial and extraterrestrial. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6345.1s)]
*  The maintenance improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence is the central [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6348.58s)]
*  driving force of cultural evolution. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6353.66s)]
*  And that to the extent intelligence can be improved it will be improved. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6356.9400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't actually have the next line that that he writes about and says and if it's not [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6362.66s)]
*  improved it will be to the detriment of that society. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6368.06s)]
*  That's certainly seems to be true. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6373.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6375.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6376.5s)]
*  So that's so that so it's him but also Joe it's not just him. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6376.9s)]
*  There is a group there called the invisible college and I'm not going to name who they [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6381.1s)]
*  are. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6385.54s)]
*  People can search them and find out their names but they're part of this oral tradition [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6386.06s)]
*  and this hidden tradition that's been at the forefront of doing this type of work for [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6390.82s)]
*  over 50 60 70 years. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6396.42s)]
*  So what has it been like for you to go from a person that before you visit this crash [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6402.7s)]
*  site you think this is all nonsense right to where you are now. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6407.98s)]
*  I haven't written two books about it and very careful with your words and realizing how [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6412.34s)]
*  bizarre this is to now having this conversation with me in front of millions of people. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6418.3s)]
*  What has this been like for you. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6423.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes it's been life changing. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6427.34s)]
*  OK so that's definitely a fact. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6429.02s)]
*  And in the beginning it was uncomfortable. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6432.38s)]
*  But I learned this is where I learned about you know you're talking about the the [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6436.22s)]
*  penile gland and this is how I learned about this access and I learned it through [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6441.06s)]
*  communities that are associated with this study. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6446.34s)]
*  So I've learned about human potential and I think that that's probably what's impacted [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6449.26s)]
*  me more than anything in and I also learned about structural evil in societies and how [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6453.98s)]
*  has it been for me. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6461.46s)]
*  I think it's been great. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6462.62s)]
*  Really. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6464.74s)]
*  Yeah I mean I thought about it the other day because I because there were times when I [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6465.1s)]
*  said I don't want to do this anymore and I think that I thought you know I think the [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6469.66s)]
*  bad times have been worth it. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6475.66s)]
*  The scary parts have been worth it. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6478.7s)]
*  Because I went into this wanting to know right. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6482.14s)]
*  I'm a professor of religion. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6487.54s)]
*  I mean I want to know. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6489.22s)]
*  And I wanted to be a professor of religion since I was 11. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6490.18s)]
*  And yeah and now I am. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6493.860000000001s)]
*  That's cool to know what you want to do when you're 11. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6495.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah it was pretty weird. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6498.5s)]
*  But I knew. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6501.1s)]
*  And now I feel like I'm getting answers. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6502.02s)]
*  And it's not like I know conclusively part of it is that we're not meant to know is [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6505.22s)]
*  that part of it is that it is a mystery. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6511.5s)]
*  But the but it's a fascinating one. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6513.9800000000005s)]
*  It's almost like I'm a professor of religion. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6515.780000000001s)]
*  But it's a fascinating one. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6518.18s)]
*  It's almost as if this for me you talked about obsession. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6519.54s)]
*  It's that like I do it in and of itself. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6523.740000000001s)]
*  I think it's fascinating. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6526.1s)]
*  I often struggle with the concept that the human mind is incapable of grasping the truth [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6528.34s)]
*  that even if it was presented to us we don't have the capability to truly incorporate it [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6534.5s)]
*  into our not just worldview but universe view life view existence view that it's it's [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6541.660000000001s)]
*  too baffling. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6547.98s)]
*  We're not quite ready yet. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6548.82s)]
*  It's like showing Australia Pythagoras a cell phone. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6550.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6553.86s)]
*  What the fuck is this. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6554.74s)]
*  What is this. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6556.459999999999s)]
*  We're not ready for it yet. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6557.0599999999995s)]
*  And I really wonder with the emergence of artificial intelligence and what seems to me [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6558.299999999999s)]
*  at least to be the inevitable not just incorporation of it into our lives which has already [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6565.299999999999s)]
*  happened but incorporation into it biologically. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6570.9s)]
*  I feel like that is a step that we're taking that seems inevitable. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6574.820000000001s)]
*  That seems there is going to be some sort of convergence emerging of human consciousness [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6580.18s)]
*  and artificial. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6587.54s)]
*  It's I think artificial intelligence is the wrong term. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6589.06s)]
*  I don't think it's artificial at all. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6593.02s)]
*  I think it's a type of intelligence that's created by the human being and the human being [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6595.02s)]
*  is biologically hindered by the fact that biological evolution is so slow and technological [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6599.66s)]
*  evolution is so insanely rapid especially if sentient artificial intelligence becomes [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6607.22s)]
*  capable of creating its own version of artificial intelligence. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6614.58s)]
*  And it's not hindered by the biological limitations of the human mind. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6618.94s)]
*  You know I think Elon said it best and you talked about in this book that we're the [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6623.42s)]
*  biological bootloader for artificial intelligence. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6627.74s)]
*  I've described it before I heard that that we are we're a caterpillar that's creating [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6631.86s)]
*  a cocoon to give birth to the electronic butterfly and that this is also what fuels not [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6638.66s)]
*  just innovation but materialism. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6645.26s)]
*  Materialism is inexorably connected to innovation because one of the things about materialism [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6647.66s)]
*  is everybody wants to do his latest greatest thing and status is attached to those things. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6652.74s)]
*  We buy new cell phones like my friend had an iPhone. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6656.82s)]
*  My friend's hilarious. My friend Eddie Bravo. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6661.179999999999s)]
*  He had an iPhone 13 and I go why did you get 30 because they gave it to me for free. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6663.259999999999s)]
*  And I was like didn't you want a 15. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6667.46s)]
*  He's like doesn't do the same thing. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6669.34s)]
*  I'm like it really does. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6671.78s)]
*  But I wanted a 15 when it came out. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6673.0199999999995s)]
*  I have zero difference between my 15 and my 14. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6674.62s)]
*  I had to get the 15. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6678.66s)]
*  You know it's like there's something connected to us that wants the latest greatest and we [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6680.3s)]
*  are connected to this idea of materialism. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6685.7s)]
*  And if you looked at the human being as an organism and you were separate from it and [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6688.54s)]
*  you said well what does this thing do. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6693.58s)]
*  Well this thing makes better things constantly. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6695.0599999999995s)]
*  That's all it does. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6697.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what it does. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6698.099999999999s)]
*  It does a lot of other stuff. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6698.86s)]
*  Yeah yeah it does a lot of other stuff. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6700.0599999999995s)]
*  But it makes better things. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6702.139999999999s)]
*  But even the better things it does like when wars to control resources. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6703.099999999999s)]
*  Why do they want resources so they can make better things. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6709.78s)]
*  It's all about better things. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6712.54s)]
*  It's all about more control so that they have more access to more materials to more more [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6714.5s)]
*  better things. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6720.18s)]
*  And that that always if you're dealing with intelligence and you're dealing with [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6721.54s)]
*  technological evolution and technological innovation it's going to lead to artificial [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6728.34s)]
*  life or a life a new kind of life a new kind of life. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6732.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6736.42s)]
*  And that might be the kind of life that literally becomes a god. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6736.9400000000005s)]
*  If you think about it continues to get like there's I was looking at this this video that [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6742.34s)]
*  was on YouTube that was showing the stages of artificial intelligence and that there's [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6749.06s)]
*  these multiple stages artificial and the general intelligence sentient general intelligence [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6754.58s)]
*  and then it goes to godlike artificial intelligence. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6759.62s)]
*  But that is is that what God is and is that what we're doing. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6763.62s)]
*  Are we making God of God made us in his own image. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6768.14s)]
*  Are we making God. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6770.66s)]
*  Is that what this whole thing is about. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6772.26s)]
*  Well you know it's these are some of the questions that I have when I go back to looking [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6774.1s)]
*  at some of the characteristics of these like the Virgin Mary sightings and things like [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6778.26s)]
*  that. Like we now have technologies that can replicate what it seems like was happening [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6782.7s)]
*  during that event. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6789.0199999999995s)]
*  You know like in Garibandal in Spain in the 1960s. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6790.3s)]
*  And if that's the case then it looks like Stephen's idea of the intelligence principles [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6794.46s)]
*  is correct when he says that there will be intelligent beings that will appear like [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6799.02s)]
*  deities to us. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6804.9800000000005s)]
*  Which makes sense. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6808.14s)]
*  Yeah. And he also says you know and I don't know if you've gotten to the chapter on Simone [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6808.9800000000005s)]
*  in the book but she's a quantum AI person and she's she talks about UFOs and and she [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6813.9800000000005s)]
*  hates the word artificial intelligence. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6822.34s)]
*  She says it's completely we don't like make a painting and then say see this artificial. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6824.62s)]
*  You know we don't do that. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6830.14s)]
*  So why are we call it why. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6831.22s)]
*  It's because she says we're afraid of it. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6832.26s)]
*  You know we're afraid that it's going to be sentient and we're afraid. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6833.900000000001s)]
*  You know she said but it's just another life form that's that we happen to be doing the [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6837.3s)]
*  creating. Yes. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6841.9400000000005s)]
*  And she says it's special in that way but it's also going to free us in many many ways. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6843.1s)]
*  She's a tech optimist. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6850.02s)]
*  She's an accelerationist. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6851.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6852.7s)]
*  Well I hope she's right. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6853.66s)]
*  Because she's having you right. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6856.5s)]
*  Yeah. It's happening no matter what. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6857.74s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean I think if you could go back again to Australia Pythagoras and say hey [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6859.34s)]
*  man one day you're going to be wrought with anxiety because his existential angst and [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6863.42s)]
*  you're going to be on antidepressants and living in a cubicle all day and doing but [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6867.94s)]
*  that's the future. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6872.14s)]
*  It's progress. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6873.0599999999995s)]
*  Like fuck that. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6873.7s)]
*  I'd rather hang out here in the savanna. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6875.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6876.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6877.62s)]
*  I think it's in this inevitable part of the process of whatever we're going through [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6878.62s)]
*  because we're not in a static state. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6884.219999999999s)]
*  We're in a constant state. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6886.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6888.0199999999995s)]
*  Social upheaval cultural upheaval a change of perspectives is constant battle to try [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6888.7s)]
*  to define things and to figure out what's appropriate and inappropriate and gaslighting [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6894.66s)]
*  people who disagree with you which is also fascinating just to watch people do that. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6899.54s)]
*  It's fascinating to watch people try to put a positive spin on inherently evil things. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6905.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6910.74s)]
*  It's pretty terrible. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6910.94s)]
*  It's really horrible. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6911.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6912.9s)]
*  It's a bad show. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6913.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6914.58s)]
*  It's a weird show. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6915.0199999999995s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6916.58s)]
*  It's a weird show. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6917.259999999999s)]
*  But again I do have this internal struggle with this concept of good and evil that [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6917.98s)]
*  perhaps the negative aspects are there to enlighten us and to let us know that our work [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6926.139999999999s)]
*  is not done and that we have to move into a direction that we know is just and good [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6933.38s)]
*  and correct and loving and that this is possible within small groups of people. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6939.9400000000005s)]
*  It's possible with individuals and ultimately must be possible with the collective. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6946.7s)]
*  It just has to be managed in some way or facilitated in some way and that there it's [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6951.9800000000005s)]
*  not guaranteed. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6957.58s)]
*  And then if you look at World War II and look at the Holocaust you look at the horrific [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6959.34s)]
*  things that human beings are capable of when they're allowed to just run rampant. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6963.46s)]
*  You talked about the Japanese horrors during World War II like the rape and nanking. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6969.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6973.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6973.9800000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6974.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6974.9400000000005s)]
*  I remember reading that going how are human beings capable of doing this. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6975.46s)]
*  How are people savagery. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6980.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6981.5s)]
*  Unbelievable bizarre bizarre in its cruelty. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6981.9800000000005s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6985.900000000001s)]
*  Horrific. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6986.34s)]
*  And that seems to be evil. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6987.620000000001s)]
*  That seems to be evil personified. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6991.54s)]
*  I think so. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6993.46s)]
*  But I mean I'm not afraid to say it is a thing. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6994.1s)]
*  Evil is a real thing. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6996.820000000001s)]
*  Like evil is real. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6998.18s)]
*  That's I mean as a professor you know teaching my students I'm not going to say oh yeah [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=6999.620000000001s)]
*  evil is real. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7004.1s)]
*  But here I'm going to say and I've said this on podcast you can't say that human [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7005.06s)]
*  trafficking is not evil. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7009.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7010.820000000001s)]
*  That's evil. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7011.14s)]
*  Evil. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7012.18s)]
*  And let's just call it for what it is. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7013.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7014.740000000001s)]
*  Human medical experiments on children. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7015.219999999999s)]
*  It's evil. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7017.099999999999s)]
*  Evil. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7017.54s)]
*  Evil. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7018.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7018.54s)]
*  And we do it and we do it almost specifically for profit. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7019.459999999999s)]
*  Always. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7024.179999999999s)]
*  Which is also evil. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7024.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7025.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7026.099999999999s)]
*  So so back to the allegory the cave in the play dough. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7027.219999999999s)]
*  So he's dealing with these questions of it doesn't call it justice but calls it [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7031.179999999999s)]
*  injustice. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7036.62s)]
*  I mean he doesn't call it evil. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7037.179999999999s)]
*  So I guess what I'm trying to say is my position at this point after doing the [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7038.74s)]
*  study of this kind of thing is that it's the development of this this mystic state [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7043.38s)]
*  that we've been talking about that I think we need to. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7051.26s)]
*  This is how we need to counter because we can't decide these are the rules we're [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7054.62s)]
*  going to follow. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7060.06s)]
*  People aren't going to follow those rules or they're going to follow those rules and [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7060.9800000000005s)]
*  cheat right. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7063.78s)]
*  Or they're going to pretend to follow the rules. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7065.06s)]
*  But if people actually engaged in the type of thing that we were talking about the [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7067.62s)]
*  thing they love you know that allows then perhaps justice emerges. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7073.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7078.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7078.9s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to point out to people that with we these these ideas have been [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7079.3s)]
*  around for a long time. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7084.9s)]
*  They're not new ideas but we've never actually done them like you know small groups [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7086.54s)]
*  have done them. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7091.46s)]
*  So when you're alone with your thoughts and you've been studying this for a long time [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7092.66s)]
*  now what do you think the UFO phenomenon is. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7097.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7104.0599999999995s)]
*  So I think first of all that there are a lot of different varieties of it. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7104.459999999999s)]
*  But when we look at like we were looking at the Francis of Assisi and the kind of [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7108.139999999999s)]
*  historical things and the abductions and things like that. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7113.7s)]
*  I think that that it's been around for a long time and that these are things that are [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7117.3s)]
*  in communication with us. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7127.94s)]
*  So I used what I do in my book both the books that I wrote about this is I go I talk to [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7129.26s)]
*  people who I think represent thousands of people. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7136.78s)]
*  So each person in the book represents thousands if not more maybe many thousands of [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7139.62s)]
*  people who have had experiences and the ways in which they interpret them. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7145.06s)]
*  So all of the people seem to have had experiences where now what they want to do is [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7150.1s)]
*  they actually want to work for justice in different ways like Jose the veteran in my [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7155.38s)]
*  book. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7160.38s)]
*  He's working with young people and helping them deal with being addicted to social [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7160.9800000000005s)]
*  media and things like that and helping them get through life which is really hard [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7166.38s)]
*  right now. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7169.34s)]
*  And that's what he's doing. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7170.26s)]
*  And then you look at Dr. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7172.580000000001s)]
*  Whiteley. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7173.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7174.3s)]
*  So she's she's working in a space where she's trying to help people deal with the fact [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7174.62s)]
*  that they're seeing things that you know that could down planes and things like that. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7179.46s)]
*  She's helping people talk about that. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7184.46s)]
*  She's helping people. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7186.34s)]
*  Each person in you know is somehow doing what I'm suggesting that I think is an out [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7188.62s)]
*  this kind of structural injustice that we see. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7195.5s)]
*  So I think that this is a transformational thing without the drugs is what's going on [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7198.34s)]
*  like some kind of massive experience that people are having. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7203.38s)]
*  And now it's getting out and people are being able to talk to each other through Reddit [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7209.7s)]
*  communities and you know different types of social media. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7213.9400000000005s)]
*  So it is it's it's we did see you know religions when they begin they become viral at [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7217.14s)]
*  one point. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7224.14s)]
*  We've never seen it in an age where we have digital technology but this is what we're [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7225.18s)]
*  seeing now. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7229.18s)]
*  What do you think the physical objects are. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7230.5s)]
*  Well OK so this is something that's very interesting. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7233.58s)]
*  We just looked at the strata of Turin. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7236.26s)]
*  I believe that there are these I would call them and this is just my own non scientific [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7238.42s)]
*  term interdimensional objects. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7245.34s)]
*  They're objects that have characteristics of our dimension and some other dimension. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7249.34s)]
*  So some other dimension has the capability or something from some other dimension has [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7255.74s)]
*  the capability of transporting a physical object into our realm or even imprinting onto [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7263.54s)]
*  a physical object. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7271.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7273.5s)]
*  How so. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7273.98s)]
*  Well I don't know. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7274.7s)]
*  I mean I think that's what does it mean imprinting on with the strata of Turin. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7275.74s)]
*  We see the imprint of you know the image and if it's real. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7280.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah if it's real. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7283.26s)]
*  But it's an anomalous object. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7284.42s)]
*  So we do have from Gary Nolan engineered objects that we don't know how they're [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7286.3s)]
*  engineered but they definitely look like they're you know it's it's off planet. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7291.740000000001s)]
*  I would call the kinds of things that we see in the historical record interdimensional [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7298.58s)]
*  types of things. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7302.46s)]
*  Now how. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7303.66s)]
*  I don't know Joe. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7304.42s)]
*  OK so I just don't know but I do think that scientists in the government know that [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7305.62s)]
*  scientists in the government know that these things exist and they would like to figure [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7311.58s)]
*  it out. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7315.86s)]
*  And so part of disclosure the disclosure movement is outsourcing this and trying to [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7316.3s)]
*  get as many people as possible to to help in figuring it out. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7321.74s)]
*  What do you think when they use the term donations. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7326.74s)]
*  What do you think the purpose of that is. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7331.9s)]
*  If there is an object that is purposely released into our you know like I'm sure [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7334.26s)]
*  you're aware of cargo cults. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7340.7s)]
*  So with cargo cults for people that don't know there's been some islands during World [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7342.86s)]
*  War One and World War Two where planes landed there and they left and these people [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7347.7s)]
*  they created these statues of these planes and they worshiped them and they wanted them [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7354.34s)]
*  to come back. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7361.86s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7362.38s)]
*  Yeah because they got food and all kinds of wonderful things from the plane. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7362.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7366.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7366.94s)]
*  They thought of them as thought of them as deities. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7367.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7370.0599999999995s)]
*  The same way we would think of something from somewhere else. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7370.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7374.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7375.02s)]
*  So yeah that in my field has been called the cargo cult the UFO cargo cult. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7375.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7381.06s)]
*  And obviously Tyler and James view these parts as as donate. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7381.74s)]
*  They called it the donation site. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7387.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7389.34s)]
*  So giving it the idea that just one theory. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7389.82s)]
*  Yeah that's just one theory. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7393.74s)]
*  Are there other theories that there's a biological organism that encounters a [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7395.14s)]
*  lightning storm and it actually crashes and there's physical bodies. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7398.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7402.46s)]
*  There is that. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7403.42s)]
*  Yeah there's that. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7404.14s)]
*  What's your take on that because that's one of the things that Grush talked about and [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7405.3s)]
*  some of the other people talked about that there there are biological things that have [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7409.14s)]
*  been recovered. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7413.9s)]
*  Well what impressed me about the way about what he said was that he used the term [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7415.3s)]
*  biologics and I actually know that term because that's the same term that Tyler was [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7420.62s)]
*  talking about when he was creating materials in anti-gravity spaces on on space [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7425.1s)]
*  shuttles and such. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7431.42s)]
*  So I was wondering because David Grush does get his information from people in [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7432.5s)]
*  allegedly in the programs but he's never seen these materials that I know of. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7438.46s)]
*  I think he has some firsthand experience that he was not able to talk about. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7443.22s)]
*  OK. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7447.860000000001s)]
*  That he's alluding to. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7448.22s)]
*  OK. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7449.46s)]
*  I think but this is a this is recent and he's been very careful about how he releases [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7450.7s)]
*  this information and what he's able to release and not able to release. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7456.82s)]
*  And that I was like OK. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7461.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7463.94s)]
*  So I mean I've not seen any any bodies nor have I seen intact craft but I also have [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7464.179999999999s)]
*  had now remember I don't have a clearance like he has so I can actually talk about what [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7472.74s)]
*  people have told me. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7476.9s)]
*  I have had people tell me that yes Diana there are intact craft. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7478.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7482.3s)]
*  I mean maybe. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7483.38s)]
*  So I don't know Joe. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7486.3s)]
*  Have you studied Bob Lazar. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7489.26s)]
*  OK. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7493.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes I have always asked about Bob Lazar. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7493.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7495.7s)]
*  And I don't know but I can tell you that people that I've met who are associated with [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7496.46s)]
*  the programs tell me that he's he's he's right. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7502.9s)]
*  Now I know his backgrounds and I know you know all the things I don't I don't have an [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7507.22s)]
*  opinion one way or the other. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7511.860000000001s)]
*  But I can also say that a lot of times people with very disturbing backgrounds you know [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7513.54s)]
*  who could be easily discredited are given information and shown things and told things. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7520.9400000000005s)]
*  Well I would think that that's sort of like a little escape clause. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7526.54s)]
*  Yeah I think so. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7529.5s)]
*  I think it is. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7530.3s)]
*  I mean the guy's obviously a genius and was obviously a propulsion expert and put a [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7531.42s)]
*  fucking jet engine on a Honda in the 1980s. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7535.9s)]
*  He's a fascinating guy. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7539.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7542.46s)]
*  And you know he claims that there's some element some element that exists in other places [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7543.339999999999s)]
*  in the universe which leads me to believe. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7550.62s)]
*  Well not even to believe but like so here's the question. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7554.42s)]
*  Are some of these things from other planets. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7559.219999999999s)]
*  Is that also in the equation. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7562.299999999999s)]
*  I mean just because something is traveling inter-dimensionally we do know that there [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7564.22s)]
*  are an infinite number of planets in the universe. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7570.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean we have no idea how many of them are capable of supporting human like life or some [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7574.9800000000005s)]
*  other kind of life or an infinite number of varieties of life. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7581.46s)]
*  And if that life can do what we've done and get to some part of its progression where it's [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7587.1s)]
*  capable of creating what we're calling artificial intelligence or super advanced [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7593.82s)]
*  technology. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7598.9s)]
*  Why wouldn't it come here. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7600.42s)]
*  Yes I have. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7602.46s)]
*  I'm not just I'm not discounting it. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7603.7s)]
*  So that could be there. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7606.7s)]
*  I think so especially because of the ways in which the materials are being manufactured [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7607.66s)]
*  off planet like the ones that we just saw that you know and that was information when [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7613.98s)]
*  I met Tyler 2014 and now it's a full on thing that's happening. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7620.74s)]
*  Right. So it's it's a supercharged program of creating things that will help us off planet. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7625.82s)]
*  I mean certainly then. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7632.9s)]
*  Yeah I think so. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7636.099999999999s)]
*  I mean but I don't know. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7637.139999999999s)]
*  Right. So I have to just be honest. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7638.98s)]
*  So it might be a bunch of different things happening all at the same time inter-dimensionally [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7640.78s)]
*  extraterrestrially something from a distant galaxy that's figured out some new method of [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7646.58s)]
*  propulsion that's beyond our imagination that can visit and then also things that are coming [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7653.339999999999s)]
*  here from other dimensions. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7658.82s)]
*  Yes. And even recently somebody had you know. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7661.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well I can't say anything. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7665.5s)]
*  I can't say I'm sorry. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7667.339999999999s)]
*  I don't want to be that person that goes on your show and says I can't say that. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7668.86s)]
*  But I probably most likely there are if there's crash retrieval part you know crash retrievals [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7673.0199999999995s)]
*  here on Earth perhaps there are in space as well. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7681.66s)]
*  Do you when they talk about inventions that emerged post Roswell that's one of the points [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7687.9s)]
*  of speculation is that we have back engineered something and that this led to the creation of [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7697.0199999999995s)]
*  fiber optics and a lot of other technologies that seem to emerge after that time. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7703.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Part. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7709.179999999999s)]
*  So this question was prominent in my mind in 2012 when I met Jacques Valle. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7711.339999999999s)]
*  So I was already aware of his work even as a person who hadn't studied UFOs or even believed [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7717.299999999999s)]
*  in them Jacques Valle is just one of these people right that you come across his work and he's [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7723.62s)]
*  fascinating. So I thought it was strange that not only was he a person who was you know pre [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7728.0599999999995s)]
*  engineered ARPANET right. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7736.9s)]
*  He was on ARPANET which is pre internet. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7738.5s)]
*  He's creating that at the same time as being obsessed with UFOs and doing you know being a [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7740.78s)]
*  ufologist. These things seemed that they had to be together right. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7746.78s)]
*  There's something that you know what's going on here. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7752.46s)]
*  So and I'm in touch with him often and he says a lot of things that are rather cryptic but sometimes [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7755.780000000001s)]
*  I ask him specifically was was what you were doing on ARPANET related to back engineered UFO [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7765.06s)]
*  parts and then he'd say something like there are many secrets in Silicon Valley something like that. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7775.18s)]
*  Yeah yeah he's real cryptic. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7782.3s)]
*  He's kind of difficult to have a conversation with publicly. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7784.660000000001s)]
*  Well it does have a lot I guess there are lots of secrets in Silicon Valley of course which is [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7788.900000000001s)]
*  where he lives. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7793.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7793.9400000000005s)]
*  Another thing that was really fascinating about your book was you're talking about how much [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7795.46s)]
*  religion he studied. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7799.38s)]
*  Yes yes that was really interesting. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7801.14s)]
*  So in the book what I do is I uncover not just him but Alan Hynek. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7804.38s)]
*  They were friends and they were both Rosicrucians which is a form of he might not like me to say [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7808.98s)]
*  this but it's a form of mystical Christianity in a sense but a lot of Rosicrucians don't view their [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7816.54s)]
*  roots as Christian. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7822.74s)]
*  They look at it as Egyptian but it's basically it's an esoteric tradition and it involves [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7824.0599999999995s)]
*  meditation. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7832.219999999999s)]
*  I think it most likely involves this thing that you and I've been discussing in this the whole [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7832.9s)]
*  talk so far is the pineal gland thing you know the the access point because both of them believe [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7837.42s)]
*  in this kind of life this meditating and things like that. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7844.86s)]
*  And so I included references everything I say in my books by the way I pass to the person that I'm [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7849.1s)]
*  writing the chapter about. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7855.22s)]
*  So everything that I said about Jacques I gave it to him beforehand and I said are you OK with me [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7856.58s)]
*  saying this publicly. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7862.18s)]
*  And so it passed all the tests. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7863.62s)]
*  And I also talk about going to his apartment and seeing his library which is an amazing library. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7867.82s)]
*  He has stained glass from Chartres Cathedral in Chartres Cathedral is a special place for [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7875.1s)]
*  Rosicrucians like a special place of presence of the sacred. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7881.46s)]
*  And he actually did those himself. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7886.7s)]
*  So he learned how to do stained glass from people at Chartres by the way. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7888.38s)]
*  And yeah just amazing. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7892.66s)]
*  And he had a lot of books on angels and fallen angels in that library like almost like it was almost [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7894.62s)]
*  like going into the Vatican Archive going into this place because these looked like first [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7902.06s)]
*  editions or close. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7906.66s)]
*  So you know really really old books about this topic. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7908.38s)]
*  Fallen angels. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7911.66s)]
*  Yeah I was pretty shocked when I had when I went I was we were going to have lunch and talk about the [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7912.66s)]
*  crash site and maybe talk about you know what I learned from Tyler and that kind of thing. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7918.94s)]
*  And we went to lunch and then he said do you want to see the library. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7922.9s)]
*  And I was like yes of course. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7925.74s)]
*  So I saw the handwritten documents from Project Blue Book and that was just going into the [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7927.099999999999s)]
*  library that wasn't actually in the library. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7934.259999999999s)]
*  Then when we got in there I noticed a big bookcases of these books and of course I was drawn [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7935.62s)]
*  to them. And he said he picked out one and he opened it and it was about angels and he said this [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7943.139999999999s)]
*  is the you know this is a book about angels and I could see that. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7947.94s)]
*  I was looking at it. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7950.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7951.54s)]
*  And then I looked at the other bookshelf and that bookshelf was just as impressive. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7952.42s)]
*  And then it was about fallen angels. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7956.42s)]
*  He said oh this one's about fallen angels. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7958.42s)]
*  And then he made a joke and he said you can't have one without the other. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7960.0199999999995s)]
*  And I thought that yeah I thought that was really interesting. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7963.62s)]
*  That does seem to align with what we're talking about with like the struggle of good and evil. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7966.82s)]
*  It does. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7972.299999999999s)]
*  That's what he said too. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7973.46s)]
*  And I was actually shocked at that point. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7974.54s)]
*  I was like wow. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7977.46s)]
*  So just you know I'm a professor of religion you know so I'm like I'm right about you know my [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7978.94s)]
*  intuition was somehow confirmed. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7983.9800000000005s)]
*  And by the way I think people I think this should be I'm not sure if this is totally true but I [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7987.22s)]
*  believe he was the inspiration for the French character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7992.54s)]
*  I think so. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7997.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7998.06s)]
*  Which makes sense. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=7998.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8000.22s)]
*  Because Hynix in there and then there's him. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8001.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8003.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8003.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8003.9800000000005s)]
*  It's wild stuff. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8004.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8007.66s)]
*  What do you make of the reports of this craft that's supposedly 40 feet long and you get inside [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8008.74s)]
*  of it and it's as big as a football field. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8014.82s)]
*  Oh oh that one. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8016.74s)]
*  OK. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8017.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8017.82s)]
*  So the time dimensions. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8018.18s)]
*  And OK so people I know who do the work and are physicists they describe this in quantum [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8019.54s)]
*  language which I cannot replicate at all. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8026.38s)]
*  But this is how they're describing it. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8030.22s)]
*  They're saying that the. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8031.78s)]
*  And by the way it's really interesting that you know when I'm doing my research into the [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8033.54s)]
*  Catholic history and I'm looking at some of the things that we can do now technologically [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8038.179999999999s)]
*  that it looks very you know like people back then were like this is a miracle right. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8042.5s)]
*  OK. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8047.26s)]
*  So what they're doing is a similar type of process or method. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8047.82s)]
*  So basically what they're doing is they're looking at people's descriptions and data of [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8052.62s)]
*  craft right. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8058.94s)]
*  And they're then identifying the patterns and they're saying if there was a quantum field [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8060.700000000001s)]
*  this would make perfect sense. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8065.900000000001s)]
*  So if this was occurring in a quantum field this would make sense that this thing would [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8068.18s)]
*  look small on the outside and go in and it's immense. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8073.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8076.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8076.860000000001s)]
*  Why do you think this information is getting released. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8078.900000000001s)]
*  Why do you think it's becoming a more mainstream acceptable thing to discuss because to the [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8082.3s)]
*  average person that sees this the thought I think sort of naturally goes to this idea [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8089.58s)]
*  that some sort of contact is inevitable some sort of revelation some sort of landing on [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8097.1s)]
*  the White House lawn type deal. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8104.14s)]
*  OK. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8107.38s)]
*  I have a couple of thoughts on that. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8108.58s)]
*  The first one is that part of the reason is because China is now in space. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8110.42s)]
*  So before it was us in Russia. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8118.22s)]
*  We were the only ones we were together actually. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8120.9s)]
*  So you know we were aligned even though at many points were enemies on Earth in space. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8124.26s)]
*  We weren't enemies we were working together using each other's equipment. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8130.3s)]
*  So also keeping the secrets that perhaps we're seeing in space. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8133.66s)]
*  But now that other countries are going into space whatever is up there will be known. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8137.94s)]
*  And I think part of it has to do with this phenomenon. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8143.7s)]
*  And so that's why it's urgent to get this message out. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8147.54s)]
*  That's that's one of my ideas. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8153.1s)]
*  Another. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8157.3s)]
*  Well I have some other ideas but that's the one that's most prominent is because I just [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8158.14s)]
*  don't think that it's going to be a secret for very much longer. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8162.06s)]
*  And in fact right now a lot you know Chinese are you know they are going into space and [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8166.1s)]
*  they are like you know looking at things and. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8171.42s)]
*  So from a national security standpoint it's important to sort of move this conversation [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8175.26s)]
*  further. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8180.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8181.22s)]
*  Accelerate it. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8181.42s)]
*  I think so. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8182.06s)]
*  Are you hopeful. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8186.18s)]
*  With all this information that you have. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8188.62s)]
*  Are you hopeful about the direction that the world is going. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8191.62s)]
*  I would say that I'm simultaneously hopeful. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8196.9s)]
*  And horrified. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8200.9s)]
*  OK. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XphFGuORY&t=8204.58s)]
