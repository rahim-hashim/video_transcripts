# Joe Rogan Experience #1401 - Iliza Shlesinger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 16, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZamJraVSxo)
*  And the first sound is a slurp.
*  Hello Eliza. It's a cozy morning. What's going on my friend? It is kind of cozy, right? For California
*  It's like a little chill in the air makes you feel like there's real weather here. It does like we're in a normal place
*  Yeah, normal place. With normal people. Like where things change like you get a winter and a summer and a spring
*  Yeah, we get a slight chill and we're like, oh my god, it's real. With the season changing though
*  Nobody ages like it's still that perennial somewhere between 20 to 45 year old nobody ages
*  What do you mean? Everybody in LA like there's like this nebulous age where it's like
*  Behavior wise and everything like you're somewhere between 25 and 45 and then on either side of that
*  You're too old or too young but like everybody is this kind of like just you can act like a child here
*  That's an interesting observation. It's totally true, right?
*  Because they don't have the responsibility of having to like shovel snow and prepare for the winter
*  And get up and scrape your windshield because there's ice on it or prepare for life
*  Like you could be like 40 a 45 year old dude and you're like I do improv and I have a roommate and girls are like
*  Awesome, like I really like awesome. Totally really what girls know that I know but yeah
*  No, you're fucking you think so other girls that are like that. That's what who's fucking other people that there's like a
*  You know, there's certain people that we know
*  Okay, let's say we know that we've run into
*  That are on this show business path and they are fucked and you know
*  They're like like a stampeding herd of buffalo that are headed for a cliff. Yeah, and there's no way out
*  you're not good you're either gonna get some kind of a job and you're gonna be bitter and angry or
*  You're you're just gonna keep doing this forever and it's never gonna happen. I feel like with comedy in particular
*  It's one of those careers where it's not even you fail up where you just fail laterally
*  Like comedy is one of those things where you can kind of just continue to exist in and around it despite actual talent
*  We all know the comics where it's like you're not dead yet. They're like no, I'm writing
*  Ads that go on the back of tickets. I'm writing commercial parodies for like comedy net like just
*  existing in
*  subdivisions of the realm of comedy and they think that they're in the game, but really they're in the parking lot
*  There's a weird ones that come to the store and they come to the improv and they hang out
*  But they don't really go up ever. I don't understand that
*  I don't understand the myth of the hang the idea is that you would be hanging if you don't know anyone you want
*  To meet some new friends or your friends are there
*  But I see people that just bob and weave and I'm like and they act like they're looking for someone
*  I'm like, there's no one there. You're just here hoping someone talks to you, but you've been doing this for so long
*  Go home write something. Yeah, but it's not gonna happen
*  I'm not coming. How many one of those things like I feel like you could learn how to play music
*  Someone can teach you how to move your fingers in the right direction
*  I mean you might never be Jimi Hendrix you might never be some virtuoso who's like stands out
*  But you might get good at music if you could put the practice in could learn the math of it. Comedy's not that
*  My college Emerson College offers now offers out to Boston
*  Shout out whoo offers a comedy major and good luck with that, right?
*  I'm like you're either funny or you're not and you can learn what makes a script funny and you can learn about
*  Timing and things but you have it innately or you don't you know, I firmly believe that I do too and the amount of people
*  You know, you can't tell someone but there are plenty of people who aren't naturally funny that make a huge career
*  out of things, you know, cuz someone else unfunny finds them funny, but it's one of those things where
*  I'm not gonna be the one to tell you to give up on your dream
*  Like that's not my position to tell someone that but you're constantly surrounded by these like it's almost like this walking dead of unfunny
*  Like they're just at the shows and they're just there for decades of your life. Yeah, it's hard
*  Sometimes they'll ask me to get on the podcast too. I'm like what what are you saying? What do you say?
*  I don't know. You don't you say no. No, you're very good. I remember watching you. I've told you this before
*  We were at the store one time and there's this um, cuz you're so
*  Alpha like a proper and I say this to you every time I see like a proper definition of one and I think that
*  Like a real alpha male. It doesn't seek to disempower doesn't seek to make anybody else feel bad
*  Like you're just like this is what I do and I set my boundaries and we were in that back
*  Outside bar where only comics are allowed and this guy walked up to you
*  Do you remember this and he was a little bit in your space harmless?
*  He was like, oh Joe can I get a picture and you firm you were like you cannot be back here
*  You've got to go. Well, I saw him weasel through he came from the show and then went through the back kitchen area
*  And then went to it's happened a few times where people know that we hang out back there because we talk about on the podcast
*  We go back there to smoke and then all sudden they'll be like me and you know
*  Callan or whoever and you and comics just talking about the sets
*  Like are you doing Tripoli show like what's going on?
*  Stuff folks and then all sudden
*  Someone's right here. Hey, man. Hey, what's up? Hey, dude, can I get a picture? You're like you're not supposed to be back
*  Is that I don't know that it's like we all I put my foot down for certain things
*  And of course as you get older you get better about it, but I straight up
*  I don't know that I could say that to someone I
*  Allow people in my space and I think you kind of just tolerate it cuz you never know and there's that fear
*  Like what is this person? But you were very like you can't be here and the guy was like, oh so sorry
*  Well, I'm happy to take a picture with somebody but I knew that that guy had gotten into the employees area
*  He had weaseled his way back through. Yeah, I don't yeah, but you did that and I remember watching and I was like
*  You could do it the problem is with women like men get really fucking creepy
*  Men get really shitty with women if a woman says you can't be here, you know
*  Who knows you who knows what kind of a man you're dealing with we can bring I can I can speak to that
*  And I also remember I was on your podcast forever ago and
*  I had done this show and I brought up this thing
*  I get a lot of incels
*  Instagramming me about this because this guy came into our group was a group of women standing outside and he asked for a lighter
*  Oh, yeah, I remember this and all of the betas you got a lot of great fans, but on the fringe ones
*  They were like, oh don't ask her for a lighter
*  And I'm like tell you what when someone bigger and stronger than you that has the ability to hurt you comes into your personal space
*  Not really wanting a lighter wanting something else when your sensors go off make sure that you stay silent see how great you feel
*  I don't think there's any respect for the idea that like sometimes you feel scared and it's not like a cry wolf thing
*  Like I'm a tough chick. I don't walk around like afraid but everyone's in a while. Show me some knuckles
*  They're all bloated from vodka last night
*  I was like, yeah
*  You know the thing like someone can do it the right way like someone could say, excuse me
*  Do any of you ladies have a lighter easily and that and then you can say no, sorry, we don't smoke. Okay, cool
*  Thank you
*  But I've had it happen where somebody they put their energy and they get in that they're like who has a lighter and you're like
*  I don't think what you want is a lighter
*  And I stand by that decision
*  It's all the context. I think so, but it's so it's a technicality, right?
*  And it's like okay, so if you want to have white power night at the Laugh Factory
*  You just have to cut Jamie a check. So we're gonna take over the place. I think my biggest issue will be cutting Jamie a check
*  I do it
*  But I also know you listen we have white power night love to have you in but you're not white power white powder open mic night
*  There are no jokes
*  Everyone is fully erect buddy. Everybody already did you did see Kyle? You can't do see how have you been banned from there?
*  No, okay, cuz I was yeah. I know yeah, but well, I was your first guest on your podcast that you were doing out of there
*  I know and you were and that was so cool of you because it was a podcast
*  There's no money in it. There was you know, but you were a friend
*  Like I didn't get any like it was a dinky podcast run in the attic of the Laugh Factory
*  And when you decided to leave the Laugh Factory as a venue for your podcast you wanted to expand
*  Jamie said buddy you can no longer do your seek higher in my club to the two Jews. Yeah
*  Yelled at me and
*  This was four years ago. He yelled. I I was offered my podcast
*  This is an old podcast to run it out of the improv and so I called Jamie and I said I
*  Got offered my podcast somewhere else and I'm gonna take it there
*  I just wanted to respect it set up a whole podcast studio the impromptu. Yes. Yeah, they set it up
*  They're like come over here. We'll get you advertisers. Well, it will produce this the Laugh Factory
*  They would put it up, but that was it. There was no
*  Business behind it and I was fine with that. I wasn't trying to make money and brought us me over there
*  I go. Okay, great. So man to man I called Jamie
*  I just want to say you know, man to man man to man. I talked to him like a man
*  Well, I called him up and I said listen fucker. No, I just said hey
*  I just want to let you know
*  I've been offered to take my podcast somewhere else and I'm gonna take that opportunity and I just want to give you the respect
*  Of telling you versus just leaving
*  Absolutely. No problem your family really and by the way, I said no problem. Mm-hmm. That's why this is so insane
*  No problem your family go ahead I'm making them some Russian
*  But it's like a weird accent anyway, so I go and keep in mind I was like the
*  Textbook picture employee there like I'm one of three women that perform there regularly at the time like headlining women
*  I baked cookies for the waitresses
*  I would bust my hump to get there cuz there there's times where I was written in stone like it's 845. Can I get 850?
*  I'm running. No, this is the time like I was I never ran the light like I was really respectful and
*  Like an hour later, he calls me yelling at me
*  You did not say you are taking your podcast to levity
*  Which is the governing for those of you know body that owns a lot of the improvs and they're a huge thing
*  We told you told me you're going to the improv. I just said I'm taking it elsewhere
*  It didn't it didn't occur to me it to say it but it also levity so big
*  It's like I didn't even think oh, it's a competing thing
*  I think of the factory is a couple of clubs and levity is more of like an enterprise
*  Yeah, plus I don't play my factory clumps right
*  It's just yelling at me acting like I did this duplicitous thing. He hangs up on me hangs up on me grown man
*  And I go on the website that night. My name is taken down off all the shows
*  I'm pretty sure he removed my face from that mosaic of comics outside. I am persona non grata and
*  So did I ever tell you the conclusion of this no
*  It really hurt my feelings really and I'm the kind of person if you shut a door in my face
*  I will nail it closed. Oh and
*  I call the lab factory and all the girls that are working there and I said why didn't anyone like we're all cool
*  Like did no one even stand up for me?
*  Like I didn't really do anything wrong and this one girl goes, you know, he's just really stressed
*  A lot of people are leaving the production office
*  So I think he's stressed cuz a lot of employees are leaving and I go who's left and she said this one girl
*  Who doesn't matter the name said this one girl and I go, okay
*  Give me her number and I called her and I said hi
*  It's Eliza cuz she worked on my podcast and I was like I will give you
*  X amount of money if you walk out of the lab factory today and come work for me
*  And it was like a chunk of cash and she was and I was like I need the answer by noon
*  I'll be at Kings Road Cafe. There was no reason to put a clock on it
*  I was just feeling really he put a power mug down and
*  That's who's sitting in our lobby now. She's been my assistant for four years. I
*  Rescued her. She's my angel my heartbeat and
*  Only recently were they like she can come back because my face is on the side of the fucking building
*  Oh, you can come back now. Yeah, do you come back? I went I did one show back. Did you?
*  Did you see Jamie? No, I said I said I go I he doesn't need to apologize
*  But I'm walking in with my head held high and I'm doing my set. I'm not like everybody was super cool
*  He's not there because he farms it out now to other bookers
*  Yeah, did he put your video up on YouTube that he filmed your set. I told knowledge. I told Brian monarch
*  I go I'm going because I'm I'm doing another show there, too
*  I go I'm going if you film me I will have a Kramer
*  Moment like I will flip out on you in an epic way
*  Like it is it is a non-negotiable thing. So they said no, I talked to Bill about this
*  He goes, nah, they don't do that. If you ask them, they don't put your video up. I go. Yeah, I go look for your videos
*  We're in the fucking green room of the ice house and he goes what the fuck
*  Well, it doesn't matter I mean Chappelle that's one of the reason why Chappelle won't go there
*  Yeah, he went there just to work out and they this is when he was not doing shows and not doing specials and they put
*  All his shit online. No not asking him. No nothing. I think that they the I'm I think they've got like new management there
*  Whatever, but like it's trickled down from the top. Oh, there's no way anybody's like just
*  Recording people on their own and putting it on the on the fucking internet
*  No, they know that it's not cool and they're doing it. Anyway, I also yeah
*  It's uh for people don't know like how comedy works
*  We need to work out like if Eliza comes up with a bit tonight and and and works on it tonight
*  That's if someone records it and films it and puts it online
*  That bit's fucked because that bit's not done that bits a baby you're being judged on that bit
*  It would be like anything if you were an athlete and you went to a workout and they're like, well, you can't make the team
*  You're like, well, I'm still working out. I'm not I'm gonna get bigger
*  It's not even just that like eating a half baked cake. It's yeah
*  It's it's just in the premise is cooked like you fucked the premise up. It's now it's like it's out there
*  Yeah, it's tricky because we we rely on live audiences and you know, thankfully
*  Most of the vast majority of people that come to comedy clubs particularly in LA are really cool
*  Like we have no problems with this. It's not an issue
*  But this is a thing that we need, you know
*  We need and because everyone has a recording device now
*  It needs to be like difficult to bring a recording device into a comedy club now
*  Everyone has them by default on their own
*  My favorite thing is I understand if you're Dave Chappelle and you're like I need your phone zipped up because this is you know
*  Sacred material and these are you know, um, we all have our material that we need to make money off of some comics are bigger
*  Than others. My favorite is one shitty comics or like we need your phones taken away
*  I'm like nobody's checking for your act like nobody's taking your act unless you say something stupid
*  Yeah, there's that then they'll try to ruin your career with it should be a social contract the improv does that with every show?
*  I love that and by the way, I'm there this Friday night 1030 just announced it just just just put it up online
*  I'm also there this week, but I don't have my phone with me. I'm just doing 15 minutes
*  But I that to me I think it slows it down that at the improv
*  Yeah, um does slow I've never but it also more aware
*  They're just not checking their goddamn phone all the time
*  One of my favorite shows that ever did when I was doing that when I was when I prepare for my Netflix special the last
*  Couple months before I did all my shows with these phone backs. It gets to be a pain
*  Yeah, especially when you're doing giant places, but in Miami is the best because Miami
*  Everyone is doing coke and no one is paying attention to anything and they're all looking at their phones constantly
*  So you could look you could use your phone, but you got to leave the building to use your phone
*  So everyone was getting up and going out and coming down and coming in so during the show it was just constant
*  Oh my god. Oh my god in sitting down the only place at all the places
*  I did Miami was the only place where people were constantly getting up and sitting down not even aware that like you're doing a performance
*  Yeah, like we don't care. Well, Miami's just crazy. It's its own thing. Yeah, it's another country. It really is. It's wild
*  It's fun. It's great place to visit. I love Miami. I love the food. I love the people
*  I love the attitude down there, but it's just it's not the best place to perform. You said that to me in an airport once
*  I remember everything you say
*  You said that to me now. I feel bad for feeding it but we were in an airport and you were going to Miami
*  I was going somewhere else and you were like if you like something like
*  You want to start if you want to start to open a library in Miami open a bookstore open a bookstore because I remember
*  Thinking well, no one makes money. I'm a library
*  Open but you said that and I always remember you said that I've only played Miami proper once
*  But I always play like Fort Lauderdale and all the things around it
*  I used to do the improv with Joey Diaz we used to go down do that improv down there in Coconut Grove
*  Oh, it was a battleground
*  And I love Joel bash cough with all of my heart some of these like West Palm Beach
*  I'm there five sold out shows for Valentine's Day. Nobody's laughing
*  I'm like, why did you come like this tickets cost you and it's just and then people like oh we did love it
*  It's the weirdest you're pulling from the polar ends of every demographic to comprise a Florida audience
*  Well, they all escaped to Florida from somewhere else the people that are born and raised there
*  Like whoa that being said Tampa and Orlando fucking fire like awesome. Hmm
*  Maybe it was a lot of people visiting too. Yeah, Orlando is like maybe that's a Disneyland
*  Universal like that's a giant part of Orlando people that are visiting. Yeah, and I always liked Tampa
*  It was always cool. I
*  Remember playing the Jacksonville comedy zone. I like West Palm. I've always had a good time in West Palm
*  I had a good time because I made a lot of money and everybody was nice
*  But I remember thinking like this is like blood from a stone really it was like Valentine's Day weekend
*  I'm like a bunch of dudes a good drag there by their fucking wives
*  It's it's a I always make that joke
*  You're never in the room and like the or it'll be in the main room
*  And there's always dudes that you can tell the dudes that are there for Marc Maron and the dudes that are there for Rogan
*  Because there's like it's just a different time
*  There's two different types of dudes and I always make a joke like if something doesn't like I'm like every guy's like yeah
*  Where's Rogan? That's why I showed up. What's she doing here? Where's Rogan?
*  And they always laugh because they're like friendly apes, right?
*  They're friendly apes, but the you can tell the guys that are there for you
*  The guys are there for Marin you could tell because they're by themselves
*  I'm gonna say they're all in flannel. Did someone tell me they had he had like the highest
*  Number ever a single ticket sold in all these different venues. I always encourage like Marc of course you do
*  I love duck. We're both in a movie coming out together. Oh, yeah, what is it called Wonderland? It's a Mark Wahlberg
*  Winston Duke Peter Berg movie like you and Peter Berg are friends
*  Yeah, you guys are the same vibration and
*  We're in a movie together, and he plays a reporter and I play a
*  Love interest I'm reticent to say but he was great in the Joker. He's great. You that Joker movies
*  Oh, I always encourage people there was like you know you get a DM like I don't want to go to your show alone
*  I'm like come alone. It's a dark room
*  Nobody's gonna ever have fun and and you meet at least in my shows you make friends
*  Yeah, because people everybody wants to feel good. It's okay bring your dog come alone
*  I've talked to people like that too is it lame to come to show alone just come man who cares go to the movies by yourself
*  Good yeah, that's the cool thing about groups of people going to see things is that you're feeding off the vibe of all the people there
*  It's not just it's an experience. Yeah, it's not virtual reality. You're with people
*  It's an experience, and you're there and by the way how bad of a comic am I if people are noticing an audience member alone?
*  Yeah, like if that's the focus well the only problem would be like a place like the store
*  They'd have to sit somebody at your table because every place is like a two-top, but then it looks like you're with them
*  That's right, and when I come to pick on you then we'll know yeah, then we'll know that'll be a sure the ones by themselves
*  They always seat them. I don't know if they asked for it in the OR
*  They always seat them in the front so I was like I'm just here alone
*  I'm like that's cool, but it's weird you're right in the front well
*  That's because it's easy to do right because it's not a table. It's a bar. You know the front
*  Yeah, front part. It's like just a long line a
*  Large table yeah, yeah, it's not it doesn't like you're next to someone you can easily be right next to someone you have no idea
*  Who they are I can always tell where the line is I'm like I can tell who's together
*  Like shapes go with different shapes, and you can tell like where that line is I'm like you're a school shooter
*  You're sitting alone these two are together
*  So yeah, the OR is the fucking ultimate university for comedy you learn so much about whether your act sucks
*  Or where your acts at like whether or not it's getting better where you know
*  It's such a we're so lucky
*  I think about that sometimes like when I think about living somewhere else because I do want to live somewhere else
*  And I probably never totally live somewhere else
*  I'll probably keep a place here always because I feel like there's something about being able to go to the store
*  It's so goddamn powerful. It's like we're so fortunate that we all work together
*  You know and at any given show it would be you and me and Dalia and Whitney and Joey Diaz and
*  Callan and it's like fucking god so lucky yes, we're so fucking lucky
*  It's always like a thick like there's always on the lineup. There's always like a dense
*  Murderous chunk yeah, and I think to myself like wow
*  I'm so proud to post these lineups because these are the people that comic these are the comics that people want to see like this
*  Is special for them, and that's this dangerous weird energy place is our home and other comics
*  You know people are very intimidated by the store
*  Which I totally get because there's a dark energy there, but I always feel like I'm part of the Adams family
*  I'm like yeah, but that dark castles my home. Yeah, well it's a tight-knit group of humans
*  You know we're all real close to each other in a weird way in a weird way
*  But I've never like I'll never go to Brian Callan's house like I don't know where you live
*  like not never but like we're close right and I love seeing you guys, but like
*  But outside of that for some of us. I mean I think it just depends
*  Yeah, I think we spent enough time with each other at the fucking store
*  I mean I go on the road with a lot of guys
*  You know so that's different because when you're on the road together
*  You're really like family you know like if I'm on the road with Diaz or Ari or Hinchcliffe or any of those guys like
*  You know we eat together we work out together. We're just bullshitting together
*  Walking to the mall together and hanging out like it's all we're together all day, and you have systems in place
*  There's like a comfort you bring you know you bring your friends because there's a trust there
*  There's a shorthand my my features Hunter Hill. Do you know Hunter? No? I don't he's huge
*  And he's so funny, and it's like I'm so proud to be able to be at a place in my career where I can
*  foster bring another comic and watch them grow, and I'm so proud of him and
*  To get to share my audience with him like that's part of being an established comic that joy
*  It's like having like a child like of giving them these opportunities
*  Yeah, and to show them you also have this opportunity to show other comics
*  the the right way to tour and the right way to treat a comedy club waitress and the right way to
*  Speak to your tour like there's so many shitty comics out there that do things wrong
*  And I very early on decided like these are the rules that I want to tour with and this is how I want to treat
*  People and you pass that on other comics learn from older comics. Yeah, that's the only way we learn about everything really right
*  I've been talking about this a lot lately that there's nothing written written down by people like us
*  By like legitimate established comedians with specials who headline all over the country in the world
*  There's nothing written down by us because there's no rules. It's all so fluid, but even that just that fact
*  You know like I feel like there's there's there's a book out there that should be written
*  And it should probably be done by us
*  Where we kind of just talk about how everyone has a different process?
*  Everyone's got a different way of doing it because young comics
*  It takes a long there's there's a lot of like wasted energy trying to figure out how to do it and no one can really figure
*  out how to do it themselves until they just have experience and do it but
*  You I want to know how you write I want to know how you what do you do when you have a premise like?
*  How do you go up? Do you do it different than Delia does it do you do it different than Diaz does?
*  How does Bill start his set right when he throws away all his material because he just filmed a special right?
*  And he's starting how does he start new you know?
*  And also by the way you can read all about the people that read about comedy and then think that's the way to do it
*  You won't know till you go right and that's why when I you know I had somebody reach out to me recently
*  Like I'm getting up pretty regularly getting laughs pretty regularly. I'm like the key is pretty regularly it has to be regularly
*  Yeah, what is pretty regularly right and I'm like this is a commitment. This is a craft. This is a passion
*  This isn't a hobby if you want to be a hobby. You're gonna get hobbyist hobbyist results
*  You know that's a good way of putting that and so you got to put everything in because it's the only way you know
*  How to operate but just because I write a certain way doesn't mean that works for you like I don't write anything down
*  Some people I remember one comic had a recipe box of jokes, and he would go through and each one was categorized
*  Is that insane for sure was he good no, but?
*  Everybody's got their way that they do it and if it works it works. Yeah, it's not you know
*  You can't knock it
*  Yeah, I think that everyone has their own way for sure and I think you can learn from other people's ways
*  and maybe try them out and
*  Also, you got to realize like someone like you has been doing it forever and doesn't write anything down
*  That's very different than someone who's just starting out who doesn't write anything down like you should probably write some shit down
*  Yeah, a couple keywords. Yeah something yeah and record your sets fuck
*  But it's the thing about it is that there's the consequences like if you really want to make it as a comic you must
*  Literally dedicate your life to it particularly in the beginning like you have to I was talking about this yesterday the other day I was like
*  Because so many people do comedy now even less did it when you started and not it you know
*  As and so many people do it now, and there's so many avenues for comedy so many different ways you can do it
*  So many more opportunities I
*  Really give the people that do it now that are starting out credit because if I were if I just decided I want to start comedy
*  Now it would seem insurmountable. Mmm. Just how intimidating it is getting it everybody's in UCB everybody to stand up everybody
*  I feel that way about podcast too, though
*  You know I always tell people to do podcast and like just fucking do it
*  So if you can figure out how to do it, it's an amazing way to make a living and so many people can do it
*  It's like anything else like comedy like anything else you just start it and do it
*  But there's so many people doing it now. I mean the numbers are fucking astonishing
*  There's no litmus test for like what's a decent, but if you're good
*  I really feel like even though there's a
*  700,000 podcast if you have something that's unique and interesting you build something people will find it people find it the cream rises at
*  The top and that's with comedy too. You know go do your set don't blame anyone else
*  Put in the work. There's nobody out there. Who's fucking awesome that isn't making steps toward being
*  Better undeniable yes. Yeah, there's nobody out there. That's like a brilliant comic, and it's like yeah, nobody will give me stage time
*  It's been that way for a decade if you are good people will support you
*  a lot of people won't but you have to just move in that direction and
*  Even if you are that shitty comic that we were talking about at the beginning like don't let us be the ones to tell you know
*  Don't you feel like in this day and age though comics are way more supportive of each other than when you started yeah
*  And I'm at a different level now, so I don't
*  It's weird. I was thinking about the comics or when you start there
*  You're like a freshman and now you can become an upperclassman and the upperclassman stay upperclassman like you were an upperclassman
*  When I started, but now I'm also an upperclassman and these people go from being people you look up to to being your colleagues
*  And among successful comics it's less cutthroat
*  You know and I think because of the pendulum shift in our society people are a little bit kinder or whatever
*  But all that toxic energy that was at the store in particular and in comedy
*  I remember when I started kind of flushed out not really tolerated as much. Oh, it's gone
*  It's a hundred percent gone. There's no there's no like we got a lady doorman
*  Yeah, it's a crazy place now and and Adam
*  I think to his credit kind of is responsible for a chunk of that shift hundred percent
*  And I think the resurgence of our audience is I would say in large part due to you and your podcast and Marin and his podcast
*  Brett Ernst said this to me a while ago, and I agreed with it
*  He was like podcasts people hear it and they come to the store and it's become more of a destination
*  Because it for a while like the store was like whatever well
*  There's a prelude to that when Paulie Shore had his show when we had minding the store. I was in high school
*  Yeah, well when he had minding the store
*  I was at the store and I remember there's this giant crowd in the front bar and I was like what is going on and
*  Paulie was out there and
*  People were like well the show minding the store has really jumped up the amount of people coming it didn't last
*  You know the show didn't last either but there was an impact and I remember the impact and I were going oh, that's crazy
*  Yeah, look how many people watch this show like all of a sudden the comedy store became like this destination
*  But now when you think about podcasts like this one that was gonna be heard and seen by millions of people and the other ones
*  That we've done have also been and then they you know
*  I've done fucking how many comics on podcasts like hundreds of them all those are like a free
*  Advertisement for the greatest spot on earth for stand-up
*  Yeah, and you get to say your spots and people come and they just want to be part of it
*  I was in a like a novelty store in Sweden
*  I was buying like a plate with like a cartoon chicken on it and this really cute guy
*  Because I like little things it was like I got it for my assistant
*  It had like a rich something like a tchotchke right and the guy who obviously like it wasn't his dream job
*  Just like a dude, and I was talking and he was like I've heard you on Joe Rogan
*  And I was like I'm in Sweden in like a girly plate shop
*  And here's this dude who probably like fucking loves MMA and you and recognized my voice across the world
*  In like the weirdest little plate store, and I was like that's the power of comedy like it reaches that far
*  And you get to tour like I got to go on tour I got to go to Malaysia to do comedy who's Alex
*  fucking lit like they were I
*  To me I did this whole Asia tour and I was like Malaysia is of all the countries
*  I did because I did Hong Kong and I did Japan and
*  There was one more and I'm blanking on it. Oh, Singapore and of all of them
*  I had not been to Malaysia. I'd been to the others and I had less context for Malaysia
*  I knew some of my clothing was made there
*  And I knew that we ship a lot of our recycling there or try to
*  But I had no context and it's interesting because you're there and everyone is in a hijab and they're Asian
*  So that's like you don't see that a time. Yeah, cuz they're all Muslim Muslim
*  Uh-huh, and they look like Asian like Japanese or Chinese. Yeah, like Asian Wow and
*  They were just the crowd was on fire. Really? I thought it was gonna be super conservative and weird
*  I made fun of the Chinese a little bit
*  They were like yes, and they just went nuts and they were awesome
*  And I just remember thinking like and some people are expats
*  But a lot of them were just full-on Malaysian and it's all because of Netflix and I was like that's it's so
*  Special to have your comment
*  I'm gonna go tour in Russia like places that you have no real context for are
*  Feeling your heart and they're understanding what you're saying and it's resonating with people that are nothing like you you're gonna tour in Russia
*  Yeah
*  I'm going to Europe like it's just cool and then they know other comics like I know who you are
*  They know who other people and it's just it's the secret
*  It's like language this community that where you and I are members of and people all want to be part of it, right?
*  Because people want to feel seen and heard and that comedy validates that weird voice in your head and it lets you know that
*  You're not alone and for so many people that feel alone. It's so powerful to
*  Feel like you're being seen and that somebody understands you
*  And that's why it's so important have so many different kinds of comedy different shapes and colors
*  Just so people can choose who they resonate with right? I'm never gonna be able to reach everyone and that's okay
*  Yeah, of course
*  Touring in Russia is gonna be a trip
*  Shots just did that I'm gonna ask Bert Kreischer for tips. Did Bert work over there? Well, no, but no machine
*  Yeah, how to get drunk on a train? Yeah, I tell you how to get drunk anywhere. I got a letter today
*  I'm going to Vietnam and it was in bold and I've been to Vietnam before like for funsies
*  but it was in bold and it was like this like written out like
*  Imprisonment will be issued. There will be no jokes about do not mention Vietnam War Vietnam
*  Like all these things and I legit was like I do mention the Vietnam War
*  So just please remind me day before not to have that one joke. It's not a joke about the Vietnam War
*  I just it's in there as part of the setup
*  But some countries like you do military shows they have like a no burden list like you can't there's certain things you can't say
*  You know you do a military show. Yeah, you can't make like drug jokes. Please don't make fun of the president, which I get
*  And some countries are like no fucking joke. Do not say it like so they wouldn't let you joke about Vietnam
*  Yeah, sorry. Sorry about all that. I
*  Feel like I could but then like try explaining context to someone that just wants you in jail. Yeah, I was going to China
*  I did Hong Kong and I had Beijing and they canceled it to honor so random the Tiananmen Square massacre
*  Which of course should have been honored prior but it wasn't and they canceled all comedy
*  not that there was a ton across the land and so but they canceled all canceled it and
*  It's that it's just the thing where we're very lucky in this country
*  You can say whatever you want your rights under your neighbors nose
*  That freedom is totally not to be taken for granted and other countries are aware of our freedom, too
*  And I wonder how long they're gonna keep the bullshit up in places like China
*  I wonder how long they're gonna be able to do that because like you see what's happening in Hong Kong where Hong Kong is rebelling
*  Against the Chinese. I was there
*  Protests were happening. We had to move the hotel because it was like in this like civic area
*  Whoa, it's I think was like on Kowloon Bay or something and I'll be a thousand percent honest
*  It was so congested and busy there
*  But if I didn't know there were protests going on I wouldn't have known it was and now it's probably grown a lot
*  But I mean it's ongoing those people they got a message and they're not backing down. They're not backing down
*  What's incredible is it's been going on for months and months and months
*  It's like a new activity people are just in the streets
*  But a lot of people have been shot on video, you know by cops and we just watch it
*  I mean and it's like it just happens and it's not a big deal. It's insane
*  but we definitely have these social liberties and and
*  I don't take it for granted and some of these countries and then part of me is like, okay
*  Some venues are big some venues are small if I make a joke that you don't like is that gonna be run up the flagpole
*  I don't want to take the chance. I know
*  It's so interesting. We were at such a strange tipping point culturally in this country and then worldwide, you know
*  You know England just had their big elections Jeremy Corbyn lost but he did a video where
*  He was saying how he's running for president or whatever it is Prime Minister. What is it over there Prime Minister?
*  Yeah, I'm watching the crown. He said his fucking pronouns. He said my pronouns are him he okay
*  Can I just put this out there? I'm super pro trans. I'm pro fluid sexuality
*  If you are a straight male, we know your fucking pronouns are him he well, even if you're a gay male
*  Your gay male your pronouns
*  He him too if your pronouns are something or what it looks like you are
*  Yeah, I don't think you need that to me. That's a very white nightie here. He is a hundred percent white nightie
*  Yeah, it was very cringy and I think a lot of people like there's like some borderline people like fuck this guy with this
*  He him shit. Yeah your pronouns say him they
*  Z whatever great he him when you are when you're he him
*  Everybody you know, it's just such a thing a ploy
*  You know my pronouns are he him like oh, no, you didn't you fuck your 60 years old because what it does this
*  It gets other it's it's such a valid thing for other people and then it makes people
*  I roll just a little bit and then I think it takes away from the plight the genuine cause of the trans community
*  Yeah, which fully supportive of yeah, if you want to be called she or her fine
*  I identify with the made-up words. I made up words can all go fuck themselves the zur and zigs and also you wouldn't know
*  Unless someone told you like don't get mad at me for not innately knowing that I should have said you should have a plea
*  You should have asked the pronouns. No, you gotta tell me no. No, you have to ask
*  That's the new rule. You should you must comply. I'm really bad at asking questions
*  Like someone will be like, how's your day? I'm like great and I talk and I always have to remind myself like how was your boring day?
*  Because there's no punchlines in this answer
*  People ask me and I always assume they're just interested and then I realized they're making small talk
*  I should ask I should return the fire. Mm-hmm, right don't know you're beating to the worst when someone comes over and just starts rattling
*  Off about how their day was and there's nothing there nothing like and then I went to try to find a lighter
*  But you know how hard it is to find a lighter and then I went to this store
*  There's no lighter and I was like, do you know where I can get a lighter?
*  Here's the other day somebody was talking to me and I the words came out like a burp. I couldn't stop it
*  I just went stop stop telling me stop talking
*  Can do what what I did to that guy I was very comfortable with that person stop talking. Oh you were comfortable wasn't a stranger
*  That's the devil. No. Yeah, sometimes you got to give people a minute. They're not as verbally accurate
*  but yeah
*  but yeah, mm-hmm as we both think yeah, so
*  Malaysia is where is it on the map? What's it next to Singapore? It's like Singapore is younger
*  I guess Singapore is the younger brother. Singapore has a lot of expats, right? A lot of expats a lot of money
*  It's very sterile sterile like it's not like a party
*  But they have a lot of money. There's crazy laws there, right if you fuck up that cane you. Remember the kid?
*  Yeah, that's how that's that was our introduction to Singapore as white America. That kid's got scars on his ass to this day
*  Well, here's a fucking rule
*  Don't go to another country and break their law and think it's cool cuz you're American right like I have such a healthy respect
*  As a proud American I always want to represent well talk about it my ex
*  I'm not gonna do the bit
*  but I really am cognizant of the fact that people in many cases look up to us and or are jealous of us and
*  Like with anybody if you give them a reason to be like what an American pig and I don't I will know like I will always
*  Show you that we are as good as we think we are
*  That's what I always say about Hawaii like people say off you go to Hawaii. They don't like white people
*  I go no, they don't like ass. They don't like assholes
*  Don't let us one of the nicest places ever
*  Do they have a problem with some white people that come over there and act like assholes? Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, but like the general look you're gonna find racist everywhere racist against black people racist against Hawaiians
*  racist against
*  White people racist against Asians you're gonna find that there's certain people that are just they don't like others, right?
*  That's it. It's just how it is. But for the most part Hawaii is cool as fuck
*  They just want you to respect their land the way that they do and I get it
*  It's funny because my mom
*  Anything I'm like I'm going to these countries. She's like don't walk around alone. You're Jewish be careful in Europe
*  Jewish by the way suit like anti-semitism is rampant alive and well
*  You don't look horrific though. You could pull it off. You don't look anti-semitic. Like what does that mean?
*  You have a tiny little nose. Well, I paid for it
*  What was it like before you got it whacked here? No, it was just different
*  It was like, you know, my dad calls it the Chinsky hook every one of my family has this nose
*  My Nana whose last name was Chinsky and it's just my dad has it looks great on a dude
*  Not my favorite thing like I do dudes can have fucked up noses and it's kind of noble
*  So my husband has like a big nose, right?
*  Yeah, he loves you
*  Half-Vitalian half Jewish and I said to him cuz I'm like this isn't my nose and if we have a baby
*  I'm like, whoa and that and it's a girl and she's got that nose
*  She better be fucking great at basketball or brilliant because just get her nose fixed I don't I don't be her choice
*  I would want to think your nose matches your face
*  like if I didn't know good nose job was fixed I would yeah, well sometimes too because I
*  Had one, you know
*  Yo
*  I look and I can spot one a mile away like a nose job and a lot of people have big noses and they get these
*  Scooped out things that don't fit their face because everybody wants like a cute little yeah guy ish nose
*  And it doesn't fit if you're like if you've got like a long face and you have this scooped out nose, right?
*  It's you can tell like if Ari got a little nose like yours
*  We'd be like what in the fuck is going on any dude had a little elephant nose, right?
*  But I have a small head and small mouth. It's a syndrome. Mmm, and I have a tiny nose now, but uh, yeah
*  But that's it. I think the blonde hair throws people. You smell as good as you used to be able to yeah
*  I have your nose holes are probably smaller. No, my nostrils were always small
*  I have I got when I was 18. So like who remembers anything for that?
*  Right, I have keen olfactory senses. I can smell it's like a problem like a wolf
*  Like if you had a cigarette yesterday, I would be able to tell you now really I it's a problem
*  It makes it difficult for me. Like what is that one where people not am like where people have sense like
*  Were loud noises upset them? Yeah, I don't know the word but I know what is it. I have that with smells
*  And it's difficult just around people and I'm constantly having
*  I'm constantly like being like just mentally attaching things in places that smells like I'm just having
*  Not deja vu, but I'm always knows to be fucking useless
*  Until I got it fixed. I got a you've been hitting the nose so much. That's the problem
*  Everybody says they had deviated septum. I did have a deviated septum. My nose is actually wider
*  I think after the operation because they stuff something I had to get these
*  Turbinates they're called cleaned up. They had to cut the inside of my nose out and it was also calcified
*  Yeah, because you know like cauliflower ear, you know that is when guys get fucked up ears from wrestling. I squeeze it
*  I had that inside my nose. So the inside of my nose was all hard with
*  Bro, a lot of people that have been hitting the nose and like scar tissue. It just it swells
*  well, yeah, what it is is when you have blood under the skin the reason why you get calcium or the
*  Cauliflower ear it's actually what happens is the blood calcifies and the blood actually literally becomes a rock, right? So like when you see
*  Cauliflower ear like I've seen guys get their cauliflower. You're broken off
*  And it falls off. Yeah, there's a video of this guy. He loses his cauliflower ears. He can find it Jamie
*  Just Google cauliflower right on the map. It's white. It's white like a white stone. I can't really is calcium
*  Yeah, so that was inside my nose so they had to open up my nose
*  Well, you know with fucking forceps and shit carve all this stuff out and then they had to shove these molds
*  Like these like to form it. Yeah, well, it's like foam like like a hard like a soft, you know dense foam
*  So look at that ear on the ground that is yep
*  That's just but that's that's just the calcified part does just the calcified but it's all the skin attached to as well
*  He was relieved probably but guys like it because it makes them feel like a
*  Well, you can spot a fighter I'll see him in airports
*  I mean, they're always also in sweatpants and sliders, but
*  Yeah, that is doesn't go away. She fought Jessica
*  I and Jessica I fucked her ear up and to the point where her
*  Cauliflower ear broke off and you could see inside of her head like her ear was hanging down
*  You could look look into her head. It's hard to see from that picture. That's not
*  You're cool with that. I think about how sweaty my ears get in these headphones
*  So I can't imagine being punched in the ear repeatedly. Well, I always wore headgear
*  Always from grappling. That's why I don't have any cauliflower ear. Well, so you're not like a little tiny pieces, but you love it
*  Do you love it?
*  Feel right there thick you're right there
*  Your little spot little tight spot. Yeah, a little bit of one
*  I always ask if I can squeeze it and they always say yes and it's never as satisfying as I'd hope it's a rock
*  Yeah, you want to squish it. It's not cute. Randy Couture told me used to shove it in people's faces
*  Like when he's wrestling he said get his ear and drive it into people's eye sockets
*  Like that whole thing is a giant rock well props to him for having the precision in battle to be able to do that
*  Along with all the grappling. He's a savage. He just had a fucking heart attack
*  Yeah, it's crazy
*  Five years old he was working out and he was like, um, I gotta go to the doctor
*  Just went straight to the doctor and like dude, you just had a heart attack. I'm so fucking tough
*  I know notice. It's like I eat my own heart
*  I don't have any sports injuries. I don't think I ever played a sport. You have no sports injuries at all
*  No, I feel like a lot of girls like get knee surgery in high school and stuff like that
*  Maybe I just wasn't playing hard enough. You don't have you you never played any sport. I played sports
*  I just don't have any I played lacrosse. Oh, you were so white so white. That's so why it's such a private school
*  That's the whitest sport of all time. I played lacrosse in Texas so rough sport though
*  People don't know people crack people with those sticks what I lacked in genuine athletic ability I made up for an aggression
*  Whoa, so there's nothing worse than an athlete. That's not good, but they're very aggressive
*  Do you think that flavored you as a human maybe yeah, it wasn't cute. Well, it's not cute
*  Well, I think of girls playing the crosses like hair all over the place and fucking this face in skirts. Yeah, it's I
*  Got ejected from a game one time
*  So hard that I wasn't allowed to sit with my team like what's a shade beyond a red card
*  Mmm, like a black beating heart. What did you do? I hit a girl with the stick. Yeah with my car
*  I'm in your hand or something
*  No, I have my stick and it was unlawful and they made me sit next to my parents in the stands and it was so
*  Humiliating good for you. Yeah pat you on the head. Good. He was pretty good. Fuck those bitches up
*  I played defense though. So I wasn't really a part of I had a buddy of mine that played lacrosse in high school
*  And I remember he was like telling me I was crazy to fight and I was like
*  What's to stop someone from hitting you with those sticks? Yeah, you guys are running into each other man. I go Mike. Don't kid yourself
*  I'm like you're doing something violent. You're just doing something violent under this weird pretend thing
*  Yeah under pretend civility. Yeah, boys get pads and helmets and girls do not what the fuck is that all about?
*  Because girls aren't supposed to hit I mean you're it's a physical sport but boys it's like football with sticks
*  Did you like just pick it up like a baseball bat and crack this chick in the head?
*  Like how do you do it over your head and come down? That's not okay, right?
*  My nickname was that I think it was like a butcher because my coach was like you hold your stick and you come down so hard
*  because you know what it comes out on the field and
*  Women are not allowed to be aggressive
*  It's a thing where it's like on sports day like, you know wear a skirt be ladies represent and you got dudes just running around
*  ripping people's heads off raping villages and
*  One girl takes her shirt off at a World Cup game Megan Rapinoe does something. It's like whoa scandalous
*  Well, I just got back from the UFC. There's three women fights this weekend
*  That's a different thing pretty intense and that's okay now, but for other sports. It's always expected that women conduct yourselves like ladies, right?
*  That's not
*  It's sport. It's there's nothing to do with the real world
*  It has to do with trying to win but it also has to mean you just you violated the rules though
*  I broke the rules because otherwise like if everybody was just swinging at each other would be a tip totally different sport
*  No, I was not great and I own that what did you do? Did you just swing it over your head?
*  I probably just came down like a hammer
*  Yeah
*  Like if you have too much like torque built up like I had and I hit and you're not supposed to you know
*  You can give a tap a tap to get the ball out of the thing. I didn't hit her on the head
*  I think I I probably hit her stick so hard
*  I don't remember my friend was telling me people get concussions high school was only like two years ago
*  I'm like how many people you know even getting concussions from lacrosse. It was like a lot and I was like, bro
*  You're in a violent sport. It's a violent
*  It's a fucking violent sport and it's oddly not a professional sport because I think it would be an exciting professional
*  It's a professional sport, but it's not it's not a widely received one. I'm gonna make any money playing lacrosse
*  It's like bowling right? It's not a good look, but they do have it
*  I have a friend that plays professionally and I don't know who's watching it, but they do it, right?
*  But wouldn't you think that it would be like hockey or like a legit? Yeah rugby should be our football. That's what I think
*  I think it would be better for the athletes less concussions
*  They had less concussions back when they were playing with those little leather helmets and tiny pads
*  Because you just couldn't do what these guys are doing. You're just smashing into your head as a battering gigantic
*  Super athletes in their prime running at preposterous speed with
*  Undescribable power. Yeah, those guys are so fucking strong when you're around a real professional football player like Jesus huge
*  They're annoying. They look like Brandon Chobb plus right?
*  Well, you know when you're around show how fucking big he is imagine him plus 60 70 pounds. That's these guys
*  I get it Joe 300 seen football. They're so big. It doesn't make sense and they're running at each other full clip
*  It's terrifying it's terrifying and it's so bad for your fucking brain that being said I would like to go to Rams game
*  Yeah, I'd like to see the new stadium. Yeah, I like to go in the line the one of them big
*  Bulletproof hamster wheels, you know and play so nobody could see me. I mean no so no
*  Why don't you just a skybox because people fight? What are you talking about? We're talking about two different things Rams
*  What are you talking about football? I'm saying go in the audience, but be being like a bulletproof box
*  Why don't you sit in a skybox? It is bulletproof. That's true
*  Didn't you not down with the people you know, you get down. Is that what you want to be with the proletariat?
*  Well with the Raiders game, that's how I'd watch a Raiders game. Oh boy
*  Yeah
*  Have boxes on the field bulletproof boxes. I don't know about bulletproof, but
*  Glass box Ram, but I was honestly I was thinking Raiders, but the Raiders game is you Raiders are going to Vegas now, right?
*  It's gonna be even more violent. Yeah, cuz there's no loyalty
*  Just people coming and getting fucked up and being like Raiders
*  That's a weird sport right or a weird team right because the Raiders are synonymous with thugs. Yes
*  It's like one of the only sports or one of the only teams where the audience is synonymous with thugs
*  I always think of Frazier Smith joke
*  Well, I like there's all these like thugs at Knox Ferry Farm and it's just like some teenagers. It's like boo Raiders bitch
*  And I always think of that like some kid and like a sheet just scaring you and yelling Raiders
*  That's hilarious
*  But I think having a transient audience for a home team is kind of a thing
*  Of course people live in Las Vegas, but by and large it will be a tourist attraction
*  Mm-hmm, because it's also in the fall and winter
*  So it's a not sweltering time of year to go to Las Vegas
*  And I don't know it'll be interesting to see like hometown pride and what that fan looks like
*  When you're in a city where everybody's always coming in. I don't believe it's real. I don't think I mean Vegas is a real town
*  There are real locals there, but I don't think there's enough to show like hometown pride especially for something like
*  the Raiders
*  Fucking LA they're from LA and then they're from Oakland and now they're here in Vegas
*  But they're not from Vegas and I don't think the Rams
*  I mean to me I don't really even know anyone that watches football and it's uh, it's weird that we're getting a football team
*  Yeah, I wonder what would happen if players were not allowed to switch teams
*  Well, it's just like a sentence like you take the oath you're like Larry Bird you're in the fucking Celtics for life
*  You know like there's back when I was a kid
*  I didn't watch sports, but I remember like players were on teams like Michael Jordan was on the Chicago Bulls
*  Right. Yeah, I that was how it was with the Cowboys growing up whether you watched it or not
*  Like it was a part of your life. Mm-hmm, and all those guys are forever synonymous like Dan Sanders primetime 21, baby
*  Yep, that's the Dallas Cowboys and I remember there was a DJ who passed away who did
*  Kid Kradik and he was the kiss FM DJ in the morning that guy passed away passed away and it was that
*  Maybe a year ago two years ago. What happened heart attack?
*  But I remember he would always this is not that funny
*  But he would always say I'm from Dallas, Texas where the Cowboys play and I would say that for years because I thought that
*  Was like a cool source of pride because it's America's team
*  And then I realized all that did was open up the conversation to someone being like whoa Cowboys
*  And I don't have the information to back it up, right?
*  I don't want to have that conversation right you'd have a debate about the Cowboys versus blank like saying I'm for I for years
*  On stage at like a shitty club. I'd be like I'm from Dallas and you'd always get a guy like no fuck the Cowboys
*  I'm like cool, dude, not attached to it. Like this is not gonna be how this hour goes, but uh, yeah
*  No real, but it is part of your upbringing sports dudes love to get angry. There's something about sports radio and sports broadcasting
*  They love to get shitty about athletes that guy's a pussy
*  Fucking play I was in Montreal last week
*  And I was just sitting in a cafe and I was just listening to these two French Canadian guys
*  Go in on just shitting on other parts of Canada other cities and the stuff
*  He was it was savage like they eat their own in Canada
*  And it was just shitting on the leaves and shitting on Winnipeg. Oh, it's a city of degenerates
*  That's why they lock it down at 10 like just losing it and then I tweeted I
*  Instagrammed about it and then the rest of the Canadians weighed in on how much they hate French Canada became a thing and I'm like
*  Well, French Canada is a different Canada. It's a different thing. That's great. I love it up there
*  I love Quebec, but they want us to see they've wanted to see since I've been going up there since the 90s
*  Yeah, people get froggy when it comes to the brexit thing, but nobody even breaks it England's not pumped about that
*  Northern California wants us to seed well brexit so weird because brexit is
*  You know, they're part of the European Union. It's almost like Texas leaving the United States
*  My whole thing is whatever I understand the reasons wanting that the second somebody tries to invade like you don't have your own militia
*  You don't have an army. Well, they this whole European Union thing is very new though. Mm-hmm
*  Because you cannot just easily when you're in England
*  Gotta go through the whole thing when you're going to other country and it used to just be such a chill thing
*  Mm-hmm, and now it's a little bit of a nightmare. I haven't done it. I haven't done it
*  I haven't traveled to England since the whole brexit thing has been going on
*  I did I went through touring and it should have just been like just hop on a plane to go to your other countries
*  Now you go through just stuck in customs
*  Hoping someone comes for you. I don't know enough about the arguments pro and con to comment on it, honestly
*  Well, and it truly doesn't matter because we don't have a vote in it
*  But I know that dude looks like a British version of Donald Trump. Yeah, he looks like they're he's got fucked up yellow hair the whole deal
*  He literally looks like their version of Trump like a wonkier if it's possible younger version wonkier hotter
*  He's a little hotter a little bit. They say America sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold
*  You know, like we do something people will start to imagine if dudes with fucked up blonde hair to start taking over the world. I
*  Feel like that was Hitler's vision. I feel like that's where they were
*  Right was crazy was like Hitler didn't look like that brown hair
*  I think he even had like a Jewish grandma brown eyes every Jew knows this yeah Jewish grandma
*  I think it's something like that. Look at that guy. Come on. What he looks like Harry from dumb and dumb away
*  He's not hotter. He's just younger when Trump was younger. He was way hotter than that. No, that guy's terrible
*  Terrible looking. No, but a lot of Trump supporters this weekend. It's Colby Covington was fighting in the UFC and he's a
*  Big Trump supporter, you know, I gotta say this this is not pro Trump, but this is pro your own rights
*  We have this thing in California
*  I said something I was in a writer's room and I said something about
*  someone who I knew that voted for my family that voted for Donald Trump and
*  They someone was like someone in your family voted for Donald Trump
*  Do you still speak to them and I was like don't get high fee with me this idea that you can't I understand
*  All these horrible things but we have to be able to have conversations
*  Yeah in this country and if on both sides and other liberals at times and I say this as a person who's fairly liberal
*  It's terrifying. Yeah, just attacking your own allies and creating no space for a conversation
*  Well liberals used to be when I was a kid and my parents are hippies and we lived in San Francisco when I was a little
*  Kid and so I always thought of liberals as being the people that were like open-minded
*  You know
*  Not wanting to silence people letting people speak
*  They're all about people just being whoever who they are and not not trying to enforce like rigid patterns of behavior and thought on people
*  But that's not the case now because they think they're doing the right thing
*  I think they're combating something that's awful and aggressive and regressive
*  You know that's something that is they feel like the country that they know and love is slipping away
*  So the
*  So do the conservatives so does everyone but the response to it is not the right way to go about it
*  The response to it is to show a great example of what your your
*  ideology
*  Represents by being a good person by being open-minded by being kind instead people are being super super shitty
*  There's so many super super shitty people that think they're doing the right thing because they're progressive and all they though they want good things
*  They want
*  Gay rights and they want racial equality and they want people to be able to make more money
*  And they want to be happy and healthy attacking anyone who from the get-go doesn't agree with you because by the way if you if you
*  And I disagree and you calmly want to have a conversation with me
*  I am very open to having my mind change of course
*  I want to be on the right side and I want to do the best thing if you yell at me
*  And you call me stupid call me all and you're attacking me and you're on the defense from the get-go
*  You're on the offense from the get-go
*  But just as a person with pride you're gonna want to be like you know what I don't want to hear it and fuck you
*  Because you represent now all the good intentions like you're the representative of all that and I don't like you
*  You know so you are um
*  You're an ambassador for your cause when you speak
*  I'm really into the environment and plastic and stuff like that and I am very
*  specific about how and when I post about things because you don't want people to get activism fatigue and you don't want to be the
*  Person who posts about everything because then no one will listen to anything right and you don't want to call people out
*  Specifically because just because somebody carried a plastic bottle that day doesn't mean they don't drive a hybrid
*  You don't know what people are doing right you see Chris practice
*  Yeah, that's literally what I'm thinking of and while I love that he did that part of me is like that's a little holier than now
*  Shamed him Jason Momoa is so fucking hot so hot
*  He's not but we were so especially online. We're so quick to be like you're not doing it, right
*  We do it with feminism too, and you have no idea right the pious good life that person is leading
*  And you're judging them on a snapshot on which you don't want to be judged on well
*  They want to judge people the thing is about it's a lot of what this is about people that are on the fringes
*  It's the the ideas are great right but the people that want attention for espousing these great ideas
*  Oftentimes are the fringe so the far left and the far right a lot of it what it is
*  It's just people that are ultra aggressive about enforcing their ideology
*  And then they're really shitty and they want other people to comply and so you get these people that represent the right and these people
*  That represent the left, but they did a lot of the ideas of the right and the left
*  It's nothing wrong being fiscally conservative. There's nothing wrong with being
*  Republican yes, right you want less government in your money. There's room in there for conversation
*  But when you go far right and then you go far left then there's no room and when you start billifying people
*  Yeah from the get-go and when you start expecting people I
*  Owen Benjamin who is just
*  Basically is like in a tinfoil hat somewhere and like living off the grid he offended a lot of people right
*  You're staring at me. Yeah, no most of them
*  and he said a bunch of stuff about trans stuff and
*  I remember there was this
*  Girl that I was friends with on social media didn't know her but just followed her cuz I liked her writing
*  That's it and she DMS me one day and she's like she's like Owen Benjamin
*  Like how could you be like maybe I I don't know if I'd interacted with him on Twitter
*  I'm never on Twitter because I think it's a toxic fuckhole
*  And she was like she's getting mad at me and I go what are you talking about?
*  She was like he said all this stuff that's anti-trans and I hadn't heard anything
*  Let me let me say what he said okay, and here's the thing
*  He went off into a spiral right, but I
*  Agree with what he said what he said was there was someone that he knew
*  Someone who works in Hollywood that had a three-year-old that they were turning trans right and he said that that was child abuse
*  That was what led. I don't disagree with that crazy situation. Totally. This is I know I agree with it a hundred percent
*  I don't disagree with that. Yeah, I agree with him child hundred percent you wouldn't let that child decide what it's eating right so that's
*  Joke you don't let
*  Say this I wish I could remember who it was they said you don't let a kid pick their outfit
*  Why the fuck would you let them pick their gender for the rest of the joke? I just made yeah, but it's somebody did it already right
*  I'm not gonna do the joke
*  but
*  So that aside and the spiral aside which I didn't even yeah participate like it's whatever like those are your choices
*  That's what you're saying
*  I had known but this is a thing that cost him dearly his agency left him and then comedy clubs banned him for that
*  That was the beginning. He just steered into that skid well
*  That's but that's what started the skid right what started the skid was something else about like he called someone who had written a
*  Look this that's not the point of what I was saying went south afterwards
*  You have to manage those things my point was I knew none of this
*  So I'm just like going to brunch one day and this person starts attacking me offline
*  How can you be friends with them and I go? Whoa? What are you talking about?
*  She's like he's saying all these horrible things and I attack you in person
*  In my like direct message and this is my only point is I said I've known Owen most of my career
*  Let me go read what you're talking about and she was angry at me for wanting to gather information
*  This person is a trans writer who I literally until that moment didn't know was trans because I was just a fan
*  Based on merit like I just like the writing and I said how dare you shame on you as a journalist
*  You should applaud that I go and collect my facts
*  They want compliance like immediate instantaneous and I said I'm an ally and I am pro trans and I'm pro gay rights
*  But you do not get to bark at me on a Sunday morning when I have no idea what we're talking about and get mad at me
*  I don't trust anyone who says they're an ally about anything. I'm a total but you say that if you say I'm an ally
*  I know you think I'm antitrans
*  I vote and I hate Mrs. Doubtfire
*  So now she is just the term allies gross
*  It's okay when other people use it like he's an ally that guy's an ally. She's an ally. I get that
*  That's a good way to use it. But when you say I'm an ally, I'm like, yeah, okay
*  No, well, I'm pro trans good for you. And I am I blocked that person
*  I was like you don't get to bark at me and tell me for any cause. Yeah, I too many fucking people live on Twitter
*  It's not good. It's not healthy folks. I don't have my talk to people Twitter is it's good
*  Like a subway bathroom wall like people just told me the exact same thing last week
*  She's now at our phone
*  Because you're just screaming into a void and all it does is just it just nets negativity
*  So they're just waiting for you to fuck up. Mm-hmm
*  By the way, anybody who's ever said anything awful to me on Twitter who I've seen in person
*  They say nothing and I'm you know, I'm part only way people should talk is face to face
*  Yeah, Louis CK said that to me. We're talking about this and he said it's just talk but it's written down
*  So people think it's like more than it is
*  Well because people people would say these kind of things and you would go
*  Ah, you get like she's and retweets which are basically pitchforks
*  But like if you said something like if you said something about someone like you said something about Bert or something like that
*  You know and he said it online like fucking Bert should know a lot about getting drunk in Russia
*  If he's he read that it sounds so bad. It's like what the fuck lies. There's no inflection, right?
*  But if right, but if you just said it to me, we're hanging out and then you saw Burton hugged him
*  I wouldn't think you're a hypocrite. It's right, right, right? So it's it's like what Louie saying is just talk
*  It's but it's but it's written it's talk without nuance or inflection because not everyone has mastered grammar or punctuation
*  It's worse, especially for us because we say things we talk shit
*  You know like even now you and I are agreeing on everything and I'm like I'm gonna face a firing squad of
*  Betas when I get on my Instagram later be like
*  And Rogan was talking and not you listen
*  There's a certain percentage of people that are gonna attack every woman who comes in the show for sure that just happens
*  But I was almost always I brave it Jesse May Jesse May got like super positive
*  She's doing it better than you
*  Now she's the only one that I've had on but maybe how do you know cuz she told me do you check
*  Maybe she's just like a half glass half full kind of girl. Maybe she's just high all the time
*  I don't know. I don't know anything. She's high all the time. Oh, yeah, I am NOT I know it's like not cool
*  I am NOT a pot smoker. Yeah, and I want right. Nope. I mean I tried pot
*  My brother grows Elon Musk moment, you know man, man
*  Did I didn't think his I didn't think he looked as weird as everybody thought. Oh, it's weird
*  But he because he was like trying to like hold it in or whatever
*  Do you know that my brother?
*  Has a marijuana farm. That's what my brother does where?
*  Northern California and he does it like he's got a gun like he grows his plants
*  We're not a farming people but he that's what he does
*  It's a great way to make a living right now makes his living and I am just not I
*  Would like to like it because it seems like a what's wrong with it to you
*  Like what is I just think you're gonna be hotboxed in about ten minutes. I thought that wasn't a real thing
*  It's a real thing. I've got places to go
*  I'll be more jovial. I have an outline do more community. I'm good more community oriented later the day
*  I think it makes me I always people always like no
*  This is indica in the couch and this is the TV over your mind
*  And I always feel like it makes me think about death and I feel uncomfortable
*  And my mind just starts racing. Yeah me too. I don't want that because I already think about death. I'm already uncomfortable
*  It
*  Gives look I think I need humility in every form but it is an excellent form of humility to me
*  It helps me it helps me be more humble. It helps me be nicer to people
*  No, it does you are nice. I am nice. So what do you know the reason why I'm nice is because I'm a pothead
*  It's maybe a nicer person
*  I've always been nice, but I have less not nice in me than I ever did before I
*  Think that just comes with age. Maybe two for sure. You're very old. Yes
*  Ancient no barely alive. Uh, I'm halfway dead for sure unless everything goes amazing
*  What is that? Oh, that's a bug. That's for my friend Maynard. He sent me that from his farm
*  We were talking about one of these fucking things like a black jacket. No, that is that gigantic monster is a tarantula hawk
*  That is a queen name. Oh fuck. Yeah, something out of a bestiary
*  They kill tarantulas they sting the fuck out of them and lay their eggs in their body. Those are monsters. They're so big
*  It's like a little bird
*  So he was explaining it to me and describing how fucking big it was then he sent me one a dead one from his place
*  Pretty cool. I don't think it's dead. I think it's waiting. That's Maynard from tools bug. That's fucking
*  Cloud in the room. It's floating over her side of the room. Yeah, it's trying marijuana's trying to talk to you
*  It's like Eliza. We have creativity for you get it everywhere. It's at all the shows they give you and I just you don't have to
*  You don't have to you just no need no need to do you do anything like do you meditate do you do anything to try?
*  To alter your state. I do a lot of deep thinking
*  I'm not as good at meditating as I would like but I'm very self-reflective. That's good. And I do a lot of
*  Do you feel like women that are confident?
*  Get kind of like more heat like men that are confident don't really get that much heat from women
*  Right, it's almost like expected but women that are confident get hate
*  Like when I if I did a woman's podcast, right and like a women's podcast or a woman's podcast
*  Women's like you're a girl. I did your podcast. I don't get hate would you from women sure
*  I do I guess did it before. Uh, I don't get well
*  I wouldn't get hate from women, but I think for certain amount like
*  Sometimes guys podcast they want to hear you talk about guy shit, you know
*  I talk about football for at least five minutes and I have my own talked about how you were violent as a lacrosse
*  So are you rock hard or what?
*  I think it's um, it's not something that I think about a ton because
*  People are like, oh, you're so confident. It just it's not like I took a pill to become that way
*  I just always operated just the way I was supposed to some people like you some people don't but I think
*  Well, I think people get insecure and I think insecurity for men and women manifests itself in very ugly ways
*  Whether it's women hating other women for being more attractive whether it's you didn't get laid
*  So now you're gonna go shoot up a group of people. Yeah and
*  Insecurity I talk about this in my book is just such a personal ugly thing and people it's you are constantly putting it on others
*  It used to be that a girl could have a hot body and there was zero consequences
*  No, it never was now it was never that girls didn't like it, but there wasn't like publicly espoused consequences
*  Social media, right? Oh, definitely there was hot girls are always called sluts
*  Right always in forever or gold diggers or something like that, but Salem witch trial all the men hot bodies
*  Oh, yeah, but that wasn't real. Do you know what that was about the Salem rich trial?
*  It was it was about ergot they had a late frost and the late frost caused fungus to grow on their wheat
*  no, they thought that fungus contains lysergic acid which is a
*  Very similar to LSD. So while these fucking people were eating their bread and using their wheat and flour
*  They're getting acid poisoned. So they were thinking that everyone was witches
*  Mmm, and it was always probably men that couldn't get laid and now you're talking about in America because it was different Salem
*  Which house that very particular thing but what came before that check to make sure that this hasn't been debunked
*  Well, I can tell you what came before that in the witch seeking out of witches in Europe. Mm-hmm
*  it was this
*  Widespread thing of course to spread Christianity
*  But they had which committees like go from town to town
*  To find people because everybody needs like a scapegoat and then they'd check you for marks
*  And of course a mark could just be a birthmark and then there's trial by fire trial by floating
*  I used to tie women down and weigh them down with rocks and if they drown they weren't a rich
*  Yes, but if you survived then they knew they were witches right you're fucked either way. I
*  Listen to Aaron Manke's podcast lore and he talks about this stuff all the time and he talks about trial war
*  Lore it's awesome about folklore all different kinds and he talks about the different trials
*  So, you know and it's all stuff like that
*  We're like you're kind of damned if you do damned if you don't regardless like if you we set you on fire and if
*  You scar then you're not a righteous man. And if you die you were righteous whoopsie daisy
*  So this is a thing. What was the point? Oh, which is head hot bodies. You're talking about the women having good bodies
*  No
*  what I was talking about is that women when they go on a man's podcast a lot of times is
*  Get women or men rather will hate on them. I know that was gonna say that women have
*  Like today women your body shaming or you're showing an unrealistic body type and you're feeding into unrealistic body expectations
*  I've seen that a lot saying that to another woman. Yeah
*  Yeah, there was an ad that was pulled in England in the UK because it was like a gym ad and these this girl was in
*  A bikini shot hot body. I forget what it was for. I think it was a gym something like that
*  Maybe sunscreen or some shit but this girl had a hot body and they made them pull the ad because it was promoting
*  unrealistic body expectations
*  But I was like what isn't well, here's the thing. It's like it's a girl like she's a real person
*  It's not unrealistic. You could do it. You can get really fat too. There it is. Are you bitch body ready to me?
*  That's maybe in England. That's unrealistic. But in LA that's just normal. That is not unrealistic. It's not unrealistic
*  No, it's just here's my thing. Here's my thing. It's a hot girl. Let's say that's her body. Okay, um, I
*  Do think we have a problem in our society like my boobs are real and because they're big my whole life
*  I mean my adult life people are like
*  Oh those kids real and they can't believe that and I'm like someone's got to have real tits for you to ask if they're
*  Real. Yeah, they're real some some big ones are real and it's offensive but it's also like people are just
*  It's almost like we're so fed all of this fake stuff that when someone actually has it like my eyelashes are real and they're
*  Long and people are always like those gotta be fake
*  I'm like someone had to have had real eyelashes in the first place to measure other eyelashes against
*  so when someone's big or strong, we always assume that they're faking it because
*  Sometimes our noses are fake right but some girls go crazy with the eyelashes
*  They've already got spiders growing on their heads. But my other thing is like I can judge that girl silently. I
*  Don't have to say it to her face. Like you don't have to be a piece of shit about it, right?
*  Well, that's the thing about social media is you can just attack that girl
*  I don't want to be high and I feel like I'm high now definitely not I feel so high
*  Do you I don't know I've been playing with this corn too long. You might be again paranoid. I'm a little sweaty
*  Yeah, yeah, oh the heat on yeah, yeah was cold in here when we first got in here
*  I find those like 59 degrees. I think it's just your body heating the room. Mm-hmm. I
*  come on your podcast because I
*  Genuinely enjoy interaction and I do think you have a really smart cool audience of most of people that think like you
*  I think as a woman or just as a person anytime you open your mouth or leave the house
*  There's gonna be people like you people who don't right?
*  So you just don't focus on the ones that don't because I have found when someone doesn't like me
*  It typically has nothing to do with actually me
*  Well, there's a thing that people do when someone's very opinionated where you wanna for some reason like combat their opinions
*  I've seen people do it even the things that they don't necessarily disagree with
*  They just become a contrarian just to like to fuck but that's what I'm saying. It has nothing to do with what I said
*  It's something in you that you're bothered by and I really try in being autodidactic and I'm being self-reflective
*  When I don't like someone I really try to examine what it is and sometimes it comes down. I'm like, maybe I'm just jealous
*  I'm just jealous. You use autodidactic
*  Don't be jealous. You just did it really well
*  Knock it in there without any but a lot of time it is jealousy versus oh, I really hate their stance
*  It's that but sometimes it's also there's an incorrect way of thinking about people like when someone's confident or someone's brash
*  For whatever reason like we get competitive like fuck that guy. Why is that guy such a dick?
*  Yes, instead of getting like, huh? What do I care? As long as he's not being shitty to me to you
*  I don't care think about it that upsets people because deep down
*  You're reminded that you're not that and those are all the things you want to be sure. He's confident. Oh, he's strong
*  Always good-looking. Oh, I've seen that with men. Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure. I
*  Was all the time if there's like an attractive guy, you know, you'd be like, oh, isn't he pretty short and it's like
*  Maybe he is but does that help you if so if a guy's short, do you feel better now?
*  You know, well, they do that's the only way they do
*  Yeah, but it's not real see the thing is when you shit on someone unless you're being funny if you're being funny
*  I'm all for you
*  But if when you're when you're just being mean about someone like some football player
*  Like he's a fucking pussy keeps dropping the ball like is he really like could you do that job?
*  Come on, man with a freight train coming at you fucking pussy
*  He's just not as good as at football as some of the best people well
*  And it so takes away from I'll use feminism for example when I do have a genuine criticism of someone
*  You're so rarely I talk about this on my special but like you're so rarely allowed to voice it cuz it's like well
*  You're just jealous
*  I'm like or I am in fact doing the correct feminist thing and judging her on merit of what she has done and I dislike it
*  And it has nothing to do with her being beautiful
*  I think the there's obviously issues that women need more equality in in this country
*  I think the issue with the concept of being a masculinist or even the concept of being a feminist is that
*  Everyone automatically thinks you care about that more than you care about genuine general humanity, right?
*  Because you're isolating gender you're saying I'm a feminist. I'm a woman. I support women
*  I support women's rights and women's values and I support feminism empowering women when people hear that they go
*  Okay, you like women more than men, but it might not be that it what it is
*  Is I support the idea that we could be treated equally because men and I love men
*  I love breaking balls with male comics. I married a dude. I have made out with some hot dudes congratulations again
*  I am actually a gigantic frat boy trapped in a feminist body
*  But
*  That all we're fighting for is just to be treated equally and not be made to feel horrific
*  That's it. I'm not asking for a special tree. No, I get it
*  I have zero problem with any of it, of course not
*  But I my my thought on why people react so strongly to it. I do it. It's not a good
*  But I can I get you know, I trust you as an affidavit sign it
*  It's signing where you're like rights
*  But I think that like when people hear it like they kind of have that feeling like oh, she's one of them
*  She's a man hater. It's like it's a risk. It's almost like the word is
*  So heavy so heavy that it doesn't necessarily accurately portray the intent
*  Well, it's so a the intent wrought with historical weight
*  Yeah, and I do think that's changing but I also believe I it's a word
*  I had never used until like three years ago and I picked it cuz I was like well this sort of applies
*  I don't read feminist writings
*  I don't the idea that as a woman you're constantly being preached to by other women like preaching to the choir
*  What it is is I think on a granular level. I enjoy having conversations and most men
*  I know are like they're not these oppressive horrible people and we always look to the extreme left or right to prove our point when an
*  Actual there's a whole population of people who think and feel just like you and that's the key is finding those people
*  Yeah, and communing with them. Well, you're you've always been very pro male
*  You've never had a problem with men
*  But you you're also you're confident and ambitious and when you're both of those things and people hear the word feminist they go
*  Oh, she's one of those like she's gonna be annoying but you're not no, but there's that thing and it goes back to what we're talking about
*  Earlier, it's the fringes. Yeah, it's not like all men
*  Fucking men that want to sue you because they can't go in that's actually more of a guy who's just trying to sue people
*  But like yes, like okay straight pride parade. We were talking about this in the phone straight pride parade guys
*  Right like that kind of shit the worst those guys but it's just the idea of having that people that say all men
*  Like the kind of feminists that say all men. I'm like you're part of the problem
*  Yeah, cuz that's just as bad as some guys saying all women are sluts
*  Right, you are just as bad for marginalizing anyone
*  I was hearing this woman talk about sex and she was like women want this and women want she was on a podcast
*  Women want this and women want you to slow down and women want you to be Jen. I'm like no no no no
*  Women some women do I mean I know some women want to get ravaged look you're talking to a girl who speaks in
*  generalizations for a living like women do this but by and large
*  You know jokes for sure and by and large most you know
*  These things are right because these it's you proved it over years and years
*  But I also like sex podcasts are like so not my thing
*  Well, it's just so crazy to speak for all women like trying to speak for all men
*  So if I said men like to be ballgagged men like to be kicked in the balls men like to be tied up and pissed on
*  What is Joe do their shit? They want you to shit and top it where and send it to them
*  Well, that's true. Some men like that. That's real
*  Question okay, does that get into that territory where now you're on stage and you have to start saying some not all speaking for me
*  It's personally I know for me. Well, we have this thing where we are
*  We don't look at things granularly and we're like, well, they said all so they must mean all and fuck them
*  Well for me, it's been a little bit of a change
*  Where it got in my brain you're gonna be fun Joe, who's your buddy? You're Rogan. Yeah, don't worry about it. We're gonna be fine
*  I have a dog. It's outside. It's cute dog. I keep remembering. I have a dog
*  Very sweet you want to talk about her the little situation sure it's crazy. This little girl was on her way to China
*  No, no, she's from China. Yeah, well, they don't import the meat. They were gonna eat her
*  They were gonna eat her. She has a scar around her nose where her mouth was bound like it's all around
*  It's very sad. I noticed it yesterday. I thought she just cuz she's a white dog
*  I thought she had like tear marks and then I noticed and went all the way around and then
*  But I also realized that she lets me kiss her on the mouth. So she's not weird about that
*  I got her less than 24 hours ago. Yeah, I was I make candy every year for the Comedy Store Christmas party
*  I make it for all the employees and it's actually a really difficult thing to hand out because out of uniform
*  I can't remember who works on who doesn't like, you know a couple waitresses. I remember last year. I had my bag of candy
*  It's his homemade sponge candy and I went up to this girl and I just said do you work here?
*  Meaning if you do I'm gonna give you candy, right?
*  It was as if I had set her mother on fire. She goes no, sweetie
*  I'm a comic and I was like I just walked away but it's like but are you because I don't know who the fuck you
*  Are but also like don't be a bitch. Yeah. Well just say no just say no. I was just trying to suss out
*  Work there. Yeah, so I brought this candy. I do it every year. I'm home yesterday
*  I asked my husband to get sugar and
*  We didn't have we had like half a thing of sugar because he accidentally used all of it making something whatever
*  So I was a chef we had a holiday party, but he you know when you say he accidentally used it
*  You say it like he's an apple. He didn't know no
*  He didn't realize he had used so much in making this cranberry thing and he said I thought I had I left you more
*  But I needed more so I called a friend. I said, can I have some of your sugar?
*  She's like, why don't you just go to the store at the bottom of the hill and get it?
*  And then this little dog. Well, I go there and there are these two. What are they?
*  Beagles and they were for adoption and I really want a dog and there was a giant husky that was like your size
*  And I was like, maybe I'll have a husky was too big and I'm starting to like convince myself
*  Like maybe I have a beagle and the lady was Chinese. She was like we have more dogs in the car
*  She opened up the car and there was like seven cute little white dogs and I picked up this one and I just started crying
*  My dog died while I was on tour in Japan
*  I never got to say goodbye to Blanche and I'm just crying and I'm holding this dog and she's white and I was there
*  To buy sugar and it like I do the girl thing where I'm like and she's white and it's sugar and she's sugar and it's cosmic
*  Cut to me just putting three hundred dollars in a cardboard box with no receipt. No paperwork
*  I gave this Chinese lady my phone number and I have a dog now. Her name is tofu
*  So this lady goes to China and brings him back. Yep. Wow, that's heavy and they were all like schedule
*  Move to go by Laurel Canyon, you know, you think that's so many fucking LA people that love dogs in that area
*  So many people and it must work cuz she wouldn't set up. She's a good spot for dogs. You could have dogs here
*  You know, like everybody has a fucking dog, you know, it's really weirdly not a dog friendly city is New York. Yeah
*  Well, it sucks. I mean unless you live right next to Central Park. I mean to have a dog. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, if you're in a fucking apartment, you're in a seventh floor walk up and your dog's got to take a shit
*  Jesus Christ, you got to walk down seven flights of stairs
*  Dog out. Yeah, and then the dogs like sniffing like hey fuck face
*  Shit already and there's so much garbage. Yeah, my dog one time found all the pieces to a full Thanksgiving dinner
*  Oh my god on the streets
*  There's so much garbage New York gets gets weird and then you have to pick the shit up, too
*  You know
*  I saw there was a bunch of people in Brooklyn that got mad because they have this they have these trees and then they have
*  The trees sort of fenced in and people were taking their dog putting it over the fence letting the dog shit and then picking it
*  Up they're putting signs up there
*  They took pictures of these people put signs up and like this is not a toilet
*  Meanwhile all of them throw their cigarette butts in the street a lot of them
*  I lived in Brooklyn for seven weeks this year because I was shooting my show and I was appalled you think of New Yorkers as
*  This intelligent race and they're all just thrown. I'm like cigarette smokers almost universally do that
*  It's where do you and I I I just went on a rant about this recently. Where do you think that's going?
*  Think about it. My friend John actually I confront him about that
*  He's like somebody gets paid to pick that up. Nope. I did it to a comedy store work the other day
*  He threw it I go
*  What are you doing? You'd be better and he picked it up
*  You have to shame someone so that they remember people I love and respect do that in the back parking lot of the comedy store
*  I'm like, what are you doing? You're littering. You gotta say something. I don't think of it as littering
*  There's something weird but like think but think of it, right? Think of it
*  Why do you think they don't think of it as littering because it's always been done and they think someone's sweeping it up
*  It's not only are these cars are just going in our oceans and in our fish. These could set fires
*  It's just overall health and also don't be a piece of shit. Don't throw things on the ground
*  Yeah, not even food like we all think you throw an apple core out. It's okay. It isn't that attracts animals
*  It doesn't like it's a parts where it shouldn't be like on a road driving by a wooded area
*  I'm the fucking wooded area, but people just throw trash out
*  Nobody considers realize that like this is your community and this is your home
*  Yeah, and it I won't even drink out of plastic
*  Yeah, the cigarette thing is one of the weirder ones because I always felt like maybe it's because they're they're treating themselves like shit
*  Yeah, here's a question. You're driving down the road with your window open smoking a cigarette
*  So, you know that the smoke needs to you know, the smoke is bad because you're letting it escape
*  Why not just roll up your window and smoke it in your fucking car and kill yourself quietly?
*  Why do you have to have it open or smokers that stand in the doorway?
*  I'm like it's not any warmer near the doorway if you're smoking outside
*  You're just making it so that we all have to smell like cigarettes leaving the building
*  They don't give a fuck about that smell that smells weird because the smell of pipes is actually nice
*  Tobacco's yeah. Yeah, someone has a night like the smell of cigars. I like the smell of cigars. It smells good to me
*  The smell of cigarettes is always shitty and it's I don't know why we can't put
*  Perfume doesn't last cigarette smoke lasts four days and I
*  Want that in a purse clothes it gets in your clothes like nothing else
*  What have you yeah, isn't there like something pretty you could burn just like wave it around your body some sage type deal
*  To do what to get a good smell like instead of perfume? Yeah, just wave it over your cooter
*  Put on your feet. So my vagina burns just no no, no like get smoke everywhere
*  Oh, what if you did poo-poo-ree that stuff that you spray?
*  What if you do that on your body and then walk through a cigarette would it deflect?
*  Who would win
*  Who would win the bad smell the good smell who will represent us in a science off?
*  I'm walked by this lady the other day
*  I had to stop cuz I was tying my shoe and this lady her perfume was so strong
*  I literally wanted to stop tying my shoe and move away from her
*  You know some people just go ham with the perfume. Yeah, like I know that's not what you smell
*  I find it more often as with cologne. Oh, yeah
*  I'm just like oh, it's gross. Yeah, it is gross cuz it triggers something. You're like this feels cheap
*  This feels like I'm 20 in a shitty bar. Yeah, when I see a dude doing a cologne commercial
*  I'm always like do you wear that stuff man? No. Hey Brad Pitt. You really wearing cologne? He doesn't have to
*  Does he do cologne commercials probably in like Japan does right? Yeah. Yeah, Julie Roberts has that one
*  That's a weird European one where she's got her hands tied to like marionette strings
*  But that was a thing back in the day
*  Damien pulls it's on that one side or right in front of you over here, too
*  But the weird thing is back in the day like actors would never do commercials because if you did a commercial
*  We all knew even people that were non-actors and at the end. Yeah, there was something wrong. So they go over somewhere, right?
*  I mean wouldn't you here's a million dollars just say that you like this beverage
*  Now everyone sees everything
*  Yeah, but back in the day like we'd find out that like oh Julia Roberts does big-time commercials in Japan. You'd be like what?
*  Here's the thing
*  There will be no day of reckoning like I always think about this with acting you make a shitty movie
*  Seldom is anyone ever in an interview gonna be like remember that piece of shit you made like you never have to atone
*  In person for a bad film choice because no one would have the balls to shit on you for trying to make money and make a
*  Living there is Chanel. There you are. I remember that commercial that is so preposterous
*  If I was Brad's friend, I'd play that every time I went over his house. I would walk in with a boombox
*  I'd have him wait if you came over my house
*  It would be on every television and I would go tell me when he's at the door
*  Tell me who's at the door ready go play that's peak pit right there to look at the hair legends of the fall hair
*  Yeah, that's it. That's the fucking man who lives in the woods hair. Look at him. Hey, how you doing? He's a beautiful man
*  Beautiful not as beautiful as J's mom. Oh
*  I was on set with this actor named Ryan Hansen who's in like Veronica Mars and he's really and we were he was just we're
*  Talking about like would you rather and we were just playing this game and he was like, who's your celebrity pass?
*  I'm like no one it will wreck your marriage
*  But I just said I thought Jason Momoa was hot and he just goes oh he would treat you right
*  But then when the time came he would fucking lay it down and I was like, yeah put that velvet scrunchie on me into it
*  Okay, so many different kinds of hot weird that that dude's describing how another guy's gonna fuck you though. We're weird. That's cool
*  It was cool. Okay
*  Uh
*  He's just hot handsome fella. I mean guy too really nice guy and that scar is from a bar fight
*  Is it so manly? Yeah, it's not like painted on it's legit. He could have lost an eye could have but it didn't
*  Yeah, he's okay, right
*  Like old Frazetta paintings of Conan. Yeah, big scar across his forehead cut into his eyebrows
*  I feel like you would want that like you would want a face scar. Mmm, right?
*  But probably kept fighting I definitely would have got one I would have got some I just kept fighting yeah
*  I don't want a face guy. I've got a small one
*  Do you what happened an Alaskan Malamute bit me on the face on Thanksgiving?
*  Those are weird ones. Those Malamutes bite people in the face. I will be honest. I was taunting the dog
*  I was like eight and it got a challenge. I hear about German shepherds biting people in the face, too
*  I love a German shepard. Oh, too. I've never had one, but I respect their great dogs beautiful dogs
*  They're smart and a Belgian Malinois as well. Oh, those are real smart the movie
*  I just did I had to do like a little half day of training with a Malinois for this scene and
*  I had to like hold its collar before I let it go and that dog pulled me
*  Yeah, they're fucking strong. No joke. Have you ever seen some of the videos where they jump up like these preposterous heights?
*  Yes to grab things like a vertical. Yeah, just 20 feet straight up in the air
*  They jump off people's shoulders and straight up in the air. It's I don't know where they get the propulsion
*  They're just ridiculously powerful athletic dogs that are designed to attack people. Yeah, that's what my tofu is gonna be
*  Yeah, I mean they're yeah, I think so. She's got it in her. She's vicious. Yeah for five pounds
*  She fucked you up, but those Malmois and German shepherds
*  They need work one of the things that people do they make a big mistake is they get a dog like that and they don't do
*  Anything right? That's a working dog. Like if I had a dog like that, I'd take it with me all over the place
*  I would run it every fucking day. I would throw a ball with it
*  You got to give them active things to do. It's German. It loves precision and productivity. Well, it's a guard dog
*  Yeah, you know, it's it's big. Look at that. Look at that dog
*  Yeah, I mean what in the fuck that dog can fly don't can be in the NBA and then how about how the dog lands?
*  Like a cat on this this
*  Thing but they know how far it's gonna go. I thought is an insane amount of athleticism. That was a human. I mean that
*  We're watching a dog combine. Yeah, it's like the Hulk that would be like the leaping through the air like the Hulk
*  It's always hard for me at the airport when I see like, uh, like a drug sniffing working dog
*  But it's like a yellow lab. I'm like really I can't pet the yellow lab. I don't I don't
*  You could ruin the dog. I don't want to ruin the dog and his chances at retirement. You could ruin it
*  I'm not going to yeah
*  Those drugs drug sniffing dogs make me fucking nervous because I'm like, what are they looking for?
*  No weed that's the truth, but you could only teach a dog to look for one thing, you know, you can't
*  Hey
*  You can't teach a dog hey, I want you to look for guns and coke right it's like residue right or right, right
*  Do you smell gunpowder do you smell marijuana? Like what do you smell?
*  Like what do you what do you train you train the dog to smell heroin mushrooms? Bring them back, right?
*  Find them find them you little fuck. Yeah, definitely the heroin because I think you could make more things out of that
*  Well, it's one that kills you that's one of the reasons why they should look out for heroin fentanyl
*  I think it's smell fentanyl. That would be nice. They can smell fucking anything, but I feel like fentanyl is it's more local
*  I'm actually no, I don't know what I'm talking about
*  I feel like with prescription drugs like that's more like it ravages a community and
*  I don't when I think of like airplanes
*  I think like weight being pushed through from other countries, but I don't know I think it's all things math. It's everything
*  It's the really fucked up part about it is it's almost like what we're talking about with football that football be safer if there was no
*  Helmets, it doesn't make sense and drugs would be safer if they were regulated if they were legal
*  I feel that way about prostitution. Yeah, and I'm gonna actually broach this here. I was gonna write a joke about it
*  I'm just gonna say it I believe a
*  State issued if you apply for funding for support
*  You're going to school like a loan or the state's paying for you to go to school
*  You get a scholarship
*  You should also be able to apply for a state issued prostitute if you are a little socially awkward
*  Maybe you haven't had sex
*  Because men get weird if they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is or they haven't had sex and you're going to college
*  Let's get you a prostitute. Let's get you having sex twice a week. So you you're not afraid of women
*  Let's get you a little less weird
*  Let's fund a prostitute. Well, I think if it didn't have the social stigma behind it
*  There's a lot of people that would choose it over working at Wendy's
*  Great did a lot of people that choose it
*  The social stigma is that there's something wrong with it, right?
*  Because it's a woman saying I want to do this with my body that's what's upsetting it's sort of that but it's also well in
*  This country. It's also connected to sex slavery
*  We think of it as like if someone is doing that then maybe maybe they are a sex slave
*  Like maybe there's someone who's I think that's less on people's radars and it more has to do with the puritanical idea of
*  There's a little bit of that
*  But I mean that was one of the things that they were accusing Robert Kraft of you remember Robert Kraft
*  Who owns the Croft or craft it's craft right he's the guy who owned the New England Patriots
*  He went to a massage parlor in the game a happy ending and then the next thing you know that you know
*  They arrested him and told him there's a video of it
*  And they were you know
*  They're trying to get him to plead guilty and all this all this different shit that was going on to a guy who's like
*  Insanely insanely wealthy who just was going there to get jerked off
*  But one of the things they said was that it was that he was participating somehow in sex trafficking
*  And so they were accusing him of that they were that was a big part of what the police were saying
*  Well it turned out that none of the girls that worked there were sex traffickers
*  They're just prostitutes and the woman that did it to him
*  She was like 40 years old but none of this would have happened if it was legal none of it regulated legal
*  But also they were using that term
*  To they were accusing him of this thing and using that term like to brand are you telling me that shame?
*  There was a news story where they used a buzzword
*  Yes
*  Yeah, it is buzzword right, but it's a buzzword
*  That's it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you would want someone to face
*  Whether they just went there to get jerked off or they participated in sex slavery
*  Right you're not a part of a ring
*  I mean you are because the ring ends with you so because there's a demand for it there is a supply
*  So that is by and large a part of the issue
*  And I say this not knowing a ton about sex slavery
*  But I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize it
*  But if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very quickly weed is a great example
*  Right. Yeah, you could do that
*  And even we've done this with women and bodies and the way that we look at people who are overweighed and we look at people
*  With different things like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing
*  I think you could do that with prostitution
*  I think so too and and it's fine and
*  Look at it as like this is her choice
*  And if there if there wasn't an exception exorbitant demand for it wouldn't be a thing
*  Yeah, it's just you you can't tell people what to do with their bodies any other way
*  Except when money's involved. Yeah, that's where I have a problem with it except when taxes are involved
*  Yeah, but it's it's it's not even that it's it's it's a societal position, right?
*  If we're gonna vote on it
*  Most people would vote on no prostitution because they don't want their daughter or their sister their mother to be a prostitute
*  That's how that's so or or them. They don't want to be a prostitute. That's why they would vote on it
*  But this the only thing that's completely legal to do like not only that but it's what sells everything when Brad Pitt
*  Is fucking selling cologne? He's selling I'm a hot man. If you if you get my cologne, you might get some pussy
*  I'm looking right at that mouth. Yes. Look at them. It's beautiful
*  I so that is the thing that is is fucked up about all this like a woman can have sex with as many
*  People as she wants for free
*  Charges then also describe but you can charge for a back rub like what the fuck like why is it?
*  I'm getting off either way, but it doesn't just doesn't make any sense. I agree with you. It's silly
*  I think restrictive when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body. No taxes being paid
*  and
*  The idea of someone being a whore because of our puritanical roots in this country all those things combined make it a volatile topic
*  But at the end of the day if she's gonna make money that's gonna go back into your society that's gonna be put to good use
*  It's gonna be tax. It's gonna be in your community
*  What do you care what she's doing behind closed doors if it's safe and it's regulated just like weed all of a sudden
*  There's standards now. There's a way to
*  Sanitize this. Yeah, I think so and they did it in Australia. They did it in Nevada
*  Yeah, I'm parts of it parts of it, but in Australia they have I mean it's full-on there
*  You can do whatever you want they have they have brothels
*  But I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a perspective on it's similar to the drug issue
*  like I don't want my
*  Friends or my daughters or my mother or anyone I know to be a prostitute, right?
*  So we have this like this position on it. I also don't want them to do coke
*  But I don't think coke should be illegal
*  I don't think anybody should be able to lock you in a cage because you want to get coked up
*  Imagine if it were legal how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade
*  Yes
*  And how many more people would be aware of how much you can do because you'd get actual coke
*  What a lot of the shit you're getting is being cut because you're getting it
*  You're buying it from people that aren't companies, right?
*  If you're gonna buy something from Nabisco if Nabisco is selling coke
*  They put the ingredients on it. It'd be a hundred percent coke. You'd be able to get real coke real coke
*  Nabisco flavored cocaine moreover
*  I mean look in Europe the way that they are with alcohol like Italy
*  For example kids have wine when they're little and sure there's alcoholics there way less
*  It's less of like a rum springer freak out. Yeah when you are able to do something
*  That's a great way to put it a rum springer freak out that what she's talking about
*  If you don't know is the Amish have a thing. It's when they turn like 18, right?
*  They get to go ham they get to do whatever they want. They can watch TV
*  They could drink smoke pot and fuck and they go crazy
*  For a short period of time and then at the end of that time
*  They can either leave the church forever or come back and most of them come back right because it's all you know
*  Also, you're probably so hungover
*  Make me some oat cakes. Get me back to cutting logs
*  Real workout fuck it. Yeah, but it's that's the truth what you're saying is the truth like when you repress people
*  That's when they want to do things really badly
*  Oh for everything and we have this obsession as humans with regulating other people's bodies minds everything with religion with laws
*  Some of them are put in place to make sure we don't accidentally kill ourselves
*  But by that same token if you are dumb like we always have signs like don't touch a live wire
*  Let them touch it if you're dumb enough to do it
*  Well, you should know you should have a sign says don't touch a live wire because it can kill you
*  You know, if you read that sign you still touch the live wire. That's nature doing its thing
*  No, that's what that becomes if you survive is you suing the state while the sign wasn't big enough. Well, that's a problem
*  It's a big problem. Yeah people sue we're very sue happy in this country other countries something happens to you
*  You break a leg on a city bus. Your legs just broken. That's it. It's not someone else's problem
*  Yeah, other countries don't even think about suing people over the shit that people sue for in America
*  It's a weird game, but it's also you know, it's there to protect you. It's there to protect you
*  I think a lot just in discussions with my husband about like food safety and in this country. Everything is so
*  sanitized
*  This like anodyne food system we have where everything is wrapped in plastic and refrigerated and it's all there so that a
*  Health and safety inspector can say this is okay
*  You go to Europe food is just out and people are fine because companies I think it has to do with health and safety
*  Of course, but also liability so much of our regulations and rules are really put in place for liability issues
*  Making sure that somebody doesn't get sued versus your genuine concern for your safety
*  Because we're so able to just it's good and bad living in America you can sue if you feel you've been slighted
*  But you can sue not to really make a point just to make some money. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's not perfect. It's not a perfect system. It's also super complicated
*  there's so many different rules and regulations and laws and things on the books and it's just
*  If we if we made
*  If we made three top rules right now, we'll do four all the way in kind
*  Don't be a C
*  You're gonna say see yeah, is it the sea? I don't like the word you don't like you say it
*  I don't care. You don't say it. How about twat? Can I say twat? Yeah, you're not really old twat
*  Everybody everybody kids are saying it again. It's like lit. It's back. Yeah, it's back. You know what else is fresh
*  Fresh to death fine like that's fresh. That's fine or boring. Someone's fine. He's fine. Hmm. That's coming back guys
*  Don't use it though. You know what? No, I don't say that girl's fine
*  No, right not since like 2001 yeah guys, I think was 80s you guys stop never went away is cool
*  Yeah, right cool has always been cool
*  But now I feel like cool is more like when something sucks you're like cool like it's a sarcastic cool
*  But like no be cool. Yeah, people still use it the right way dope. I'm partial to dope
*  I love dope when I'm like into it. That's fucking dope. Don't like lit has come back very strong
*  I like lit my 11 year old used lit all time
*  It's fucking lit dad
*  Have you heard zaddy zaddy friend of mine is like a zeers daddy. It's a non gender binary
*  No, it's not it's not it's uh, it's like a thing that girls say it's like what is it? It's like a
*  Like a young daddy like it's like a hot term of endearment, right? It's something
*  Z-aid it's like a thing like a hot dad. They learned it on tik-tok. I don't know
*  I think it's a hot
*  With Jamie the urban dictionary guys attractive and fashionable that's what it is with swag and sex appeal. Hmm interesting
*  So yeah, I saw a sentence you might say
*  Did you see that guy at the mall? He was a total zaddy and then we'd be like, what's a mall?
*  2017 but I think it's already dead. I think that turns dead. There's a rap song. I think it died
*  Oh turn that off. Shut it shut it down
*  Good Lord
*  Out of your hair you wanna leave
*  So we say I can stay you can stay let's stay let's talk for a little
*  Okay, but we're just talking about before that
*  Before we got into lit. Oh, I was saying we should make some rules, right? Yeah, you were saying don't be a see
*  You don't like that word. I just I don't use it. I don't care. What is good twat never went away
*  Just didn't get that popular. It's sort of like
*  It came like an alpha Romeo. It's like a fringe totally. You know, I'm saying totally fringe fringe car
*  It's not something people talk about regularly
*  I'm all for like a brutal. It's always funny when someone's peppers in like a brutal term for vagina
*  Like but it's not a vagina term when you say cunt like let's know first
*  For my friends that live in Australia, like my my friend Adam Green tree. They just say it throws that thing around like it's a beach ball
*  It's actually a weird
*  Adjustment for them. They come in England to they come here and we're like dude
*  But like bloody hell like we don't say that and that's the thing there. So New Zealand
*  They have that too style bender has a t-shirt says something about good cunt. This is just as good cunt. Were you
*  On the show the other night in the main room
*  There's a kid sitting in the front row his shirt in big bold letters just said fuck Hitler
*  Oh boy, and I was like, I'm not on a limb. I hope it's not an ironic t-shirt and I was like you're obviously not Jewish
*  he's like I'm not and I'm like you just this is how strongly you feel and
*  I what I agree with the sentiment
*  I would never wear a shirt that said fuck on it and I was like it's just so jarring to read fuck that big that
*  The rest of the sentiment for me evaporates. Yeah, I just think putting curse words on your shirt is just so aggressive
*  It's definitely aggressive. I saw a guy with a t-shirt on in Vegas that said I'm with Trump fuck the rest and
*  the fuck the you and the C
*  Had been turned into asterisks. So you had to figure out what it said
*  So like you saw flick the wrist you saw the K and you saw the F
*  I was looking at that show. I'm like what it's so Las Vegas
*  Oh my god
*  I those shirts and shirts that remember like there was like this ironic t-shirt craze for a very long time that would be like
*  It would say done only dorks were there would say stuff like the voices in my head. Tell me what to do. Yeah, we're like
*  Like sarcasm department like I'm a cool nerd, you know what that shirt means you got ripped off you bought that stupid t-shirt
*  That's all it means. That's all it means. You're the type of knucklehead that buys a self-defining t-shirt
*  This is my ethos. This is who I am
*  How dare you?
*  What are you wearing a regular shirt? Oh, I got an aggressive shirt on what is it? I even have an f-word on it
*  oh my god, it's a skull with a fucking with a
*  It says camouflage hat what does it say at the top says Marines never die they just go to hell to get
*  What does it they just go to?
*  To hell to regroup. Okay, it's a vent. I love vintage military sure
*  So is that like a legit vintage shirt like somebody made it in the 80s and it survived in someone's basement
*  They brought it to the it's it's a term. I've heard like they never died
*  They just go to hell whatever and I've had the shirt for a long time and I got it from a vintage store
*  I
*  Had a friend of mine that I used to work with in
*  Construction he had a t-shirt or a tattoo rather that said death before dishonor and some guy came up to me
*  Was she were you in the service? He was no, I just always liked it
*  Go alright. I saw somebody
*  Something I'm a set the other day was wearing it and I gave him so much shit
*  He's just some dude. I'm like, you know what it says. Yeah, I just liked it
*  I'm like, what does it mean to you that I was just a shirt my wife picked it up
*  I'm like, it's just such an aggressive statement
*  And you're mad at him I wasn't mad you a little man I asked him sound like you're man. What is this?
*  Term I love that term. I love a good gaslight gaslighting is weird twat. Here it goes first
*  That's the second one a person
*  Stupid or obnoxious is number one a woman's generals
*  I mean who says sticking in my twat like during sex that'll be that'd be a nightmare
*  Because what's after that like where do you go from there if that's what you open with when a girl says put it in my
*  Con it's gotta be jarring
*  Like what is what are you saying? Why are you saying it like that? Even even
*  Is so aggressive and sometimes you have to but you can't say penis right? Yeah put your penis in me. Yeah. Yeah
*  Right. I still do a bit about the word cock. It sounds like it's wearing a sombrero and carrying a gun
*  This cock oh, it's just like it sounds manly the word comment it is fucking manly word like penis
*  Liz it's too. It's too soft penis
*  Because I can't get you my penis. Can I put my penis in in your sliv? Yeah, it's like
*  What do you think of my penis?
*  I like my penis
*  It's just like also vagina like actually says my vagina we think of my it's too clinical it is
*  But it's okay cuz it's like you could have like you could a girl can say that I think I think right here
*  I think sending a girl a dick pic and I know I'm opening a floodgate with this but try not to be an animal
*  About it folks if you send a girl a an unrequited dick pic and you just write what do you think about my penis?
*  She's gonna have such a
*  No one gets more dick pics than Whitney
*  I told her that she needs to write like a book and publish all these just blur out everybody's face and publish all these dick
*  Pics and she shares us
*  No, leave the dicks. She shares them to us in this group text that I'm in with her
*  She like it's me and Dalia and Swartz and and chill
*  She'll send us these pictures these guys send her we're all like you got to write a book
*  But this is so gotta write a book have you seen so many there's an app
*  That blurs out part of the picture to make it look like your dick has been blurred out. Oh, it's awesome
*  You're just in there and then I'll just put a blur thing next to your leg
*  Did you see that one dude that they took down his photo on Instagram and all he was doing he was wearing shorts
*  Just a really muscular gentleman with a large hog
*  And he was wearing shorts and they're like like boxer briefs and his dick was so big that you could see it in
*  The boxer briefs so Instagram took down his fucking photo
*  No, that's not cool a dick in briefs as per
*  Restriction it is shrouded and it should be it should have it good way to put it
*  Yeah, and it should stand you are on point with the vocabulary in this podcast. I'm not the famous Jason Derulo. Yes
*  Oh that yes, wait, I'm taking my hat off. I mean, I'm just here. I didn't see this now
*  I just think googled it. It's real recent and dude the guy's got a big hog. He's a very well-built gentleman
*  All around very muscular and handsome with a large hog
*  Put the photo up right now Eliza grace drool over this
*  Look at this gentleman. First of all, very what does this guy do? He's a singer and just answer
*  He's gonna be the new cats. That's what he does. He's gonna be in the new cats
*  How the fuck is a guy that manly in them?
*  Anyway, you can't you can see by the outline of the hog. Oh my god. Yeah, it's quite a hog
*  But you know what it's not terribly you gotta look for it's not terribly prominent it's not she's not taken down
*  What is he gonna do? He's got you got a problem because he's got a big dick
*  Is that really was getting it taken down who complained some asshole? He should put it back and just blur it out
*  Did he put it back up? Yeah, did he blur it? I don't know
*  I could he should just put it back the way it is really it's fine. He should protest it. He should it's nonsense
*  With that the guy shredded with a large hog. Congratulations, sir
*  You shredded with a large hog. Yeah, he's shredded with a large the American dream. It is the American dream
*  He's you're shitting on the American dream Instagram. You're un-american. That's if you don't like a shrouded hog
*  He did cover it up. What do you do pixelated? You put a big cat? He put another dick over it
*  He did he cut another he put a subway there
*  That's way better he put a subway sandwich there that's fucking hilarious
*  Yeah, I don't he should be congratulated on his physique as well
*  That's some long hours in the gym right there. That is some high weight low rep. Yeah, a hundred percent that dude is that dude is working out
*  Yeah, that's working out. That's just doing shit and showing his hog. What is the problem folks?
*  Is that what we're scared of hogs behind cloth also who says social media has to be a bastion of purity?
*  Yeah, right. It's waiters not garbage wasteland
*  I love Twitter for that Twitter shows all kinds of fucking and sucking and chaos. It's maybe because Facebook owns it
*  I don't know
*  Probably yeah, I think they just don't want porn on it
*  They don't want porn and and mostly really violent images are hidden like you have to click on it
*  I'm okay with that because I follow a lot of like nature accounts and maybe today
*  I don't want to see a baby seal club, you know, and it's good to know that those images are there
*  So it's present in your mind, but define porn. Is that porn and if it's like that guy's not porn
*  Right. So what's where do we draw the line here Twitter would have no problem with that Twitter keeps up most things
*  In fact, they took down when Tim Dillon did that Meghan McCain spoof when you've ever seen that
*  Well, the best fucking things on the internet Tim Dillon as Meghan McCain, do you know Tim?
*  You know Tim Dillon. Oh my god. He's fucking hilarious
*  He's a big heavy gay guy who does the best Meghan McCain of all. He's a hilarious
*  But you you can't put a label on this guy. He's brilliant. Okay, and he's so fucking funny pull it up for Eliza
*  Look at it bring it to the beginning bring it to the beginning. Give me some volume
*  What's going on
*  What's holding on here?
*  Moment moments away. We're moments away
*  Is it not on mute? I think what is happening? No, it's not
*  Fuck. I mean I get the joke. No, no, no, no, I need to get it harder
*  He goes hard in the paint. See if you can sort that out. Jamie will sort it out. Anyway, um
*  But but anyway Instagram took this down this video
*  You can only get it on YouTube and on Twitter now Twitter left it up Twitter leaves up everything
*  I think two of the highest forms of comedy are people falling and men dressed as women. Oh, yeah, it's never not funny
*  Here it goes, but bring it from the beginning. But here's thing Meghan McCain blocked him on Twitter. Well, I wouldn't love that either
*  Yes, she did
*  Yeah
*  They've asked someone from Megan is asked to be on this podcast and I would have her on with Tim in a heartbeat
*  Before my father died I had a baby with him and we're going to it will be raised in captivity
*  It'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever lived
*  My name is Meghan McCain and I'm on a news show called The View and Donald Trump that fucking riverboat
*  Casino captain is talking shit about my father
*  My father was tortured for a hundred years for this fucking country and he came back and he started seven wars
*  Because he's a gentleman fuck you Trump
*  I'm gonna wear my father's skin mask and I'm gonna primary Trump from the right come on the view bitch
*  If you're that tough come on the view you want it. I like sounding in a car. It's your good dance
*  You want this shit?
*  But I won't fuck you because the only person I'll fuck is dirty
*  Riverboat casino captain he's fucking genius. He's an animal funny and good dude to really really good, dude
*  Um, what was my point? Oh Twitter had no problem with that. What about freedom of speech? Yeah, what about freedom of speech? That's funny
*  He's being funny. Come on. He's not inciting a riot. He's not calling for anyone
*  Is it her favorite thing ever? No, but where do you draw the line then? It's not her
*  He's making fun of her saying things. She never said it's funny
*  It's all it is. It's funny. But also it's like if you're gonna get that taken like where where is that line?
*  Where is that and no one can laugh at anything now, right?
*  I completely agree and who's deciding unfunny people exactly unfunny people are in charge of comedy in
*  in studios in meetings and pitches in comedy clubs in
*  Audiences and the fate of your career rests on in the hands of someone who is not qualified to handle comedy
*  Not only that the hands of someone who wants to let everyone know they're woke let everyone know they're adhering to progressive ideology
*  Let everyone know they're upholding these community standards. They all decide are important
*  Inclusivity and I was reading about this girl got fired from a show
*  They didn't bring her back because she
*  She said that she she had all these requests for people being cast on the show. She wanted an interracial couple
*  She wanted a gay character. She wanted all these things and they didn't do it
*  They got rid of her and she was complaining that they got that they they're not in favor of inclusivity
*  Imagine if you wrote a show just imagine if you're a writer you wrote a show got the show you got this idea
*  I'm gonna do a shop a coffee shop and these people work there and have them interact with customers some crazy stuff
*  I have it all written out and someone who you cast you say, okay, you're gonna be Thelma. You're gonna be the waitress
*  She's like, yes, I like that. Yes. Okay and get it
*  She gets the part then she's like I need you to have a transgender couple. She was the actress not the writer
*  No, not the writer. I want you to have an interracial couple
*  I want you to have I want this to be inclusive
*  Inclusive and they're like, what is this lady doing? Well, are you writing the show? Are you an actor?
*  No, I I'm all for all of these things. I think sometimes
*  What we have to be afraid of is tokenism
*  You want it always to be an organic story and we do have a problem with not populating our worlds with enough
*  Variety because white people see white things and people see things a certain way
*  You never want the tokenism like I never want to think I'm somewhere just because I'm a girl
*  I want to be there because you know, but it's tough because where do you draw that line for my sketch show?
*  Which comes out in the spring?
*  For my sketch for my writers
*  I wanted a diverse writing team because I wanted to make sure that my that we were not so much inclusive
*  But also that we were making a smart show that wasn't just from one you want a different perspective
*  But you also wanted quality
*  You wouldn't sacrifice quality just to get a demographic
*  No
*  And so what I did was because to me this was an infallible way to do it
*  I had all the writers packets because people submit writing packets and samples
*  I had their names taken off of it so that when I read your packet
*  I was reading it and I could only base my opinion on the content of the comedy good idea
*  I ended up with three Jews
*  But it really we had 28 submissions and there were some we like some we didn't we know we narrowed it down
*  But I never knew what the person's name was or what they looked like
*  Until I said I like it and we scheduled a meeting good for you. That's smart. That's a great way to do it
*  That's a meritocracy. That's what you really want, you know, and the thing about this inclusivity
*  It's like yes, you you want a world where everyone gets a chance
*  But you don't want a quality of outcome that doesn't work that way
*  What you want is people to rise to the top and when you're dealing with like
*  Mathematics you're gonna get a lot of European Jews, right?
*  You got a lot of Asian people why because they've they've studied that like pretty extensively in their countries
*  It's been a part of their heritage for a long time
*  It doesn't mean that like you're you're being discriminatory against Italian Americans
*  It just means like these are the people for whatever reason that are more
*  invested in that particular way of thinking and you can we can begin to
*  Create opportunities and ways into things so that in 20 years, maybe it is. Oh everybody goes to see
*  Whatever ethnicity of doctor we can create these opportunities. Yes, but nobody wants to sacrifice performance just for that
*  But that's why go out of your way to include someone but it can't be a crock
*  We're just mandating things and that's for women. That's for anything. I want to be somewhere cuz I'm good
*  Yeah, yeah a hundred percent. We we want to concentrate on is having people have the quality of
*  Opportunity to explore different things that they want and that should be there and there should be programs created and sometimes it does you do have to say
*  Well, we need to take X amount of this many types of people to create that
*  But if you're given the chance and you do well, you're even that much of more of a hidden gem
*  I always say this with when girls
*  I see like a lot of girls get upset like and I can't get on this show and I can't do this and that
*  But when you do get on a lineup and you fucking crush, you're the one everyone's gonna talk about
*  So when you're given this opportunity to fucking nail it like it might be hard getting in there
*  But when you have that chance you can't use things as a stepping stone woman and as a crutch the next
*  so just know that like if you're the only girl in a lineup for example, and I'm speaking from a world that I live in not
*  For anything else and you fuck up people are gonna think all women are like that because you were the sample
*  Yeah, I would prefer them to not think about at all
*  Just think about being the best that they can be and don't concentrate on your gender at all
*  You don't but I think it's something that's always brought up and put in our faces
*  So if you have to just know that if and when you do succeed and you are good or just as good
*  People will remember how great you were and you will shine more than just like the other average dude 12 dudes that were on there
*  Well, I think that's one of the good things about comedy communities. Is that when people are good they get respect
*  They get it is merit based. Like I said, there's no brilliant comic out there not getting any credit
*  Yeah, whether it's Ali Wong crushing or you or you know, name the woman Whitney name a woman who's good when they're killing
*  They're killing because they're a great comic and everybody gives them props
*  It's not this thing where like the men are versus either way to do the men
*  But to say the guy thing if you are a mediocre like male comic, especially now
*  You're not going anywhere because there's so many people doing comedy and the odds are so against you
*  You've got to fucking bring it and that gets rewarded
*  Yeah, for sure. We've all had to up our games because it's just so much. It's so popular now. Yeah, it's exciting though
*  It's a lot of competition. It's great time for all of us. It really is
*  It's just the comics are more in control. You can make more comedy. There are more opportunities when I started in comedy
*  I like nobody paid you for spots and
*  Now you get paid the comedy started but like small shows nobody gave you money. There weren't that many
*  I remember I had to run one there. There's so much more out there
*  So you've got to go and carve that out for yourself because it's definitely there for the taking
*  Yeah
*  It would be interesting if there was a service that let people figure out like how to start off as an open mic er
*  Like like an LA based service like if you pay like five bucks a month
*  They'll give you a newsletter that shows you where all the different spots are and yeah or
*  It should be a little harder or figured out yeah figure it out
*  And then once you figured it out you got it and or it's your friends ask my friend
*  There are shows my husband always jokes because we pass a Baja fresh
*  I'm like I did a spot there once like an abandoned CVS
*  I did a spot there like there are shows comedy is going on everywhere a lot of coffee shops, right?
*  Yeah, I went to see poetry slam once. Do you ever see a poetry slam?
*  It's so weird. It's so weird. They take it so seriously. They take it so seriously
*  It's one of the most pretentious forms of entertainment that's ever been created
*  Well that like staccato speaking like and putting in your own good doesn't mean you can't be good at it
*  But in terms of overall pretentious level, it's probably the the highest percentage ever
*  Yes, you hear people that are saying that you should do that now
*  You should wave jazz hands because some folks have a real problem with loud noises
*  And if you clap when you like something it hurts their ears
*  Gotta be kinder more gentle. I noticed younger people snap which I think I did a college gig five years ago
*  And I was like, okay, it's not it doesn't feel as validating as a glorious applause
*  But that's like from the 50s
*  It's very it's cool and when girls do it I'm like, yeah, I'm cool. I'm young cool girl, too
*  I'm young and cool. It's like it's also a competition. How loud can your snap be? Is it based on skin thickness?
*  Yeah, cuz your hands are thicker than mine and I have little cricket snips
*  Someone's listening to this just loading a shotgun
*  The fuck do you snap into my ears for a Swedish plate shop?
*  Yeah, there's different kinds of snaps too, right?
*  Isn't there one like you can go across like the top of your thumb with like your second finger?
*  Instead of this is like a dude thing like how dudes like like different whistles
*  What's this thing? Yeah, that's the one they do. What is that? I'm afraid of what is that supposed to be like?
*  Honestly, I don't think everyone's doing it but it's it imitates packing a dip like the dip can
*  Yeah, that's it cuz that's exactly what it looks like my fingers don't make noise that way
*  My fingers don't make noise that way. I mean they make noise that way ligament on ligament
*  Probably not doing it good
*  Things to remember arm farts those were huge when you were a kid
*  Mm-hmm make arm farts everybody figures that out my kids figured it out. They thought they were so smart
*  I'm like bitch. I've been doing that forever. You're just trapping oxygen or this like yeah hand farts
*  Yeah
*  It's just a dry fuck yeah
*  Yeah, oh people
*  People
*  I can get that whistle that's so ear piercing
*  Anything though they can do their lips in a way. I can't whistle when once I suck on my fingers
*  I have to put fingers I can tune each side say I always want to do the finger whistle. I can't
*  You did it well not really that's real a whistle reserved for calling dogs
*  Yeah gunner Brixton right and then you do it or when you want your significant other in the bedroom to fuck right?
*  I guess let out that whistle like it's time
*  Do you need the whistle no you can have a drum set I could literally just be like babe
*  You'd be like is it time to fuck yeah, you said my name come on. Let's go. I'm always ready. I'm always ready
*  Rock hard yeah guys that turn down sucks. That's what I've heard girls talk about that
*  That like you know that they're the ones who wanted it and the guy was always saying no was like
*  Hi
*  He had herpes or he's whoa
*  Interesting think about it great. He's like oh not today. I definitely I've had people talk about that
*  I'm like he had herpes wow good point if he's and by the way if he's having sex with the intermittent like I think
*  There's also that like he's uncomfortable
*  Right most people have it, so that's probably what it is or he's coming down from like doing too much coke
*  Yeah, or there's that
*  Good a lot of people feel like she would know I mean I don't maybe
*  I did a girl. I didn't know she was a coke head
*  Didn't know until after I dated her I didn't date her a lot like I saw her rarely she seemed pretty normal
*  You can conceal that drug just like late nights like I've got a friend who's a total coke head
*  But other than the fact that she talks really fast you didn't know no no I do know, but you wouldn't know oh
*  One wouldn't know well. That's that what Adderall is is people that
*  Like have an affinity towards that kind of thing and they can do it every day
*  That's a that is a giant problem. That's that drug and you see people that have when they're on it. They have this
*  unfounded
*  self image like unfounded belief in themselves like
*  Delusional belief in themselves. It's very it's a very strange drug it's like hubris and pill form yep
*  It takes away all of your inhibitions about expressing how good you are at things and everyone else sucks
*  You find you know you find all these faults in people you don't find any in yourself
*  You have unfounded confidence your ability to get things done like it's a weird drug
*  It's a weird drug a lot of fucking people are on it, but how good a scarface. Oh, it's amazing
*  It's so good to this day, and I don't think his accent everyone thinks that accent's bad. I think it's great
*  It's great
*  It doesn't sound totally Cuban. It's exactly what a Cuban person sounds like maybe
*  No, I know a lot of me and Joey Diaz and so like that, but but he's an American person
*  It's not it doesn't it's it's off. It's off for sure, but but it's really good to find a generation of impressions. Yeah
*  Oh, yeah, it's it's an off impression, but it's it's a really good off impression has influenced almost every rapper
*  Oh, yeah, do you do you remember the curb your enthusiasm episode where crazy eyes killer?
*  Had Larry David over his house, and he's played Scarface 24 7 on the big screen. It's like a Bible. Yeah
*  But I mean it was one of the ghetto boys, but it's an American tale. Yes, what he did sure
*  Yeah, and got the girl came from nothing. Yeah, sir and made his way up. Yeah, even how he came over here
*  Yeah, I can tell he came to the land of opportunity and he had it until Miami PD fucking shot him up
*  Have you ever seen cocaine Cowboys? Oh
*  My goodness one of the best documentaries of all time. My friend Billy Corbin made it
*  Cooking Cowboys one and cooking Cowboys to Billy's been on the podcast a few times
*  He makes a bunch of different documentaries, but those two are just
*  Fucking gems it shows you how goddamn crazy Miami was in the 1980s
*  There was one year where the police academy the graduating class half of them were murdered and the other half of them went to jail
*  Then went to jail for corruption. It was just brutal coke everywhere
*  Yeah, all these pilots talking about coke all these hitmen. They got hit men on film. Yeah talking about all the shit
*  They did it is a crazy doc. It's a brutal drug. Oh
*  It well, it's also what defined Miami. Yeah, there's my buddy Steve was an ophthalmologist shout out to Steve Graham
*  He was an ophthalmologist during his residency
*  He was in Miami in the emergency room and he would he would tell him tell me about dudes
*  Horrific wounds. Yeah, just all this in the face. Just everyone's getting fucked up and shot and stabbed
*  It's like I thought even just from coke like just from doing so much of it getting into your whole face murdering people
*  Sure, I mean it was a goddamn war zone still is I mean not so is but still is a war like just the trafficking of
*  It and what that does?
*  To our neighbors to the south have you ever seen the video the Coast Guard pulling over the Mexican submarine that's filled with cocaine
*  Yeah, and they jump on top it bang on the lid and such as X Machina moment
*  Like who's the guy banging on that?
*  We all want to bang on a floating submarine jump and have be the kind of man that has the balls to jump on a submarine
*  While it's moving through the ocean. Yeah, that's fucking that's a savage move. That's lit. That's lit as fuck
*  All that stuff could be avoided if it was legal if it was legal you'd be buying again you'd be buying fucking Coca-Cola cocaine
*  Which is what our grandparents had? Yeah legalize it sanitize it regulate it tax it Bob's your uncle
*  Yeah, do you know that they still use cocaine to make the flavor for a coca-cola?
*  I challenge that a coca leaf maybe coca leaf. That's okay, but not actually take the coca leaf
*  Cocaine is the byproduct of a coca leaf exactly you're correct
*  They take the coca leaf they extract the cocaine and then it's the number one medical supplier of medical cocaine
*  Takes that stuff from the coca leaves that they can yeah sure flavonoids that they use for coca-cola
*  That's why it tastes so good. It tastes so good. So good
*  they did this experiment where they put some coke coke a coca-cola on the floor and then diet coke and
*  Bugs wouldn't go near the diet coke. Yeah, that's because it doesn't have sugar in it
*  I don't think I think it's I think it's whatever they put in the diet coke
*  Yeah, but they probably wouldn't go down the floor for water either. They know what sugar is
*  I feel like they were sure it works for them. Yeah, but sugar works for them
*  I'm just saying if a bug doesn't want it, but you know how you get like flavor from sugar
*  Bugs don't necessarily get flavor
*  They're they're going to it because they're probably attracted to the smell of it because they know it's going to be effective for whatever
*  They're trying to do with it. I'm just saying the diet coke repelled them it I prefer it though
*  I prefer the taste of diet coke. It's lighter. I like a diet coke on occasion with a little bit of lemon
*  Oh, how about some lime?
*  Racist against limes. Yeah big time. That's where I draw my line everything else
*  I was okay with but this we got a real problem. You get sparkly water
*  They ask you if you want limes you get regular always get lime
*  Yes, which is actually kind of hard to find outside of the country the lime depends on that you go to a lot of countries
*  They're like we have lemon. I'm like lemon and it's not the same but some people just don't have limes
*  Yeah, they don't get it fucking losers
*  Yeah, get some limes in your life get some limes now. You can grow lemons you can grow lime not true. No, no different soil
*  It's just different isn't yeah, you know you see a lot of lemon trees in LA. You don't see any lime trees
*  Maybe it's just people suck
*  Maybe I think we have a an aversion to delicious things here. Really?
*  I really feel like there's so many fruits that we sleep on that like what like durian
*  I have some in my house right now. Does it stink? It stinks at my freezer. It's freeze-dried. I brought it home
*  Did you like it? I liked it fresh there. I thought it was really cool
*  It's weird, but I do it as like a party trick just to watch people's faces contort
*  mangosteen super tasty
*  Mangosteen jujubees, which is I found out recently an actual fruit not just a candy really dried jujubee
*  It will change your life and I brought it to set and all the Asian girls were like, yeah
*  My grandma uses them and I never heard of it and we just what do we have apples and fucking grapes?
*  Sometimes we have melon a little bit of melon cantaloupe. Everybody thinks it's funny to shit on melon
*  Honey do dude, I love them when it's hot out a cold cantaloupe might be one of the best fucking things
*  You can eat in your life
*  Barbara Streisand once said her definition of luxury was not having to scoop down to the skin in a cantaloupe
*  Like not having to go to a bitch
*  It's tasty though. She's probably throwing straws in the ocean to right off her balcony to the fucking fuck these
*  People I went around last night at the comedy store
*  I was like, why is everyone having a straw men shouldn't use straws if you need a straw great
*  What about women? Can women use it? You know what your lipstick's not that sacred, but then the lipstick you're crushing up bugs
*  You're wasting it. I don't know. What about paper straws? Do you need a straw?
*  Let's say that you are not medically incapacitated in any form. Do you need a straw other than a smoothie?
*  I do because it's a good way to make a point
*  What's the point? So like if I have a straw in here and I go well, maybe you should get your shit together
*  I'm gonna suck on the straw. We started look it's like it's like when the old-timey guys take a hit on the cigar
*  And I told her get the fuck out of my room. It's a good punctuation
*  Yeah, I would argue a gurgly sip like I started this this conversation with is equally as shady, right?
*  Like oh and maybe you should eat my shit
*  It is that is just as good. It's actually kind of better. No more straws, but because you're guiding your face
*  No straws are good and they're they're good for a reason. It's a good way to suck liquid through quickly shouldn't just be
*  Your fucking handbag like a savage you could just pull in the straw really like savages drink tea with their pinkies up
*  The issue is biodegradable plastic is very possible. You make it with hemp fiber. It's not hard
*  They know how to do it. It literally
*  Goes back in the earth in 80 days the thing they know how to do a lot of these things and we don't
*  Because it doesn't make money or it people don't they want to maximize their profitability now
*  There's a giant business with all of these things draws and shift over to making hemp plastic
*  It's it's really not that hard easily and what kills me is people like look no straw
*  I'm like, but the whole cup is plastic. These are
*  Just saying we waste a lot of these things. You got a Yeti. That thing is awesome
*  Yeah, I have one pretty good. Can I have one of yours too?
*  I was hoping to get a free one free one for you. Great. 100% got my face on it
*  I feel weird my gift bag drinking your coffee. I've gotten one before so I'd like another one
*  Did you give it away? Did you gift it? What did I do with it? I have it. I think I just have to
*  Um
*  The plastic lids on Starbucks cups those gotta be a problem. There's huge problem. Can't do it with paper, right?
*  I think a pittled water. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Who the fuck would buy that? It is ridiculous. Why's it here? Jamie? This is outrageous
*  You're not no one's that thirsty
*  We're telling Jason Momoa if he comes here. He's gonna shame us all
*  Tell him I said I sort of water like in a can he sells water in a can. Oh, that's why he's shaming it
*  Oh fucking I thought he was just virtual. Yeah, I didn't know that either
*  I just have a filter in my house and I just drink the tap water
*  I do too, but um, we should get some sort of a big jug. Yep
*  Definitely you have the beautiful coffee machine the layer of a matching superfood coffee machine get a layered Hamilton superfood water machine
*  I don't think it works like that. Yeah, ask him. We'll just get something. He lives in the water. He does you can hook it up
*  Yeah, we just need to get some sort of glass containers to keep them on the table
*  Oh, if only we had a container I know I
*  Have to I am the Lorax and I just I'm just doing my part
*  Speaking well, I remember that movie. I remember that book too from when I was a little kid
*  The movie was great. The message is great. I drive a
*  2009 Honda Civic hybrid
*  Because I don't want to get a new car and it's a hybrid and that's the part that I'm doing
*  I know you've had that same car forever. I always shit on you for I love that money lady
*  You have a fat ride you should get yourself an old Cadillac a big purple one or maybe a Lincoln with suicide doors
*  Whoo? Yeah, how about that dark pimp my ride? I can pick up so many now we're talking
*  Lesbo we get as well dark purple super metallic flake. No and Lincoln a big old
*  four-door continental with suicide
*  65 I could get a Cadillac and I could get like a Cadillac emblem like tattooed on me
*  Like old English font, yeah
*  Yeah, I could get it there and I could start finger blasting chicks. Oh, you can do that too. Yeah, call me zaddy. Hmm, okay
*  I'm gonna keep
*  I'm gonna keep the Honda Civic hybrid until the wheels. I just bought a $700 alternator
*  Why are you still honestly? Why do you still have that just to see how long it'll last for those reasons?
*  Do you like to pull into the common store and feel better than people?
*  I would love to show everyone how powerful I am with a nice car. It's a nice car
*  It's a much you make it's a hybrid and I don't need a new car
*  We live in this society that you know
*  You're always trying to posture and show off things and that's fine if a car is your thing
*  But that's just a way that I choose to help good for you. That's it. Well, you're right
*  You know if you want to like be a cons conserver of resources like you're absolutely conserving resources by driving that old shitty car
*  But I think you work hard and deserve a fat ride
*  I'm talking about like a 2020 Corvette with your name does nothing for me pink like a vagina a Corvette
*  Whoa, come on chrome wheels fuzzy dice. Let's go
*  How about a truck with giant wheels like a dude with a little dick
*  Yo, how about you get one of those you say that but like like the lesbian part of me wants a fucking truck get one
*  Just that truck just a truck like in I I don't want to kiss a woman, but I do want that truck
*  Okay, you don't have to kiss her. She can just kiss you. I don't want that
*  And that's cool. Like those are that's the way you are. I don't I but trucks just being from Texas
*  Like my brother's got a nice truck. There's something about being something about a truck
*  Let's just pretend that you decided to get rid of that shit. No, I wouldn't
*  Well Dodge Ram makes a nice truck. Dodge Ram makes a very nice truck. Extended cab. Fuck. Yeah
*  They're your friends can do I like the they have a great dash setup now is there a hybrid 20 models
*  Here's a hybrid. It would be a waste communist. That's what I'm asking for. No, I
*  Got nothing to put in the bed. Get the Elon Musk cyber truck
*  What how dare you that things amazing?
*  I love it up a very narrow some guy next to me is a Hummer, but I live of a very narrow dirt road
*  What does the Hummer do just fucking jack everybody's cars?
*  He drives by and sits there covered in one of those like military flaps that looks like it has fake leaves on it
*  There you go Dodge Ram with the fender flares and big old fucking tires on it
*  Yes, gotta be 35 inch tires, right?
*  Chame is that a zipper on the front of the grill that looks like a no, that's a that's LED lights
*  Oh, that's necessary. It is necessary if you go off-roading. I tell you my first boyfriend in high school
*  Had a Dodge Ram with a lift kit. Ooh
*  And it was it no, but it was I mean people were kind of like this is but it was like a serious truck
*  Fuck yeah a lift kit while it's super Florida Georgia line and like a little white trash
*  Mmm, I don't know when we played Florida. We rented like a big
*  Ford truck
*  Great. It's fun to do in the right context, but I don't need that
*  Well, listen this trucks now that you drive that drive amazing like a Ford Raptor
*  Ford Raptors are super comfortable because there's a lot of travel in the wheels
*  Like the wheels like absorb potholes because it's supposed to be like they're off-road vehicles
*  So they handle bumps better than anything well super comfortable to drive
*  That's if you're concerned about the person sitting in the back, which I seldom and caring anyone
*  So as long as my front is comfortable
*  Sitting in the back sitting in the back of a truck like my brother's truck
*  Like you leave and your necks all jacked up because the shocks are shit. It's a nice car. Like it doesn't feel great
*  No Raptor absorb shit. It's actually pretty comfortable
*  I just don't drive over like crazy rugged terrain at very fast speeds. I am watching America fall like Rome
*  I'm watching our world fall and I don't need a new car
*  I get it and so I just admit that but I do buy other things that are nice
*  I've got my money in other ways. I believe you. Yeah, I believe you listen. I'm not shaming you
*  No, no, I'm a little bit but not really I'm just making fun of you. It's okay shitty fucking car
*  I'll take a look at a
*  1969 Corvette with no air conditioning and no school
*  How did you get an old-school hot rod and just be hot driving around one of those with a stick shift?
*  Rumbling stick. Yeah whistling out the window at girls. Hey pack of cigarettes rolled up in your sleeve
*  Hey, watch me pack this dip. Whoa
*  Check it out hookers. That's it
*  I hit trash cans with my car. Do you oh, yeah. Oh you see you love the fact that your car is kind of a beater
*  I don't go out of my way, but I'm not concerned about it. And more importantly, I'm not trying to attract women or posture as anything
*  So I don't need a nice guy. Don't it's okay. Yeah, it's okay
*  You hate America. Yeah, you hate cars
*  But what if someone gave you a dope car?
*  Like what kind of car would someone like if some someone's like happy birthday Eliza?
*  I think a Tesla makes the most sense because of the emissions and everything. Yeah, I don't want to have one
*  I know I saw you pull in it's dope. I love a big SUV
*  I you know what I always want to throw that fucking Honda right in the garbage if you ever drove my car
*  I would gift it to someone the Honda my assistant who has the same car but mine's a hybrid hers isn't your car
*  I
*  Always wanted a G wagon. Those are dope. It's not not a it's not responsible not responsible
*  But what if you want to go to war and you need something that has three lockers?
*  Three locking differentials you need a of course a German car. They're like this is necessary. It's very nice
*  I probably just drive out of town good move
*  I mean the first to go if we went to the new ones are weird because the new G wagons aren't really a military vehicle anymore
*  It's just really nice Mercedes with very heavy metal doors
*  Well, and you have to get the AMG package of course, and if you don't then it's like it's like you got a three series
*  So is there anything wrong with a three series? Who are you?
*  I'm just saying I thought you were the girl who owns the 2002 Honda and you're shitting on people with three series
*  Yeah, how dare you why I just feel like it's hypocritical a little bit. I don't think so three series is a nice car
*  I'm making a point with mine three series is my dad got this for me and it's like a dipping a toe in luxury
*  I see what you're saying BMW three series is what my friends got when they were 16
*  I had a blazer did you really know I drove that thing all the way down
*  He blazes which the shit it was a it was all the bells and whistles. It was awesome
*  It had a little splash decal why did Chevy stop me like they have a Tahoe?
*  It's like the McRib like they keep they take away things that people love
*  Like they're bringing back the Bronco
*  For 2020 Bronco, it's fucking dope. You want an old Bronco. You don't want the new one
*  You want like that the look of that piece of shit
*  What is that? That's the new blazer get the fuck out of here. It looks like a Nissan. That's a shitty body. That's terrible
*  How is that a blazer? That's a blazer? It looks like a Lexus not there's anything wrong with it

*  No one's off-roading in a Lexus you can though do you know that's the same base as a Toyota Land Cruiser
*  Yeah, I did know it's same chassis. It's everything's a charge. Oh, man. It lifts up
*  It actually has a button we can lift to go off-roading it has locking differential. Yeah, but my Honda Civic Hybrid has a CD player
