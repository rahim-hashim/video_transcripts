# Joe Rogan Experience #1525 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9XzuUXj6Gc)
*  Tim Dillon fresh off a COVID test. How you feeling buddy? How's the nose?
*  Feeling good. You know, when I go out with friends to restaurants in LA, they, you know,
*  everybody gets the gun, the temperature gun to your head, but you know what's fucked up?
*  A lot of my friends, they don't do it. They do it to me. And I'm like, I guess I'm the
*  only one that looks sick because they look at me and they go get them, get them. And
*  then I ask other people, I'm like, were you hit on the way in? They're like, no. So I'm
*  like, yeah, it's weird. It's like arbitrary the way they do it. Everybody. I know. Maybe
*  they think like you're a little bit overweight. Yeah. You could die. They're like, we don't
*  want him dying at Boa steakhouse in West Hollywood. Oh, you could eat outside. I don't want me
*  falling on a TikToker. Boa is an outside place. Boa is all outside. Yeah. All outside. Oh,
*  yeah. Those outside places are, they're, they're doing good. They're jammed. But the fucking
*  inside places are doomed. They're doomed and they will not reopen. Many of them. A lot
*  of them. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big problem. Let me ask you this. When do you think Los Angeles
*  is going to open up back up again? Next spring? Wow. Like April? Well, I mean, it depends
*  what the second wave does, right? If there is a second wave, right? Does the, do we get
*  clobbered in the fall or do it? I mean, by the time LA reopens, it's going to be Terminator
*  here. Don't you think that it's going to be Terminator after November, no matter what
*  we do? Probably. I feel like with all of the fucking tension, like there was a story
*  in Chicago, right? They thought it was a 15 year old girl was shot by the police. It turned
*  out to be a 20 year old man and he was shot, but he was still alive. How did they get that
*  wrong? The fucking telephone game. Right. You know that game. Yeah. Doesn't work. It's
*  crazy. So then everybody goes crazy and goes looting. So like people are looking for an
*  excuse to go crazy. If Trump wins again, it's going to burn. Not only that, it's like, it's
*  going to be the mail-in thing, right? So are they going to do that? 100%. Wow. Yeah. So
*  it's going to take days. I mean, I was assumed they're going to have some polls. Yeah. Open
*  some places and we're not going to know. We're not going to have an answer that night. No,
*  that's going to be a fun week. It's going to be of not knowing who the president is.
*  Remember when it happened to 2000, no one cared. It was funny that we didn't have a
*  president like there was all those SNL skits and you know, everybody's making fun of it.
*  There was no real unrest in 2000, but now we cannot handle the uncertainty of not knowing.
*  We need to know that night. Yeah. The dangling Chad's thing. It was no big deal. It was funny.
*  Everybody was wondering. Everybody was like, what, what, what are we doing? Laughing it
*  off? We were all going, we don't need a president. Yeah, whatever. We were so much more emotionally
*  healthy as a country at that moment than we are now. Yeah. This is funny, but it is true.
*  Cause we laughed. We go, yeah, who cares? Yeah. They go, we're fine. And, but now it's like chaos
*  and we need a break. Like we need a break. Whoever we're like, everybody can't be a political
*  pundit. Like my aunt cannot be writing about trade on Facebook. I think we just leave it all to
*  Alyssa Milano. Yeah. Looking forward to her tweets in November. I'm just going to follow all that.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, she was like, she's got a podcast. We know that she's fine. Yeah. I mean, it's
*  relevance, right? They're all trying to be relevant. Everybody's relevant. Like they have to be,
*  you have to get your opinion out there. It's super important. And that's the way to be relevant.
*  Now is to just be, you know, like be political all day, every day. We go from actor to activist.
*  Yeah. All in very interesting. As soon as the fucking call stop coming in, you're like, all
*  right. I'm an activist. What's so funny is we know because we're like in the, in this thing that
*  getting good at this, whether it's comedy or being an actor, it's very tough. You're not spending
*  your life thinking about other people. Let's just be real for the most part. You're just not. I
*  didn't. You're thinking about your career. Yeah. You're thinking about your career. I spent the
*  last decade thinking about myself, my jokes, my, how do I get ahead? How do I get ahead? How do I
*  get on television for three minutes? Like, so this idea that these people are now going to pretend
*  that they've spent their entire career thinking about global warming, it's just not true. Like,
*  I know these people, like I've met these people and, and my friends have opened for some of these
*  people. And I know that like these people are going out there and they're like, you know, listen,
*  we've got to do this. We've got to do that. They got to move the country forward. But I've seen them
*  make people cry backstage in a theater because there's not enough water in the dressing room.
*  Right. So it's those same people that are really cruel going out and telling everybody how good of
*  a person they are all the time. Well, they find the pattern. They find the pattern, the way they
*  have to talk and the things they have to talk about, lock into those things with no deviation.
*  They find whatever the line is where Hollywood wants, whatever the line is always left. Yes.
*  It's always super progressive, always super woke. And they fucking ride that line like a fucking
*  railroad train. Just choo choo straight down. No deviation. It's so obvious. I know dudes I
*  used to do open mics with who like they're tweeting it Mayor Garcetti. They're tweeting
*  about the budget in LA. They're like the budget's being passed. They're tweeting Garcetti, the
*  budget. I'm like, God, you can't you don't have the money to pay your rent. Like you have no idea
*  what's going on in the world. And you're tweeting at Garcetti about them. And they're doing it so
*  that they can get a job. They're doing it so that somebody can see him and go, you know what,
*  he'd be you know, he'd had a great Garcetti tweet. He should write on Bojack Horseman.
*  That's the way it works. It does kind of work like that. I've just I've never been more amused.
*  It's very funny. But I'm also terrified. It's very we're gonna die.
*  It has both of those things happening. It's like part of me is laughing at how stereotypical
*  everybody is. And how cliche. Yeah. But then part of me is like, this is terrifying. Like the people
*  had each other's throats. It's terrible. People are enemies now. Like, listen, people never loved
*  each other because it's a competitive business. But like, I like people. It wasn't nearly as
*  intense as it is right now. Like the feeling of like, if you disagree with somebody,
*  they are your enemy in comedy, and they want you to not have a job. Like, and I've never felt that
*  way about anybody. I don't care what you if you're funny. I truly don't care. If you're a communist,
*  if you're whatever, whatever you are, you're not you don't have any power. It's not like you're
*  affecting my life. You can believe whatever you want. If you're funny, you're funny.
*  I don't like to say this in generalizations. I don't think I don't believe in generalizations.
*  I love them. I do too. They're fun. I need them. They're the best for comedy. I mean, we need them.
*  Without generalizations, comedy kind of sucks. But more people on the left are doing this than
*  people on the right. Yeah, I don't see that many people on the right. I see a few, but I don't see
*  as many people on the right calling for people to get canceled forever. But the people on the left
*  are like, burn their house, burn them to the ground. Well, the right will do it. The right,
*  the QAnon thing is kind of a way they're doing it where they're like, David Spade's got an ankle
*  bracelet on and he's in jail and Trump's put everyone in the house arrest. They're in this
*  other thing where it's like, oh, you guys have left the planet. And you like so explained to people
*  who don't know what this QAnon is. Well, the QAnon stuff is like, there's this idea that there's an
*  intelligence dissemination operation happening, meaning behind the scenes, high level intelligence
*  guys or military people are leaking information about a shadow war that we don't really see
*  happening. And the shadow war involves Trump and the people on the side of lightness battling the,
*  you know, these deep state pedophile cannibals. Like, I don't know why, like, I don't never
*  understood why they have to be cannibals. I didn't know they were cannibals. They're cannibals.
*  They're eating children and then they get the adrenochroma to keep them young. Oh, that's right.
*  So this is all the end. Then Trump is going to war with all of them. Right. Now, listen,
*  pedophilia is a big problem. They do cover up shit at high levels. 100%. Yes. The Epstein stuff is
*  100% real. 100%. Clinton's on that plane. He's on that Island. 26 times. Yeah. The Franklin scandal,
*  there's scandals all over the world. So I'm not delegitimizing like the idea of real human
*  trafficking, but the idea that Donald Trump is fighting the human traffickers and the human
*  traffickers are Ellen, who is a little wild that everyone in Hollywood's eating children
*  and there's tunnels under central port. I mean, it's hard to keep up with. And the Q drops,
*  so to speak, are like these, these, you know, they're like, they're like poems or they're,
*  they're coded information. So it's never like, Hey, this is what's happening. Where do you get
*  a 4chan or something? You get them like on 4chan. Okay. But 4chan is the best place in the world for
*  trolls. It's a lot of, well, that's what maybe this is. This could be like, that's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah. It could be a tie level troll. Nobody knows because it's bait. It has nuggets of truth,
*  just like anything else. Right. It has nuggets of very real things. The government is shady as
*  fuck. A lot of the elites are doing things, engaging in pedophilia and probably worse.
*  Like some of those kids on Epstein's Island probably did disappear, but the idea of it,
*  like that, that Trump is fighting this underground war and it's all about human traffic. I just don't
*  think that's born out by the facts. Like there's no facts to point. I mean, Trump was like friends
*  with the Clintons for his whole life. Well, not only that, if Trump was doing it and not talking
*  about it, it would be so out of character. Like imagine this one thing that he's doing is the most
*  noble thing that he's ever done ever. Right. He's not mentioning it. The most important, the most
*  humanity. And he's not even bringing it up. He's just secretly winking at all the Q people. Well,
*  and so everything he does, there's like a reason that he does it, they say. Like when he wishes
*  his lame acts, he goes, I wish her well. Now the thing is, that's a rich guy who's forgetting he's
*  the president and who's just on a T at Mar-a-Lago because that's how rich people talk. I mean,
*  that's literally, and I've been around a few really wealthy people. This is how they talk. When you
*  say something bad, anything bad, if you go, John's wife has cancer, their kid had a DEWE, he's got a
*  problem. He had a couple incidents there at Harvard. They go like this guy, I wish him well.
*  T off. That's how they talk. That's how they talk. It's just a dismissal. It's a way to dismiss it.
*  But the Q people are like, oh, there's a meaning, there's hidden meaning. He's saying that she's,
*  and if you look at it, Ivanka is wearing this dress and it means, and it's just like, listen,
*  I'm a conspiracy guy, but this is exhausting. Well, I don't care to you, jacket, the jacket.
*  Yeah. I don't care to you. Isn't that what it said? Yeah. I don't care. I don't really care to you.
*  Right. Yeah. I mean, it's weird. What the fuck is this? Yeah. These are weird things. What are we
*  doing? So I think the Trump administration feeds the trolls. I think they like it. I think he'll,
*  by the time the election rolls around, he'll be like full, full Q just leaning in. Who's behind
*  the scenes pulling the strings? Is it Ivanka? They say Jarek Kushner has a lot of power. But wouldn't
*  it be funny if it was Ivanka doing the whole thing? It could be. If she's the one stroking
*  her chin like, hmm. She's the boss. What is the nugget we release next? She's QAnon. She's the
*  smart one who's like set it up. How do we? Yeah. She's the pretty daughter. Everybody dismisses her.
*  I mean, nobody takes you seriously. Right. She's in the background of the whole fucking show. She's Q.
*  With black leather gloves on. That go to the elbow gloves? Like the Inspector Gadget hand. You just
*  see your hand typing on 4chan. Send. Send. Yeah. I don't know, man. You know, Steve Bannon said
*  something and there was a documentary about, Errol Morris made a documentary about Steve Bannon.
*  Bannon said this very interesting thing. He said, you know, there's a guy out there who's got a
*  horrible life. Like he's divorced. His kids don't like him. He has a shitty job. But when he plays
*  like League of Legends or World of Warcraft, one of these games, he's a hero. And when he dies in
*  real life, nobody really cares. But when he dies in the game, so many people come out and they,
*  like, you know, they show him respect because you're playing with people from all over the world.
*  So Bannon's like, which life is the real life? So, which of course it's the real one that you're
*  living, not this fantasy game. But I think the QAnon thing, I think the Trump administration is
*  like, yeah, let people believe they're hunting pedophiles online. It gives their lives meaning.
*  Like, let these people believe they're like hunting the Clintons. It's like fun. It's like
*  a fun video game for them. And then they don't have to ask why they don't have health insurance
*  and can't get a knee operation. I don't think that it's that involved. I think it's just a thing
*  that's happening that happens to fit in with human nature. That's probably true too. Yeah.
*  I don't believe that the Trump administration has the resources to do that. But still,
*  I mean, they would have to be so 4D chess. They would really have to be. I think they may, like,
*  encourage it a little. I think they may just pour a little gasoline on it. Maybe. Yeah. Maybe. Why
*  not? If they think that's their base. Yeah. They're like, why not? They're having fun.
*  When you go out to a Trump rally, you want a little fun. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. It's the
*  things that he does that are mistakes. Like these interviews that he does where he'll argue about
*  shit. Like he'll argue about how well they're doing or what's wrong or what he got right or
*  what his IQ is or how well he did at this intelligence test. Like anybody who's playing
*  like 3D chess is not going to do that. No. No. He's not playing any chess. He's going by instinct.
*  He's riffing. And we've said it before. I've said it on the show before. It's like, it's amazing to
*  watch a guy get up, no material, and just crush. I mean, just he's really going by instinct. He's
*  perfectly suited for this era because he's like, he's hypnotizing. Like if you start listening to
*  him, you can't stop. Like I'll try to watch one five minute clip of an interview. I end up watching
*  the whole hour because he's like, there's a hypnotic thing that's going on where he just is up and down
*  and you just, you can't not listen. Have you ever seen Scott Adams talk about him? No. Scott Adams
*  is an interesting guy. He's a very intelligent guy. He wrote the Dilbert comics. You know what
*  he is? Yeah. So he's basically saying that Trump is like a master persuader and Scott Adams
*  understands hypnosis and persuasion and he's talking about the way the guy does it and how
*  he does it that he's a master persuader. And a lot of people disagree with him, but what's interesting
*  is he's not, he doesn't even vote. Scott Adams doesn't vote and he's not really a Trump supporter,
*  although he does say a lot of things that seem to like, I think he leans towards Trump being more
*  persuasive than just going by his gut because it sort of fills his, he's got this theory that aligns
*  with his theory. So he goes along, I see him leaning into it a little bit where it's not like
*  he's totally objective about it, but he's lost millions of dollars because of this. Millions.
*  Really? Like people have turned, oh fuck yeah. They've turned on him. He was saying on Twitter
*  the other day that people slow down in front of his house, start screaming that he's a racist.
*  Jesus. For nothing. Just because he said that Trump is persuasive. Right. And that he said that he
*  thinks Trump is essentially pulling people's strings and manipulating people in a really
*  interesting way. Yeah. And he is. I mean like any president does that, but Trump does it extremely
*  well. Well he does it in a non-presidential way. Right. That's what's weird. It's a weird way of
*  doing it. I love con artists and grifters and to me Trump is the highest level,
*  biggest con ever, most successful, without a question. I mean like he's the king of all
*  of those. Every guy sitting in an office right now calling people up, trying to sell him shit
*  over the phone. Trump's the king. Trump's the highest level that you can, I mean anybody,
*  if you're using a fake ID to try to buy cigarettes, up the ladder there's Donald Trump.
*  Like all the way up the ladder. And that to me, I think, because everyone's like he's evil or he's
*  Jesus. It's like I don't look at things that emotionally because I guess I'm just not a total
*  loser. I think that's really what it is. I think if you're really, if you have nothing going on,
*  everything becomes about politics, which we don't, I'm never going to meet Nancy Pelosi. I mean this
*  is a television show. You know, I'm not saying that real things don't happen that people aren't
*  affected, but this day to day, like you're inundated with like he said, she's there,
*  Pelosi, Schumer. It's like, dude, who cares? My favorite Pelosi and Schumer image of all time
*  was them with the African outfit on. The Kenton cloth, yeah. On their knees, not realizing that
*  the cloth pattern they're wearing was from a tribe that was notorious for selling slaves. Yeah, yeah.
*  Well. Notorious for being a major part of the slave trade. Yeah, well, so is the Democratic
*  party for many years. Let's be honest. That's what people don't know. Yeah. I mean, when you
*  go way back to the Democrats, Democrats were the Confederates. Yeah. Whoops. So it's just,
*  we've been looking at these people for too long. We've seen. That's amazing. I love her. But it's
*  not as good as the woman they're on their knees. I love the hands on the hips. Like, oh, and the
*  mask as well. They've got everything going on there. Boss bitch. Yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful.
*  And someone was saying that like, well, you have to respect Nancy Pelosi. Someone said that to me.
*  And I said, she wants 16 year olds to be able to vote. They look by the way, like invaders.
*  It just came into a country, slaughtered people and took their clothing, hopped off of a boat.
*  Yeah. They look like people that just colonized an area and took their cloth. Yeah. They're,
*  they're wearing like swamp boots. How old is she? A million. She's a million years old. I mean,
*  does anyone retire? Does anyone step away? No, you die at a Trump rally like Herman Cain. Yeah.
*  What are you going to do? Respect to Herman Cain. Respect. No mask. Godfather's pizza. Yeah.
*  Went out there. No mask. He does what he wants to. But he had cancer. And did he? He had cancer,
*  I think. Oh, did he? Yeah. Well, he died of COVID. Yeah. If you have COVID and you die of cancer,
*  you still die of COVID. Right. It's, if you get hit by a car, you die of COVID. I don't think they
*  do it that far. Well, you'll see. We'll see. There's going to be a documentary in a few years
*  about this. I don't know. New York Times is saying today, they think it's underreported. They think
*  the COVID deaths are somewhere around 200,000. Yeah. I mean, listen, I mean, at a certain point,
*  you just, you have to stop reading because everything you read every hour contradicts
*  the last thing you've read. Yeah. And they're like, it's airborne. No, it's not. Yes, it is.
*  No, it's not. I'm like, what do I do? You can get it off surfaces. No, you can't. Just kill me. Like,
*  I don't know what's happening. Well, they don't know. That's the problem is they're making it up
*  on the go because they're getting new data all the time. They're constantly getting new information,
*  new studies, new things show, but they don't react to all the studies. Like one of the big ones is
*  the fact that it dies in sunlight. So if that's the case, well, you should let people do all sorts
*  of outdoor activities. These studies, when you read about the studies, they're like, we sampled
*  a certain amount of people and this is what we found. And it's like, that's not necessarily
*  indicative of anything. Well, it's, it's information. It's better than nothing. Yeah.
*  It depends on who's reading the study and what their bias is and what they're trying to say.
*  But it's clear that they're trying to figure this out. I mean, obviously it's only been around for
*  six, seven months and they say that the people that are really reacting to it, in many cases,
*  a lot like for whatever reason, their immune system has not had as many prior experiences
*  with Corona viruses. So if your immune system has gotten a lot of colds and you fought them off,
*  supposedly you're in a better position to deal with this than somebody who has not had that
*  germophobes are fucked. Yeah. Germophobes. We might be the fact that we were shaking hands and on and
*  off planes. That might be good. That might've strengthened our immune system. Well, they were
*  saying that about people in prison. Like one of the reasons why the people in prison are doing so
*  well with it. Like when guys are in prison, you would say, Oh, what a fucking terrible place for
*  your immune system. But was it Huberman? Was it a Andrew Huberman was talking to us about this?
*  I think it was. He was saying, it might not have been him too many guests. They were talking about
*  immune systems in that when you think of your immune system, you think, well, if you're healthy
*  and calm and well slept and you're not stressed out, that's when your immune system is at its
*  best. Well, that's not really the case. And those people that are in jail stuffed in next to all
*  these people breathing in everybody's bacteria and all the viruses and shit that's in the air,
*  no escape from each other, no way to social distance. Those people actually have pretty
*  strong immune systems because of that. Because their immune system is like in shape. So the
*  LA homeless population has got to be great. They probably have a natural immunity.
*  You know they have typhus? I have no idea. They found typhus. It's a middle-aged disease.
*  It's come back because of the conditions, the urine, the feces. Not a middle-aged,
*  medieval. I always fuck that up. Every time I do that, I'm like, this time I'm going to get it right.
*  Nope. I always say middle-aged. But they're doing good with Corona because they have strong immune
*  systems. So why don't we open the comedy store up and just have the homeless be the servers?
*  Like why can't we open up businesses in LA and just have the homeless who've strengthened
*  their immune systems operate the businesses? Let them shoot the voice. Let homeless people go in
*  and direct the voice. I don't think they don't show up a lot. That's true. They're very unreliable.
*  They're unreliable. Maybe you should have like three homeless for each job. Yeah.
*  Like look someone's coming in. Becky's ready. Becky's on standby. Becky's over there shaking
*  and scratching. Here's the camera. Yeah. Pointed at how we meant that this is America's Got Talent.
*  There's 70,000 of them just in LA. It's crazy. They don't even know really how many there are
*  now because there's 70,000 of them before Corona. Oh, there's going to be millions.
*  Imagine if there's a million homeless people. There's going to be millions of homeless people.
*  It's going to look very soon like a, and it's already starting to get there, like a movie,
*  like a post-apocalyptic movie where you drive down Melrose and everything's boarded up and you see a
*  lot. Like it's gonna start looking really bad here. It could look really bad. New York is
*  a nightmare. I've heard. Like New York, the crime is skyrocketing and you know, there's just,
*  you know, the relationship between the police and the people is very fraught and it's very hard.
*  I mean, it's like, so the police like, fuck it. We don't want to do anything. And you like,
*  you understand a lot of they're just like, listen, we're going to sit back. And then now
*  a lot of areas are just being policed by criminal elements, by gangs and stuff like that.
*  Cause that's what happens in a power vacuum. You know, if you get rid of the cops, I'm not saying
*  they shouldn't be reformed or they shouldn't have all these new regulations, but like if you defund
*  them or get rid of them, somebody steps into that vacuum and it's going to be usually a gang,
*  the mafia, crime syndicate, whatever. Dude, de Blasio. Not good. If you think your mayor is bad,
*  de Blasio is a nightmare. He's like, hold my beer. He's bad. He's the worst. He's pizza with a fork.
*  And what's great is that he does. He does. Yeah. What's great is that everyone hates him. Like the
*  left hates him and that for different reasons. And then the right hates him. But even the black lives
*  matter. People hate him. They all hate him. He's so pandering. What are you doing? Look at that. Oh God.
*  Pizza with a fork. He's disgusting. What kind of a fucking human? What is this? The mafia? Who's he
*  sitting with? Bunch of old dead people. Who is this? The mob? Look how ridiculous this is. Is the teachers here?
*  One guy with the sleeves, the guy with the sleeve tattoos, he better not eat that pizza with a fork.
*  I will fucking find him. Yeah. I mean, de Blasio. He's a fake human. He's not a real human. He's
*  like a goofball. Yeah. And he gets up with his wife. They did like a rally right after coronavirus
*  and like she gets up and she goes power to the people. And then she thought like it was going
*  to be like a sixties rally. And then the crowd was just stared at her like, what the fuck? We're
*  going to die lady. Yeah. They thought everyone's coffin. Yeah. They thought it was going to be
*  like they were going to start beating tambourines like power to the people. Like her and de Blasio
*  think they're like living some historic moment and they are. Yeah. It's just not what they think.
*  They're in the wrong movie. Yeah. It's, uh, it's rough, man. Yeah. Cities are in trouble. Yeah.
*  Well, he literally said you can only protest if it's a black lives matter protest. Yeah. Listen,
*  as much as I support the movement, that is not freedom of speech. You can't do that. No, that's
*  anti first amendment. Yeah. That is a big part of who we are. You can't say no, you can only do one
*  kind of protest. Everybody's got a protest or nobody's got a protest. Everyone's got to be
*  allowed. You got to allow the anti-mask people with Candace Owens singing songs with Sean Hannity
*  and you need to let the black lives matter. People do it. Everybody's got to be able to protest.
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm out in the, I rented a house in the desert and it's 119 degrees every day. So
*  not only can people not protest, you can't leave your house without dying. Like if you leave your
*  house, you get skin cancer. Yeah. And they tried to do a protest. It lasted, I swear to God,
*  lasted three blocks. They were like, back like they were banging a thing. They were like, no justice.
*  They were like, no, no Pete. Like they had no idea. And then they were sitting down and you
*  just saw them like sitting down eating ice. I am 100% for police reform. 100%. I 100% believe
*  there's too much police brutality. Too much. I am also 100% in the belief that there's a lot of
*  people that are doing this and following this movement because like we were talking about before
*  with actors, it is the trendy thing to do. Social. And then also what you're seeing in like Portland
*  and Seattle, you seeing crazy white people trying to light government buildings on fire.
*  Well, they think if they, if they bash the windows of Amazon, this is the beginning of the
*  revolution. How does it at all connected to police brutality? It's crazy. It is not connected at all
*  to police. It's just anarchy. It's just chaos. And when you unleash that, like in the beginning of
*  this, like, listen, you burned down a target. It was fine. I even laughed. I said, who gives a shit.
*  It's in Minneapolis. Like did this happen in Minneapolis? So what? A target gets it in
*  Minneapolis. The guy gets charged the next day. It's fine. But when you unleash total chaos,
*  you know more about violence than anybody. You can't control it. You can't direct it to the,
*  to the targets that you think are right. It's also intoxicating and fun. Right. All those people that
*  are involved in it, wearing masks, showing up every day, having a good time. They're giving
*  their, it gives their life meaning. Right. It does. They're trying to beat the man. Right.
*  They're trying to break down the fucking fence. They put around the federal building and they're
*  trying to light that bitch on fire using Bibles. Right. They're lighting Bibles on fire. Jesus.
*  It's all chaos. It's just insane. How about the mayor of Seattle is like, maybe this is our summer
*  of love. Yeah, there I've never been there. I don't want to ever go. Like I have not the Pacific
*  Northwest. I hate it. I know you do. I don't give a fuck about people. I don't care about those trees
*  and the trails and they all look like vampires. They're pale and gaunt freaks. They're so weird.
*  Amway that scam started up there, like multi-level marketing startup. Yeah. They're all looking for
*  something to believe in. And that's that those are problem areas. Well, that's where Brett
*  Weinstein was teaching at Evergreen and that's where they came from. They were like patrolling
*  the campus with bats. Looking for him. He's like, he's literally as progressive as a human can get.
*  Right. And he's also a nerd. Yeah. Like super nice guy. Yeah. And they, you know, they were coming
*  for him. It's crazy. I've never liked it. Something about the Pacific Northwest. I've just never,
*  I never connected with it. I thought about living there once. Yeah. But I mean, that's your,
*  you love that stuff. I don't give a shit about it. It rains all the time. I know, but that's why
*  these people are out throwing Bibles at the federal building is cause it's raining all the time. Well,
*  I don't know what makes that place so progressive and so left wing. But the thing is, is that like,
*  you saw hints of this many years ago where Antifa would stop traffic. Yeah. They were like doing
*  these things and stuff. And when people would, they would get people to say Black Lives Matter.
*  It's like, what's the point of that? Before that, they weren't connected with Black Lives Matter.
*  Before the coronavirus thing, before George Floyd, the Antifa people, it was all about right wing
*  people. There was all about combating right wing folks. Right. Like the proud boy. They would have
*  those skirmishes. Exactly. Right. Well, that's where the proud boys came from. They came from
*  Gavin one. Protecting right wing speakers. Exactly. Yeah. They wanted someone to fight back against
*  Antifa. Right. Who were shutting down. Correct. People who were speaking at colleges who were
*  right wing. People like Milo or anybody else. Ann Coulter or whatever. Yeah. Those kind of people.
*  So that's where it all came from in the first place. But when you would go to Seattle, they
*  were letting these fucking people direct traffic or is it Portland? Might've been Portland.
*  They were letting these fucking people direct. They were telling people you can't go down this
*  road. Yeah. And so this old man was like, I'm going to and they started chasing him and they
*  kicked his ass. They're beating on his fucking car. Yeah. I don't know why people on Twitter
*  defend that. And I don't know why a lot of celebrities defend it. And I don't understand
*  why a lot of mainstream Democrats don't just call that out for what it is. I've never once seen
*  a mainstream Republican ever defend the proud boys or that was certainly not their hill to die on.
*  Like if a mainstream Republican defended them, it was very like, it was a huge news story.
*  Usually, I don't know why. I think the big problem is it's like things are happening. You see them
*  with your own eyes and then people tell you that they're not happening. Right. They're like, no,
*  that protest is peaceful. You're like, I saw them light a guy on fire and use him as a battering
*  ram to get an amazes. They're like, well, you know, he gave them a look. There's always a
*  qualifier. There's always this weird qualifier. They're like, well, here's what happened. You're
*  like, they were beating a child. They're like, let me explain what happened. They were gathered
*  together. They had burning Bibles, bows and arrows, bike locks and chains. That child crossed the
*  street. That child said, my dad's a cop. You see the child starting? You're like, no, there's always
*  a weird like, but they did it first. They're the thugs of the left wing. They're doing the dirty
*  work that the left wing wants to get done. They're like theater kids. They're like people that failed
*  at standup comedy and theater and they moved back to Portland from LA and now they're like,
*  let's burn it all down. I didn't get a Comedy Central half hour. It's truly what it is. You
*  ever see the ones that are practicing self-defense? No. They train. They actually train. They're like,
*  they were, these Antifa people were meeting in the park and they were getting ready for skirmishes
*  with the right wing people. This is all pre-COVID when this was funny. Pre-COVID, this was funny.
*  When it stopped being funny was, how do you pronounce the last name? Go Andy No. Andy No.
*  When Andy No got beat up and they milkshaked him and people were mocking and I'm like, hey,
*  why do you think it's okay to beat this guy up? Why do you think it's okay to steal this guy's
*  camera? No one is saying this is wrong. Then I started to say, okay, this is going to be a real
*  problem. And then the economy got shut down and you're like, oh, this will only make this big
*  and bigger. Yeah. This will only fuel the fire. But again, it's like these people who'd go there,
*  whether they're trying to light the federal building on fire or direct traffic, they have
*  a purpose now. They have a thing and they have a cause. Right. Like when they took over that six
*  block section of Portland or Seattle rather. Yeah. Chazz. Chazz. Yeah. What was it? Chow?
*  It was Chazz or Chop. Chop. It became Chop, but it started as Chazz. But young countries often
*  have, you know, they changed the leadership hiccups and as they develop coups. I was going
*  to have that guy on my show. The guy Raz. Yeah, I was too. Then he got caught with a gun. I know.
*  He was handing a AK to someone or whatever it was. I still would have had him, but we couldn't get a
*  zoom link working. I was going to have him here in person. Really? Yeah. Interesting. That would
*  have been fun. Maybe. Yeah. I was like, listen, man, I support you, you know, doing your thing,
*  but you can't bring it out of God. And it's like, and I didn't even know what the thing is. Well,
*  didn't they shoot two people there? Well, I don't know. He didn't shoot two people. Well,
*  he didn't, but somebody definitely did. The other thing they were doing that was crazy was they
*  basically became a really shittily run country. They put up borders almost immediately. Barriers.
*  They want borders. When people were doing things they didn't want them to do, they were the worst
*  case of police brutality. They just beat the fuck out of people. They just beat people up. So if
*  you were trying to film them doing something they didn't want you to film, they just kick your ass.
*  Well, this is just like, if you believe in something really fervently, not like it's always
*  the ends justify the means. Like however you get there, it doesn't matter. Like anything's justified
*  in the pursuit of this utopia that you think you're going to erect in downtown Seattle. Well,
*  it's also you're doing seven blocks. What you think shouldn't have been done to America. You're
*  occupying land, right? Taking over existing structures. You're kicking out the indigenous
*  people of Seattle. Yeah. I think the shitty thing is like electoral politics isn't perfect,
*  but that's what you have to do. Like look at Cortez. She got elected. The people that believe
*  the things you believe can get elected. They have to work within the system because all the violence
*  and chaos will do will give the government a reason to even clamp down more. Now they got throwing
*  people in advance of the DHS because again, you're not going to overthrow the government.
*  You're not going to overthrow the military. It's not the way it's going to work. They catch you
*  breaking public property. It's just going to be an excuse for them to clamp down more. And it's
*  going to work. We're going to be in more of a police state than we were. Yeah. The idea that
*  when they did that, that somehow another incited the violence to get worse. Like that is, I don't
*  know if that's true. No, it was chaos every night for 50 days. I'm not for the unmarked vans. I
*  think all of those things end up being, because look at what happened after 9-11. They said,
*  we're going to do this, this and this. And then all of a sudden, nobody got any rights back,
*  by the way. Your emails are still being read. You have no privacy. All of that's still there.
*  So if we just establish a precedent of like, yep, some people need to get thrown in a van
*  and we'll explain why that is. That becomes a major problem going forward. Did you see when
*  they got thrown in the vans how excited everybody else was? What's your name? What's your name?
*  We'll get you out, friend. Right. It's like, you guys are all like Luke Skywalker. This is
*  what happens when you shut a country down for three months. This is the only fun left. Nothing's open
*  anymore. The only fun thing left to do is to overthrow the government, get thrown in a van.
*  This is summer vacation to people. You know they used to have those dumb escape rooms that people
*  used to do. They're stupid. But this is a real one. This is a fun real one now. How fun is that?
*  How do you light the federal building on fire? Now it's a real one. Yeah. It's interesting,
*  man. And I wonder how these people are going to transition into regular grownup life.
*  I think regular grownup life, the ship is on both sides. Like the people that were in Charlottesville
*  marching around like, we're gonna have a white country. I mean these people also. They will not
*  replace us. Yeah. The Jews will not replace us. It's like those people are as well. You'll never
*  please the far left and the far right. Right. Like the people that are really on the fringes,
*  you're never gonna make them happy. Like Kamala Harris, by the way, is a fine VP choice. Yes,
*  we're all gonna get put in jail. Yes, she's gonna put you in jail. But guess what? Who is he gonna
*  pick? Elizabeth Warren, who lied about being a Native American. Kamala's good because the people
*  in the middle don't care that she's a cop. No one gives a shit. No one cares. You might care that
*  she locked up people. But the Republican conventions can be very tough to really get people mad at
*  Kamala Harris. You're gonna be like, fuck Kamala. Everyone's gonna go, yeah, they're gonna go,
*  she's a cop and she locked up minorities. Republicans go, ah,
*  ah, is this a real problem? Like, I just think she, what do you think? You think she's the worst?
*  I don't think she's the worst. But I think it's, it's very inch. Well, somebody wrote on Twitter
*  that the left is very much against sexism and racism. Yet they elected someone or they chose
*  someone to be a VP based entirely on their sex and their race. Right. But we knew that was gonna
*  happen. We knew that was, this is why all these people on Twitter and guys that I really like,
*  like I really love Kyle Kulinski and those people, but it's like they were like so mad about it. I'm
*  like, guys, didn't you see it was gonna happen? Didn't you, didn't you like, it's the most
*  predictable choice in history. I was thinking if they went nuclear, Michelle Obama, that would have
*  been wild. Right? She would have won. They would have won. They would have won. And Cuomo from New York,
*  who I call Meatball, the governor of New York, Meatball and Michelle Obama win. Did you see the
*  latest Cuomo thing? No, what's he doing now? Kyle Kulinski sent me this. He's out of control over
*  there. Him and his brother pretended to have coronavirus by the way. They pretended? Well,
*  his brother, Chris Cuomo said he beat coronavirus by doing chest exercises. What? Swear to God.
*  There's a YouTube video where Chris Cuomo is going, you know, this virus gets in your body. It wants
*  to stay there, but you know what? You just start stretching your chest doing this. You get rid of
*  it. That's literally, I mean, he's never forget. Liar, liar. Is that true? Yes. He's a liar. He said
*  you get to stretch your chest. Yes. If you can find it, Jamie, it's real. And he said he cured
*  himself. He cured himself by doing chest exercises and stretching his lungs out. Well, the worst part
*  was when he pretended to come out of the basement for the first time, when he had already been in a
*  fucking fight with some guy. No, these people are, they're pathological liars, both of them. I don't
*  think that's what the case is. Okay. This is my take from a person who's worked in show business
*  for a long time. I think he had a producer that had at CNN and they had this shot scheduled.
*  We're going to film you coming out of the basement. It's going to be amazing. You're going to
*  embrace your family for the first time in two weeks. Okay. Did the producer make him pretend to have
*  coronavirus as well? Cuomo's protecting his Wall Street donors from democratic tax bills.
*  So this is, but the tweet I sent you, Jamie, but I didn't send you the tweet. Here it is.
*  New disclosure record show Andrew Cuomo's largest hedge fund donor just funneled huge money to the
*  governor precisely the moment Cuomo has been blocking democratic legislators bills to reinstate
*  New York's financial transactions tax. That's crazy. That is crazy. It's nuts. If that's the,
*  if that's the case, if like he knew that tax was coming and he blocked it just so that he could
*  get paid. I don't know enough about finance. I don't know either. Tell me. I was a subprime
*  mortgage guy. I mean, I know these things. I mean, what I mean, you're my guy. I go to,
*  yeah. Well, good. I mean, I, I, I, it's very possible that he did block it so we could get
*  paid. I mean, these people give themselves raises constantly, no matter what circumstances are,
*  no matter what shortfall the city government's in, these people constantly give themselves raises.
*  And Cuomo has got to play an interesting game because Wall Street money is how New York is
*  even alive. If enough Wall Street people leave, they're fucked. Well, they're fucked right now,
*  because 50% of the taxes in New York are paid by the rich. Right. And they're leaving. It's like
*  1% of the people pay 50% of the taxes. Yeah. A lot of them went to the Hamptons. A lot of them
*  got out of the city and a lot of them are leaving the city forever. Right. So you, you know,
*  you can shit on the rich, blah, but he, blah. I think a lot of them should, you know, a lot of
*  them get, get out of paying taxes by routing their money off shore and they do a lot of things they
*  shouldn't do, but that tax base is essential for that city. A hundred percent, a hundred percent,
*  and this is where also foreign criminals, as sad as it is, third world dictators,
*  Chinese amusement park, tycoons, Russian oligarchs and assorted murderers. You need their money.
*  Yeah. Otherwise how are you going to sell stock? That's the reality. Like they have to come in and
*  launder their money through New York real estate. They got to come in and buy 10 apartments. They
*  don't use, and then their daughter goes to NYU. I mean, otherwise that whole city is going to fall
*  apart. It's not right or wrong, good or bad. It's like, it's just what's going to happen.
*  It's just what it is. You see Cuomo trying to bring the rich people back. It's like,
*  come on over. I'll cook. Yeah. I'll cook. They're good. He's a goon. That guy,
*  you cooking for, bro. He's an idiot. This is that folksy horse shit that they do like,
*  I'm making me both for you. It's like cook for you. How about not letting the city get destroyed?
*  How about not sending sick old people to the nursing home where they can infect everybody else?
*  Well, that I was for. I think a good brush fire through the nursing homes is good,
*  to be honest with you. Oh God. I mean, my mother's in a nursing home. Her roommate had COVID
*  for a month. My mother never got it. Every day they would go in and they were like, well,
*  my mother's an annoying woman, loud, looks like me. Every day they walked in, they're like,
*  will you die? She's like, I feel great. So we're all hoping second wave, but it's like,
*  it's, you know, she won't die. The woman's 300 pounds. She won't die. She won't die.
*  What is she eating? Everything. Probably her roommate who died of COVID. She's probably
*  eating her, but the woman won't die. She's indefatigable. Like they can't. Great word.
*  Yeah. I, I whip it out here. I don't know if I can say it right. I don't think I said it right.
*  Say medieval. Yeah. Here it is. Here it is. This is how it'd be Corona. I don't think that. I think
*  he's just talking about the tightness in his chest. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  he is stop defending him. I have to defend all this is insane because I have too much of that
*  in me. This is how this is the vaccine for coronavirus by the way, going like this stretching,
*  you stretch stretching. I like how the stairs are behind him. Yeah. It's all horseshit. He looks
*  fine. Probably a set. Yeah. It's probably a sad, he's not sick. He's like, he goes, you know, he
*  goes, this virus gets in here and wants to kill you. But he goes, you know what I do? He goes,
*  I just stretch the lungs, stretch the lungs. Then and it's like, okay, so we shut down the economy
*  for three months for a virus where you can just stretch your lungs, stretch the lungs,
*  and then that's it. Something's off. Well, this virus is fucked up because if you talk to some
*  people, it's nothing. And I know people that have gotten it, they got a headache and then other
*  people that have gotten it and they're fucked still. Right. Like I think Michael Yeo is still
*  having a problem with fatigue. My man, my ex managers, his wife got it. She still can't smell.
*  How long ago? Three months. She still, she can smell a few things. Jesus. I know. Is she healthy?
*  Yeah. She's a thin, you know, middle age woman. Yeah. It's weird. And they also saying that some
*  large number of people that get it, they still, they have a heart damage. So after it's over,
*  they show it like that baseball player. There's a professional baseball player that has to sit out
*  the rest of the season. He got checked out. I mean, I think he's 29 years old or something like
*  that. And they found out that he has some inflammation in his heart. Nobody knows why
*  any of this is happening. Well, I take it back to Brett Weinstein again, because Brett, who's a
*  biologist was saying that this disease has all the markers of a disease. It's been manipulated
*  for research. Right. Probably. That's why it does. It's so infectious. Now manipulated for research,
*  like manipulated so that they can research it or manipulated as like, how can we make something
*  dangerous? That might be a weapon. No, they manipulate it so that they can do research on it.
*  So they can find out what kind of cures they can create for coronavirus. Interesting. The lab that
*  they did research at was in Wuhan and it's a level four lab. Bioresearch facility. And they
*  had been cited in 2018 for safety violations. They're getting real sloppy over there because
*  when you're working under communism, you don't have a lot of incentives. Right. Right. A lot of money.
*  So it's very possible that this is a genetically modified virus. And maybe that's why it has all
*  of these different effects on people. Exactly. Exactly. And it's probably morphing. Like they
*  say the one in India is so different that if we come up with a vaccine for the American version,
*  it's not going to work on the Indian version. Is this just the rest of the history now is just
*  viruses and pandemics and like, I mean, this seems to be, because all the conditions for this,
*  are going to still be there. Like there's still going to be these wet markets. There'll still be
*  a lot of unsafe handling of produce and not only produce, but like different types of animals.
*  And so this may not be the end of this. Maybe the beginning of an era of just
*  different types of pandemics and viruses. Well, they've been warning us about this for a while.
*  Bill Gates had that Ted speech in 2015. Said it's coming. Yeah. And now he's the devil. Now
*  everybody's like, Bill Gates wants to give you a mic. I just think people get weirdly uncomfortable
*  when it's like billionaires want to do it. Like Bill Gates was considering once shooting a missile
*  of dust at the sun to help climate change. This is a fact. What? Yes. So he was considering this.
*  And then, yeah, Bill Gates, where'd you read this? This is what kind of dust,
*  do you know how big the sun is? Yeah. But Bill Gates was considering shooting a missile full of dust
*  at the sun. So it's like, now obviously people said to him, Hey, not a good idea. And he relented.
*  But when you have these Batman villain billionaires, not that they're evil,
*  but that they have a lot of money, they could do whatever they want. People get uncomfortable
*  with just one guy saying this is the way it is. And this is what you need. People just feel
*  uncomfortable with that. You find that? Is that real? That's real, Joe. Could dimming the sun save
*  the earth? Bill Gates wants to spray millions of tons of dust in the stratosphere. Okay. That's
*  different to stop global warming, but critics fear it could travel calamity. Yeah. That's not at the
*  sun. That is the suspending particles in the atmosphere that are going to act as like clouds.
*  But the reality is people get a little, they get a little uncomfortable when a billionaire from a
*  lair is decided to start shooting dust into the atmosphere. And you know, where is, where is the,
*  is there any democratic process here where anybody will ever have any say in anything ever again?
*  I saw a meme. Or are we just going to listen to Bezos and him do it in there? They could do
*  whatever they want. Well, it's hard to say because when you're that rich, we listen anyway,
*  because we figure Bezos has got $200 billion or something. He must know something that we don't
*  know. We assume. Sure. But I mean, who knows what, you know, also they have a lot of money. I don't
*  even think they want more money. I think a lot of them just have, they want more. Well, some of them
*  do, but they also have, they just have designs in the way they want the world to look. They have an
*  ideology. I trust Bezos more than I trust Bill because Bezos doesn't wear a uniform. Bill Gates,
*  where's that Mr. Rogers uniform? Yeah, I don't trust it. I don't, I trust Warren Buffett because
*  I feel like he's in Omaha just eating eggs. He lives in the same fucking house that he bought in
*  like 1980. That's a scam though. He does that. He does that. So guys like us will be like, what a
*  down to earth guy. Like, but he's- $80 billion lives in a $400,000 house. Something's wrong.
*  That makes me more suspicious than I would be if he had a man. He should have a big match. Bill
*  Gates. Well, that's not even his regular outfit. The regular, that's the regular outfit. Yeah,
*  he's a little bit of a creep. With the shirt. What do you do when it's a hundred degrees, Bill?
*  What do you wear then? You know, do you wear the same sweater with the shirt? Look, he's got that
*  fucking outfit. He loves it. But why isn't- That's the tech outfit, man. That's the Silicon Valley.
*  They're gonna, people just get very nervous with Silicon Valley billionaires. Well, it's an incredible
*  amount of money and it's an incredible amount of influence. People are really worried about Mark
*  Zuckerberg. Yeah, these guys are the new Rockefeller Carnegie. And he's fucking really young. He's
*  really young. By the way, speaks perfect Mandarin. Well, he's got a girl who's Chinese, right? Yeah.
*  It's married. Jesus Christ. I don't know what he's doing. I'm not invited to his home. You're not?
*  I'll get you in. I'd love to go. All you have to do is get your Facebook page over 700,000.
*  I'd love to go. I'd get banned from Facebook within an hour of being there. I'd be taken away. I just
*  go up to him and go, can you get rid of my aunt Kathleen, please? There's a crazy video of him
*  in China and he's on a television show and he starts speaking in Mandarin and they go crazy.
*  They can't believe he can do it. And they're clapping and cheering. Interesting. What takes
*  very little to impress them, huh? Well, they're just, it's just a white guy. He's doing it. Here's
*  the guy from Facebook speaking perfect Mandarin. Wow. But he's ready. That's comforting. That's
*  comforting by the way. He's going to bring them all. The head of the head of Facebook is yucking
*  it up with, you know, maybe our biggest enemy. Yeah, that's nice. He's going to be super excited
*  about New World Order. Give me some volume on this.
*  Yeah. What he's saying is we will destroy America. The translation is America will be a prison.
*  We will send your government to rule our. This is what happens when you're like a genius and you
*  don't get laid in college and you just say, you know what? I'm just going to take over the
*  world. This is like pinky in the brain, but the real thing. Well, he's also a guy who was friends
*  with the people who put together Facebook. Yeah, that's a great movie. Social network.
*  I didn't see the movie, but I read an article about the actual real story. The actual real
*  story is kind of fucked up. Yeah. He kind of, well, there were those Winklevoss twins and they had
*  this Harvard dating app or something. And then Zuckerberg came in. I think Zuckerberg had more
*  of a vision of what he wanted it to be, but it was certainly sketch. It's a little sketchy
*  way that happened. Yeah. But the fact that they're trying to do money now, they're trying to do
*  Facebook Bitcoin like a crypto currency. Oh yeah. It'll never end. It'll never end. It'll
*  be Facebook vaccine. It'll be Facebook. I mean, it just won't end. I mean, I don't know how it's
*  still relevant. When you go on Facebook now, it's just still crazy people screaming and they've
*  still kept them all on there. They've kept them on there. Like Zuckerberg's figured out a way to
*  keep the boomers on Facebook. Just sharing recipes and complaining about, you know. QAnon? Yeah,
*  she's talking about QAnon. My aunt's like, save the children and here's a recipe for banana bread.
*  My aunt's like, there's tunnel under Central Park and I'm making a banana cream pie later.
*  So if you want the recipe, I mean, literally it's recipes and Q drops. That's my aunt's face.
*  Q drops. I mean, her head is melted. I've talked to multiple people that really truly believe in
*  the QAnon stuff. Well, some of it, some of it, listen, some of it, you got to give them the
*  benefit of the doubt. It's like, I don't even blame the QAnon people as much because like,
*  if you were ignorant of everything and you never thought anything was conspiratorial and then Epsi
*  and all this stuff happened, your mind would melt. Oh yeah. And that's what happened. They just,
*  I've been listening and following weird shit. I mean, I remember when 9-11 was a big thing. Now
*  nobody even cared. Like you bring that up, people rolled their eyes. I remember like news change.
*  Yeah, that was a huge thing. And everyone's like, we're going to get the answers. And then people
*  just stop caring. And then you move on to this. And then in five years, QAnon, people will be like,
*  they'll stop caring. And then it'll be another thing. And eventually you just have to like,
*  kind of check out because it gets boring. Well, you got to wonder, disinformation campaigns have
*  existed forever where they take legitimate information and then they lump it in with nuts.
*  Yes. Crazy shit. Crazy people and crazy shit. And then they put it out there because it taints all
*  the legitimate information as well. A hundred percent. You know, there's a great book,
*  Behold the Pale Horse. You ever read that book? Yeah, William Cooper or something. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You read some of it and you go, oh, this makes sense. And then you go, but what,
*  a fucking alien base on the moon? Like what's going on? Yeah. Yeah. And then some of it just
*  goes left. Gets really crazy. Yes. Patrice O'Neill, I think, a great point where he's like,
*  people will be, they'll, then they'll say two things that make a lot of sense and then they'll
*  put marbles up their ass. That's the way he said it. But it was true. And he said it on ONA. It was
*  like, but it's hard. But eventually just for your own mental health, you got to check out. Yeah.
*  You got to just go, you know what? There's more to life than politics. And there's just more to life
*  than hunting this conspiracy forever because it's not, none of what you think is going to happen is
*  going to happen. I think that's part of what you, you just nailed it though. There's more to life,
*  but there's not for some people. Yeah. Some people, if they put on a fucking MAGA hat and they,
*  you know, they have fucking liberals with a line through it. Yeah. And they go out there and they
*  fucking, yeah. That's sad. And they get to the rally. I was, I was out there in the desert. They
*  had all these women and they're in, you know, Mercedes, like beautiful day, not as hot as it
*  usually is women in like top-down Mercedes. You'd think like on a day like that, you just go out,
*  take a drive, put an album on, go take a drive up the mountains. Beautiful. Instead they had these
*  pink women for Trump flags and they all met on a corner and they're all waving their flags.
*  And it's like golf people. It's like, like middle, upper middle class golf people. And this is their
*  sports. It was like high school spirit night. I wish her well. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it is.
*  And it's just like, again, I thank God I found comedy. Thank God I have something I like to do
*  because maybe I'd be somewhere with a flag, waving a flag, running around. That's what it is. Right.
*  I think things to do. Nobody has hobbies. Not only does nobody have hobbies, but right now,
*  no one has a job. That's a problem. So there's like no money coming in. You're desperate. You're
*  scared. You're blaming other people, everybody else. You don't know who the fuck is to blame.
*  You have no idea what's going on. And then there's a disease that might kill you.
*  Yeah. So that you're anxious, you're depressed, your social circle has been cut dramatically.
*  Dramatically. And now the only thing you could do is kind of go online for 19 hours a day and
*  get radicalized in whatever direction. That's the thing that bothers me too about like whenever
*  people talk about whether it's conspiracy theorists or whatever, the one thing that drives me nuts is
*  that people say we have to stop these conspiracies. Like when all these COVID conspiracies were going
*  around. Well, that's a different one, right? Because I guess some of them could be actually
*  responsible for people making poor choices. None of those people were going to make good
*  choices before that. That's my point. Yeah. It's like if there's people out there that are pushing
*  ridiculous conspiracy theories, like who are you worried about? Are you worried about getting to
*  you? Right. No, you're not, right? You're not worried about you believing it. Right. So you
*  think you're smarter than everybody else? Yeah. Well, I think it's just people get deeply
*  uncomfortable with the idea that they're losing control of the public sphere, the public space,
*  right? For so long, you had these mainstream media outlets, they had real direct control.
*  I mean, everything you saw, everything you watched, everything you read, it was under the control of
*  relatively small amount of people. And this was how it was forever. Right? I mean, this was not like
*  an aberration. This was literally how it was forever. Every single thing you read or saw was
*  curated by a small group of people. And now it's the Wild West. And a lot of people don't,
*  and you're going to get bad information, you're going to get good information, you're going to
*  have to figure out which is which, and the country is not good at doing that. People are not good at
*  doing that. And so people get worried and they're like, wait a minute, but you can't put the genie
*  back in the bottle. Well, the problem is they can. Right. And they will. And they will. And they're like
*  plandemic and all these different- Right, they ban them. Yeah. And the video of the bunch of
*  doctors talking about hydroxychloroquine and Z packs and- And that woman who's a witch doctor,
*  I liked her. I liked that witch doctor. And I want to hear more about, I find her opinions on
*  demons fucking you more interesting than COVID. She needs a podcast. She needs a podcast. I don't
*  care about hydroxychloroquine. I want to know who are these demons who fuck you in your sleep? We
*  should have her on you and me with her. Please. If you get her, me, you and her would be phenomenal.
*  We could fly her and she wouldn't even wear a mask. She would not wear a mask. She'd fight a cop at
*  LAX. Where does she live? I have no idea. Where does that woman live? She practices medicine in
*  his trip mall. Have you seen it? No. It's literally like right next to his nails. But you know, a lot
*  of doctors are bullshit. Oh yeah. A lot of doctors, dude. A large percentage, especially in LA. Well,
*  doctors are humans. Humans go to school. They learn to be a doctor. There's a lot of crazy humans.
*  You know, Whitney Cummings said to me once, she goes, my doctor friend said, it's a practice,
*  which means we're still practicing. It's like, well, that's not comforting. That's not what
*  practice means. That's not at all what practice means, you freak. But there's so many doctors.
*  And I'm like, do you even have a degree? Did you go to medical school? That kind of logic is like
*  when people say program, when talk about TV programs, they're programming you, bro. Right.
*  They're letting you know. It's that stupid, like linguistic garbage. What a nightmare. Yeah. Are
*  you, are you, is there any part of you that's going to miss Los Angeles? Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm
*  going to miss it. Sure. I'm definitely going to miss the store. But I'm missing the Los Angeles
*  that I don't think exists right now. Right. When you go down Melrose and you see everything boarded
*  up and you see fucking homeless encampments everywhere. Like I took the wife to Venice.
*  Yeah. And I've talked about this before, unfortunately. Sorry if you heard it before,
*  but driving by, I parked at a red light, you know, stopped at a red light rather. And there's this
*  fucking house to my left. It's probably worth $5 million. And right across the street, there's 10
*  tents. Right. So imagine you, your fucking kid is in your front lawn. You, you made it. You got a
*  beautiful house in Venice or five minutes from the beach. I love it. You've got 10 junkies camped out
*  in front of your fucking house and needles in the street. Like this is crazy. It's a fucking tents
*  everywhere. Yeah. I was in Brentwood this morning. It's chaos. Yeah. Dude, you get off the 405. It's
*  just garbage stacked up seven feet high and tents, fucking hibachi grills out there. Yeah. That's why
*  I got this house in the desert. Cause I'm like, I just want to get out. And you know, as soon as
*  you get out there, something happens where it gets really calm, really hot. And there's none of that.
*  That's why I'm moving to Texas. Yeah. Same thing. Texas is like that. Texas is like the regular
*  world, but you wear a mask. And a lot of people from Texas, you're all upset that I'm talking about
*  it so much and people are moving out there, but I'm sorry. Sorry. You're awesome. Sorry. You got an
*  awesome spot. Yeah. It just seems like the first of all, high population centers. It's just, this
*  is not a time for high population centers. This is letting everybody know that the whole idea of
*  like living in Manhattan, this is going to be great. Everything's there. Right. Yeah. All the
*  laws. It was great. Here she is. She's in Texas. Firepower ministries.org. I love that. Whoa.
*  Weapon of war. What firepower? What is that weapon of war? Give me the full image. Hold on a second.
*  You've got, hold on back, back, back, back. I can't. Yeah. Make it there. Firepower ministries.
*  What is that? God's battle acts and weapon of war. See that? I would have went to the website,
*  but it was not working. Firepower ministries. Look at what it says there. God's battle acts
*  and weapon of war. I love it. I need that tattooed. Yeah. I think I'm going to get that on my right
*  leg. Firepower ministries. I love that. Ammunition ministries. And weapon of war. AK-47 ministries.
*  I'm going to put that on my heel. Where is she? The Christian resource center. That sounds good.
*  Firepower ministries. Prayer, deliverance, counseling, bookstore, print shop, gifts. I
*  will send a limo to get you gifts and more. Bring you to Austin. You do a podcast. We're going to
*  have a good time. It sounds fun. It looks legit. Yeah. Perfect. There's a whole witchcraft section.
*  Well, if you don't get a book on witchcraft, how are you going to learn? You got to go to a
*  witch and they might lie to you. I'm all for her protecting us from witches. Well,
*  God's battle acts and weapon of war. Imagine writing that on your Twitter. Man, this is her
*  time. Everybody out there, please listen to me. I've never asked for anything from you people.
*  I want everybody to update your Twitter bio to God's battle acts and weapon of war. I want
*  everyone to do that. I may do that too. I may do that. God's battle acts and weapon of war.
*  I'm going to do that right now. I'll do it too. Let's do that right now. It's important.
*  It's important to show solidarity with that woman and her. God's battle acts and weapon of
*  war. Firepower ministries. Yes. God's battle acts and weapon of war. That's so funny.
*  Edit profile. Here we go. Everybody's coming out of the woodwork now. You have a lot of different...
*  If you had anything to do with medicine at all, you could come out now and just
*  you could build a brand. She's building a brand. It's a Bible verse apparently.
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, really? You won my war club. Maybe I should leave it alone then.
*  Yeah. I'm already moving to a red state. She's building a brand.
*  I understand what they're doing. Yeah. Hey, you got to build a brand. It's just what it is.
*  You got to make noise. Not everybody can be Alyssa Milana. Some people have to be God's
*  weapon of war. Yeah. Battle acts. Battle acts and weapon of war. What a crazy Bible quote.
*  There's some Bible quotes that make you go... Well, they don't... People like her, they don't
*  want the light touch Bible quote. No. They don't want the like, give the old man soup or whatever,
*  some version of that. They want like, the fires will rain through your eye. Like that type of
*  intense... Yeah. Yeah. The apocalypse. They're into that. So many people just really love that
*  vivid imagery from like Book of Revelation. Yes. They want that. That's the only part of the Bible
*  a lot of them care about. They just want the end. They think it's coming. What's going on here?
*  Give me some. Give me some of this. What's she saying?
*  Right. Oh no.
*  That's not reasonable. That's not reasonable.
*  Don't be afraid to give your all to Christ. I'd feel comfortable if she walked into a way,
*  a hospital waiting room and started treating me. I feel very comfortable. And then she brought that
*  guy out and she goes, now meet my nurse. This is my head nurse. You know, what is interesting though,
*  is this, the politicalization. Is that a word? Oh, this is, she's rocking out. Yeah.
*  That's exactly like the Blasio's wife. That's the Blasio's wife trying to get,
*  trying to get a response from people in Central Park. Power to the people.
*  Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. You got to wonder.
*  It's a real nightmare out there. It's weird. Yeah. It's really weird. If we can stay alive,
*  it's awesome though. As long as nobody you love dies in this. It's a good time. Yeah. I think if
*  we come out on the other end, which I think will be next spring, I think we're going to go through
*  the fall and then winter, it's going to be weird. The election's weird. Like have you ever, have you
*  ever looked forward to three months less? No. Than these three months of just intense. I have
*  intense anxiety about the election. Right. Like I'm where I'm like, yeah, this could be bad. Could
*  go interestingly. It could be a real mess in this country. I think it'll be a mess no matter who gets
*  in. I'd be less of a mess if Biden wins. I think if Biden wins, it'll be less of a mess. And I think
*  people will shut, I'm hoping people will shut up. Like can people just shut up? They're not going to
*  shut up. Yeah. They're not going to shut up. Cause first of all, the Trump people, if Biden wins,
*  they're going to be furious. Right. And Trump has said that like this mail-in vote thing is going to
*  be ripe for fraud. Maybe he's not wrong about that either. I don't know enough about it,
*  but I don't know why we can't have a regular election with masks. Well, I don't know why
*  we can't entertain this scene is how you and I don't know what the fuck we're talking about.
*  Let's just go all in and say, I believe it could be a fraud. The mail-in? Yeah. I think it could be
*  too. I think there's your vote online. How come you can do banking online? That can be fraud too,
*  because then Russian trolls and Chinese trolls and all the trolls and bots. Meanwhile, you bank
*  online. No problem. What's more important to you than your money? Nothing. Nothing. It's a good
*  point. Meanwhile, they figured out how to do that. Let's just have a regular election, six feet
*  distancing mask, spray everything down in between. I mean, what are we doing? Your phone opens up with
*  your face, right? Yeah. Mine does at least or your fingerprint. Why can't you use that? Well, I just,
*  I agree with you, but I don't know why we can't have a traditional regular election with masks
*  and distancing. We certainly can. I think we can. I think it's stupid not to, especially in an election
*  that's going to be this contentious anyway. We should probably just have a regular election
*  with masks and distancing. I wonder what it's going to be like at the polls. And then like,
*  if really elderly people, yes, you should go to nursing homes, they're really elderly people and
*  let them touch a computer screen. Like let my mother go in there and let my mother touch it,
*  because she loves Trump. She asked me the other day, she goes, can you get me a MAGA hat? She said
*  she's schizophrenic, but she loves him. She's kind of his base. She goes, yeah, she goes,
*  yeah, she goes, I love Trump. She goes, he's just trying to do the right thing for the country.
*  She goes, your aunt Donna doesn't understand that Donald Trump's trying to save us from the people
*  that want to hurt us. I was like, yeah, I was like, that's aunt Donna. Always trying to let the people
*  in hurt us. Everybody has one. Yeah. So I mean, that's my, uh, here's a question. Who's going to
*  name the kid Karen after all this? Oh God, that name's out. It's a rough year. My name that happened
*  to too, every pussy that was being described in the eighties was like little Timmy, everyone,
*  everyone dude. And that name is decreased in popularity, which is fine. I don't want it. I
*  don't want a name that everyone has, but everybody that was the pussy name forever. It was like Timmy.
*  What about Adolf? By the way, not a good guy. Great name. It's not a bad name. It's a great name.
*  Yeah. It's a strong name. Wilhelm. Clip this and send this around. It's a strong name.
*  Wilhelm. You can't use it anymore. You can't use, uh, you can't use Adolf anymore. Yeah. But how
*  many kids a year, let's ask, let's, let's do a poll. How many kids a year are named Adolf?
*  Adolf. Probably nobody. Nobody, right? I want to know. I want to know how many children. I mean,
*  you want to talk about a social justice warrior. The guy who's named Adolf's gotta go hard left.
*  What? Uh, well actually, hold on. What does it say? I thought this was like a US article.
*  What does it say? Well, why? An article. Um, Europe's all in. There's official records on it,
*  apparently. So, uh, official records show that only 13 children were named Adolf between 2006
*  and 2013. Follow them. Netflix doc. Made a small comeback since then. 46 children have been named
*  Adolf since then. Oh yeah. The way Germany is going, there's going to be a lot of Adolfs. Yeah.
*  Cause they got some issues. How low that number is. Follow those 13 kids. That's a great Netflix
*  documentary. Like you just call it 13 Adolfs and you follow them and see like how they deal with,
*  how they deal with having the name of a, you know, a genocidal monster. Really? But maybe.
*  You can be Genghis. You can name your kid Genghis. No one would have a problem. Is it Genghis or
*  Genghis? Genghis. Genghis Khan. Oh, I like Genghis. Genghis is fine too. I've said Genghis,
*  but I think you're really supposed to say Genghis. Oh, Katrina, Caitlin. Hey, wait a minute. Hold on.
*  No more Caitlin's. Monica? Monica's are out? Isis. There's a few Isis. Dude, have you ever gone
*  somewhere and you see someone of Middle Eastern descent and their name is Isis? It's like a
*  beautiful name, Isis. Ellen's rough. Ellen is like an old. But it's a rough one now. It's a rough one
*  now because she was running Abu Graib in the back of her show. That's a rough one. She's out there
*  dancing with Kristen Bell and in the back there's people that are getting up on the rack like this.
*  It's so weird when you see like a lot of people saying that someone who seems so nice is not nice
*  at all. She doesn't seem nice, but that's that people have a very poor judge of character.
*  She doesn't seem nice. It seems forced. People that are like that all the time. She doesn't
*  seem nice. It's very forced and whatever. You're allowed to be a bitch, right? You're allowed to
*  be a bitch. You're allowed to be nasty to people. You're accomplished. You're a comedian. You did
*  the whole thing. What you're not allowed to do is have a Guantanamo Bay situation in the backstage
*  of your show where everybody's walking around afraid for their life. And it's like Abu Graib
*  where they're hooked up to wires and they have like, yeah, she's got dogs and hoods. If an intern's
*  late, they have a hood on. I don't support that. That's just me. Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you. Yeah.
*  I mean, you know, I wish she's best. She's around for too long. All these people walk away. You've
*  been famous forever. Walk away. Like eventually everybody, they're just going to figure it out.
*  Now, Fallon's on an apology tour because of the blackface. Like, is he? Well, he was like,
*  he had to go around and apologize a million times for like, they're going to find the thing. If you
*  don't go away, you got it. You got to have a good run. And then we have a good run. You step back
*  and you go, okay, I'm still going to do my thing. But like, I'm not, I mean, there's only a few jobs
*  in entertainment, right? So I think a lot of the cancel culture shit is probably these motherfuckers
*  want those jobs. They're like, how long is this bitch going to be dancing? I can dance with Hillary
*  Clinton. I could do the Charleston with Henry Kissinger, whatever the fuck she does out there.
*  The Charleston, is that what it is? She goes out there to do the Charleston. She's got war criminals.
*  Her and Bush are jumping around. I mean, she was buddies with Bush. She's a CIA agent. Steven
*  Paddock, and do not ask me for sources, but Steven, Steven Paddock. Who's that? He was the guy that
*  shot up the Vegas concert. That was very tragic thing. Listen to this. The only guy that saw
*  Steven Paddock alive, his name is Jesus Campos. He was a guard at Mandalay Bay. He got interviewed
*  nowhere else. You know where he got interviewed in the beginning? Ellen. Ellen. Really? Weird.
*  And then they went on, if you could find that clip, they went on with a weird like diagram of how
*  it happened. And Ellen's like showing the people out. Not like an emotional, like how are you
*  feeling? How are you holding up? It was a weird diagram of like, and then he went to the left and
*  to the right. It was very strange to look, what the hell's going on? This is a daytime show.
*  Which is the paddock guy? And there's two guys there. The chubbier guy is the Jesus guy. And now
*  Ellen is doing a thing of how this shooting happened. Look at how she's got like an antenna
*  from someone's Buick that she's popped up and she's using it as a pointer. But why the hell is this
*  happening on like a daytime show where she did? This is weird. Where'd she get that pointer?
*  I don't know. She stole it off. She stole it off an intern's car. Why wouldn't you just use your
*  finger? Like if that was you, if it was your show, the Jim Dillon show, wouldn't you just point? Yeah.
*  Yeah. This is also a giant screen behind her. So they could have just put it on that screen.
*  So, but she's using this thing. I find it very strange. I don't know why. Wait a minute. Those
*  aren't real palm trees? No. I know that street. I know that block at Beverly Hills that she used.
*  I don't know why they're doing this on a daytime talk show. Let's keep it running. Look at it. She's
*  dressed like Colonel Sanders, not Colonel Sanders. She's dressed like Sergeant Pepper. This guy looks
*  like a member of her staff. What kind of outfit is she wearing? I don't know. She wears those weird
*  like militant lesbian uniform. Yeah. That should tell you something. Yeah. It does an odd look with
*  all those buttons. Like why do you have so many wrist buttons? It was given to her in Langley.
*  The only reason why you have that many wrist buttons if you're looking at clothes on somebody.
*  Yeah. Look at her. Look at her. Everyone says she looks so friendly. She looks, yeah, she looks
*  friendly. She does look very military. Yeah. She's a militant woman with a very expensive watch. She
*  dealt with a lot of discrimination when she came out. It was very sad, but then she joined the CIA.
*  Her house got broken into while she was at home. Really? Yeah. Yeah. She got a dope place in
*  Montecito. And they broke in while she was there. Yeah. And those people are still being tortured
*  to this day. Probably. They're still in an underground jail. Yeah. She's feeding them to
*  her staff. She's like, it's okay. Don't worry about it. She goes, you did good.
*  Is that the guy, the survivor? He's the guy who met Paddock. She's holding onto him. It's odd.
*  Yeah. She's allowed to do that because she's a woman, but if that was a man holding onto
*  a woman's arm that long, it'd be rape. It'd be a real problem. Yeah. That's for sure.
*  So weird, man. What a strange interview, man. I mean, the whole situation was strange. What a
*  strange thing. They never really figured out why that guy did that. There was no motive. He has a
*  very little footprint online. He was a professional gambler, right? Yeah, he was. He made a lot of
*  money doing that. Jamie's just, what did you do? Jamie knows. You don't know? What do you think?
*  Well, I don't know. You tell me what's going on. That's the story. Okay. But you just made a noise.
*  Like this is bullshit. Professional gamblers? Not. There's a lot of professional gamblers, buddy.
*  Not about playing video poker. Is that what he does? Yeah. That's all he did? Yeah. He was an
*  arms dealer. No, I don't know that. But I just see the way I said it very definitively. He was an
*  arms dealer. Yeah. He did have a lot of fucking guns. So it's just very strange. And a lot of
*  times what happens is, you know, she gave him a check for 25 grand. Oh, well, good for her. Big
*  ass check too. Like you won a lot. That's good. Yeah. A lot of them gave you a check that big.
*  It's 25 grand. By the way, after taxes, that's not even any money. I might put a zero on that.
*  It's like, bitch, how about you give me some real money and not $8,000. When we would give people
*  $50,000 to win Fear Factor, the government, I think takes 16. Yeah, it's crazy. You get 34. Dude,
*  when you do your first job in comedy, you have to join SAG, which is $3,000. So a lot of times
*  you're like negative. Yeah. You have to pay three grand to join the Screen Actors Guild. Yeah. And
*  then you're, I mean, it's wild. Well, what they're doing right now in California tax is they're
*  trying to retroactively tax everybody. Up to 16.8%. Which is hilarious. You're going back to
*  January. Like, you know, I know you were living here over the last seven months, assuming that
*  your tax rate was what it is and you budgeted for that, but no, we're going to steal your money.
*  Are they going to be able to do that? I don't know. They're saying 16.8% for top earners. Yep. And
*  then it's going to be high no matter what, because it was 13. Yeah. And a lot of people will be paying
*  14. It's a lot of money to go to the, to a state that doesn't manage money well and doesn't seem to
*  fix any of the problems. Especially if you're that guy that's got that multimillion dollar house in
*  front of fucking tents. And you're like, what am I doing? Yeah. What am I doing? I've worked my fucking
*  ass off 10 hours a day. I come home exhausted, try to spend some quality time with my family.
*  I'm dodging needles in my fucking front yard and I'm paying 16%. I don't know if he's spending
*  quality time with the kids, but he's still like, he's like, I got some hookers and coke and this is
*  still a problem. He's like, they don't want to come over here and walk through tents. These women
*  are professionals. Yeah. I don't know that that guy's coming home to his kids. They get into Uber.
*  No, he pays someone to watch the kids and yeah, but it's, no, it's, it's falling apart here very
*  quickly. I wonder what's going to happen. Like how far can it fall apart? Cause I would have never
*  imagined it can fall further. Don't get crazy. It will fall further. Go to Machu Picchu. There's no
*  one there. Okay. That's a good point. Yeah, man. All these places. It's going to be taken over by
*  the Tik Tok kids. You already see it happening. That's why Trump's trying to ban Tik Tok. They're
*  16 years old. They literally run LA. These 16 year old kids, they go to that steakhouse boa and they
*  all walk around in bedazzled jackets and there's paparazzi outside and these paparazzi, their job.
*  Yeah. They go like, as the world's burning, these kids are doing this. The paparazzi's job is to ask
*  these kids like what's going on and their kids and they're, they literally have responses like
*  a regular childhood. They'll be like, what's going on Madison? And she's like, I'm trying to get a car
*  and he's like, all right, right. And it's so sick. Like this is that guy's life. He's got to follow
*  around these children. At least used to follow around Sandra Bullock. Now you're following around
*  a kid who like does this. There's one dude that was a comic. Oh, he's still a comic, but he was a TMZ
*  guy for awhile. And he was a, yes, I know that guy. I've been met that guy. Good dude. Good looking guy.
*  He was like one of those TMZ guys. Yeah. Very nice guy. I meet him at the airport all the time.
*  Sometimes that answers questions. Sometimes like, bro, how embarrassing is that though? I get that.
*  That's his job. It's tough for a fellow comic. And we're talking. I'm like, come on, I get it.
*  But, but he was cool. Like if I told him, like, I'm not into it, I'm so tired and I'm not going to
*  comment on my friend's death. Like one of them was Anthony Bourdain. Yeah. Like right after Anthony
*  Bourdain died, I'm like, I can't, man. I can't. What a way to make a lit. Like I feel bad for those guys.
*  You have to camp out outside of a Starbucks and interview 16 year olds. You're like, what's the
*  drama this week? They also know where you are somehow. Oh, they're stalking these kids.
*  What did they get? How did they get the flight information? Like that's what I want to know.
*  No one's done that to me, Joe. I don't know. I always want to know how they get the information.
*  I don't know. I've never been. I didn't know what airline you're on. It's weird. Yeah. I don't know.
*  I don't know. Like you must have someone inside the airline. They send them money or something
*  like that. They must have some sort of a. That's interesting. So they, they, so then they show
*  about LAX at the right time. Yeah. Not just LAX, like they show up when you're getting off the
*  Ellis, the escalator, like at fucking, you know, the fourth terminal, you know, when you're in
*  terminal four and you come in, they're there for you. They're ready. Wow. Weird. See they're
*  outside of the restaurants in Beverly Hills a lot of times. Like those fucking people that go to
*  those restaurants, they know what restaurants they're going to get. Like if you go to Craig's,
*  yeah, or, or, or, or any of those and the food at a lot, I like Craig's, but a lot of those
*  it's not good. Well, it's a scene. It's a scene. Yeah. It's exactly what it is. But the food is like
*  you go, this is horrific. Like if you go to Nobu and Malibu, they don't let them on the property.
*  So they're on the street yelling at you. They yell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there's like the
*  parking lot and then there's the restaurant. Are you going to miss that stuff? Are you going to miss
*  like the Nobu and Malibu, like the food, like the sushi? No, no, I eat meat. I know. I eat meat.
*  No, I don't like fish. You don't like fish. It's okay. I eat it when there's no meat around.
*  Yeah. My dad's friend owned a steak house. He said that he goes fish is part,
*  he goes fish is perfectly good if there's no meat. Yeah. I like meat. Well, the good thing about
*  fish is you can eat it all day long and no one gets mad at you. If you eat meat, people think
*  you're a terrible person. Meanwhile, there's plenty of cows and we're sucking fish out of the ocean
*  in record numbers. The ocean is going to be drained of sashimi. Yeah. But you know what? No, no
*  generation before us ever worried about us. So it's like, I'm going to eat the sashimi and the kids
*  can figure it out. Let the TikTok fucks figure out how to get more salmon. But there's no shortage of
*  cattle. Like you can grow cattle like crazy. Isn't the problem that they fart and then it causes
*  methane? I mean, I know, but that's what they say. But then they did an actual survey. See,
*  if you can find that, they did some sort of a satellite image of the United States and they
*  found out that the large majority of methane release is coming from dumps and coming from
*  landfills. Interesting. Yeah. Which makes sense. Interesting. Of course it does. Of course. All
*  that food and everything's wadding and it's just going straight up into the air. Well, all of those,
*  you know, people criticize meat because it's political, but what's very interesting is like
*  sugar gets away with everything. Yeah. Sugar is like a, like there was a comedian who did a great
*  joke. I think it was Baron Vaughn. And it was like, he goes, cocaine and heroin, look at sugar and go,
*  fuck, that's the fucking dude. That's the real drug. He's everywhere. Yeah. I mean, that's the real
*  markets. Yeah. So I mean, sugar is just so endemic in our culture then and it's not that political
*  and it is very addictive. Oh yeah. Really? Me and Ari Shafir did this and big Jay Okerson, a few
*  people, we did this SlimFast challenge for like two weeks and you read the SlimFast ingredients,
*  all sugar. Yeah. You're just drinking a chocolate milkshake. Yeah. Just doesn't have much calories
*  other than the sugar. Right. And it fills you up in some weird way. What do you got there, Jamie?
*  What is that? Research shows removing all livestock and poultry from the U.S. alone would only reduce
*  global greenhouse gas emissions by 0.36%. You fucks. Just relax. If you don't eat those cows,
*  they die on their own and no one gets to eat them. Right. That's the problem. Yeah. So you
*  got to eat the cows. Yeah. This idea that you're going to save the world, that was something that
*  was promoted by a lot of these bullshit propaganda vegan movies. Right. That if you like greenhouse
*  gases are all coming from that. No, no, no. No, look, a lot of greenhouse gases coming from
*  shipping produce, folks. Right. It's unfortunate. It's true. Agreed. There's a lot of problems with
*  growing things like almonds that you're using so much fucking water to grow these things. Right.
*  You're drinking almond milk. What's your feeling on home? I drink almond milk. What's your feeling
*  on whole milk? I think raw milk is probably good for you. What's raw? It doesn't bother me.
*  The raw processed, non-homogenized, non-pasteurized. Where do you find that? You can only get it in some
*  stores. It's kind of, it's kind of, I mean, that's like, yeah, it's like finding DMT. That's what I
*  was about to say. I'm like, sometimes you'll bring up a product. I'm like, how do you even get that?
*  I was drinking raw milk for a while because you could get it at the supermarket. I think you'd
*  get it at Whole Foods, but it was good for literally like two days. Does it taste good?
*  It tastes great. Interesting. It's really thick and like you drink it and it doesn't make you
*  feel like shit. Like there's something about regular milk, which I love, like milk and cookies.
*  You give me a fucking chocolate chip cookie and a cold glass of milk. Woo. Yeah. It's so good. You
*  dunk it in. Are you a dunker? Do you dunk the cookies? I have dunked. Boa has a dessert where
*  it's those warm cookies and then just a little scoop of ice cream. It's a problem. Yeah. That's
*  a very good thing. Real good. Yeah. It's a very good thing. But when you drink regular milk,
*  your stomach's like, all right, we can deal with it. Like fry, whatever. But whole milk,
*  it just kind of goes in there because it has all the enzymes. It's not boiled down. When your body
*  is drinking pasteurized homogenized milk, the idea is it can stay on the shelf longer. It could feed
*  more people. It also lasts longer and keeps people from getting sick. I get it. All that stuff's good.
*  But the problem is that your body doesn't know what that is. Like that's boiled and dead. There's
*  no enzymes in it. When you drink regular milk, it's like your body's like, oh, we know what to do with
*  this. This is raw milk. This is milk. It's not this like pasteurization. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
*  That's all. And you don't fuck with almond milk. Well, I've had it. It's a little lighter than
*  whole milk. Yeah. Not milk. It's not milk. It's nonsense. It's the chalkiness. Well, it's some
*  fucking shit where you take almonds and then you soak them. And then you get this murky water and
*  then you drink that and lie to yourself. And by the way, most almond milk has sugar in it. Like
*  Dunkin, I love Dunkin and Dead. Like dude, almond milk is so healthy. I go, why don't you read how
*  much sugar it is per serving? It's like 19 grams. I go, yeah, 19 grams. That's why it tastes so good.
*  Everybody lies. You're drinking it in the milk shake. Well, you go to Whitney's house. Whitney
*  has all these weird plant based things, but they're all kind of like weird, like plant based chocolate
*  pops and chocolate almond milk. But she's very thin because she doesn't eat a lot of them. She
*  throws up a lot. Well, that's what she does too. And she's on speed. Yeah. It's a good point. She
*  does all of those things. All of those things help. You know, the needles. Every now and then
*  I'll call it. She's got like nine needles coming in. I'm like, is this COVID vaccination? What's
*  going on? She does the NAD. We both do NAD in directions. But yeah, I mean, but the plant based
*  stuff never feels that healthy. Is she on plant based diets? Is that what she's doing? No, she'll
*  have meat every now and then. Like I'll bring her food that has meat in it. And she probably eats
*  it like a wolf. Yeah, she'll eat it. I mean, a lot of times they try to bring her like an egg plant
*  Parmesan or something that's like in her wheelhouse. Yeah. Yeah. She's a person. She's dyed her hair
*  pink now like Billie Eilish. When did she do this? She's recently. I mean, she's like gone off the,
*  she's probably losing her marbles. We need a vaccine. Nikki Glaser was talking about
*  shaving her head on Twitter. I had to reach out to her. Yeah. Did you? Yes, I did. Are you like,
*  bitch, you're stealing my thing? No. You call Nikki. Stop right now. She was saying I'm doing it in
*  solidarity for my friend who has cancer. By the way, there is no friend. Yeah. Oh geez. She's like,
*  people are having issues. She's coming on next week. I texted her and I'm like, you, what is,
*  what are you doing? And she's, she's like, oh, I'm going crazy. She's in Missouri with her family.
*  Yeah. She's living with her family while this is all great, man. She's a, she's great. She's a
*  fucking great comic. And she's killer. Whitney's hair. She's so crazy. Whitney's really, Whitney
*  keeps getting younger. Like she looks like she's 17 years old because of the adrenochrome. Yeah.
*  It's a good, what's happening there. Where'd that blue shit come from? What is that? What is that?
*  Who's doing this? Her assistant. He needs to shoot things at her. Oh, she knows how to stay relevant.
*  Hilarious. Yeah. He's very funny together. Very funny. Yeah. He just like, I don't know,
*  crack sags overhead or whatever. I don't know, but it's good. I mean, it works. It's, it's a fun
*  dynamic. She's having a good time. Yeah. I, she's one of those people that I go, man, how does Whitney
*  function without the store? Which is probably what a lot of people say about me. Right. Well,
*  also to find function. But I mean, like, yeah, no, of course, like some of us, people are shooting
*  a potato gun at her in her backyard. Let's not go. I agree, man. I had to get out of LA. I had to go
*  to the desert. Cause I couldn't handle the feeling every day that things were disintegrating minute
*  by minute. And they are. Yeah. That was wearing on me. So I said, let me just go to a place where
*  there's just 80 year olds driving golf carts. Yeah. Bob Hope. You just look at Bob Hope's house.
*  It's nice. Joey Diaz had a really good point. I think he's right. He's like, before you leave Joe
*  Rogan, you got to go down there and film that shit. Show these motherfuckers. They don't know.
*  They don't know. They don't know. Go down Melrose. They don't know. They don't know what the fuck.
*  I listened to the episode he did with Lee when they talk about dissolving the church and was like,
*  that was a great fucking episode, man. And it was like emotional. It was like,
*  cause that guy along with you helped define a whole era of podcasting and comedy and everything. So
*  it's like, when you hear him talk about walking away from LA and why he's doing it and the family,
*  I mean, it's a real like impactful thing. Don't tell Joey. Yeah, it's going to happen. He's going
*  to go to Texas. One winter in New Jersey and I'm going to call him up. Joey, I bought you a house.
*  Just reroute his plane. Just have his plane land in Austin. I'm going to buy him a beautiful
*  house like on a golf course. Yeah. Green. I'm going to make sure it's real near walking distance
*  to good food. Yeah. I'm going to buy him a house. Yeah. I'm going to buy him. Once I open up a comedy
*  club in Austin. So you're hardcore. You're like going full. I'm gone. You're doing it. I'm gone.
*  Well, I know you're gone, but you're really doing the club and everything. I am fucking doing
*  everything. Why? Listen, it's exciting. I need comedy. I agree. Also, I feel like
*  Austin is a fantastic artistic community. There's a lot of like fantastic music. Yeah.
*  It's the live music capital of the world. The food is fucking sensational. Very good.
*  The people are cool as shit. I just felt like that's a good spot. 100%. I mean, we only come,
*  I'm doing a tent in Long Island in two weeks at governor's. They've set up a tent in the parking
*  lot and I'm doing it because why is like, Hey, good for them. Why not? Good for them. Time to
*  start little by little figuring out like what this is going to look like. Good for them for
*  just fucking adapting. You know, I like that these restaurants are like, if you go down Venice,
*  they're like taking up the sidewalk. They're like, we were all supposed to shoot. I don't want to say
*  what, but me and a bunch of other people were supposed to shoot something for Netflix in August
*  in LA. That never happened. That's so now it's like, we don't know what the hell is going to
*  happen with that. Yeah. I, I was going to try to do my next special, uh, right around the new year.
*  That was my plan. And you had the garden book, you had all these things. Oh yeah. I had a lot of
*  shit booked, but my plan was to make this mad run. I was going to do Boston garden, Madison square
*  garden. I had all these theaters booked. Me and Chappelle were doing a bunch of dates and the thing
*  was to come into like January, February, just fucking coming in hot and do my next special.
*  And now it's like part of me, look, I'm not happy that this is happening for anybody that's sick
*  or anybody who lost a business, anybody, but you have to be able to adapt and look at the bright
*  side. So for me, what I'm thinking is right now is at the very least, what I can do is use this
*  as an opportunity to examine what I want to say in my act, examine it instead of just doing bits
*  that I know are killing. Cause I had a lot of bits that I know are just murdering. And I'm like,
*  okay, should I do that bit? How, what is that? Is this how I feel? Is this real? Like where do
*  I go with this? And then go, go forth once the year rolls over, I think around 2021 January, February,
*  that's most likely if there's a possibility of doing standup again, that's when it's going to
*  open up. Cause they're talking about having some sort of a vaccine around December. So, well,
*  let's see, but yeah, sure. Yeah. I think it's going to get to a point. We're going to get to
*  herd immunity a little quicker than we think. Well, you know, I was talking to Ron Funches
*  yesterday and I was like, Ron, what if this is it? This is the, this is how we live from now on.
*  You can still go to the store. You wear a mask. You can still go to a restaurant, wear a mask.
*  Like is this, or what would we do? Would we eventually just start doing standup again? Say,
*  fuck it. If you catch it, you catch it. That's a good question. I don't know. I think that you can
*  reach herd immunity with this at a lower percentage than a lot of other things. Cause we, they say that
*  we have exposure to prior previous Corona viruses and that you could maybe start reaching some level
*  of herd immunity around 20 or 30% as opposed to 60%, which would mean that New York already,
*  I mean the New York COVID cases are very low. That's one of the reasons I'm doing that tent
*  is because they're very low right now. Yeah. But LA is skyrocketing. LA is skyrocketing,
*  but no one cares. Why is LA skyrocketing? It's the wrath of a vengeful God.
*  I mean, let's be very honest. I mean, do we deserve to not be? No, I, I think it's skyrocketing
*  because it just went across country. It was just East to West. Everything cool kind of starts in
*  New York and then it ends up in LA to get sold and get ruined and get big and get ruined. So COVID
*  started in New York. You know, it's what happens. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody just uses COVID filters to
*  block your zits out. No one cares. I mean, people are out in the outdoor restaurants. I mean,
*  it doesn't really matter. People are enjoying the restaurants. The outdoor restaurants, but I feel
*  so bad for all the really good restaurants that don't have an outdoor center. Osteria, Mozza,
*  places like that. I'm really, I'm upset. Nancy Silverton's fucking- APL. APL. Yeah.
*  That place, Felix, you like? Felix has an outside. Oh, they do? Oh, that's wonderful.
*  Their whole outside is fantastic. That's awesome. Maybe I'll go there in an hour. They have a next
*  door restaurant that had this whole outside area. They took that over. They have a lot of seating.
*  It's the one thing in the desert when you go to a restaurant in the desert, you eat the food,
*  you like chewing it. You're like, what the fuck is this? I don't know what goes on. I go to like
*  seafood restaurants after I start chewing something. I'm like, I don't even know what this is.
*  There's one good one called Pacifica, which is really good, but there's a lot of restaurants
*  out in the desert where you go, something's wrong. So you just decided to go out there. Did you
*  previously have experience with Palm Springs? No, but I was in a car and then the people,
*  the riot started. So I was in a car and the riot started and I literally, instead of going back
*  to my house, because I live right off Sunset and apartment right off Sunset, instead of going back,
*  I just got on a 10 East. I'd never even been out there. I just said, I'd put the clothes on my back.
*  I said, I swear to God, I said, I'm getting on a 10 East. What am I going to go? I look like a cop.
*  I look like a guy that should be burned alive for every sin that this country is committed.
*  No one would care. My own parents would be like, he probably did something to deserve that. So I'm
*  getting the fuck out of here because I get lit up immediately. So I just started driving under 10 East.
*  I got an Airbnb. I talked to some dude. I'm like, Hey, was a nice Airbnb. And I just got out there
*  and I'm like, I fucking love it out here. It's just nice. It's just quiet. I know people who
*  have like vacation spots out there. Yeah, of course. And then I just said to myself, I'm like,
*  if LA is not going to be, if I'm not at the store and I'm not doing anything, I can drive in and do
*  podcasts. I can easily drive in. How long did it take you to get here? Under two, about two.
*  Sounds like a San Diego trip. All the traffic has been through a freeway. Have you ever thought
*  about living down there like La Jolla? No, no, I'm not a surfer. You know what I mean? You don't
*  have to be a surfer. I'm not here. I came here to do standup comedy. I came here to create things.
*  I didn't come here to be a surfer. I didn't come here to do yoga. I didn't come here to join a
*  cult. I didn't come here to do any of that. I'm an East Coast guy. East Coast is where I was born
*  and raised. Which makes sense that you're in the Palm Desert. Yeah, because it's, well, what are
*  you going to do? I can't go move back to New York, get shot in the face. So I'm staying there until
*  December, until the holidays, and then I'll figure out, you know, who knows? We'll see what's happening
*  in the world. The violence rate in New York right now is off the charts. It's a little too much.
*  It's a little too much. It's so crazy. It's a lot. And listen. How are they going to turn that back?
*  Turn around, dude. In five years, everything, it's a cycle. It'll bottom out a little bit. Or?
*  Or it'll be done forever. It becomes Bosnia. It'll be a cycle, dude. In five years, a bunch of rich
*  kids will move in there just like they moved in there in 2009. They'll start doing alternative
*  comedy, dressing like fucking, you know, fucking like flappers. They'll start tripping, you know,
*  and they'll just, and that'll be the resurgence of the city. They'll open a bunch of new coffee
*  houses in what used to be homeless shelters, and it'll just, and it's just a cycle. But
*  what needs to happen now? There's going to be a lot of pain. Yeah. There's going to be a lot of
*  displacement of people. And then I think this could be the route to the city getting cool again,
*  to maybe younger artistic people coming in, architects doing cool shit, reimagining public
*  spaces. You know, New York needs to get shaken out of its tree a little bit. And so does LA.
*  That's what's happening. Right. I just don't want to be here for it. Like maybe it'll get
*  dirty and dangerous again. It's going to get to the point where maybe everything won't suck.
*  Times Square will be like Times Square. And people that move to New York will,
*  will, they'll be, you know, listen, if you know, you could get slashed on the way to the comedy show,
*  you better kill. You better make it work. You have a lot of tension. You better make it work. If it's
*  safe and you and your friends are like skipping down the street, you don't, you don't ever feel
*  that, you know, pressure. Where's that other song? Right. Pressure is good. Yeah. And, and I think
*  that now you're going to get it, you know, we'll see. Where do you think you're going to wind up?
*  I don't know. Text is very interesting to me. That's very interesting. I mean,
*  the idea of that is very interesting. I put up the bat signal for everybody. Yeah. I mean,
*  that's very interesting to me. I mean, I also think, you know, I do like LA, but I don't know
*  what's going to happen. I do like it here. I mean, they're, you know, I don't know what I'm going to
*  do. I may manage, you know, I've talked about managing Logan Paul's presidential campaign.
*  I could always move back to do that. We're going to have to talk to Jake though. He's going to be
*  like Roger Klint. We're going to have trouble right now. Well, he's a few guns. Not trouble.
*  He's like Billy Carter. He's got an arsenal. Listen. Yeah. There's always like a Roger Klint.
*  There's always a brother who you go, you take, you just sit down. Was it an arsenal thing or was it
*  because he was, he was stealing things from the mall? No, I think he was just walking around the
*  mall being a being what he does, which is with a camera. And then I think, you know, he left,
*  I think an AK 47 on his hot tub, like leaned up against the hot tub. I think somebody ratted him
*  out. And then, you know, I show it on Twitter or something. Yeah, there was something on Instagram
*  or something. But dude, a guy like that with that kind of money, I say, get more weapons, get up,
*  get a bio weapons lab. You should have a back coronavirus going 24 seven, get anthrax,
*  Jake Paul, get anthrax. Who cares? You're going to need it when LA falls. These are the only fucks,
*  you know, that are going to be able to do anything. They're going to have arsenals.
*  Good point. Yeah, man. Why not? It's not a bad idea. Yeah. But I don't know, like,
*  LA is very weird because you're you're like, where do I fit in? You know, without stand up comedy,
*  you're like, I podcast and that's good. And I try to make that as funny as I can. But then you look
*  around a lot of places of LA, like, I don't really fit in with the actors. And I'm not really one of
*  these kids. It's really like a social media guy. And then I'm not one of these com these writers
*  that, you know, tweet about global warming of Black Lives Matter all day. So you look you're
*  like my community of people, which was the store, and the stand up comedians have now been like
*  dispersed. So it's like a weird like I'm like a man without a country. Yeah, I feel like that too.
*  And I want to be adopted by one of these like someone come in here, like one of the big YouTubers,
*  I don't care. Anybody one of these guys that walk around, you know, like hype beasts and
*  these crazy shirts and everything just I'll be one of those guys just someone knock on my door.
*  Well, I mean, golf shirts and just just just polos just like this just ill fitting polos,
*  for the American racists.
*  Polos are a weird choice. Like, why is it that that is like the only thing I wear for dorks where
*  you know what it is? I I've always wanted to look like I've had money and I've never looked like it.
*  And there's a type of guy that's from a lot of them live in New York or Long Island or Boston,
*  by the way. Yes, I saw. Yes. And they wear these fucking polos and they have no fucking money. And
*  that's the kind of guy that I am where it's like, I always want to look, but they're always sunburned.
*  And they've always got like an ill fitting thing like the collars like his collars all
*  fucked up because I tumble dry it in the wash like an animal. I look like I like a golf pro
*  who's failed at everything. His wife left like John Daly's brother. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but that's
*  the look. And when you have the look, you just honor the look, the eyes on look. I remember when
*  I was a kid, I have fake eyes on. We couldn't afford alligator. Okay, so what was it? You have
*  like a bullshitting thing you buy from like, you know, some stupid department. Yeah. And guys would
*  glue an alligator over it. Oh, really? Suppressing. Oh, that's rough. Yeah. Well,
*  they would fake it. You made it out. But it's so funny. Like, you figured it out. Labels to kids
*  are a big deal. Like if you have off brand sneakers on. One summer I saved up for a Versace shirt and
*  I bought this Versace shirt. It was like this weird mesh material that clings to your body. Now,
*  we can imagine there were many problems with that, right? Because Versace has European cut clothes.
*  Now, even if I, you know, were a small. Cock clothes? Cock clothes. No, cut, cut. They're
*  European cut. They're for dudes with like small shoulders. You know, the, you see Dolce & Gabbana,
*  like they're just, they're women. Like they're, right. So I bought this Versace shirt, which was
*  like blue and mesh. And it was just a night. I mean, I looked like Grover or something, like Cookie
*  Monster walking around. And then I just spilled something on it. And then I realized like designer
*  clothes, you can't ever spill anything on it ever. Or you have to like throw it out. Like those types
*  of material, it just doesn't work. And I'm like, oh, the people that wear these don't eat. Or when
*  they eat, they don't eat in a way that gets things on them. Or when they get things dirty, they just
*  throw them out and get another one. They're crazy. Yeah. They're wild. I've never been in a fashion.
*  Yeah. I never have either, but I have been fascinated by the whole Paris fashion show,
*  runway culture. It's interesting. To the point where I've actually like, I remember when Kanye
*  West was getting into that and you know, he was making his stuff and have people wear it on
*  runways. I was like, I almost want to be there to see what one of those things are like, because
*  I bet some of the people there are probably so preposterous. Yeah. So weird. Well, that's like
*  going out to dinner in LA. You see these people walk into these restaurants and it's kind of
*  hilarious. You're like, these people are like a meme. I mean, like they're not even real. I'm like,
*  oh my God. So that's what fashion week is like. I think it's an entire business built on bullshit.
*  It's like an entire business built on like, what do you think? And like buzz and all this crap.
*  Like there's nothing real about it other than what's created. It's like, our business is kind
*  of like that too, where it's like, there's no nuts and bolts and it's all pretty much like,
*  where's popular sentiment going? How much can we affect it? How much can we direct it?
*  And then there's, you know, eight year olds in Pakistan that make all the clothes.
*  Yes. Yes. All these things. Which is sad, but they need to work.
*  I mean, we see what happens when you shut down a country and nobody works.
*  We want eight year old Pakistanis in Antifa. No work. I wonder what's going to happen with
*  American manufacturing. I wonder if there's going to be a real shift recognizing what a huge problem
*  is having all our medicine made in China and all like there's not a single phone that's made here.
*  Not a fucking phone. Single one. Not a single one. Everybody has a phone. There's millions of
*  phones. I wonder if this makes us rethink all of that and that we got to be more. I mean,
*  that would make sense, right? Cause 90% of our antibiotics are made in China. Yeah. Most of our
*  medication. That's crazy. That's one of the things that I thought was very interesting about Trump
*  was that he was like, you know, listen, these fucking we're getting fucked by China. They're
*  fucking us. And he was right. He was right. But it's just when he's right about things,
*  those things become wrong because people don't like him. That's what I was saying about the
*  politicalization, whether that's a word or not of hydroxychloroquine. Yeah. When shop got the COVID,
*  he took it. The doctor asked him what his political leanings are. He's like, what? He's like,
*  a lot of people don't want to take hydroxychloroquine because of Trump. Yeah. He's like,
*  is that what I should take? Goes, yes. Shop's getting nervous. He thinks it's like a history
*  test. They're like, where do you stand on imperialism? Shop's like, wait, what? He was baffled.
*  I'm just coughing. He was like, what are you talking about? Yeah. Give me the fucking medication that
*  works. He was like, okay, fine. It was a doctor. What was that? If any doctor says this helps,
*  anybody that doesn't want to take it is, to me, is crazy. But it's a strange one in that so many
*  people are against it. But it's like, hold on a second. There's an article. What was that article
*  that I pulled up really recently about, oh, here it is. The key to defeating COVID-19 already exists.
*  We need to start using it. This is a doctor who is a legitimate scientist. Right. So they're trying
*  to figure out why is this guy a- I've heard that it works from doc personal. Professor of epidemiology
*  from Yale School of Public Health. He's not full of shit. He's not full of shit. And he's saying,
*  listen, there's real evidence to show that particularly in the early stages of this disease,
*  it stops the virus from spreading. It's a malaria disease that's been used forever. But-
*  Doctor New York told me that it was like the Lazarus drug. Like people just getting up and
*  walking out of the hot- like people literally that came in with it, if they used it early enough,
*  it was really good. Right. But then you hear these studies where people are saying, no, in fact,
*  more people died when they're on it. Like, well, what the fuck is true? What is real? Yeah. I mean,
*  that's when you just have to kind of clock out and you go, let's figure it out. Well, is it because
*  of- is it different stages of the disease where it's not effective? Is it different- like is it
*  old people it doesn't work on, but it works on young people? Yeah. It's also like, what are the studies?
*  How are you doing the studies? Who's doing the studies? I mean, it's all very difficult.
*  Have you done anything different in terms of like taking care of yourself other than moving to the desert?
*  I take vitamin D. How much? I take vitamin D. I think 5,000 I use a day. That's right. I take vitamin D.
*  I started- I started smoking because the cigarettes, they said help. Oh. There was an
*  order. I'm kidding. I did hear something like that. Every now and then I have one cigarette, but I don't
*  smoke. Really? I don't smoke, but every now and then at night- For COVID. As a- as a- it's a relaxing thing once
*  in a while. Not all the time. Do you smoke cigars? No, I should. Do you want one right now? No, not really.
*  I appreciate it though. I should start. I have a whole box of them. Mike Binder can get a whole box. I know. I don't need another habit. You're very good. I just start smoking cigars.
*  You don't have to smoke cigars all the time. I know. I have an addictive personality, so whatever I do, I tend to do it a lot.
*  Guess what? That's the problem. Me too. That's the problem. That's why I got good at comedy. Diaz talks about it. Like,
*  got addicted to that. You know, that's the whole thing is like you end up getting addicted to
*  something. So you better make sure that it's something good. But I- I've been trying to do
*  better things and you know swimming a lot, working, you know, working out, things like that.
*  Well, have you ever talked like when evolutionary biologists talk about addictive personalities and
*  obsessive personalities, obsessive behavior, and they say that you're actually- this is very
*  controversial, but I think some of them think that you're actually tapping into a trait that would make
*  you get very successful at things like hunting for survival. Like you get obsessed at something, so you
*  you want to perfect it. You want to be- you're obsessed by it, so you become better at it, so you become
*  more successful, so you survive because you have food. Interesting. Yeah, which makes sense. Or war,
*  or combat, or things where you're going to be able to figure out how to defend yourself. So that's like a
*  primordial trait that a lot of us have. And he gets hijacked by heroin. Right. He gets hijacked by gambling.
*  Gets hijacked by something horrible. Gets hijacked by jerking off. Yeah. It's like, wow. That's what it is.
*  Wow. So you would have been a hunter. Yeah. Let's listen. It makes 100% sense. It does. It does. I mean,
*  it's just, it's crazy. It's like in the modern world, that trait becomes sometimes a liability.
*  Well, in the modern world, there's so many- like the modern world is not natural. Not at all. Every
*  fucking thing that we do is very recent. Everything we do is- is there so unnatural, like every- the way
*  we stand. Everything. Yeah. Yeah. Well, how about what we do for a living has only been around for
*  a hundred years- not even a hundred years. Right. When was the first stand-up? I think it was the
*  mafia started putting these nightclubs together after like vaudeville. Like it was started, those
*  type of hacks, they started putting the brick wall up. Yeah. But I think that was, you know,
*  that was- it's all very recent. It's in the last century. Yeah. In the last century. 100%. And guys
*  like us would have been the MC. Right. And there would have been like a fucking go-go dancer and
*  a guy playing the drums. Yeah. Yeah. That's all that shit. We're descendant of like, you know,
*  tent carnivals and circuses. It is crazy that one of the most prominent art forms in the world,
*  which is stand-up comedy, is literally within the last hundred years. Yeah. But a lot of things,
*  you know, yeah. But like music, acting, poetry, literature. Well, you'd have to look at the
*  predecessors, too. Like it was probably in the middle ages, it was a court jester. Right? So
*  there's always been somebody goofing around and being funny. Sometimes they did comedic plays.
*  Sometimes- there had to be a guy in the town square. Yeah. Yelling and screaming. Storytellers.
*  And podcasting is like, we're essentially, it's like other than being a whore, a hooker,
*  it's like the oldest profession because we're just talking. Sort of, but we're doing it in a
*  new way where people are doing other things and they're getting entertained while they're doing
*  other things. Like right now, while you and I are yucking it up, there's a guy who's running around
*  a lake. Right. And he's out there laughing his ass off, sweating, and it distracts you. And he
*  looks down at his watch. Holy shit, I can't believe- Yeah. Yeah. It's true. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just
*  simple. It's not just- Recording things changed a lot of that because like musicians changed too,
*  because everything would have had to have been a hundred percent live performance. Sure. Like if
*  you play guitar or a harp or violin, whatever the fuck it would have been. Well, that's what I miss.
*  I miss, I love podcasting and I get to do it. But I do miss the live experience being in it,
*  because everything is context live. Yeah. Twitter, all these things have no context. When I did the
*  Houston Improv, which is the only date that I did over the last few months, it was like, I felt like
*  I was getting away with something. I was like, okay. And then I realized I kind of have almost
*  like a low key depression from not doing standup. It's not bad, but it's like, this is what it is.
*  And this is, I hate to tell you all, you folks out there, regular people who do not kill, if you do
*  not go on stage and kill, you do not know what that feels like. It's a high. It is not just a high,
*  it is one of the biggest highs in all of show business. It's life affirming. When you and I
*  would do the main room at the fucking store and you get off stage and murder. It's great.
*  And you would hand it off to me. Nothing's better. Oh my God. Nothing's better. It's like the feeling.
*  And there's a feeling that I remember going on stage when someone was coming off, they would
*  introduce you and they would just crush. And you looked at their face and you got to see a face of
*  a person who just crushed. Right. And I would always say this, I feel bad for people who don't
*  know what it's like to crush. Yeah. Well, it's also like you look at actors and you go, how
*  fun could that be? It's fun. I'm sure it is, but it can't be anywhere near as fun. No. Can't be
*  anywhere near as fun. Just in the raw visceral reaction of people, like Greg Giroldo always
*  used to say, like it's that visceral feeling. It's not so much that it's not like you're getting love,
*  but it's like you're just this, it's like this weird almost like God-like experience you're having
*  in terms of like being able to take a room full of 300 people and bring them with you on a journey
*  and take them from where they are to a place where they're hysterically laughing.
*  It's like a chemical reaction to change people's, I mean, that's why I'm going to go do it in a tent.
*  You're giving them a drug. Yeah. You're giving them a drug. Yeah. And I'm not going to do a lot
*  of those shows, but I said, I'll do one. Let me see what it's like. I'm curious as to what it's like.
*  And I've shit on them and I still may after I do it, but like, I want to see what it's like to just
*  do it in the circumstances it can be done right now. Are you going to do one with Bert, those
*  driving things you were talking about? That I'm not going to do. I love him, but I'm not going to
*  do, I don't want to entertain cars. Like you sit people in a parking lot. I'm cool. When I start
*  performing at Dodge Durango's and listen, God bless him. He's got a huge fan base. A lot of people
*  do it. I think Gaffigan did it. I just personally don't, I feel like that's way too disconnected
*  for me. This is all personal, right? Yeah. Everybody's going to think like, I love podcasting.
*  I try to be as funny as I can. I do these crazy rants and that gets a little bit out that I need
*  to get out. I would rather do that than perform in front of cars. Yeah. I don't know, man. I think
*  I'm going to try the car thing once. I'll try the car thing. You got to try it all once. But
*  Burt's doing it all over the country. He's basically going to drive through tour. What I
*  love about Burt, Burt was like, they were like, we're shutting down comedy. He's like, no, we're
*  not. Yeah. Burt's like, we're not. Yeah. He just got shoveled out there, but it's also, it's, you
*  know, the thing about COVID, it does give you an opportunity if you're a comic to sort of sit down
*  and rethink things and also to really appreciate what it's like to do standup again. Yeah, that's
*  true. Like when we did that weekend in Houston, like I did it with Moses and Hinchcliffe. And when
*  we came back, we were like, man, I missed that. Yeah. My God, that was fun. Yeah. I mean, I know
*  that I'm walking into a situation where I might, I might get off stage and go, oh, fuck this forever,
*  because it's a rough, you know, it's going to be different. It's not a club. Well, they're going to
*  be thankful though. But I'm going to be thankful. We're going to have a lot of fun. They're going to
*  be thankful. I mean, tickets sold immediately and like, we're putting more shows on and then it's
*  my home. I from Long Island. So I'm going to have a lot of fun there with the people that come out.
*  And where I think that, cause it's going to be a really great place to ease back in because I'm
*  going to be able to do some material, go off the top of my head, know that the crowd has a lot of
*  shared experiences with me because we all grew up in the same place. It's kind of a training wheels
*  to kind of come back in. And then hopefully I'm hoping by this winter, we're kind of start revving
*  up again because we can't, I mean, what are we going to do? Well, what do we do if COVID is like
*  this next August? If we're all the way to next August and still like this, I think it is a certain
*  time we're going to have to make that distinction because like at the end of the day, how does the
*  economy survive? How does the country survive without these things? I mean, sports is a mental,
*  people need sports. They need to participate. Like they need to watch sport. Like you can't take all
*  of this away forever. I mean, there's all these freaks. Listen, I get the people that the masks
*  that are like coughing and in elderly people's faces, no good. But on the other side, you have
*  these people that are like these weird, like cat moms that are like wine drunk, baking bread on
*  Instagram. It's like, honey, we can't do this for 10 years. I know you're happy because you're this
*  weird freak that doesn't like leaving anyway. People need to fucking leave their homes. Yeah,
*  they need to leave their homes and there's not a lot of entertainment coming down the pipe either.
*  Not a lot of movies being made. No, not a lot of ways to entertain yourself. And these studios are
*  trying to figure out ways to film these movies and keep people safe, but it's hard, man. Yeah,
*  they got to quarantine everybody and put in hotels and it's difficult. And but that's why I think
*  eventually, you know, New York COVID rates are very low. I think that it's going to blow through.
*  I think there might be a little second wave, but I think eventually the viruses weaken,
*  they weaken and they disappear. It happened in 1918 with the Spanish flu. They weaken and this
*  will weaken. Yeah. Why does the virus weaken? Well, you know, it just, I'm an epidemiologist
*  and what you see is a lot of times the virus is just, it goes into the hosts and then eventually
*  the virus is like, eh. Like what causes it? Is it the people that have? It just runs through. It's
*  just like a picture of somebody that just fucks everybody that they've just ran through everybody.
*  They move to the next town, right? You just fuck everybody and then you're like, what am I going to
*  do? And then if you fuck like 30 people, by the time you fuck the 31st person, you barely have a
*  hard on. You're blowing out dust. Yeah, you're going to have a hard on. So I think this virus just, I mean, I don't know. I don't
*  know exactly how it happens, but it does historically happen. It's happened. Yeah, historically. I mean,
*  this is a different kind of disease though. I think the big problem is the bigger issue actually now
*  is economic, even though COVID is a massive issue. I think the bigger issue is how are we going to
*  stop 28 million people from being evicted or foreclosed on because they couldn't go to jobs.
*  The government literally shut down the economy. These people could not work. So through no fault
*  of their own, they have a real problem here. There's a real like housing issue. Not just that. How
*  about the businesses that are closed down? How do you restart a business when you have no money?
*  Correct. What do you do? How do you get going? And does the government have money to give these
*  people loans? I don't know. Get started again? I mean, I think they have to do something, whether
*  it's universal basic income. I don't know what they're going to do, but that economic issue is
*  going to be really, really massive. It's so fucking anxiety filled. It is. It's like, how does this end?
*  It's a great movie. In Texas. That's where it ends. It just ends in Texas that we all have guns. We all
*  just sit on our porches all day waiting for someone to come near us. How often have you shot a gun?
*  A few times, like upstate New York. I don't have a gun. I should get a gun. I didn't think I need
*  a gun when I moved to LA. I didn't think I'd have to sit on my balcony with a gun.
*  It seemed relatively safe when I moved in. People were annoying, but I didn't think they were coming
*  to kill me. I didn't think they were coming in my windows to kill me. But now that I'm like,
*  yeah, I should get a gun. I think I texted you a second week of quarantine. I'm like,
*  should I get a gun? You're like, yeah. You're one of them. You're one of my liberal friends.
*  I'm not a liberal friend, but I was like... Are you a centrist?
*  I believe in pedophile cults and lizard people. I think that's centrist. I think that's in the
*  center. I'm on the fence with lizard people, but the pedophile cults are real. They're all real.
*  I just don't care. I don't care. That's really my political option. It's like, I think it's not,
*  most of it isn't real. You're making a lot of it real. It's not real. Walk away. Like it truly,
*  like the, like most people that are real activists, a lot of them have like a degree,
*  like they're a lawyer or a doctor, and then they use their skills to actually help people.
*  And they give up really profitable careers to do that shit. But dude, your Twitter fucking posturing
*  and your virtue signaling doesn't do anything. It's fake. I know it's fake. And there's just more
*  to life than red and blue and Republican or Democrat. And all these motherfuckers are trying
*  to kill you and they're all fucking losers. And they're all just, I mean, listen, they're more
*  capable. Like all the shit that they've pulled, the CIA, all these people, they're just too good.
*  They're good. They've beat me. They're going to win. They're going to win. The CIA is going to
*  beat you. Maybe you should join. I don't know who needs to hear. I'd love to, but I don't know who
*  needs to hear this, but like stop investing your emotion, all your emotions and your time and
*  energy into this thing. Like you would be so much better off if you just found something you enjoyed
*  and did it right. But you don't want them taking away your rights and closing email accounts.
*  Are they sure? Don't take my voice. Send fucking matter. They're going to take them by the gun.
*  Do whatever you got to do. Like there's no winning here. Do you believe in a well armed
*  militia? I think that's necessary. Yeah. But look, I mean, you could, yeah, I'm all for people having
*  guns, but a militia, like it seems like more now than ever, the idea of forming a militia is in
*  people's minds. It's going to happen. It'll happen. There'll be skirmishes. There'll be violence in the
*  street, but it's like, that's what I was most worried about with Portland and Seattle. Yeah.
*  At the end of the day, you know, I mean, I don't know, you know, this country is not designed for
*  massive re-imagining. That's sad to say. I can say it. I'm a comedian. It is what it is,
*  but the reality is it's just not, it's going to disintegrate like everything else that's ever
*  fucking existed on the planet. And you just hope that the plane lands slowly and doesn't
*  nose dive into the ground. But the best days are over here. The bright, like the hopeful,
*  you know, we're going to the moon. That's, that's done. Really? You don't think so?
*  I think we could be in a little bit of a blip and we'd make a nice resurgence. And in a year
*  and a half from now, everything's looking good. I don't know. I think we just head into a dystopian,
*  insane kind of like tech world where we just all live on compete, like reality barely exists.
*  That's a real problem. It's a dystopian world we're heading into.
*  Well, the real problem is if everything goes into like a ready player one type situation where
*  whatever they can manufacture on a computer with artificial reality is more interesting.
*  That's going to happen. And listen, most P here's the problem. Most people don't care. They don't
*  want these rights. They actually don't. You like them because you're like a successful person.
*  Most people don't give a shit about their rights. They want pizza. They want chicken wings. They
*  want fucking soda. They want cheap credit. They want to go on a cruise once a year. They don't
*  give a shit about their rights. They don't care. They want Netflix and they want, you know, garlic
*  knots. And that's the, that's what it is. And you could pretend like America is just not a country
*  like freedom loving. There's a few of those people. Most people are just like, Hey, whatever. And
*  they're the happiest people. A lot of those people I'm talking about are actually the happier
*  people. They're not trying to build an empire. They're not trying to succeed. They just enjoy
*  like putting something warm and doughy in their mouth, vegging out and fucking wake it up the
*  next day and go, shit, I'm here again. And, and they're the happiest people. They like to get
*  drunk and go boating. That's it. They like to get fucked up and go out on the lake, go out on the
*  lake and get railed up and yeah. And it's fun. What are you going to sit around all day, worry
*  about what DARPA is doing. It's like the fuck kind of life is that grill a burger. It's over. I mean,
*  enjoy it. It's the end. The end's not that bad as ends go as things as ends go. This end happens to
*  be hilarious. And there's still food in the food stores. Yeah, that's a good point. As of right now,
*  I like your optimism. This is a good end. It's not a bad end. It's not the worst end. I want to see
*  what happens when Joe Biden gets into office. I want to see what happens. He's going to sleep a lot. He'll nap a lot. I want to see what the
*  speeches are like when he forgets what he's talking about. He's going to have no clue. Kamala, he'll run
*  for a term. He'll live for a term. It's Kamala. And if you pronounce it wrong, you're racist.
*  I call her K-dog. K-dog. No, she's going to run. He'll do one term and then she'll run. I don't think
*  he'll run for a second term. He's already too old. He'll do one term. She'll come in again. No one
*  will care about politics. She'll be yassqueening all over the place. If he does run for a second term,
*  he'll be in his 80s. He's not going to run for a second term. She'll run. She knows that. That's why
*  she's pumped. But do you think they have to think that through when they run for president? Like if
*  you're 78 and you're barely hanging on now? It's probably unspoken, but I think that that's probably,
*  I think why he picked her is because she's young and vital. Yeah, everybody's kind of comfortable
*  with her. She's a centrist. She's a cop. She doesn't care. She'll put you right in jail. She'll put
*  the cuffs on you. The government, the larger power centers are very happy with her. She'll throw them
*  in the vans. She'll brand you. They love it. So if she runs, who's her VP? God only knows. I mean,
*  someone else that shares her values, which are aesthetic politics and a lot of prison.
*  Potten calls from many requiring all Americans to wear masks. Three months, he says. For three months.
*  He was joined at briefing by his newly named running mate. Let me hear it. It's weird.
*  That's a long speech. I want to hear some of it. I just want to hear his voice.
*  Okay, here it goes. Give me some. When one arrives and what plans will be made for it,
*  we talked about, significantly about the racial disparities that exist and how it is COVID-19 is
*  affecting the different races differently. And we talked about the continued lack of PPE, protective
*  equipment and testing capacity and the like. But, and I put out a comprehensive plan over the last
*  three months on each of these things. But today I want to talk about one thing, very straightforward.
*  Doesn't have anything to do with Democrats, Republicans or independents. It has to do with
*  a simple proposition. Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside.
*  What? For the next three months at a minimum.
*  Every governor should mandate, every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing.
*  The estimates by the experts are it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months.
*  40,000 lives. The people act responsibly. And it's not about your rights, it's about
*  your responsibilities as an American. That's a bad line. It's not a great line. I get what he's saying.
*  At least he got through that without stumbling. He seems to be getting better. They're injecting
*  him with something that he's getting better. Yeah, no, legit. Yeah, they got Alpha Brain on an IV drip.
*  Yeah, right into his dick hole. He's going slower now. Because remember, he used to be fast.
*  Well, he does have a stutter. He's always had a bit of an issue.
*  I don't know. It's so depressing that these people rule us, but then you also go,
*  who even wants this fucking job? And if you're really talented and you don't even want that job.
*  And it's like, I mean, look at this one. She's Indian, she's black, she doesn't know what she is.
*  She's everything. Best for their health, their well-being and for their families.
*  That's what real leadership looks like. And when Joe talks about his priorities, he knows and he
*  cares about the fact that we have as a nation witnessed 165,000 people who just in the last
*  few months have died in our country. We know that those individuals represent families,
*  loved ones, grandparents, parents, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles.
*  Sisters. Those are all people she could have put in jail. She's so upset because we could have put
*  handcuffs on all of those people. They could have been out there fighting wildfires for a dollar an
*  hour. They could have been working for Walmart for 10 cents an hour in the Kamala Harris prison
*  program. Yeah. What are you going to do? It's just wild that these are our choices. Trump
*  or this old fella. But that's what I mean. It's like, this is kind of the beginning of the
*  sense to me as a vice president, like, you know, get away from all the prison stuff.
*  She makes all the right people feel comfortable. Yeah. She makes all the right, like all the people
*  that need somebody in there that will, you know, check the boxes, check all the boxes. Yeah. And
*  Who's that guy? I don't like him. Don't want to try. Who is he? I don't know. What does Donald Trump say?
*  Oh, he's wearing a mask. Yeah. We're not united in our effort to defeat invisible China virus.
*  Many people say that it is patriotic to wear a face mask when you can't socially distance.
*  There is nobody more patriotic than me. Your favorite president. Yeah. This is the end. I mean,
*  this is the end. This is out of a movie. You tweeted to Bill Maher today. What did he say?
*  He went off on Bill Maher. Oh, because Bill Maher did that thing about him. He did a eulogy for him.
*  Yeah. He said he wouldn't, he wouldn't get a eulogy. So he gave him. Trump was not happy about that.
*  Oh my God. Let me just see what he said to him. I didn't see that. Yeah. I got it in here somewhere.
*  It's, it's actually pretty funny. He, uh, it's just funny that he spent so much time thinking
*  about this. Um, he goes, uh, his ego is the thing, man. That's the thing that really watched Bill Maher
*  last night for the first time in a long time. He's totally shot, looks terrible, exhausted,
*  gaunt and weak. If there was ever a good reason for no shutdown, check out this jerk. He never
*  had much going for him, but whatever he did have is missing in action. Wow. What a crazy tweet.
*  The suburban housewife will be voting for me. They want safety and are thrilled that I ended
*  long, the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood.
*  Biden would reinstall it in a bigger form with Cory Booker in charge. I mean, this is kind of
*  just very race baiting stuff, you know, he's basically like, yeah, I mean, this is real coded
*  stuff. You know, that's kind of ugly. Is that what they call a dog whistle? Yeah. I've never
*  heard that before. Dog whistles a new thing. I've dog whistles new. And a lot of the things
*  they say dog whistles aren't, they're just people are talking. But when you say stuff like that,
*  where you're like invade, use words like that, you like low income housing is invading your
*  neighborhood. You're kind of like housewives. We know what you're doing here. Yeah. The housewives,
*  we know I must start team climbing in the window, low income housing, you know, it's, you know,
*  but that's what he's, this is what he's doing. Do you think he gets advised to say these things?
*  Do you think these things? No, I don't think anyone's advising him. I think there's all him.
*  That's what's crazy, right? He's a creature and a creation of all of the cultural trends that his
*  supporters hate, which are Hollywood and big tech. Well, he is a creation of those two things. One
*  of the most wild things recently was the the Bubba thing with the NASCAR with the news. Yeah. Like
*  when he was saying that NASCAR screwing up the lowest ratings ever. And first of all, they had
*  the problem getting rid of the flag. Like the, I mean, the Confederate flag. The Confederate flag.
*  Not only that, the ratings aren't low. Yeah. How about what he said to the Fox news anchor when he
*  when they go, well, you know, who's done more for black people than me? And they're like Lincoln.
*  And he's like, well, that's debatable. Yeah. And then she goes, well, we're free, Mr. President,
*  because yeah, you're free. Like that's wild. It's just, it's just wild. He's a problem. He's off
*  the cuff. He's not thinking. But even off the cuff, this is really, yeah, it's a narcissist on a level
*  that any no one's really ever seen that before in public life at this level. And it just should,
*  he's the worst guy in a crisis. This is the worst guy you would never, you wouldn't want a guy
*  leading a boy scout troop in a hurricane during this. Like, this is a guy that just belittles
*  people, vindictive, blames people. He doesn't take responsibility for anything. There's a
*  smallness to him. And it's all very funny. Like it's all hilarious. But when you talk about
*  leading an organization, there's probably a lot of issues. There's a lot of issues. Yeah. Look at
*  that hair. His hair is wild, man. I kind of respect his hair. Shower rules to be eased after Trump hair
*  complaints. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean? Talking about how
*  much water comes out of a shower head and then like dishwashers and shit and like people make
*  fun of him for that. But why doesn't he shave his head? He'd look great. He'd be free. That hair is
*  so much of his thing. It's chaos. Yeah, it's chaos. Exactly. That hair is like his brain itself.
*  Oh, so shower heads, you can't take a shower. The water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands.
*  The water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer. You take a shower
*  longer because my hair, I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect, he says. Perfect.
*  Because my hair, I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. That's madness. Yeah. Well,
*  that's what he should be focusing on right now. That's so crazy. His hair. He should be focusing
*  on the hair and Bill Maher show. Yeah. Bill Maher looking gaunt. Yeah, Bill Maher looking gaunt.
*  I mean, it'll be interesting to see these debates. Are they going to have debates? They're going to
*  have some version. I think Kamala is going to be like, I got this. She's going to be good with
*  Pence. She's pretty good. But him and Biden are going to be very interesting. But I don't know
*  how many people are going to watch. I mean, I think a lot of people will watch depending on the format.
*  I wonder how many they'll actually have. I mean, they're not going to be able to be in the same
*  room the way they used to be. Remember when the Hillary thing was going on where he was circling
*  behind him? Yeah, it was creepy. Wild. And then you remember the thing where he brought the five
*  women to the debate to accuse Bill Clinton. It's live right now and there's 72 people watching it.
*  No. This is the White House's. 72 likes? No, it can't be 72 people. That's what that means.
*  That's YouTube suppressing their views. This is their, not YouTube. This is Periscope. Can't be real.
*  This is the White House's Twitter. Well, why don't you click on it again and see if it makes 73?
*  Refresh your browser. Jamie's part of the problem. You're part of the problem, Jamie. Deep state. I want to hear what he's saying.
*  Let's hear what he's saying. What's he got? You know, 500,000 applications coming in going all
*  over the state. Nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was
*  a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. It was a basic disaster. It's mail-in voting.
*  Mail-in voting. And we can give you many other locations and sites. What has happened is that's part of a big
*  negotiation. That's a actually small part of a big negotiation. He likes to do this. Yeah. Make it small.
*  This is his hands. Here's all the complicated stuff. He brings it in. Yeah. This and then that.
*  It's a master. He's like a master communicator, but he's not, but he is. It's like a weird thing.
*  Told you that was likes. 12,000 people. But still. I just clicked on it again. Still, 12,000 people.
*  Shit. It's nothing. We can go live on YouTube and have 120,000 people in five seconds. Yeah.
*  That's so crazy. I mean, he is, he is, it's been a while. It's very interesting. I wonder about the
*  kids that are growing up under him, like the young kids that have no idea about politics except for
*  Trump. Like they've never had any experience with anybody else. This is what they know a president
*  is. And they're going to vote for the first time when he's in office. Like a lot of 15 year olds
*  that were 15 when he got elected. This is how a president talks. And that's why a lot of those
*  kids are going to this just tick tocky like dancing and nihilism and just being like, yeah,
*  nothing means anything. And they're right. It's also, I mean, imagine being a kid during the
*  formative time of your life, the world gets shut down. You're stuck at home and you can't even see
*  your friends. You can't go to school. You got to do school over a laptop. It's crazy. It's weird.
*  It's crazy. My kids go to school over laptops and I've sat in the room and watch and those teachers
*  when no one's watching the teacher, they don't care. They don't give a fuck. They're so bad.
*  They're so apathetic. Yeah. I abolish teachers. I said that on my podcast the other day. I said,
*  abolish teachers, defund and abolish. Is that getting a lot of press? No, I tried to start a
*  movement. It failed, but I said, if we're going to let people please themselves, let kids learn on
*  their own, abolish teachers. Okay. So no cops, no teachers. Yeah. What else? I mean, teachers have
*  a much worse track record than cops. If you look at the numbers, well, they don't get paid as much
*  as cops. Well, but still if cops were shooting as many people as teachers were failing,
*  I don't think it's that way. I think that's like, we would have to make cops responsible for
*  suicides too then. But here's the whole thing. Teachers, a lot of them are not doing a good job.
*  Yes, but a lot of kids aren't showing up. But if those are the education suicides. I know, but I'm
*  saying that if a lot of a group, if we're going to broad brush a group, I like to do that. If we're
*  going to broad brush cops, let's broad brush teachers. Get rid of them too. Okay. Who else
*  do we get rid of? Garbage people take care of your own garbage. No, we need them. We need them. Do we
*  when people don't have a job? It's true. That's true. That's where universal basic income comes from.
*  Yeah. Get rid of cops, teachers, firefighters. You never see a fire. Let's be honest. I see
*  fires all the time. No, you don't. I've been evacuated three times. They take care of themselves.
*  The reality is you never see a fire downtown in the city. These guys put the sirens on,
*  they're going to a movie. They're liars. Sometimes they go down. They're white supremacists. These
*  firemen are white supremacists. What about the black ones? Multiracial white supremacy,
*  endemic white supremacy. They don't even know. Yeah, but I don't know. I mean, there's very few
*  good solutions with COVID. With this, it's like we're going to live in an imperfect world. We have
*  to decide what version of an imperfect world is sustainable. All right. President. Yeah. You're
*  the president. President Tim Dillon. What do we do next? What do we do next? You took over right now.
*  We'd have to do a universal basic income for six months. We'd have to do an eviction freeze.
*  Where does the money come from? We print it. We've printed everything else. Yeah, but you know how
*  much money would be involved in universal basic income for how many millions of Americans? Well,
*  you could also do, well, it's a stimulus. They're doing it right now with the stimulus. I think the
*  bigger problem is the eviction freeze. You'd have to freeze evictions. You've got to freeze that.
*  Got to freeze that. And mortgages as well. Mortgages and evictions. Mortgages and rent.
*  Yes, freeze. I would do that. I think that's the most- But for how long? How long you freeze it for?
*  Four months? Five months? Six. Six. And then you would have to open back up.
*  I would put all of the resources and energy. There's not a coordinated federal response.
*  At Corona, it's all state responses, which I understand makes sense to a certain degree
*  because states are dealing with different things. But there's been a lack of a federal, I think,
*  targeted response of here's what we hope happens. Here's what we can do.
*  I think right now people are just living without the idea of hope or the idea that something is
*  going to get better or reopen. And I think that they need that. And that needs to be on a federal
*  level. The country needs to go, hey, we're going to get moving again. We're going to be able to
*  travel internationally. We're going to be able to do all these things we used to do. Here's what
*  needs to happen first. And there doesn't seem to be a huge push for that kind of clarity.
*  My real fear is the thing that we were talking about earlier, that businesses are not going to
*  have enough money to reopen and that money won't be available. So how do you get the
*  economy back on track? Well, I think it's got to bottom out probably. And unfortunately,
*  you've got to protect vulnerable people. But the bottoming out, and I don't mean bottoming out
*  completely, but the real estate value is being lowered. All of these things happening, it's
*  going to be a years long process. I don't think it's immediate. I think it's years.
*  And I think eventually what happens is you have a situation where because of economic turmoil,
*  you might have... But yeah, the businesses you're talking about are probably fucked,
*  but those people might have a shot in three years when rents are lower and the cost of financing is
*  potentially probably not lower, but maybe if we keep the cost of financing low. I mean,
*  that's the other thing. Interest rates are going to creep up and it's going to cost people a lot
*  more money to borrow money. So much of the economy is run on just this cheap credit that we've had
*  since Obama's been Schiff and all those guys explain it where it's just like, it's a credit
*  card and we're just basically borrowing money at close to no interest and businesses are expanding
*  and people are able to get cars and go on vacations and get mortgages. When those interest
*  rates creep up, I mean, it's just a perfect storm of problems. Jesus, Tim. It's a lot of problems.
*  Trying to end this on a happy note. I mean, listen. It's 3 o'clock. I'm trying to like,
*  let's wrap it up in a high note. Here's the happiness. It's over. Enjoy it. It's over.
*  Enjoy it. It's over. Enjoy it. Meaning that it's not going to end like, like, listen,
*  we're going to limp through this somehow. We're going to be a broken and beaten and battered,
*  but we're going to get through it. We need a war with China. We need another 9-11. I hope the
*  people that run us are thinking of those things and I bet they are. Really? Yeah, we need a war
*  with China. A war with China. We need a false flag that gets us into a war with China. But a war
*  with China kills everybody. It kills a lot of people, but the rest of the people will open up
*  coffee shops. Glow in the dark coffee. Hey, it is what it is. I mean, there's no good ways out of
*  this. I think we probably need a prolonged war with China. Jesus Christ. And here's the other
*  thing. Before we leave, can I say this? Yeah. Can I say this? War with China, ding. And I don't want
*  that, but we need it. Who's closer to get us into a war with China? Joe Biden or Trump?
*  I think Trump looks like it, but I think no matter who wins, we're just going to need a
*  war with China. It could be a cold war. It doesn't have to be a hot war. It could be a cold war.
*  Oh, cold war. Fun cold war. Cold war. They build a thing. We build a thing. Oh, okay. Yeah, we need
*  that because the whole economy is fake. We need that. Here's the other thing. Derek Chauvin needs
*  to get Epstein in prison. And here's why they're not going to convict him on murder too,
*  because it's going to be a hard time proving intent with that body cam footage. So what about
*  the body cam footage? Well, I mean, I don't know if they can, the body cam footage shows that this,
*  they have Floyd in the car and then he's out. I mean, listen, everything Chauvin did was disgusting
*  and horrible. But I don't know if you're going to be able to prove to a jury that he intended
*  to kill this guy, murder him, or he was subduing a suspect who was resisting arrest. I mean,
*  he wasn't resisting arrest. Not at that moment, but he was like, he was like,
*  but listen, when someone's resisting arrest, when they stop resisting, you're supposed to stop
*  leaning your knee on their neck. No, everything he did was indefensible. I'm just saying. But
*  that's murder too then. If he dies from that. Did he intend to kill him? This is what,
*  that's the whole thing. It's intent. So the reality is, I'm not- But that's crazy. That's
*  like if you stabbed someone, but you didn't intend to kill him. Listen, I'm just saying he can't get
*  off. He can knock it off. He can't get off. I agree. So who was that guy that was Epstein's roommate?
*  The guy with the muscles? Oh yeah. He needs to go room with him. That's right. He needs to go room
*  with him, war with China. The cop. The big cop with the dogs. That's what needs to happen. Yeah. These
*  are the solutions folks. You may not like them, but they're the solutions. Tim Dillon, ladies and
*  gentlemen. Thank you so much. War with China. There's the guy. He's got to kill that guy. We
*  got to move on. Okay. And then we got to invade China. He looks like he's ready to go.
*  Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. I love you buddy. I love you too. Thank you so much for
*  everything. It's always a pleasure. It's crazy that I walked in here like a little over a year ago and
*  I did this podcast and I had to move in and change my whole fucking life. It was amazing.
*  And you've done that for a lot of people. So thank you. It's my pleasure. Yeah. Thank you so much.
*  That's one of my proudest things. One of the things that makes me most happy about this podcast is
*  that it helps people. Thank you so much. My pleasure, brother. I appreciate it. It's always
*  a fun time. Thank you, brother. It was no different. I love everybody. Thank you. Bye.
*  Let's not go to war. I want to get you in trouble at the end.
