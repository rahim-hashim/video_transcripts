**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM)
*  I'm going to say it was. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=0.0s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4.66s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5.66s)]
*  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do you know who wrote that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=11.26s)]
*  No. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=19.64s)]
*  Pop quiz. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=20.64s)]
*  Who? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=21.64s)]
*  Very famous person wrote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=22.64s)]
*  Where is that from? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=23.64s)]
*  What show is that from? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=24.64s)]
*  70s. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=27.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=28.32s)]
*  S. Stanford and Son. Yes. Who wrote it? You're not gonna believe it. Quincy Jones. Really? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=29.32s)]
*  Yes. And it's, if you hear the whole song, it's a really good song. I used to love that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=36.4s)]
*  show. Stanford and Son was fucking great. It was funny. It was funny, ridiculous. Red [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Fox was the man. He was so funny on that. I actually didn't like that theme song. Here [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  we go. When I first heard it. That was back when sitcoms were sitcoms. That one was the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=52.12s)]
*  like way, I felt like way better. Like Three's Company sucks if you watch that now. But that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=62.16s)]
*  was like the number one sitcom. Stanford and Son is still good. Yeah. You know what's underrated [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=67.16s)]
*  that I really never gave a chance? Wait, I want to guess. Big Bang Theory. Oh fuck. Fuck, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=72.72s)]
*  I fucked it up, sorry. I would have said Big Bang Theory. It's a good show. I used to shit [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=75.96s)]
*  on it because I saw clips with, you know how you do retakes. Where they're not laughing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=81.0s)]
*  No laughs. Yeah. But that's, you know what that is? That's like retakes. When you work on a sitcom, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=85.56s)]
*  sometimes you have to do pickups. Yeah. I actually don't know, but yes. Oh, you do pickups and nobody [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=90.88s)]
*  knows anymore. Nobody does it anymore. Yeah. Miss Pat is like the only person I know with a sitcom. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=97.36s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't name one sitcom. Think about all the comics we know. I know one comic with a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=102.28s)]
*  sitcom, Miss Pat, and it's on a streaming. It's on BET. Yeah, and that was everything. When I was [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=108.28s)]
*  first starting, your whole thing was like you have to get a sitcom or you don't have any money. Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=114.84s)]
*  Well, or you're never going to have a career because you needed, there was no way to get people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=120.76s)]
*  to come see you in the clubs unless you had a special or unless you had a sitcom. Yeah. And I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=125.44s)]
*  remember Zach Galifianakis, it was pilot season. Remember that whole thing? Oh yeah. That was huge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=131.08s)]
*  Pilot season's coming up. Oh yeah, everybody would be in town for pilot season. Yeah. Everybody would [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=136.2s)]
*  be like a special kind of anxious. Yeah. Because your whole fucking career was laying on this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=140.92s)]
*  moment where you walked into this room and there was these weirdos, these casting people, there [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=148.44s)]
*  were always really socially bizarre people. And like tired and mad, they've seen some people. And [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=154.6s)]
*  it's always a tiny room. And dismissive. And they're the kings and you are a peasant begging for a bowl [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=160.2s)]
*  of soup. Yeah. And when you walk in, they know they don't want you. Like they also know you're broke. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=165.48s)]
*  Yeah. And you have that desperate energy. You want them to be, you want them to like you. Hi, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  hi guys. Want you to like me. Offloading is what it is. Oh, death. I didn't get any, I never got a [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=176.44s)]
*  sitcom. I auditioned probably for a thousand. I don't know why someone didn't say this isn't, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=182.92s)]
*  you're not good at this. No one told me. You could have been on Big Bang Theory, ironically. I could [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=187.16s)]
*  have been. You would have been a fucking major get for them. I would have been a huge get for them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=191.0s)]
*  Show would have been a lot better. I had actually, I did get one of them. Now this is the story. Let [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=195.56s)]
*  me tell you this story. Okay. So I go in and you know, you got like a callback. Okay. First [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  casting director. And then you're like, please like me. Then you're like callback and like, oh, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=206.2s)]
*  they like me. Second callback. Now I get like real nervous. I can make it. It was a show, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=210.44s)]
*  Happy Family. Ever hear of that? Little nugget. What year are we talking about? 2003. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=215.0s)]
*  A long time ago. That guy, Larriquette was on it. Oh yeah. I remember him saying he was, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  he's dropping on the set and he goes, my friend Don told me that on my gravestone, it should say, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  it's not a great plot, but Larriquette's in it. He told that funny joke. Boy. So he was, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  the John Larriquette show was on the same lot as I was when I was filming news radio. And Lenny [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=242.60000000000002s)]
*  Clark, who's a good friend of mine forever. Lenny was on that show and you know, I'd run into Lenny [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=250.36s)]
*  in the parking lot. We'd talk, but we would watch their feed where John Larriquette would like, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=255.24s)]
*  yell at people. That's you. The feed is always, they forget there's a feed. Yeah. People were [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=259.24s)]
*  screaming about, but no one had a cell phone back then. You know, we're talking in the nineties. So [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=265.64s)]
*  this is probably 94 or something like that. And it was a bizarre scene, man. I never adjusted to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=270.04s)]
*  being on television. I never did. That's a good gig though. I mean, shit. That was like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, and I couldn't wait to not do it anymore. Once I did it. Really? Yeah. And I had the best [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  version of it. I had the best version of it. Hilarious cast, brilliant writers. What was that? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=287.32s)]
*  The stress of it. It was just like, I just wanted to do stand up, you know, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=292.76s)]
*  cause you're getting a little famous and then you have eight lines and you said they could do [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=297.96s)]
*  whatever you want. And then you're like, blah, blah, blah. And then as far as that was also the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=301.96s)]
*  problems, I knew I was never going to get another sitcom like news radio. The other sitcoms that I [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=306.68s)]
*  read for were fucking garbage. After that, did they want you to do some something after? Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=311.08s)]
*  There was a few opportunities. I had a couple of development deals to do stuff, but then when fear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=317.08s)]
*  factor came on, my first thought was like, yes, no actors. Oh really? Yeah. I didn't have to deal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=323.0s)]
*  with like the whole thing, like the whole thing of the schmoozing and the, you know, going to these [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=328.12s)]
*  award things and these parties and these press junkets that you had to do. It's like, I didn't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=334.12s)]
*  like it. It just felt, I don't know. It was just weird. You know, I never auditioned for anything. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=340.36s)]
*  Like I auditioned for a couple of commercials in New York. I auditioned for two shows ever. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=347.96s)]
*  Hardball. Bring it back to my Larroquette story. Don't think it would work out. Go to your Larroquette story. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=354.44s)]
*  No, no, I want to hear this. I'm just, I want to say it out loud cause I set up a story and then I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=357.4s)]
*  didn't finish it. So I got this show when I was living in New York. It was called Hardball and I came [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=361.32s)]
*  out here to LA. Oh, wait a minute. Yeah. It was a baseball show. I, I remember Jim Brewer was in the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=366.12s)]
*  pilot with me. I Mike star from good fellows was in it. I don't know that guy. Bruce Greenwood, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=372.2s)]
*  who was in star track. He's been in everything. He's a great actor. He was in it. He was like the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=379.0s)]
*  older pitcher that was like my nemesis. Terrible show. Terrible show. Like so bad. I think I saw [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=383.64s)]
*  that guy. So bad. The intro of it or something. I remember Hardball. Yeah, it lasted six episodes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=389.56s)]
*  And then the other show that I got was news radio and it was the only other show I auditioned for. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=396.12s)]
*  It was just so I'm so everything else I auditioned for was like movies and stuff that I never got. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=400.6s)]
*  And there was a couple of shows after news radio was over that I auditioned for that I didn't get, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=405.32s)]
*  but it was just like the, it was so bizarre. So when I would go to these auditions for other things, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=409.72s)]
*  it wasn't that big a deal because I was already on news radio. So it wasn't like if I didn't get [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=415.56s)]
*  these things, it was like, this will be okay. But it was like, still the anxiety of that, like I had [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=420.68s)]
*  money and it was still like, Oh, this is awful. Like this whole thing is so stressful and so weird. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=426.36s)]
*  And everybody's so fucked up because you get a bunch of people that desperately want attention. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=431.0s)]
*  And then you go there to this place where you're surrounded by people who are desperate want [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=435.0s)]
*  attention in Hollywood. And then you're, you have this one moment in front of these people [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=439.56s)]
*  and they're looking at you like this. Okay. Kyle. So you're reading for Bobby. Correct. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=445.4s)]
*  I love the script. So funny. You know, Bobby's an athlete. Yeah. No, I can do all the things. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=451.08s)]
*  Whatever you say, I can do it. I'm good at it. Right. Okay. Tim here is going to read with you [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  and Tim like could barely read. It's always like some PA probably on ketamine barely read. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=461.64s)]
*  And you have to like pretend like you're having this emotive moment with Tim. I'm so glad I don't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=468.44s)]
*  have to do that. It was the worst, but some people love it. Some people look, man, we're comics. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=473.56s)]
*  Some people are actors. They fucking love it. Like McConaughey, that fucking dude loves like pouring [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=478.92s)]
*  himself into a role, getting psychotic about who the character is. That's I wish I, if I could go [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=485.4s)]
*  back, I wish I looked at those as like, I have someone said this as like an opportunity to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=491.08s)]
*  perform instead of like, I'm trying to get something. Right. I didn't, I was just desperate. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=495.24s)]
*  Like I had no money and I have to get this. I will say though, if you're on a sitcom that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=499.32s)]
*  has really good writing, it's fun as shit. News radio was fun. You said you just got it. How'd you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=503.24s)]
*  just just had a development deal with an NBC and they were going to do, I was going to do my own [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  show, but they had a sitcom that they were already green lit and Ray Romano was on it and Ray was [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=512.52s)]
*  like the maintenance guy and Ray got fired during the pilot, which is like the best thing that ever [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  happened to him. He goes on to do the Ray. Everybody loves Raymond and it's fucking huge, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=525.72s)]
*  bigger than news radio ever was. So like he, he gets fired and another guy got hired and then he [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=529.4s)]
*  got fired. So I didn't feel bad because I'm friends with Ray. I love Ray. There's, I bet you that part [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=535.8s)]
*  just was not good. It wasn't the actor's fault because you audition and then I don't know what [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=540.84s)]
*  it was. It's like, you never know what they want. Like when Paul, the guy who created it, Paul Sims [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  is this brilliant guy who worked on fucking Larry HBO. Larry Sanders. Thank you. He worked on Larry [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=551.4s)]
*  Sanders. He was a brilliant, brilliant guy and he did a very clever thing. Like in the, the auditions, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=562.92s)]
*  the first audition I read for it wasn't funny. Like on purpose, they wanted to cut out all the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=568.68s)]
*  people who were hamming it up. I was like, Oh my God, this writing is nothing. So I'm like, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=574.28s)]
*  I don't know what this is. So like, you know, the NBC asked me to go in and read for it. I [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=579.08s)]
*  rememberized this stuff and I was like, I don't even know what I'm saying. This doesn't make sense. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=583.0s)]
*  So I go in and I do it. It's like real flat. And I say, thank you. And all of a sudden I have a callback [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=586.12s)]
*  and then they send me the callback sheets and it's hilarious. And I was like, Oh, whoa. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=590.6s)]
*  In order to see if you could turn something. Because that was a thing that everybody hated [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=595.88s)]

*  show. And it just, that happened. And then the one, and it just was over and I was back to, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=891.4s)]
*  I never sold my car. I was back to my studio apartment. Couldn't you think that studio [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=896.92s)]
*  executives would be wise enough to go look, we got Louis CK. We have Cedric the entertainer, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=901.8s)]
*  we have a fucking show. Let's figure out a way to promote this correctly. And it was funny. It [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=906.44s)]
*  was just, and it's so hard to make a funny sketch show. They try to plot people together. You need, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=910.6s)]
*  you know, real synergy with the cast and the writers have to figure out how people are funny. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=914.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It takes a while. The first set of SNL cast, they already work together. And like, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=918.5200000000001s)]
*  that's why they were like gelled right away. I mean, one of the reasons, but all these sketch [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=924.36s)]
*  shows they put together and they'll say, don't pitch a sketch show. They never work. It's because [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=928.36s)]
*  they like pluck people who don't even do sketch, you know, it's like putting together a boy band. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=932.44s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. You know, like you have to put together a fake band. Not a bunch of guys who [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=938.0400000000001s)]
*  grew up together in Seattle, been playing in the basement. No, that works better though. Find [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=942.44s)]
*  somebody. Yeah, that works better. You put them, just put a bunch of hot dudes together, get some [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=946.9200000000001s)]

*  By the way. And I did tell him, I said, listen, cause I tried to negotiate before I put his tights [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1352.76s)]
*  on him. Like, but they didn't, they just wore their clothes like back then. And he was like, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1357.0800000000002s)]
*  get the tights. Like, I want to see you in tights. Brian Callan was always going to acting schools [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1360.6000000000001s)]
*  and he knew they were ridiculous. But I don't, I think like Brian at one point in time was like [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1366.28s)]
*  completely enamored with the idea with being in, in Hollywood. Like he had a bunch of like [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1371.64s)]
*  famous actor friends and he'd go to famous actor parties and he'd take acting classes. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1376.5200000000002s)]
*  He's always working on his craft. I love that working on my craft, by the way. He was aware. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1381.16s)]
*  He was fucking around. Like when he would say working on my craft, he wasn't being serious. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1388.1200000000001s)]
*  He was completely joking. So he had this teacher that was, I think it was a Scientology hustle too. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1391.72s)]
*  It was one of those things. There was a lot of that, particularly in the nineties, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1397.8s)]
*  where the teachers were Scientologists. Insert, by the way, it's not the pick on Scientology, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  insert whatever religion there's a, there was a lot of Scientology that was in Hollywood though. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1406.6s)]
*  But what they would do is they would get people to join the acting class and they would try to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1411.56s)]
*  recruit them into Scientology. Cause the teacher was a Scientologist. He would talk about how [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1415.24s)]
*  important it was. You never tried to be in Scientology. Yeah. Yeah. How important was for [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  his craft? Meanwhile, they're never successful. The people that teaching the acting classes, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1424.2s)]
*  they're always terrible. They never go anywhere. Like maybe they have like a small part on one [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1428.8400000000001s)]
*  thing and then they're going to tell you how to make it. You didn't even apply it to your own life. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1433.0800000000002s)]
*  When I was a teacher, I didn't think I'd ever be. Not to say that it's not good acting teachers out [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1437.0s)]
*  there. I'm sure there are. There's people that just like love theater. They love like that kind [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1441.8s)]
*  of act. They have no desire to be famous. They love the craft. They love the art of it. That's, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1445.48s)]
*  that's true too. Right. Um, but anyway, this guy, he was really in a show tunes and uh, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1448.68s)]
*  he would do a big show, uh, you know, the end of the class or whatever, in the quarter, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1454.28s)]
*  whatever it was, he had this big show at this local theater and Brian's like, you have to come [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1459.3200000000002s)]
*  and watch a guy with the tiniest feet you've ever seen in your life. He had these little, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1465.0800000000002s)]
*  I couldn't take my eyes off his feet because he had loafers on and they were like that big. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1469.16s)]
*  And this guy would sing like so passionately these show tunes from like musicals. Like there's no [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1473.3999999999999s)]
*  context. You don't, he didn't see the musical. Like a medley, like a medley of show tunes. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1482.36s)]
*  I love that. Sounds like a great show. Well, you came there for you to see his feet. That was [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1486.84s)]
*  like the why you went there. No, Brian, Brian was like fascinated by how small his feet were. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1491.24s)]
*  And then I couldn't stop cause we were high. So I couldn't stop looking at his feet. That's not that small. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1494.9199999999998s)]
*  That no, they were tiny. They were like, that seems like a five. They were little, little tiny feet. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1498.12s)]
*  I had a date with this girl once and she was like, I have a shoe show. I'm a shoe model. Right. And [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1502.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh, a shoe show. Okay. A shoe model. Yeah. Foot, a foot model. Like she would model [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1506.44s)]
*  shoes. Okay. Like open toe shoes. I just would act like I didn't know, but that's what she would [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1512.6000000000001s)]
*  say. She was going to do this and she always had like dollar bills. She always had cash, you know? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1517.8s)]
*  And I found out years later, she was a stripper shoe show is when you have no clothes on. And I [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1522.6000000000001s)]
*  just thought she was a shoe. Oh, by the way, here's another, I thought it was going to another [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1526.92s)]
*  direction. I thought guys were paying to jerk off to her feet. Maybe she had great feet, but I, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1531.88s)]
*  another stoop, this was even the dumber class in the moving around class was called interpretation [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1538.1200000000001s)]
*  for the actor. So this week you would read a play like streetcar named desire, and then you'd come [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1542.7600000000002s)]
*  in and you'd do your interpretation of it. So the weirder you were, the better grade you got. Okay. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1550.2s)]
*  So one guy comes in, he did streetcar and he put, there was a big mirror, you know, cause also a [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1556.68s)]

*  streetcar. Yeah. And he pulled his pants down, started fucking the mirror and then he turned to [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1568.04s)]
*  us and he goes, fuck you. And he left and then everyone started clapping and I was like, I gotta [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1573.3200000000002s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. Listen to what I, so I'm like, cause I got like a D on my whatever I did. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1578.04s)]

*  the string and I was just like, nobody sails the seas if they don't find their way. Then I clipped [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1614.2s)]
*  the string and the glass fell and broke. Then I went outside. You could see it and I buried an egg. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1620.84s)]
*  It makes no fucking sense. And then the guy said, what grade do you think you should get? And I said [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1627.3999999999999s)]

*  learning, but certainly not movement for the actor or it's not brain surgery. No, it's not working [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1705.24s)]
*  on your craft. It's not even like painting. It's not even like when you crunch a ball, you throw [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1710.68s)]
*  into a basket like at work. It's the skill is like, well, it's one of the few, it's one of the few [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=1716.2s)]

*  I'd be on stage. I get attention. And then after that, you don't need that. That's not what you [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2471.56s)]
*  really want anymore. Like then it becomes like, I just want it to get better. I just want, I'm [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2479.0s)]
*  working on this thing. I just want it to work. I want it to pop on stage. I want to figure out [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2482.7599999999998s)]
*  the right beats. I want to figure out the right way to say it. Then it becomes that. And once it [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2487.72s)]
*  becomes that, that's the happy spot. That's where you're happy. When you can just create stuff, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2491.32s)]
*  you're like put it together. I wish someone told me that because I had some viral YouTube videos [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2496.68s)]
*  way back. And I was still on sitcom. I kind of get a sitcom mentality where if someone was just like, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2502.6s)]
*  dude, focus on your YouTube and get your audience go directly to your audience. But back then, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2510.36s)]
*  no one knew. No one had any idea. Just think about this podcast was started in 2009. And in 2009, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2516.52s)]
*  everybody thought it was a pathetic waste of time. Friends would come over to do my podcast and be [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2524.04s)]
*  like, what are you doing? Like, why are you doing this? It's like, it's such a waste of time. We're [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2528.6s)]
*  on a fucking webcam, but it's nobody saw that comment. So I would have never given you that [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2532.04s)]
*  advice back then. Just did you just do it because it was enjoyable. You weren't like thinking like [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2537.72s)]
*  this is the way I always wanted a radio show, but no one would ever give me a radio show. So I would, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2542.12s)]
*  when I would do radio shows, like if I would do sit in on Opie and Anthony and be like, this is so [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2547.16s)]
*  fun. I'd love to do something like this, but no one's going to give me one of these things. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2551.16s)]
*  That's how I thought about it. And so doing, when I saw Anthony Koumi, I started doing this thing [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2554.68s)]
*  live from the compound. He would do it in his basement where he played karaoke with a machine [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2560.2s)]
*  gun. He's out of his mind. He's drunk. He's got like full beer kegs on tap there. They're drinking [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2564.68s)]
*  Guinness and he's fucking doing karaoke where he's holding a machine gun. It was most ridiculous [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2571.56s)]
*  shit. But he had a full professional studio where he had green screen. He had like pro microphones [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2575.32s)]
*  just in his basement for funsies. He just did it for fun. And I was like, that's what I want to do. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2580.92s)]
*  I'll do something like that for fun. And then of course, Tom Green, like you go to Tom Green, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2585.0800000000004s)]
*  the internet show in his living room. And I remember looking around and going, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2589.56s)]
*  you just got to figure out how to make money with this. Like this is, this is a job. Like this can, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2593.88s)]
*  that's nice. You knew you wanted to do that. Wow. It just seemed like fun. That's the whole, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2598.44s)]
*  like I always loved the opportunity to talk to interesting people or funny people or, you know, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2603.48s)]
*  I'm a questioner. I like to ask questions. Like how do you, how did you know that? Why did you do [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2608.68s)]
*  that? You found the right thing. Yeah. I just got, I, it's just like the opportunity to talk to cool [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2613.72s)]
*  people seems like what a great thing that would be. Cause it's always fun to talk to cool people. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2619.4s)]
*  Like you look like if I was ever on those shows and I like ran into someone was interesting, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2624.2s)]
*  I was like, wait, how'd you start this? Like, what do you, what you. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2628.6s)]
*  Yeah. You having a lot of interests help. Oh, for sure. But back then I would have told you to get [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2632.36s)]
*  a sitcom because there was none, no money on YouTube. Everybody still wanted a sitcom back [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2639.3199999999997s)]
*  then. The only one guy who didn't. And I was like, he's lying. Zach Galifianakis was like, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2644.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't want to do a sitcom. And I'm like, oh, he's lying. But he actually had like a very, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2649.48s)]
*  um, he had his head together. Yeah. He's not lying about nothing. I mean, that guy, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2654.36s)]
*  he's the least attention whore of any famous favor, famous person, never famous funny person [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2658.68s)]
*  ever. Not at all. Doesn't he leave like a track? Yeah. Very interesting guy. Very smart guy. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2664.12s)]
*  Very smart. He was a good friends with Brody. And he was one of the first people to alert me [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2671.24s)]
*  when Brody was off the meds. Like there was a time when Brody was off his meds. Do you remember that? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2678.52s)]
*  People that don't know, we'll talk about our late great friend Brody Stevens, who was like that. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2684.36s)]
*  So funny. He was so funny. And that Brody Stevens is like one of the best examples of like, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2689.16s)]
*  it's not what's written on paper. Yeah, you wouldn't. Yeah. Right. If you got his act on [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2693.88s)]
*  paper, you're like, this is not going to work. Right. You'd be like, this is nonsense. This [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2699.0s)]
*  doesn't make any sense at all. Meanwhile, everyone's lining up in the back of the room to see him say [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2701.72s)]
*  it. So yeah, I think it's like that Andy Kaufman of our like little time period there where he was [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2705.4s)]
*  Andy Kaufman was a brilliant actor and a brilliant comedic actor. He's great on taxi, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2710.2s)]
*  but he I don't think he ever killed on stage like Brody did. Brody was one time we were in the [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2715.3999999999996s)]
*  different type of comedy, but it was like, you know, a different when he when I was on stage, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2723.16s)]
*  like people, the comedians watched. Yes. It was a different thing. He's doing his own thing. He's [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2727.64s)]
*  doing this Brody Stevens thing. One time we were at the improv and it's really late. Like I'd gone [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  up. A lot of people have gone up. The crowd was kind of tired. Half the people there. And they [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2736.92s)]
*  announced that Brody's here and Brody's worried that people are going to get up. So Brody takes [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2741.48s)]
*  his shirt off and he starts swinging around in the air over his head and walking to the crowd. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2744.76s)]
*  Let's go positive energy. And he gets on stage and he pulls drumsticks out of his back pocket, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2749.96s)]
*  starts beating the chairs and he starts talking shit. And he just changed the energy of the whole [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2757.0s)]
*  room, changed the energy of the whole room. And I don't think there's anybody like since him, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2761.88s)]
*  I can't think of somebody who's like replaced someone will replace that. But they're going to [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2766.2s)]
*  do it in their own way. You got to like, you have Brody's on stage. You have to go watch. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2769.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And the Polsman's like that now. Polsman. Oh, I don't know him. Brian Holtsman. You don't [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2773.72s)]
*  know Brian Holtsman. Oh my God. Stay in my house a lot. Oh my God. You let him stay at your house. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2778.3599999999997s)]
*  You don't even know. I say I stay at my house. You've never saw Holtsman at the comedy store. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2783.0s)]
*  No, that's crazy. You know what? I might have been just didn't know his name. Well, he would [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2786.9199999999996s)]
*  always gone late at night. And unfortunately, you know, there would be like 15 people left in [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2790.68s)]
*  the crowd and Holtsman would go on these wild rants. He's like one of the funniest guys of all [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2796.04s)]
*  time. He's so he's like a complete total comics comic. Oh, yeah, I don't know him well. Polsman's [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  at our club now all the time, all the time. But now he has a crowd. Now people know about him. So [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2806.9199999999996s)]
*  they come to see him. You cannot go there. If anything, if you if you can't tolerate literally [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2812.68s)]
*  everything, don't go. Why is it very dirty? It's not it's not dirty. It's just he's out of his [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  fucking mind. And somebody and it's kind of in character, but you're not really sure. I like that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2826.68s)]
*  Like, I'm sure wouldn't let him on stage for two weeks after 9 11. She wouldn't let him up. He can't [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2831.72s)]
*  go up. He's like, Missy, I don't understand. I'm not going to cross any lines. He was like, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2838.04s)]
*  couldn't wait to cross lines. You remember when Susan Smith, that lady drowned her kids? Yeah, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2843.24s)]
*  he goes the day the day he's on stage. Ladies and gentlemen, I heard those are bad kids. I heard [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2848.12s)]
*  they sat that close to the TV. They didn't put away their blocks. They always spilt their fucking [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2853.48s)]
*  milk. Those kids are not going to be missed. And you're like, what does the audience do? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2858.7599999999998s)]
*  Die. Hollywood Comedy Store, Sunset, Tuesday night or whatever it was. 1am. They went nuts. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2862.6s)]
*  Everybody went nuts. Yeah. But that was Holtzman. Holtzman got these late spots. So he would say [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2871.0s)]
*  the wildest, most insane shit, but also have a really good point half the time. Like it was [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2876.68s)]
*  comedy wrapped up in a point. And then every now and then he let you in on it like that. It was [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2882.52s)]
*  just just fucking around and go right back to it. Yeah. And you know, it's it's a little dance [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2886.2s)]
*  he's doing with the crowd and you got to know what the dance is. But if you know what the dance [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2891.4s)]
*  is, like comics love them. Like whenever he's on stage, we sit in the balcony and watch Holtzman [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2895.4s)]
*  at the mothership. It sounds like that other guy who's older and playing in his name. Don Barres? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2899.48s)]
*  Nope. He's like, what are you people doing here at this tower? Oh, Lewis Black? No. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2904.92s)]
*  Jesus, who are you talking about? He's at the store. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2913.4s)]
*  Eddie Pepitone? Eddie Pepitone. Oh, yeah, he's great, too. Very similar in a lot of ways, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2915.56s)]
*  like just insane energy and has a point, but is also saying completely wacky. Yeah, it's I love [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2923.88s)]
*  like these like how long careers can be. Yeah, he is. I think he started late. I think Eddie started [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2931.48s)]
*  a little late. I think so. At least I wasn't aware of him until later. It's good we have long career. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2938.92s)]
*  I was thinking about sports guys, you know, like you're a baseball player, that's your identity, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2944.68s)]
*  and then you're 30 and you're like, it's over. Yeah, well, you can go to maybe 40. Like, look, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2948.2s)]
*  Tom Brady still playing football. Was he like 42 when he retired? Still, that's youngish to have. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2953.56s)]
*  Young as fuck if you're a comic. If your identity is I'm a sports player, I'm like a sports player. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2959.24s)]
*  That's how much I know. I just revealed how what a good big sports guy, sports player. You know, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2965.16s)]
*  are you a sports player? An athlete makes a ton of money for a very short amount of time. That's why [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2972.7599999999998s)]
*  they all go broke, or not all of them, but a large amount of them go bankrupt. It's also just like, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2977.3199999999997s)]
*  you think about your identity when you're a kid and you probably get all that, you know, identity [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2983.3199999999997s)]
*  as a athletic person, then you become like a professional and must be difficult to just, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2988.2s)]
*  you have to really never hook into that. Like that's my day. It's also like if you're a really [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2993.64s)]
*  hot woman, I think it's hard when you know, you got to like not have that be your identity. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=2997.48s)]
*  It can't be your whole thing because one day it's going to go away. But if you're an athlete, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3001.88s)]
*  it goes away even quicker than being a hot lady. Like there's hot ladies that are in their 50s. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3005.0s)]
*  They're still hot. They maintain their looks. Hot ladies in the 50s. They work out, they take care [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3008.68s)]
*  of their skin, but there's no like super athletes that are in their 50s. Like they don't exist. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3013.48s)]
*  Not at a professional level. Hold on. Let me think. Go ahead. It's not possible. I know athletes. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3020.36s)]
*  There's one guy. There's one guy I can tell you that did it into his 50s. Bernard Hopkins. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3025.08s)]
*  He played golf? No, he was a boxer, world champion boxer, multiple division world champion boxer. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3030.04s)]
*  It was beating world champions at 50 years old. Did Tyson, was he full ongoing, full on? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3036.44s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not Mike Tyson, but I would say by the tone of my voice, you can sense a little [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3042.04s)]
*  bit of skepticism. Yeah. Anybody who's a combat sports athlete looked at that and said, you know, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3047.08s)]
*  I'm happy Mike Tyson made money. It seemed like he held back a little bit, but maybe there was an [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3053.96s)]
*  agreement. I wasn't there. I would be. I doubt. I'm not one for wild speculation. No, you're not. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3059.56s)]
*  No, you don't get involved in anything until he was 69 years old and 276 days. One extra game. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3065.48s)]
*  Gordie Howe. Gordie Howe. Great. Great soccer. Hockey. He was 69. Yeah. I mean, he was, he [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3071.2400000000002s)]
*  wasn't in the NHL at that point, but he played a professional hockey game at that age. Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3078.52s)]
*  That's insane. Hey, Joe, can I have a cigar? I want to look manly. I need, I need something to [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3082.36s)]
*  look manly. Let me get some fresh cheese out of the humidor. You look very manly. I mean, I thank you, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3088.1200000000003s)]
*  but I, I sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm like, Oh, that guy looks old. Kelly Slater also [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3093.1600000000003s)]
*  pro surfer still rolling. I'm going to look ridiculous. Kelly's a great example. He's another [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3100.76s)]
*  example of someone who just takes care of themselves. But Bernard Hopkins was, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3106.76s)]
*  what was like Bernard Hopkins world championship fight that he had when he was in his seven, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3112.1200000000003s)]
*  his 50s. This is a list on Wikipedia gives Albert Hughes as the oldest pro boxer at 70 years old. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3118.28s)]
*  Oh my God. That seems like a suicide. I'm going to look. I don't. I know Archie Moore, who was a [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3124.1200000000003s)]
*  famous boxer before the Muhammad Ali days. Like Archie Moore was, that's like way back in the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3130.12s)]
*  what? Oh, that's just sad. No, no, no. The guy's fighting does not look like he's trying to hit [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3141.24s)]
*  him. He wins. The old guy wins. That's what the video headlines. This, this looks like someone [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  took a motherfucking dive. That kid needed money. Yeah. This, this kid's not punching back at all. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3151.7999999999997s)]
*  He's just covering up. This looks super sus. If I was that, oh, and he just goes down. Yeah. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3159.48s)]
*  If I was the athletic commissioner, I'd have a talk with those fellows. I'm like, Hey, what are [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3164.44s)]
*  we doing here? Is this pro wrestling? White Tyson. Yeah. 36 years after his last fight. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3168.76s)]
*  Well, I do know that people have been offered fights that are fake fights. Like they've been [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3173.56s)]
*  offered fights. You do know that for a fact. 100%. I know people have been offered fights where they [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3178.52s)]
*  said you, you, you, you will win the fight. That's, I don't like that at all. I know there's celebrity [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3182.84s)]
*  boxing matches and celebrity fights that are like that where they make a deal. Would you ever do a [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3187.4s)]
*  legit fight at some point? I'm old as fuck, dude. No, did your chickens bring chicken? No, no, no, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3192.92s)]
*  no, no, no, no. You shouldn't do that kind of stuff as you get older. I don't think, I don't think [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3199.08s)]
*  your body's as resilient. Even if you stay fit and in shape, you don't want head trauma in your 50s. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3202.12s)]
*  I've hit my head so many times in my life. I'm a little worried. So Hopkins broke his own record [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3207.1600000000003s)]
*  by winning the IBF light heavyweight title from Tavares Cloud in 2013. And again, in 2014, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3211.88s)]
*  we won the WBA super title from, uh, Beibut Shumanov at ages 48 and 49. That's fucking crazy. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3219.0s)]
*  So he wins two titles, a title at age 48 and a title at age 49. Incredible. Are those rigged? No, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3228.52s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no. No, the way that he would box was super intelligent. Like he was very [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3236.28s)]
*  defensively minded. You didn't get clean shots off on Bernard Hopkins. He was, he was very clever [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3242.52s)]
*  and he understood boxing like at a very, very like deep level. His footwork was always on point, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3248.6800000000003s)]
*  never drank, never smoked, always took care of his body, ate only organic food, worked out every day, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3255.96s)]
*  never got out of shape, just all discipline. And so he was able to maintain his body. Did you ever [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3263.08s)]
*  have that guy, Brian, uh, what the hell is this? Oh, what the fuck? It's not working. Piece of shit. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3269.3199999999997s)]
*  These things die. That is a piece of shit. No way. I have that guy. I'm going to look ridiculous [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3275.24s)]
*  doing this. No, you look like a man. I think more of you now. Thanks, man. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3281.16s)]
*  I look like a man. Joe said I look like a man. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3285.4s)]
*  Wouldn't that be funny if that's all it takes? I didn't know. I did not. I started you. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3291.0s)]
*  Come on, bitch. I think I have to fill it. Yeah. I only got a corner. Have you had that guy on [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3296.76s)]
*  who's trying to live forever? The vampire? No, I haven't. I, I'm really fascinated with that guy. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3301.48s)]
*  I like what he's doing. He's trying. It's kind of interesting, but he's doing a bunch of stuff that [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3305.96s)]
*  I would say most experts believe is not the way to go. One of them is avoiding sunlight. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3310.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. You're supposed to get sunlight. Like sunlight is important for your body. It's [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3316.44s)]
*  the best way your body produces vitamin D. It's great for your endorphins. Sunlight is good for [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3320.76s)]
*  you. This idea that you should be shielded from the sun because you're going to prevent skin cancer. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3326.2000000000003s)]
*  It's probably, I've talked to a dermatologist about this and they were explaining that if you [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3330.44s)]
*  don't have resilience from the sun, if you're not like used to going out in the sun, then you go out [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3336.76s)]
*  all in one burst and get sunburned. He's like, yeah, sunburn is not good for you. Yeah. It goes, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3342.2000000000003s)]
*  you're damaging your skin. What you should do is get accustomed to being in the sun. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3348.44s)]
*  So you don't get sunburned and then be out in the sun. Don't get cooked. Don't spend the whole day [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3353.8s)]
*  out in the sun and get cooked. But the sun is actually good for you. It's healthy for your body. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3358.2000000000003s)]
*  That's just one thing. The other thing is the vegan thing. I get it if it's for ethical concern. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3364.52s)]
*  You've got this idea in your mind that animal life is more important than plant life and you don't [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3369.3199999999997s)]
*  want to contribute to animal death. Okay. I understand that perspective, but not from a [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3374.2s)]
*  health perspective. From a health perspective, all the studies that show that meat causes this, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3379.48s)]
*  it's all been debunked. And not only that, most of them are these epidemiology studies where they [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3386.04s)]
*  ask people, like, how often do you eat meat? Is it two times a week, three times a week, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3391.48s)]
*  four times a week? And the more people that ate meat, the more people you see diseases, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3396.04s)]
*  more people you see problems, all these health consequences. And so they go, oh, meat correlates [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3402.52s)]
*  to these health consequences. What you don't ask them is how did you eat the meat? Is it a Jack in [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3409.3199999999997s)]
*  the Box burger with a fucking giant Coca-Cola? Did you have fries that were cooked in seed oil? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3414.92s)]
*  Did you eat cake with it? What did you do? Do you smoke cigarettes? How often do you drink? Do [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3421.48s)]
*  you drink every night? Okay. People that are more health conscious, especially if they haven't read [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3425.7200000000003s)]
*  into it enough, where they really understand what's nutrient dense and what causes problems [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3431.88s)]
*  with your health and what are the real issues with high sugar diets. And those people, they [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3437.32s)]
*  hear meat is bad. So they say, you know what, I'm just going to eat vegetarian. It seems like it's [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3443.96s)]
*  healthier. I'm just going to eat lentils. They're good for you. They don't cause cancer. I read [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3449.2400000000002s)]
*  about the China diet. And so you start believing that. But that's not really true. And people have [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3453.48s)]
*  eaten meat since literally the beginning of time and 95% of the planet eats meat. There's a bunch [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3459.7200000000003s)]
*  of things that likely contribute to all sorts of metabolic diseases that people have. I don't think [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3466.04s)]
*  regular meat is one of them. I don't think a grass fed steak and a fucking salad is going to kill [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3472.84s)]
*  you. I think the real issue is buns and fries and soda and chips and cookies. And the people that [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3478.36s)]
*  don't avoid eating meat, if they're not well read about it, they're doing it because they don't give [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3488.6000000000004s)]
*  a fuck. I'm going to eat a burger because I want to eat a burger. You know, see, get a lot of that. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3492.6000000000004s)]
*  So in the people that avoid meat, you get like a healthy user bias, because these are people that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3496.92s)]
*  even if it's not correct, I know people that truly believe that you can become a better athlete on a [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3501.72s)]
*  vegan diet. I'm like, okay, but there's no pros who have ever done that. No pros have ever gone [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3507.3199999999997s)]
*  vegan and been especially at an explosive sport. There's only like a few people out there. Like [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3511.8799999999997s)]
*  there's a guy named Martin Bacolet. Do you know who he is? Of course, Martin Bacolet from the [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3518.52s)]
*  Cincinnati Red Dogs. No, you're making it up. Martin Bacolet is one of the best heavyweight [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3522.68s)]
*  boxers in the world. He's this fucking enormous guy. I think he's I don't remember what part of [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3528.6s)]
*  Africa he's from. He might be Congolese. He's a monster. And he's a vegetarian. Vegetarian, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3535.3199999999997s)]
*  fucking people up. It's kind of crazy. Yeah, like one of the best heavyweight boxers a lot. Huge guy. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3543.56s)]
*  And he's a vegetarian. It's an aberration, though. I'm vegetarian, you can still eat eggs. Eggs are [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3549.3199999999997s)]
*  probably as good as anything. If you want to eat like one protein and simple, easy to digest, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3554.68s)]
*  has everything. Eggs are pretty fucking solid. I eat eggs like every day. I actually tried to not [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3560.6s)]
*  eat meat for a while a few years ago. And you need like a nutritionist with you to really make sure [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3565.64s)]
*  you cover that. Yeah, you got to get all your vitamins correctly. And then you got to make sure [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3571.08s)]
*  you're not taking too many vitamins and which ones are water soluble, which ones are fat soluble. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3577.0s)]
*  Oh, I just caught myself in the camera here. I look ridiculous smoking this thing. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3581.96s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. I like you more this way. Great. You gotta hide those things from people. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3589.48s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to look at yourself. It's bad for you. I love it. I love that. Oh, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3593.0s)]
*  Joe just turned the camera off. It's just like reading the comments. Don't do it. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3599.88s)]
*  By the way, you know these youngins, these young kids, let me go lecture. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3604.04s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, I was at one point where... What about John Larroquette? You ever gonna get to that? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3609.24s)]
*  We'll get to it. Let's not rush that story. Let the podcast breathe for a second. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3614.44s)]
*  So these young kids now, I noticed this, women will do this. They'll be like, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3622.92s)]
*  people say I light up the room. When was the woman told me this? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3627.16s)]
*  Who ever says people say I light up the room that actually lights up the room? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3631.8s)]
*  That's what people say. I'm funny. But I've noticed they tell you compliments they got. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3636.68s)]
*  And I'm like, why is this? Because for our area, you never say like, I'm great. People think you [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3642.9199999999996s)]
*  never would say that. But now, this is my theory. I don't know if this is true. They've grown up on [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3648.44s)]
*  Facebook where people say, you look so pretty. And then everyone sees the compliment. And now when [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3654.12s)]
*  they go out in the world and they get a compliment, then they're like, oh, I let people know everyone [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3658.9199999999996s)]
*  sees the compliments. That's probably exactly what it is. That's a very good theory. I think that's [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3662.2799999999997s)]
*  dead on. You should. Make sure you do the audio yourself. I have no merch. Yeah, I'm in definitely [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3666.52s)]
*  the audio. You don't have any merch? No merch. You should have Caitlyn Jenner merch. Yeah, baby. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3671.4s)]
*  Yeah, baby. That was when I knew Comedy Central was doomed. You and I were talking. Yeah, I sent you [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3676.04s)]
*  what they cut. Yeah, we were having a conversation. You showed it to me in the Comedy Store green room, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3681.56s)]
*  in the green room in the main room. You were telling me the struggle you're going through. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3687.24s)]
*  It was so stressful, that whole thing. Well, you had this show that you were doing on your own. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3691.32s)]
*  That was amazing. And it's one of those things like South Park, right? Where South Park really works [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3696.92s)]
*  because they can do outrageous shit because you know it's not real because they don't even look [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3703.96s)]
*  remotely human. Yeah, your brain knows. You when you were doing the face swaps with like cell phone [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3707.88s)]

*  Dunnigan. It was the way you were doing it was super obvious. Then the Comedy Central thing came [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3730.52s)]
*  along like this. Like you get a beard. That looks ridiculous. I didn't mean to have the beard. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3738.28s)]
*  It started from the beginning. Wait, play a different episode, a different one. This one's [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3743.8s)]
*  terrible. Listen, no one's buying my book. So yeah, I thought I would read a lecture [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3748.2s)]

*  like a bit I did. Oh, it was awful girls. For a minute there, I thought I was going to suffer [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3774.52s)]
*  the same fate as my nutsack. Oh, geez. Yeah, baby. I want to apologize to the Trans. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3781.64s)]

*  stiletto pumps. Yeah. Then I ran back into the flames to get my Louis Vuitton alligator duffel, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3795.24s)]
*  a bag so beautiful it demands attention. My size 17 Jimmy Choo's and my dog Checkers. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3802.44s)]

*  That's an old one. But the fact that that's obvious made it better when they did it on Comedy [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3828.44s)]
*  Central. They use higher level technology and it was kind of weird. It's creepy. It has that. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3834.92s)]

*  it doesn't look real. Yeah, it's completely ridiculous. I didn't mean to have a beard. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3857.0s)]
*  That was just I was being lazy. I was like trying to make a joke. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3861.72s)]
*  By the way, I never did it. I did impressions when I was younger and I was like in middle school. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3867.0s)]
*  I would do them and then I never, I started doing like a manager was like, don't do impressions. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3871.56s)]
*  And then that face app came along and I looked nothing like Trump. Though the first one I was [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3877.16s)]
*  doing was Trump. Yeah. Because I did Trump like years ago and I was like, oh, I can do Trump. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3882.04s)]

*  It was fun though. It was a ridiculous character though. But it's like, that's how I knew Comedy [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3898.6s)]
*  Central was doomed. I'm like, if you guys are fucking this up, like this show, he's giving to [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3904.3599999999997s)]

*  creative people, and then business people, executives. That's the weird marriage. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=3975.7200000000003s)]

*  She fakes the accent. Yeah, she fakes. She's a does she? She is. She doesn't understand the words. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4326.04s)]
*  Yeah. The what is how do you say in English? And he goes along with it. But he do you have that? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4332.28s)]
*  Her shushing him at like a red car. Isn't it just awful? Yeah, I'm talking. You're not talking. You [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4341.72s)]
*  don't talking when I'm talking. He Alex Baldwin can get like a really sweet, beautiful woman. He's [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4347.16s)]
*  Alex Baldwin. What happened? He would yell. They would run away. He would yell. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4352.68s)]
*  I mean, he would yell. He would yell at them. They'd run away. Who knows? Who knows what these two are [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4358.68s)]
*  like? They both look like they're out of their fucking minds. And I'm sure it's edited, but he [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4363.24s)]
*  comes off way better than her. Maybe he's doing that on purpose. Maybe that's a clever move. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4367.639999999999s)]
*  Let her say crazy shit. Don't check her. Let her come off looking like a nut. Maybe they planned it. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4372.84s)]
*  Maybe they have a wonderful relationship. And they said, listen, this is not going to sell. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4378.36s)]
*  She humiliated him. Maybe you're right to go viral. Listen, you were going to shut me up and I'm not [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4381.88s)]
*  even going to comment on it. Plus I just killed a lady. So it does make you forget about when he [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4386.4400000000005s)]
*  killed that lady. It's a good way to make you forget the show. Yeah. The other good way is you [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4392.68s)]
*  change your gender. Oh yeah. That's another good way. I mean, I, Bruce killed that lady with a car [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4397.4s)]
*  baby. That was Bruce. Yeah. Just Bruce. That was like right after that. Have you ever seen the [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4403.639999999999s)]
*  footage of the car, the reenactment? Like she was putting on lipstick or something. She was very [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4408.599999999999s)]
*  distracted. What did I say about Alec Baldwin? Hold on. No, he was. You said she. You shouldn't [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4413.799999999999s)]
*  say she. What'd I say? You said she was. Please correct yourself. That was back when she was Bruce. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4418.84s)]
*  She was. She was. Was she always Bruce? What does it say in the Olympics? Deadname. What? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4424.84s)]
*  Can you deadname in the Olympics? Is that allowed? Deadnaming kind of went away, huh? Yeah. That [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4429.4800000000005s)]
*  didn't work. People like, you can't kick people out of the social square for life because they won't [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4435.08s)]
*  accept this bizarre new thing you're doing. There it is. Bruce Jenner. Still says Bruce. Wow. Look [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4440.76s)]
*  how jacked he was. Oh yeah. Back then it was he. There's that nut. You can see the nut shack. Yeah. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4447.320000000001s)]
*  Nah. Did he have the? I think I have no information. Yes. But I think so. You're [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4452.92s)]
*  holding back. Do you work for the government? I know a guy. I'll tell Trump to release the files. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4460.52s)]
*  So terrifically. A terrific guy. Are we getting new files, Jamie? Does anything happen? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4465.72s)]
*  What happened with? Oliver Stone apparently testified about the JFK assassination. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4471.8s)]
*  What does he know? How does he know? He knows everything about it. How does he know? He's a [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4476.12s)]
*  literally a warehouse of information on the JFK assassination before the podcast, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4480.12s)]
*  during the podcast, after the podcast. He wouldn't stop talking about it. Is it Terrence Howard? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4484.5199999999995s)]
*  No, it's Oliver Stone. He's a brilliant guy. Oliver Stone can give you, he could sit down [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4490.92s)]
*  and break down just from recall. How old is Oliver Stone? Like complete recall of dates, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4496.04s)]
*  times, who was involved, who they worked for before this happened, who Kennedy had fired, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4507.4s)]
*  why they were on the Warren Commission report, what the Warren Commission report's objectives [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4513.799999999999s)]
*  were, who was influencing it, who saw the gunshots and the grass, you know, how did they die [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4518.04s)]
*  in mysterious circumstances? He's like. He's like. Rattle it all off, off the top of his head. And [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4524.2s)]
*  he's like. He tells Congress to reinvestigate the 1963 assassination starting at the scene of the [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4529.96s)]
*  crime. Like I'm telling you, man, the movie he did is, you know, great movie, Kevin Costner, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4536.44s)]
*  wonderful movie. But talking to him about it is where you really freak out. Like this guy has [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4542.5199999999995s)]
*  been studying the JFK assassination forever. And he thinks it was a CIA or a head of the [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4547.5599999999995s)]
*  CIA? You know, no one knows. And until you get all these files, no one's going to know. And even [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4553.32s)]
*  once you get all these files, what is it going to show? How you're still going to connect dots. And [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4559.16s)]
*  it's not like there's a page, page 24. Mike did it. Oh, fucking Mike. Yeah, Mike was in the grassy [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4564.44s)]
*  knoll. I told him, shoot that Irish cocksucker. He's going to rob us. No, there's none of that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4570.2s)]
*  You're going to get certain details that weren't available before for national security reasons [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4575.639999999999s)]
*  or for whatever. But if they had made some sort of a declaration that Kennedy was a problem that [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4582.04s)]
*  needed to be removed, that would be like the as close to a smoking gun as you can. But they could [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4588.36s)]
*  probably get away with saying things like that in 1963. You know, especially like people that [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4594.2s)]
*  worked at that. They were doing nutty shit in 63, like really nutty shit. Like that's the year, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4601.8s)]
*  the same year as Operation Northwoods. That's the same year. Operation Northwoods was this crazy [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4607.5599999999995s)]
*  idea that was drummed up. It was a false flag idea that was drummed up and literally signed by the [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4613.96s)]
*  Joint Chiefs of Staff. Like they gave us a green light and then vetoed by Kennedy. And what they [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4619.96s)]
*  were going to do is they're going to have a bunch of false flag attacks. Like they were going to [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4624.92s)]
*  blow up a jetliner and they were going to blame it on Cuba. And they were going to arm Cuban [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4628.12s)]
*  friendlies and bomb Guantanamo Bay. They were going to literally kill American citizens. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4632.52s)]
*  And the idea was do this false flag blame it on Cuba? Then we have to go to war with Cuba. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4639.08s)]
*  And Kennedy was like, what the fuck are you doing? No. And then there was the other one, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4646.36s)]
*  which was the Bay of Pigs. So they informed Kennedy about the Bay of Pigs. Apparently they [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4651.08s)]
*  informed him about it like late in the process and he denied them air support. So the whole plan [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4656.44s)]
*  of invading Cuba, the Bay of Pigs, was dependent upon air support. They didn't get air support [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4663.32s)]
*  because Kennedy said no to it. So all these people died. They didn't have to die. All these [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4669.799999999999s)]
*  American soldiers died. They didn't have to die. And my friend Evan Hafer from Black Rifle Coffee, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4675.0s)]
*  he had a very good point. He said, if you wanted to look at someone who had a bone to pick, who was [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4679.32s)]
*  like a hardened killer, those guys who got stranded at that beach, those would be the kind of guys [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4683.16s)]
*  that would want to kill Kennedy. There was probably a lot of people that wanted to kill Kennedy. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4689.88s)]
*  There's probably the mob wanted to kill him because the mob got him in. The whole thing [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4696.2s)]
*  that happened with Illinois, like him winning Illinois, very shaky stuff. So the mob got him in [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4702.76s)]
*  and then his brother starts going after the mob. Like, hey, fuck face. What kind of deal is this? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4710.68s)]
*  And then you've got, he's trying to get rid of the CIA. He wants to get rid of all these, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4717.400000000001s)]
*  like he gives that speech about privacy, about having these private groups and having secrecy [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4724.04s)]
*  and secret societies. Have you ever seen that speech about secret societies? That Kennedy made? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4732.2s)]
*  Yeah. No. It's really creepy. He's talking about how secret societies are repugnant [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4737.08s)]
*  and that he's essentially calling out the shadow government. He's calling out all these people [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4743.8s)]
*  that are involved in these organizations, literally from like Yale, like the skull and [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4749.72s)]
*  bones that they're all in. All these creepy frat boys join the skull and bones. Then one day they [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4754.12s)]
*  wind up ruling the world. Like it's kind of Harry Potter-ish. It's bizarrely, you know, on the nose [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4758.92s)]
*  as far as what it is. But he was calling that stuff out in the sixties as well and then they kill him. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4765.64s)]
*  And then you don't hear a peep about any of that stuff anymore. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4772.4400000000005s)]
*  And we will get to the John Larrick head story, just anybody listening. Let's listen to Kennedy [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4775.400000000001s)]
*  talk about secret societies. I want to see that. Secret societies. There are secret societies. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4779.56s)]
*  It's a very creepy speech when you think about the fact that they killed him less than a year later, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4785.719999999999s)]
*  I believe. What about the back and the left? This is what I heard. I don't know any information. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4791.4s)]
*  But in Oliver Stone, he was like back and to the left. But someone's saying, no, your head would [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4795.88s)]
*  go, would do that because it like, from the shot from the back, your head would like recoil back. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4802.36s)]
*  I don't know anything. Well, we could look at that too. Let's hear it. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4809.48s)]
*  The speech that killed him about secret societies. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4814.04s)]
*  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society. And we are as a people inherently [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4818.5199999999995s)]
*  and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4826.5199999999995s)]
*  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4834.12s)]
*  of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4840.04s)]
*  there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4848.36s)]
*  restrictions. Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4854.28s)]
*  if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4861.4800000000005s)]
*  for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4868.68s)]
*  limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4876.12s)]
*  it's in my control. And no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4882.6s)]
*  civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4889.16s)]
*  to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, or to withhold from the press and the public [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4896.12s)]
*  the facts they deserve to know. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4903.16s)]
*  and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4910.12s)]
*  On infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4918.36s)]
*  instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4926.44s)]
*  has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly-knit, highly [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4933.96s)]
*  efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4941.32s)]
*  and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4949.4s)]
*  not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4956.84s)]
*  No rumor is printed. No secret is revealed. No president should fear public scrutiny of [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4963.799999999999s)]
*  his program, for from that scrutiny comes understanding, and from that understanding [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4971.08s)]
*  comes support or opposition, and both are necessary. Why did we become so retarded? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4976.68s)]
*  Like listen to how genius what he's saying is and how eloquently he's describing the problem. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4983.64s)]
*  People don't talk like that anymore. No, we don't talk like that anymore. And if we did talk like [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4991.16s)]
*  that, people would be like, what did he just say? Yeah, I didn't understand a word. I understood [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4995.0s)]
*  half of those words. This is 1963. We're dumber now. Oh, yeah. With more access to information [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=4998.36s)]
*  than we were in 63. And people think they're smarter because their phone, they think that's [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5005.639999999999s)]

*  I don't know, you could just see liking your AI friend. That's a problem with people. It is a big [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5017.799999999999s)]
*  problem. Grok is saying some wild shit to folks. Oh, I know they have that different kind of stuff. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5023.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, if you also if you ask Grok, if you were like purely evil, and you wanted to destroy society, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5027.88s)]
*  would you do how would you do it? And Grok essentially describes everything that's happening [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5035.32s)]
*  in society. Yeah, it's like Idiocracy. You know, the movie, Idiocracy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5040.92s)]
*  happening. I definitely feel like I'm the accuracy like was very charitable, in terms of like their [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5046.6s)]

*  figure in cell phone addiction. Yeah, you know, what makes me laugh is when you look at like a [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5057.56s)]
*  70s movie about the future, and like what they got right and wrong. Yeah. First of all, we don't do [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5061.88s)]
*  the FaceTime as much as I thought we were going to just do all the time. We're like, no, we don't [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5066.360000000001s)]

*  Watch the Jetsons. They don't have a single. Yeah, yeah, that's that was our need George Jetson. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5090.280000000001s)]

*  say that's a good question? Let's take a guess. What is it? I'll wait. Sorry. Oh, you're my cigar [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5103.08s)]
*  keeps going out. Is that a sign of manly hood? 2006. What? No, that's when it came out. That's [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5109.72s)]
*  when the movie was released. No, I mean, like, no, no, no, not Idiocracy. The Jetsons. What year is [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5119.56s)]
*  the Jetson supposed to be? Idiocracy was supposed to be 2020. What? 2500. Oh, 2000. That's probably [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5124.280000000001s)]
*  again, very charitable. Yeah. And by the way, we can have a pro wrestling president right now, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5131.240000000001s)]
*  by the way. Right. Oh, yeah. The Rock, you know, I like that guy. We allowed to say that. I think [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5135.08s)]
*  they wanted the Rock to run. Rock Rock could win. I want to go to the gym with the Rock when I was [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5140.68s)]
*  in L.A. Not a brag. I'm just telling you the facts. We went to the same gym. Joe's get pumped. Yeah, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5147.72s)]
*  we got like this is before he was like really famous. But there was this like restaurant [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5151.96s)]
*  nearby. And I was there and he got a stack of like 10 burgers. That's all he ate. I was like, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5156.04s)]
*  is it enormous, dude? He was just wrestling back then. He could be the president. He couldn't do [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5163.16s)]

*  Well, I'm here for the Jetsons. OK, let's guess. OK, I want to say 1998, 1999. I'm gonna say no way. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5172.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. For reference to it came out in 1962 was the debut 2000, 2000, this year, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5180.76s)]
*  1999. What is it? Apparently 100 years into the future. So 2062. Oh, OK. Not going to happen, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5189.08s)]
*  though. None of no, no, they didn't figure out phones. That's even Star Trek didn't figure out [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5197.0s)]
*  cell phones. It was there was a walkie talkie Kirk out. He had to like shut his little walkie [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5202.04s)]
*  talkie off. They did. Yeah, Kirk didn't have. Oh, did you see this fucking warp drive thing [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5206.2s)]
*  that they know? But I love space and all this stuff. So I want to see this. Yeah. Somebody [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5213.5599999999995s)]
*  sent me that this is very, very strange. That took physics in college, not to brag, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5218.599999999999s)]
*  but to tell you guys. I bet you did, dude. I you know, I never thought of doing something else, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5223.48s)]
*  but I love other things. And for some reason, I just was like in taking acting classes. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5227.799999999999s)]
*  What did you like about physics? I always [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5235.799999999999s)]
*  love like out like outer space and just science stuff. I just always have like an interest in it. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5241.879999999999s)]
*  And in school, I was very I didn't score well, but like physics, I did well because it was like [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5248.759999999999s)]
*  wasn't a lot of reading. It wasn't dense reading. What is the problem with you in reading? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5255.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I never tested, but I never tested, but I did take Spanish and she goes all your you write [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5260.44s)]
*  all your B's and D's backwards. So I'm assuming I have dyslexia. How old were you though? I was in [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5265.48s)]
*  high school, but I always read. So like my parents were cool. They'd send me to read speed reading [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5270.599999999999s)]
*  classes. They weren't back then in my day. They weren't like you have a reading disorder. They [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5274.44s)]
*  were like you just need you're dumb. You need to read faster. You suck. Yeah, there was no test. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5279.639999999999s)]
*  No one had dyslexia. So dyslexia is like you see things backwards. Is that what it is? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5285.0s)]
*  It's sort of like you flip things. So I actually put a dyslexia app on my computer and it sort of [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5288.759999999999s)]
*  like makes the font so I don't flip the like, you know, so you do have dyslexia. I never was tested, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5294.2s)]
*  but this app I read much faster with it. So I'm assuming I do. I took the medicine. It got better. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5302.92s)]
*  So I assume I had it. Yeah, that's kind of what it was. Jamie, I sent you that warp drive thing. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5309.32s)]

*  life form that we actually create meaning, what does meaning mean anymore? It doesn't mean anything [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5650.84s)]
*  anymore. If you don't have emotions, if you're the superior life form and emotions don't exist [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5655.96s)]
*  anymore because you don't have a human reward system that's built in through thousands and [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5660.76s)]
*  thousands of years of evolution. You need a job just to not have a job and an identity. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5664.68s)]
*  Yeah. The sun needs meaning. That's why it went supernova. It needed meaning and it just couldn't [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5669.88s)]
*  help it. It just like, yeah, see me. The sun needed to be seen. I felt so unseen as the sun that I had [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5675.4800000000005s)]

*  And we decide that meaning is important, but objectively for the universe, it's clearly not. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5691.56s)]
*  Oh, the universe. No, but we are a tiny little fucking spot in the universe. So like, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5695.72s)]
*  what does meaning mean? It only means something to us because we need meaning. What do you suggest [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5701.400000000001s)]
*  people do though? If they start to get, they don't have a good job they have to do. The robots do [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5706.84s)]
*  everything. We have universal income and you're just like, I went on vacation for three days and [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5711.4800000000005s)]

*  many incels just stay at home now and play video games. Like the number of men who never have sex [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5738.5199999999995s)]
*  and the number of men who have no girlfriends, it's like higher than it's ever been. Yeah. And then [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5745.32s)]

*  the cameras were on him for real? Yeah. You ever think maybe they just set that up because it's [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5787.0s)]

*  Say it's a disease, Joe. These people have diseases. I think that's a problem having too many names for [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=5818.6s)]

*  I think I'm fired. And it was so much like climbing a mountain to get this job. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=6968.92s)]
*  And then the next day I didn't get a call. They, no one said you're fired. So I come in the next day [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=6974.2s)]

*  Yeah. Not just this probably would probably, I think it's just, it, it helps. It's the building [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7096.04s)]
*  blocks for human neurotransmitters as it's been explained to me, like there's certain nutrients [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7102.12s)]

*  Helps your immune function. There's a bunch of nutrients to do different things in your body. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7112.36s)]
*  Right. All right. And theanine is a really good one for memory. Um, there's a bunch of, uh, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7115.96s)]
*  alpha choline. Um, was it alpha GPC colines? Is that what it is? Acetylcholine. There's a, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7122.36s)]
*  quite a few different nutrients that have been identified as to helping brain function. And so [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7131.48s)]
*  the way I found out about this stuff, there was Bill Romanowski, the football player. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7136.92s)]
*  He has a company that's he's got really good stuff. It's called neuro one. And, uh, it's like [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7140.68s)]
*  a scoop. You just mix it in water and blend it up or whatever. And it's, uh, and I, I tried, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7145.72s)]
*  I was on a radio station in San Francisco and they gave it to me. I was like, this is great. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7150.68s)]
*  Where can you get this? Like it really does like give you a little pick me up just, but not like, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7153.64s)]
*  like five shots of espresso. You're like, ah, it's just like a little edge of focus. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7158.76s)]
*  Yeah. I could use a little memory, um, booster. I don't sleep well enough. I'm really, uh, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7164.92s)]
*  going to try to fix that. Cause, uh, what are you going to do? I'm going to, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7169.8s)]
*  you're going to be really proud of me. I'm going to be taking Jujitsu class on Monday. My first one [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7175.400000000001s)]
*  that'll help you sleep. I think so sleep a bunch of times in class. I mean, yeah, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7181.400000000001s)]
*  I actually do not have a neck for like a, a chill cold kind of sport. I have, I'm 30% neck. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7186.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, um, that's a, that is a large target, but my advice would be just to take it easy slowly at [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7193.48s)]
*  first. How old do you know? 26. You look great. I look like shit. You look great. Just go slowly. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7199.48s)]
*  That's my advice. Don't try to go too fast, especially if you have been working out hard. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7206.36s)]
*  Have you been working out hard? Not. And then now, yeah, the answer is no. So that means, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7210.839999999999s)]
*  you know, your joints are not going to be the most resilient. Don't, don't try to do it all at once. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7215.639999999999s)]
*  That's my thing with them. By the way, that's with everything. If like, I'm going to run a [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7221.0s)]
*  marathon tomorrow. Hey, hey, hey, have you ever run before? No, I don't run at all. Right. Right. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7224.68s)]
*  Okay. Let's not run a marathon. Let's, let's run a mile. Let's do one mile, which is a lot. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7228.36s)]
*  If you have a run a mile is a lot. If you do not run a mile is a lot, but you can't just run a [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7234.52s)]
*  marathon. And if you're going to do Jujitsu, like start slow, don't try to do a two and a half hour [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7241.08s)]
*  session. I'm going to roll with five guys today. Like, learn an arm bar. Okay. This is a triangle. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7246.12s)]

*  Everyone's going to do it though. Nobody teaches you like flying triangles. The moment you get [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7259.08s)]
*  into the class, they teach you beginner stuff. Like this is the mount. This is side control. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7262.84s)]
*  This is the guard. Yeah. It's like simple basics. Good for confidence too. I hear. Oh yeah. You can [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7268.44s)]

*  your day is, it will never be as stressful as some dude mounting you trying to choke you unconscious. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7280.28s)]
*  This is now if you fight that off and then you're done with your class, like regular stuff is like, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7286.5199999999995s)]

*  Let me tell you how many people stall and starve to death. And then you tell me your cute little [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7463.56s)]
*  fucking joke in my village. Yeah. I've had that happen to me recently. I was like, I'm not telling [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7468.84s)]
*  you. It's just not going to go. Yeah. That's a tough one. When people ask me if they don't know [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7474.12s)]
*  who I am genuinely, I love the easiest one to say is I do commentary for the UFC. Oh, that's good. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7479.08s)]
*  That's one. That's because if I say podcast, well, people know you now. I mean, some people don't know [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7485.64s)]
*  me. It's nice every now and then I get a person who doesn't know who I am. Like some old fella, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7489.88s)]
*  what do you do? Yeah. What do you do? Sean? I do a commentary for the ultimate fighting [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7494.280000000001s)]
*  championship. And then they look at you sideways. Like what? That's, that's still, though, could be [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7498.84s)]
*  a conversation. Here's what I do on like a plane. I go, I work with computers and they're like, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7502.6s)]
*  Oh, that's good. That's finances too. Yeah. But if I want to have a conversation with someone, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7506.360000000001s)]
*  if I don't mind having a conversation with them, I just don't want to explain the whole thing. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7512.200000000001s)]

*  I have all the great jobs, but that's the only job I have. That's, that's an actual job where [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7521.72s)]
*  someone pays me. Like I show up, I work for somebody. I'm an employee. Yeah. I have to [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7526.360000000001s)]
*  sign up. Is there something you want to do that you haven't done? Are you looking? No, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7532.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not looking to do anything. Do you have a goal? No, zero goals. Zero goal. What about [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7537.0s)]
*  retiring and traveling the world? Retirement ideas? No. Pyramids? You ever see those? I want [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7540.12s)]
*  to see the pyramids. I do too, but I think what's going to happen is you go, oh, there they are. And [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7545.4800000000005s)]
*  now you're like, I don't think so. 20. I've been obsessed with the pyramids since I was like a [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7549.32s)]
*  little boy. Can you go in them now at all? Yes. You can? Yeah, you can go in them. Okay. And if I [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7553.16s)]
*  went, I'd hopefully be able to get someone to guide me. Like a really good person. I could, I [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7557.48s)]
*  could guide you. You know how to do it? Could you do it as Caitlyn Jenner though? Yeah, baby. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7562.599999999999s)]
*  This is where the guy died. I meant to be filmed that. Yeah. He was buried with his dog. Have you [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7566.28s)]
*  seen this whole controversy that they think that there's like these enormous structures? What is [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7571.719999999999s)]
*  that? This is- I don't know, but there's a guy named Jimmy Corsetti. He has this great YouTube [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7575.08s)]
*  show called Bright Insight. He's been on my show many times. Very smart guy and very reasonable [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7580.28s)]
*  guy. And also is a huge believer that there's a missing chapter in ancient history. He doesn't [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7585.5599999999995s)]
*  believe in it. He thinks it ignores something that everyone knows. There's this enormous water table [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7591.5599999999995s)]
*  that's underneath the pyramids. So the pyramids, there's water underneath the pyramids. And Mr. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7598.36s)]
*  Beast apparently on his YouTube thing that he did with the pyramids went into the water. So they [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7603.48s)]
*  were all in the water splashing around the water. So this water table. Yeah. So underneath the [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7608.919999999999s)]
*  pyramids, there's water that flows. That seems unstable to me in my engineering mind. To talk to [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7613.639999999999s)]
*  you before they built that 5,000 years ago. Was it five, 10? It's probably more. It's probably a lot [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7621.16s)]
*  more. If I had to guess, I think they're wrong. I think the hieroglyphs that are on the wall that [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7627.96s)]
*  depict pharaohs leading back to 30,000 plus years is probably accurate. I really want to know how [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7633.4800000000005s)]
*  they built those. I really, I think that's a- those- you see some of those stones are so- [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7639.08s)]
*  I don't believe aliens or I don't believe that happened. I think people built that. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7645.0s)]
*  But how did they get some of those stones up there? Well, I was watching this guy. Here's the [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7649.64s)]
*  answer. I'll tell you who this guy is because shout out to him because he had a very interesting [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7657.24s)]
*  take on it. I watch a lot of these silly YouTube videos that are all in ancient history and ancient [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7661.08s)]
*  civilizations and stuff like that. But this one was really kind of interesting. I like how there [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7667.719999999999s)]
*  were fat people falling down and playing gringes. And this guy is- I'll send it to you, Jeremy. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7671.4s)]
*  His name is Michael Button and he had a very good point. And his point is that there's this linear [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7678.36s)]
*  path between cave person and what we are today. But he's saying, but human beings in the form [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7685.72s)]
*  that we exist in today have essentially been around for at least 315,000 years. And there's [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7691.88s)]
*  all these large rise- like peaks and dips in the historical timeline of the temperature of the Earth. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7699.08s)]
*  And in these peaks of temperature, you have all this growth and change and then you have ice ages [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7709.08s)]
*  and you have drop-offs and then there's cataclysms and natural disasters. And he brings up the [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7715.72s)]
*  volcano eruption, the Toba volcano eruption. But what he's essentially saying is human beings in [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7720.2s)]
*  this form, with the minds that we have, have existed for 300,000 years with the capacity. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7726.4400000000005s)]
*  But yet only over the last few thousand years have we seen all this progress. And he thinks, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7733.400000000001s)]
*  what he's proposing is if there was a super advanced civilization 100,000 years ago, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7741.0s)]
*  there would be almost nothing left. So we're supposing that what we find is all that's ever [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7747.56s)]
*  been. What he's saying is, if you imagine 200,000 years of development of technology, of tools, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7753.0s)]
*  of agriculture, all the different things that could have happened in those 200,000 years, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7763.4s)]
*  that you could have had an insanely advanced society 200,000 years ago and then it gets [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7766.84s)]
*  completely wiped out. Then 115 to 150, depending on who you ask, thousand years later, you start [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7772.2s)]
*  seeing what we've seen in the last few hundred years. Okay, I'm going to push back on that. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7780.4400000000005s)]
*  Please do. Wouldn't they have some metal? No, all they would have- [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7785.8s)]
*  some steel? This is what he's talking about. When you have enormous spans of time, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7790.28s)]
*  all you have left is stone. You have rocks. Where does the steel go? [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7794.76s)]
*  It just disintegrates. It all goes away. It all just gets absorbed by the earth. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7799.0s)]
*  There's very little metal that is going to- like any forged- if you have a knife [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7804.52s)]
*  and you leave that knife under the ground, just the earth will erode it. A few thousand years, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7809.400000000001s)]
*  it's gone. So they probably had combustion engines and stuff? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7814.2s)]
*  Here, look at steel. It takes probably 50 to 500 years to decompose, depending on the type of [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7818.76s)]
*  environmental conditions with stainless steel potentially taking over a thousand years. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7824.68s)]
*  Just imagine something that's a hundred thousand years old. You got nothing. There's nothing left. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7829.24s)]
*  He makes this very interesting argument in this video that I never considered before. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7834.12s)]
*  It's just the timeline of human beings being human beings. He's like, why was there this great leap [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7838.6s)]
*  in technology? It is completely possible that there was great leaps hundreds of thousands of [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7846.12s)]
*  years ago. But then the question is, what happened to us? How did we get so far ahead of all these [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7851.64s)]
*  other creatures? How did we get so far ahead of everything? I know you talk about we're like this [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7857.96s)]
*  much smarter than a monkey. We have most genes. Most of our genes are chimpanzee genes. Most of [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7863.64s)]
*  them. What are the things under the pyramids or pillars? What does that mean? I don't know [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7870.84s)]
*  what they're seeing. It says some sort of satellite ground penetrating. Is it a radar, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7875.8s)]
*  a type of radar? Jamie, what are they calling it? Jamie, what are they calling it? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7882.28s)]
*  They have these images. The problem is also these guys are Italian. They're saying it in Italian. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7887.24s)]
*  I don't know exactly what they're saying. I'm just reading the translation. I want to hear their [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7893.4800000000005s)]
*  voice. I want to hear if they sound wacky. Everybody is talking in Italian. It sounds beautiful, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7896.28s)]
*  but you could say nonsense shit with an Italian accent. It sounds incredible [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7901.24s)]
*  because I don't speak Italian. Beautiful language. Beautiful language. These images [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7905.08s)]
*  that show these feet. Look, if it's real and that stuff is under the water table, that's actually [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7910.04s)]
*  even fucking crazy. Explain the collected acoustics from deep in the ground, including seismic waves, [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7915.4s)]
*  noise from human activity, and photon interactions to map newly found shafts and chambers that extend [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7921.88s)]
*  more than 2,000 feet below the surface. Biondi said these waves were collected by radar, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7928.12s)]
*  specifically by analyzing Doppler centroid abnormalities, shifts or distortions in [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7933.24s)]
*  frequency patterns used to detect underground structures or changes. However, Professor Lawrence [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7939.4s)]
*  Conyers, a radar expert at University of Denver, who specializes in archaeology and was not involved [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7945.32s)]
*  in the study, still raised doubts. He said photon interactions, this is science fiction, and [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7951.48s)]
*  frequency shifts of what? He said we now have three different energy sources moving around radar, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7955.88s)]
*  electromagnetic sound seismic and light photons. This is all gobbly gook. Sounds like he didn't [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7960.92s)]
*  get invited to the party. I heard that guy's a furry. I made that up. I'm sorry, sir. But show [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7966.28s)]
*  me the images of what they believe that they've found. Because if it is a real thing, if you really [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7974.6s)]
*  do have these, I mean the 3D images, like they really stepped out of line and drawing it so, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7981.24s)]
*  I mean so clearly. Like that's not what you see. You're honeydicking me. But they gotta dig. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7985.8s)]
*  But if it is under the water table, that's even crazier. So if they're using the water, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7992.4400000000005s)]
*  if the pyramid, there's a guy named Christopher Dunn that believes that the pyramid is a gigantic [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=7999.08s)]
*  electrical power plant. Oh yeah, like a Tesla coil kind of thing. Yeah. And the needles. So if they're [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8003.24s)]
*  using the water for energy and they actually have these columns that extend into the water, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8008.4400000000005s)]
*  that's even crazier. That's an even more advanced civilization than just building these columns. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8014.36s)]
*  Well we gotta dig. Why don't we dig? Start digging there. Me and you. How many shovels [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8019.4s)]
*  do you think we need? Should we be safe? Yeah, definitely get four for sure. Jamie's back goes [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8025.719999999999s)]
*  out if he digs all day though. That golf swing is gonna hurt his back. We'll worry about that. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8033.0s)]
*  That's a serious golf swing. You're a little jealous, right? You're a little jealous. I heard [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8038.44s)]
*  a nice pop. You're a little jealous. I felt it from you. I was a little jealous. Definitely jealous [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8041.96s)]
*  of his equipment. You heard that whack and you're like, oh that's going far. What's your handicap, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8046.04s)]
*  Jamie? I think people want to know. Yeah, I mean what was yours when you were playing all the time? [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8051.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh that's a, he diverted you. I won the- Turn the question around. I know. I don't want to be judged. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8056.28s)]
*  I was, first of all, this is not, I know it seems like I bragged a lot on this show, but this is a [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8060.6s)]
*  fact. I was the Ashtonk Valley Country Club Junior Golf Champion. So you're probably three or four [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8065.0s)]
*  when you were there? Maybe better even? No, there was not, there's like five kids in the country. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8070.92s)]
*  Now I'll shoot like a 95. I was probably like 80 when I was a kid. So that's like eight [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9shy1j8wjM&t=8079.0s)]
