# Joe Rogan Experience #1488 - Andrew Schulz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimytC6bNZ0)
*  Do do do so you were asking
*  Yeah
*  By the time I came around this sure was already in an advanced
*  stage
*  She was older okay, and she had some health issues and so she wasn't banging comics at that point
*  But there was a time there's a time when she was getting she was the boss
*  she was a boss woman and she would grab comedians and
*  Jimmy Schubert talked about he was like 21 years old wanted to be a comic all sudden
*  Bang and mincy sure like yikes do we know anybody?
*  Famous famous. I don't know. I don't know who's talking about it
*  I know Jimmy talked about it in our Robin Williams Argus talked about it
*  I have no idea, but it's in it's a part of the reason why I'm saying it is because it's a part of the Comedy
*  Store documentary that they're putting out. I mean she is a joint she was an animal yeah, like she's pretty girl
*  She also was like the most important figure in comedy outside of comedians
*  Like by running that store that way and letting all those people just be buck wild and you know this crazy creative environment
*  That's where kinnison erupted from that's where you know Richard Pryor used to work out there
*  Yeah, Hicks started there and so many people so many people were there in the early days
*  Why do you think that it could flourish that way because of her?
*  But like how did it make money? I did it like did she have money? How did it well?
*  There was a lot of great comedy right so you got to think you've got Richard Pryor there
*  You've got David Letterman there. You've got Tim Thomas. It was a
*  giant
*  Cast of great comedy that came out of that club and
*  It was a cultural landmark and still is a cultural landmark in Hollywood
*  So there's money to be made there
*  Yeah, and there was that was the roaring days of the 80s where it was packed all the time
*  It was like a drop-off, but now it's when we get to open again, it'll be packed again
*  Yeah, it's like before the the pandemic. It was probably the best it's ever been doing
*  Yeah, I mean I would go in there and it was insane all three rooms packed. I mean just comics everywhere
*  The vibe was right. It's a real shame
*  Yeah
*  It is a real shame, but it's just one part of the real shame of all this craziness
*  That's been going on for the last few months
*  Yeah, you know it's uh and now we're just talking about it before like there's all these articles now about how doctors are saying
*  That the people that come into them are less sick than they ever were before
*  Yeah, it was like skating in England or in Italy rather. They're saying there's such a small amount of virus. It's almost undetectable
*  Yeah, it's run through the country. Yeah, it's hot up. Yeah, you think that's all it was so Trump is right
*  I'm said it was gonna go away without any cure
*  Well, and then it did it would but it would have killed more people yeah, I don't know how many more people though
*  I don't know if there could have been a better strategy. I don't know dude. The problem is we're Monday Monday morning
*  quarterbacking yeah, it was like after the fact we're going oh, this is what we should have done and
*  Yeah, I didn't think we were gonna die, but like I thought it could have gotten kind of bad a little bit
*  I made a few phone calls of friends. I was like, you know go stock your fridges
*  We might be in the crib for a little bit, but the only thing that helped me was Idris Elba
*  Why would he say cuz he got it and he was fine? Yeah
*  Yeah, do you think they really got it?
*  Yes, I do like you don't think it's weird that like the second it pops off Tom Hanks is like I got it
*  Well, the whole crew got it. A lot of people are hospitalized. It was in Australia. There's a break out in that area
*  Okay, yeah, it was what I would do if I want people to be afraid right? I'd be like who's the most famous guy
*  He got it. Oh, you're going deep conspiracy. I'm just saying wouldn't you do that smoked any weed yet?
*  Are we maybe at the end but once I smoke it's over I just want to know
*  It's just I'll fall apart. I'll like start doing like
*  I'm I'll start like doing like beatboxing. Maybe it just gets really bad
*  If it gets horrible if we wanted to point to a conspiracy
*  Yeah, that you I would say you would kill Tom Hanks
*  I wouldn't say you let him walk away free because he gets it and he kicks it then we're terrified
*  Yeah, I'm not scared of Tom Hanks can kick it yeah Tom Hanks can kick it I can kick it for sure
*  Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, it was interesting like it was like only famous people got it initially
*  Yeah, but it was like the new blue check that's what we were calling it because like I remember I didn't know a single
*  Regular person that had it but all these athletes had it every basketball team a few people had it all these actors had it
*  Yeah, I was just like how the fuck are they getting it see that the act the athlete thing was like, okay
*  Well, these are super athletes and they don't have any any form. No, what it was what they were flying bitches in bro
*  You know what it was here. You come on. Come on, dude. I feel like it was just using the wrong fountain
*  We can all use any fountain now, okay cut the clip
*  How many clips are we gonna give CNN this episode alone how many problematic
*  Let's talk about them let's talk about them
*  I feel like the athlete thing was like, okay, they're super athletes and they don't have any symptoms, right?
*  But we're not super athletes. Okay. Yeah, but then Idris Elba is just a really good shape in shape actor
*  Yeah, well, he seems okay with Tom Hanks is an older gentleman who doesn't look he's in great shape. Yeah, he got through it
*  Yeah, what is you know, and then you find out the flu numbers and they're but it's not the flu. Okay? Okay
*  It's not the flu. Yeah, okay. It's not the flu. Yeah, you know science is a new religion, bro
*  Well, think about it think about it though. No, it's money money. I really believe this
*  I really I know what you're saying with the Monday morning
*  But like quarterback and think about like the way religion operated in the past, right?
*  The second you said anything against the church they shame you they ostracize you who the fuck are you?
*  How could you say these things they put you in your little box over there you get ex-communicated any of us were like
*  You sure it really kills everyone right? Like are you sure? Are you sure? It's that contagious?
*  What the fuck is what Fauci come out of the Keebler elf house? Tell them what's going on?
*  They've just rail at you non-stop. Yeah, and the second and the second you say a single thing you were what they label you as
*  I think Amazon even like took our book
*  Heretic right wasn't it? Is that what the term is? I think you were blasphemy or something
*  Right and then all the sudden this information starts to come out where it's like, okay, it's not that bad
*  The curve is kind of flattening now the shit comes out today
*  It was it basically said if you're asymptomatic you can't transfer it as easily as they thought it's almost impossible
*  It's all that worry that we were about kids giving it to their grandmothers
*  They're not gonna do that was the only reason why stores are shut down
*  The only reason why comedy club shut down restaurants because if you're asymptomatic you pass on now
*  We know you're not if you have a cough if you're sneezing if you got the flu stay the fuck home. That's it crank it open
*  Let's go crank it open. Yeah, you have to wait massive. No, New Jersey just said they want another month for so
*  This is where we get into like the I'm one my man, but don't think this is just people trying to get reelected
*  It could be but it could be people who are scared of people dying on their watch because now it's not the economy to get to
*  Reelected it's people dying on your watch
*  well
*  if someone comes along and says the reason why X amount of people died it could have been much less if you had just
*  Done the right thing and kept those people safe and kept everything closed for another month, right?
*  So I think it's that it's also a lot of these people are not healthy people, right?
*  I know a lot of really intelligent people that are not healthy and they're terrified of this virus
*  Yeah, and I would try to tell them well, hey, let's look at the actual statistics
*  Yeah, the actual statistics are it doesn't seem like it's fun to catch
*  Yeah, right
*  but as long as you have a good level of nutrients in your body you have a
*  Adequate
*  Sufficient levels of vitamin D zinc you take care yourself get in the sauna drink a lot of water
*  Don't get fucked up every night. Don't eat sugar all day. Like you're probably gonna be okay. And maybe what's devastating
*  Even more so hmm is how many suicides we've looked we had how many people died because because of the depression
*  Yo, did you hear that stat that like Corona actually saved lives?
*  Because people aren't driving so they didn't get in car accidents. Oh, that's true
*  In a weird way way less people it saved car accident deaths car accident deaths. What else was there?
*  I mean there was a lot more domestic violence, but a lot more child abuse too
*  Really? Yeah a lot of child abuse a lot of domestic violence
*  and then what's really scary is the fucking suicides because people who are already barely hanging on but might have pulled through if they
*  Had a good job. Yeah had a way to make a living now
*  They're broke and they have to beg for money and they they got one twelve hundred dollar check
*  On it everybody I know that's a comic is making more money
*  How all these comics that were like they're barely they were like middling on the road or they're barely doing it
*  They get the twelve hundred dollars. Then we check they get furloughed from their job
*  So I think you get like six hundred bucks or something a month when you're weak or something when you're furloughed
*  They're making like a grand a week like everybody had money, dude. This is a crazy shit about anything
*  The stock market has him budged. Well, that's how you know, the stock market's fake or this is fake
*  They price out everything Joe. They price out every the Super Bowl. They price it out. They price out
*  What is it? The other thing we were just in the pandemic they price out right and it dipped down the protests right now
*  They priced out they priced out the protest. There's MIT mathematicians really I think
*  Call up Lex Friedman, let's get to the bottom of this Lex Lex call me buddy
*  I was funny when we were at the store and I was teasing him because he was dressed like a men in black dude
*  And then you go he's a black belt jujitsu too
*  He's a super nerd he's a nerd that can kill you yeah, yeah nerds like that jujitsu
*  Yeah, well, it's a very intellectual pursuit believe it or not. It seems like it wouldn't be yeah
*  It seems like it's just brute strength and shit like that, but it's not so there's also they just want to like touch people
*  Like they're just it's like no socialization
*  And then you get to embrace be awkward, yeah, yeah
*  The normal awkwardness of touching people well, and you maybe never were able to like we need fucking affection like you go like like Africa
*  Right and you super homophobic a lot of these countries
*  But the dudes are holding hands the dudes are hugging each other kissing each other when they fucking meet
*  And I think it's because if you can't just fuck broads regularly you need that affection somewhere, right?
*  So you just get it from your boys. How come they can't fuck broads regularly?
*  I think you there's not like just dating cultures like if there's no alcohol. It's harder. Just like go to the hookah spot and pick up
*  Like if you can't drink yeah, if you can't go out for a drink
*  Where would you date? You're too mean in your social circle you have to meet at the mosque
*  And what are you gonna pick up girls at the mosque you'd have I bet a lot of it would be like your girl or?
*  Like like your girl would have a friend yeah, and she would try to introduce her to Jamie that kind of deal
*  Oh, yeah, you know I mean yeah like oh, I know this single guy. I'm gonna set you up
*  There's probably a lot of that yeah, you know I'm saying yeah arranged
*  Yeah, and there's probably a lot of like girls trying to sabotage relationships
*  So like I think my you've gone so much better with you and they try to sabotage
*  Relationships with their girlfriend and some guy so they can sneak in some other dude whoa
*  For sure like a terror plot. Yeah for sure they do that. Yeah, I just don't think he's good for you
*  I just don't Debbie you can do so much better. I mean yeah, he's fine
*  How happy is you that you don't have to date through all this like?
*  Dane to the pandemic I
*  Yeah, I didn't get it all I got a girl some yeah
*  I'm sorry the worst like the guys that I know that are the most depressed right now or single
*  That been by themselves for two fucking months locked in our apartment. They're having people come up
*  Oh they but then they were loose you know they were not I wasn't gonna say losers
*  They weren't getting any pussy before well
*  They were getting some occasionally, but they had to go out and get it right you have to go
*  You have a couple of drinks someone yeah, you know
*  Did it did it dude? I don't even know how to get laid anymore. I'm thinking I bet you ask you just beg you just
*  You got to bring consent form and have them sign and you have to record it
*  Everyone's gonna be a pornographer so that every step of the way gets documented like this is for us
*  We're gonna put it in a vault and a safe deposit box
*  Just so everybody knows true that you you were well aware and wanted to do all this stuff
*  You can't change what happened yeah, you can't decide after you feel terrible yeah
*  Like just asking some people do distort which the distorting part is what's really scary like openly distort
*  Like what happened with you and like you know the Chris Hardwick story no go
*  Terrible one yeah
*  Of sexual assault and this is her definition of sexual assault she said yes to him because he had told her that if
*  In the past that they had been in a relationship
*  He had been in a relationship in the past where the girl didn't want sex as much as him, and he didn't like it
*  Mm-hmm, so this was her her her reasoning
*  For describing why her saying yes to him and having sex with him was actually him sexually assaulting her yeah
*  It's crazy right so yeah, he had all these text messages from her yeah, and all these like he documented everything yeah luckily
*  Mm-hmm, but yet people were still upset that AMC hired him back even though
*  It was shown that she lied and not him and that none of it like
*  He actually broke up with her because she was making out with some other guy like there was a lot of craziness to it
*  And she cheated on him, but it didn't matter like they were still going after him
*  Yeah, people are still going out like people can
*  Distort
*  The version of the the relationship that you had mm-hmm and even if you can prove it wrong
*  You're still on the wire for the rely a believer
*  Yeah, I believe her I always believe women and there's people that do say that believe all women believe you can't believe yeah all anything
*  You can't believe all cops you can't believe all doctors. Yeah, I don't like all arguments
*  It's a dumb argument outside of stand-up. Oh yeah, well for funny stand up
*  Yeah, all arguments are the best yes sure that makes it makes good comments fine
*  It's fun like plus it also now you got me thinking about believe all women. I'm like how can I find a way?
*  Well you her burrs
*  Yeah, but they get behind it. It's a weird. I don't know you know what you know
*  I go to is Casey Anthony do we believe her what did she say she killed her fucking kid?
*  She killed her kid and duct taped it and she covered it up. Uh-huh. Yeah, she got away with it, too
*  But like how did she do it?
*  She murdered her kid like with a nice or something like that. No, I know she's in Florida something like that
*  Yeah, they found the body, but they found blood and they found a bunch of different things so the baby disappeared the baby's gone
*  Exactly she killed the kid. It's a famous story. No. I know I heard the thing, but we don't know if the baby's dead
*  Did we find the baby? I don't think they ever found it so the baby's not dead. I'd say
*  That's what I would say
*  You need a body for a murder right?
*  Say again. Oh
*  There you go skeletal remains skeletal remains. Yeah, not good um that's right
*  What wasn't their situation where after the fact they found another web browser that they hadn't bothered checking?
*  Uh-huh computer, and it was like how to get one was all like you know how to get rid of a body
*  Yeah, how long does it take for a body decompose? Yeah?
*  What's the best way to kill a but this was the case were like?
*  Her lawyer might not search that in the interest of not getting sued yeah, I've been how do you kill?
*  God it sucks that you have to preface
*  According to Google neck breaking how to make chloroform yeah for everybody that watches this show
*  I just want you know Jamie doesn't have a computer
*  He just knows all this stuff put up her put up the the list of these things and what is the article is this?
*  I'm looking in the Wikipedia for it. That's all it said so this is what they said that she had probably Wikipedia
*  It says I'm Brian Cowen's brother
*  Says I have Crohn's disease, too. They're just making sure do you have it?
*  No, so that Casey anything her lawyer said that her dad did it
*  Did you see that that was the defense lawyer said her dad yeah?
*  So the defense was hey, we just need to make it plausible that someone else killed a baby
*  Oh my god, and then you got to handle that shit yourself afterwards
*  They know somebody killed the baby and the someone was in the family
*  But it got her off the point is yeah
*  I don't think she again say again, so the point is I don't want to be dating anybody right now
*  This is a thing you can't trust anybody yes, but here's the thing with her
*  Do you think she killed the baby on purpose or the baby died and then she's like fuck? I killed a baby
*  How do I get rid of this thing so it looks like I didn't kill a baby?
*  That's a good question now. We're in the world the realm. What would you do if you killed a baby by accident?
*  It's a tough one because you didn't mean to
*  Right like you were doing the game you know where you throw the baby right and then just into a fan
*  Mentions the doc the searches it's from in the middle of the case. It's like a web archive her mom said that
*  They gave the baby to a babysitter which nobody could find mm-hmm and that Casey's car smelled like a dead body
*  Yeah, she probably left it in there a long time you got a sloppy bitch like that yeah, don't clean up the baby quick
*  Yeah, it was from an old pizza and trash that was in the trunk not human decon was she one of these like hot girls
*  Yeah, remember there was like a time where like hot girls were killing a lot
*  It was her and then that other girl right like there was smoke shows fucking joints were killing
*  What was the other girl? She killed someone? I think it was an LA trial which one was this oh god
*  She was like Spanish or something. She was like kind of like spicy. Yeah, do you remember this no yeah now?
*  I'm interested. It was like a pretty bad murder. We googled like the hottest like chicks who murdered
*  Oh
*  You know like when you're like great at what you do you can get away with it
*  Yes, you know I'm sure people have done bits about that like you know blah blah was so great
*  He could get away Michael Jackson so great
*  I could get away with these things and we were like does the same thing work for like hot chicks who kill like would
*  You still fuck oh?
*  If they will be willing to fuck you yeah, oh no if you yeah, you were gonna do it. Yeah, like if a prime time
*  Like what's give me we think is the hottest girl you've ever seen
*  hottest girl I've ever seen obviously outside of our of course significant others Joe a hundred percent um
*  Just give me an example so like publicly joint Adriana Lima is a joint
*  Yoink perfect hundred percent yeah example now imagine Adriana Lima. Yes, she kills her husband
*  Yes, but I'll clean it up guys. I'll clean them up asshole. No no no guys a piece of shit
*  He could be the kindest man ever
*  He she could kill him while he's like feeding cleft palate kids, and I would take the kid
*  I put them in another room obviously wouldn't kill a kid
*  I clean up the guy's dead body
*  And then we would do whatever we have to do if you were fucking her with a lot of objects around I would want it
*  To be in like a basketball court
*  Was she you know?
*  Fucking her with objects around I won't I don't
*  Fucking her on the table at the Joe Ronigans
*  There's always knives on this fucking table. That's what I'm thinking someone's gonna grab a knife and stab you
*  Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna trust it
*  Like maybe right as she comes
*  You motherfucker
*  Right through your rib cage like oh my gosh listen to Joe and take her to the gym
*  I once had oh this is back in my like bad days. You know I'm a good guy now reformed
*  ho if you will but uh I remember I had a girl over and I
*  Remember I left my wallet in the living room
*  Oh, no, and she went to like the bathroom or something I had to clean up
*  And I remember I like went into the living room
*  I grabbed my wallet like put it in like a pair of pants
*  And then I sat there saying I'm like am I fucking girls. I think will steal from me like
*  What's happening in my life that I'm willing to go through this well you do though when you're a young man
*  And you're horny yeah, that's a drug dealer. You got a drug dealer in front of you
*  Just a girl that you're interested in you're also you have a real need
*  Yeah, well guys are horny. I mean, I don't know what it's like
*  I'm obviously talking just for men cuz I don't know what it's like when a girl's horny
*  Maybe it's exactly the same feeling. I don't think it is
*  I don't I would assume that like all other things men and women are very different
*  So I think the horny parts very different too. Yeah, but when men are horny it gets desperate
*  It gets weird like drug Attic II desperate. Yeah, I think I've always wondered that with like women like if
*  Cuz we always chalk it up to ourselves like if we get laid right it's like I kick great game
*  Like that was me like I took that down or whatever you know and I wonder if a lot of it is like their
*  emotional state in the day like
*  Let's say they're their cat went missing or something like if that they're like fuck. I'm really down
*  I'm gonna go hook up with this guy because that's gonna elevate my emotional state
*  I think for some girls. I think some girls just want to escape and they'll just go have a
*  You know
*  Just a fling right but see a thing with girls have to worry about men
*  In a dangerous way where men don't really have to wear girls the same way
*  Yeah, there's a dude. You know what it is like you saw obviously you saw the Epstein doc on Netflix right dude
*  I couldn't watch it. Amy Jamie and I were watching it together. I shut it off after the first 15 minutes
*  Yeah, I was like I don't want to hear about this. I know what happened. Here's the thing
*  obviously fluff piece like we can get into that but like
*  To like put all the guilt on Epstein type of thing like he's the sole purpose like he manipulated everybody
*  It was like really adorable how they did it kind of like you know FireFest
*  They made it look like that guy Billy was just the only guy that did anything wrong like all these are they oh god
*  Yeah, it's like the second someone can't refute the evidence like Billy was in jail. They're like okay run the docks right and it's like and
*  You know how like so like they were these PR companies that were attached to FireFest right they promoted this shit everywhere and all of a
*  Sudden they're like absolved of any guilt because it's just this guy Billy who did everything and whatever doesn't matter same thing with with Epstein
*  But what's interesting about the girls and was like you just got to hear their stories like I never heard of any of these girls
*  Right and after watching the stories and how like they complained to the FBI they complained to all these different places and like nobody
*  Ever listened to them. I go. Oh shit. This is why the me too movement existed because as a dude that came into the me too movement not
*  Never being a douchebag to girls like I never fucking mistreated women at all
*  I was very good to girls like I looked at me too, and I was like what's going on here?
*  Like why are these girls like so angry at us?
*  They were I'm I'm the worst version of guy in terms of maybe like dating a lot, but I would never do anything
*  Yeah, but I'm not a boss see no no no no but here
*  I'm saying this is what's really interesting the girls tried to be heard for years. They weren't
*  All of a sudden the voices are heard right
*  I'm sure those aren't the only girls who talk to their boss or talk to HR about like their boss being inappropriate
*  And we're told to shut the fuck up so the second they're listened to
*  The floodgates are open right you see what I'm saying, and I was like oh, that's why this happened
*  This is like the straw that broke the camel's back type of things exactly and and if I look it through that perspective
*  Even in the time I go yes
*  This is wrong and saying things like oh, you know absolutes
*  I believe all women that kind of stuff is is
*  Wrong and probably wouldn't even be supported by them
*  But I get the feeling where it's like if nobody's gonna listen to you now you got a microphone
*  You're gonna scream into that shit. I don't even think it's the rational ones that are saying it that are saying believe all women
*  I think it's a lot of a lot of that shit is crazy people like yeah
*  Just that slogan is not something you could say you can't say believe all men you can't say yeah
*  You can't say that because then you're giving people the license to bullshit you yeah, because you're not treating
*  Like if someone tells you a story and in this story whether you know whoever it is
*  So it's your boss. Yeah, you're the victim of your boss if you don't know the bosses version of it
*  You don't really know the truth. It's hard. It's hard to say yeah
*  It might very well be they're telling you the hundred percent truth or they might be a fucking crazy person who blames everybody
*  For everything that ever happened in their life, and they might be a pathological liar
*  There's a lot of people that are liars. There's a lot of people that are manipulators
*  They make up stories of course to make other people look bad of course
*  But the nature of man is that men are disgusting and when men are in control like if a guy is the head of a fucking
*  Movie studio yeah, and get these all these dime pieces to suck on his
*  Doing that since the beginning of time yeah, and the problem is not just that the man
*  Wants to do that to all the actresses. Yeah, there's another problem that some of the actresses
*  Actively manipulate that man and seduce him so that they can get ahead. Oh, yeah, that's real, too
*  Yeah, it's all yeah, what's real is that there were willing participants
*  That that were there if you're benefiting from the system mm-hmm. Why would you reject it now?
*  I'm not making a statement about Marco Robbie, right?
*  I don't know what she's done in her life, and she probably earned every single one of her roles perfectly no question
*  Even have to name any names my point is you've never heard her complain about Hollywood
*  But she's getting all the roles the girls in Hollywood. I hear complaining are
*  50
*  You don't think that's coincidental like Rose McGowan
*  Ages out of sucking dick to do the role you son of a bitch. I'm just saying dare you just say it's
*  Isn't it coincidental when you age out of some shit you complain?
*  Look we're all guilty of it, too
*  You see like all these comments
*  I see tons of comics be like there's no jobs for like straight white comics, and it's like you're 50
*  Yeah, there's no any 50 year olds. Yeah, like that's guy. Who's you know your dad now?
*  I think a lot of times you see these these things of convenience man. It's like I
*  Wouldn't want to comment on that because I don't know what exactly what her situation is or any of theirs right?
*  But what I do know I don't know either, but you look at the correlation you see like okay
*  Maybe there was a time where this type of behavior
*  Was was like how you kind of work the system to get ahead talk to Whitney about it? Yeah? Yeah?
*  I mean, she's not gonna name any names. Yeah fucking tell you that's exactly what some of them did bro
*  That's the thing that I've realized like now is like especially with politics, which is so smart is like
*  Have you seen everything everything is like this like a proxy war mmm like
*  If you have a message you have to get across right and you're a Republican right if you have a message you want to get
*  Of your Republican you know that the left is gonna attack your identity
*  First no matter what the message is so they find people who have identities
*  They can't attack and they prop them up right like the gay Asian dude
*  What's this guy? He got beat up like they got milkshakes on him or something like that. Oh, and you know yeah
*  And then Candace Owens right like if you're conservative, and you want these conservative points said you have to get them said by people
*  That the right can't criticize the left king sorry the left can't criticize for so it's like if you or I say something
*  We're like looting is bad or something like that right?
*  Easily you well you wouldn't know you wouldn't know what systemic oppression is Joe you're a fucking white guy
*  You have all this privilege shut the fuck up, but if you have someone whose identity
*  Cannot be criticized you have to take what they say at face value
*  So that's their proxies right they put like Milo is the first one of these guys
*  Yeah
*  But these two people that you're put using an example are both examples of people that have been attacked by the left
*  But they're not attacked for their identity and not immediately discredited for that identity they have to be discredited for the words
*  Whereas you would be immediate dental identity wipe it away
*  But what's what's genius is the left does it as well and this fucking hit me because I'd be looking at Greta Thunberg
*  Why the fuck are we listening to a fucking kid about anything right right it drove me crazy
*  And then I go and I'd see the the gun kids from Florida from the school that got shut up
*  I'm back. Why are we listening to kids about guns and legislation? I'm like holy fuck
*  Then making kids make all the points because you can't kill kids to shut the fuck up
*  Or you're an asshole if you're the adult telling a little girl to shut the fuck up
*  You don't know anything about the polar ice caps you're an asshole
*  So if you just get kids to make all your points for you the right just got to go well
*  It's good the kids are involved in the political process well my favorite thing about Greta is they started off with climate change
*  She was talking about her future. Yeah, how dare you then she became a half-tart this right didn't she go half-tart?
*  She did she went Hannah Gatsby right? It's like she has autism is that what you're saying someone told me she's half-retarded
*  Autism that's the correct
*  Difference was she vaccinated do we vaccines did you have too much vaccines?
*  No, there's no there's no issues with the vaccines right it actually is a plus you know doing the vaccines
*  No, no the autism it actually helps you focus on certain things like what I don't know
*  I mean, that's what they say about people on the spectrum. Yeah, let's ask Ben Shapiro. You think he's on it
*  Oh autistic Adam Smith. That's what I thought
*  The free market isn't like ask him about anything you like donuts well even the best donuts would be in the free market
*  Turn it off for a second dude. Just fucking turn it. We get it you like capitalism, dude
*  Turn it the fuck down what I was gonna say about that Greta chick is they brought her on the kovat council
*  I saw that I couldn't believe it
*  She's 16 like why you bringing her on an infectious disease council for a pandemic that no one's ever faced before
*  Well, you know who they wouldn't have on the council Rand Paul who is an actual medical doctor who actually survived kovat
*  They didn't ask him to be on
*  Why because he has controversial opinions and maybe he thinks that it wasn't the best idea to shut the fucking economy down for three
*  Months and have everybody go crazy, bro
*  It is what it is it is what it is. It is what it is you can't it's just
*  Yeah, we live in a weird fucking time
*  Yeah, you can't tell me that they didn't calling her for a new issue and putting her out there publicly. Yeah, so
*  Irresponsible it's calling her for any issues irresponsible. She's a teenager. What do teenagers know well?
*  Please tell me what teenagers know they know how to go to school
*  Okay, and they have less things in their mind so they get better at stuff quicker
*  Like if you want to be a gymnast or a martial artist when you're a teen you get way better way quicker, okay, Greta
*  If there's a tick-tock dance that I need to learn I
*  Guarantee your autistic concentration is gonna make it perfect and you're gonna get down those steps. You're gonna be able to do it
*  I don't need to know about fucking science for me. I
*  Don't even need to know about science from most journalists
*  I just need scientists to tell me and then I'm gonna I'm gonna actually ask questions because that's what fucking science is
*  When did science stop being about asking questions like if you ask any real scientists?
*  They beg yeah
*  Well the whole point is we just poke holes in our theories and we just do that constantly and that's actually good science
*  Now the second you ask a question
*  You're a heretic man if it's a heretic. Yeah, if it's about gender
*  Yeah, or if it's about the economy or if it's about climate change
*  Yeah, those things you're not allowed to use science. Okay climates changing
*  Yeah, but you can't you can't use science to just if you have like any scientific facts that you try to bring
*  Do you buy the what do you think about you think climates changing? It's a hundred percent changing. It's changing for the better
*  If you're in Antarctica, it's better
*  If you're in Antarctica, it's gonna get hotter and it's gonna be it's gonna be there's gonna be some negative
*  Give me the negative. I I literally when they describe it to me extinction events for sure
*  There's gonna be a large number of animals that can't survive in areas
*  There'll be less water in in in areas where it's hotter. Okay animals are gonna die. Maybe people are gonna die
*  We can move the people less crops. Yeah, it's not that easy, but you're right. Yeah, we got food
*  But for sure you can make food anywhere I can make food in my my backyard
*  I can make food in my living room point about it is if you in any way
*  Dispute the models of what they're saying and have an alternative perspective
*  Yeah, that alternative perspective is never engaged that alternative perspective is demonized that perspective is your climate change
*  Denier and you're a bad person and and some of them just have data that they're going on like they're talking about the raised carbon
*  Levels in the atmosphere is actually better for plant life
*  And that the more cut because plants actually take in carbon dioxide breathe out oxygen
*  And there was some people that were talking about how there is there's some benefits to some forms of life by an increased carbon
*  Count in the atmosphere. It's a fucking weird argument because it's one of the factors that's
*  Leading to the fact that the world's heating up
*  Mean you're saying that that it's good that the world's heating up. It's like boy. I don't know maybe we act like it's good
*  We want to be warmer
*  You know I grew up in New York obviously he likes to be warmer
*  And I'm sure that's just a surface level argument that being said I don't know if the conversation should be
*  Stop global warming at any cost
*  Maybe it's better conversation to have is like hey we should do what we can to stop global warming
*  But we can't kill the economy because then we kill people anyway
*  That is true. We act like
*  We're in a weird space where we just think you could print money and everything's okay
*  This concerns me a little mm-hmm that doesn't worry you it worries me this that's why the
*  Pandemic thing worried me the shutdown because I was like it's not that easy to restart everything and there's a lot of things that won't
*  Be there when you restart it including they think something like 40% of small businesses might go under within the first six months
*  That's that's scary shit. That's a lot. That's a lot
*  So what is everybody gonna work for Target and Walmart and large corporations?
*  All the mom-and-pop stores go under all the mom-and-pop restaurants go under
*  Very dangerous time in that way because then where are the jobs you can't just go right back
*  That is a and that's gonna lead to a lot of suicide a lot of murder a lot of crazy shit because people are gonna be
*  Desperate that's one of the things they said about Northern, California
*  They had more suicides from cove during the the crackdown than they had from kovat more people died from killing themselves
*  There's a big uptick big uptick in suicides one of Swartz's buddies a sheriff was telling him that
*  They used to have one a week and now they were having five a day
*  Somewhere somewhere in LA like what the fuck man, so that's something that people need to take into consideration
*  You take any consideration how many people are gonna become drug addicts?
*  How many people are gonna be severely depressed and it might forever alter the course of their trajectory in life?
*  Yeah
*  They might have been on an upward trend all sudden boom their business gets taken away from them and then they get desperate and then they
*  Get sad then the and then they get on antidepressants and then they zombie out and then they never go anywhere
*  Well, they were on their way to having a fulfilled life
*  How many people broke up with their fucking loved ones because they had to be with them all day 24 hours a day
*  And they were just sick of them
*  Maybe they would have worked out great if they just went along at a natural trajectory
*  Yeah, how about if you just start with a girl you just meet her you've been date for a couple weeks and like all of a
*  Sudden the pandemic hits and you really like her. Yeah, like I just
*  Let's just live together. Fuck it
*  I
*  Like how long is it gonna take you tell your friends like you sure it's a good idea Andrew
*  You've only known her for 14 days. We bought a dog
*  It's true they ever call your buddy from a new number and this girl answers the phone
*  Girl answers the cell phone. Oh
*  Yeah
*  I'm calling for Greg. Yeah, who's this? Yeah, Greg's friend
*  Who the fuck are you? That's the real question is Greg. We have a secretary. What is this?
*  There's a go. Yeah, man. That's my girlfriend. She didn't recognize the number who got locked up. She didn't recognize the number
*  Oh, so she just answers your phone. Yeah, doesn't recognize the number. Yeah, what what are you talking about, man? Yeah
*  Yeah, imagine
*  Yeah, it's I don't know I've had I've been very lucky like I you know me and my girl live together and well you would
*  Tell me how to great say again. You would tolerate nothing less. That's a moron. Yeah, that's the other thing
*  It's like I cannot function well in
*  Misery, yeah, I won't tolerate misery dude. I would hate to be a woman
*  Working for a guy who wanted to fuck me. They're probably horrible, dude being a guy wanted to work for like oh
*  My god there was a guy who is your boss who wanted to fuck you
*  I was thinking like a girl boss, but also that that sucks girl boss would be rough, too
*  Yeah
*  if a guy was putting a pressure on like if a guy was really
*  Like rubbing your shoulders like guys do the chicks at work like like laying the meat on your back a bit
*  Oh, I knew a casting agent. That was a female. That was kind of gross and she would fuck dudes and get them rolls
*  Yeah, oh, yeah, she'd throw it around
*  Really is a son back in the 90s got a lot of fellas on a lot of projects really did you get something?
*  No, yeah, but she tried to fuck one of my friends. That was the only thing
*  There was a girl I got shit in the outer but I got out in anybody
*  I don't say names, but I think there's a girl that worked at a comedy club in New York
*  They would fuck a lot of coming get him on the stage. I think that's how
*  That's basically way back today is way back today, but did misty yeah, but listen here's the deal here's the difference
*  Yeah, I support that keep going no one's getting killed see right what I'm scared about with women
*  Yeah, men are physically stronger. Yes when the man is physically stronger the woman can just basically just fuck them
*  Yes, they only have sex with them. Yes, the sucky thing is if it affects your career
*  I get that but there's a big difference between that and worried you're actually gonna get raped
*  You're gonna get killed well women have to worry about with guys that want to fuck them is creepy angry guy type shit
*  Yes with men have to worry about just lies
*  They have to worry about like hysterical lies and crazy people making things up right maybe the new boyfriend coming over to kick your ass
*  Yeah, that's the kind of stuff you have to worry about you have to worry about
*  You know less things and you don't have to worry about any of it during sex
*  That's what I was saying if you're gonna was it Andrea Lima who's the girl?
*  Yeah, yeah joint
*  Basketball court nothing around no physical objects
*  Yeah, I can't kill you with anything if she puts her pants on screaming and runs out to the car
*  Yeah, I got plenty of warning you grab a chair. Yeah, you know what you know what you're doing
*  What do you do keep away like a lion? Okay? Yeah?
*  Yeah, yeah stop or stop one more time. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  But my say my point is like it has to be an extremely psychotic woman for you to be actually worried about your life
*  Yeah
*  So if a girl comes over your house
*  You might worry about your wallet if you fucked up, and you've just barely know her now since she's rummaging through your house
*  Mm-hmm, but you don't worry about your life. Yeah, you don't worry about your life a woman takes a guy over her house
*  She worries about her life. Yes, it's a different thing
*  It's always gross when someone's using their their power to fuck you
*  Whether it's a man or a woman it's gross, but it's less gross when it's a woman
*  Yeah, but power you mean physical power no no what physical power for sure yeah, I meant like power
*  Yeah, like if they're your boss that's a slippery slope though, dude. Don't you think it's like you can't use
*  Power that's a weird thing like less gross though if you're less gross, but like that was a big much
*  Yeah, well, I don't know that was a big issue with like with the Louie things like Lou I think said in his apology
*  He was like these girls admired me, and I used that or something like that, and I was like who fucks someone they don't admire
*  Like that's bit like bare minimum. Yes of the person that you're fucking is admiration, right?
*  We just can't we can't start labeling things as
*  Sexual misconduct they're actually good qualities to have in a man, but he has power
*  That would have been the gated, but that would have been negated if he actually had sex with them
*  Then there was no issue at all right the issue was he asked if he could beat off in front of him and a lot
*  Of women find that disgusting yeah, that's the issue if if he said do you guys want to have sex and they said yes?
*  Yeah, they did it. There's no argument. Yeah, but if he said do you mind if I beat off in front of you?
*  And they said yes people still judge bro. That's the tricky thing about apologizing, bro
*  It's so you know what's crazy about the public apology is it like when you apologize publicly you apologize
*  For whatever someone thinks you did yes, not for what you did
*  You know I'm saying right so like if some if some girl thinks
*  That he slammed the fucking door held it down put an axe there and started fucking whacking
*  And want to see the fear in their eyes. Yeah, that's if that's what they think and then he apologizes for and he as he says my actions
*  or whatever
*  Everybody who believes that's what happened is confirmed
*  That's why I don't know if you could ever publicly apologize because you just confirm everyone's suspicions when you do it you have to clearly
*  State exactly what happens for the apology if you apologize publicly
*  Yeah, he doesn't want to do that
*  His cuz it's embarrassing well his version of it's very different than the version that gets spouted around
*  Yeah, and whenever that's the case
*  There's no way to know it's a back-and-forth
*  There's no yeah, there's no way to know who's telling the truth and who's not but yeah the very least
*  He had a funny bit about it
*  He's saying even if they say yes, don't do it if you ever thinking of jerking off in front of somebody even if they say
*  They say yes, I had a good hypothetical
*  Tell me what you think about this gotta forget where I heard it. I want to give credit, but uh okay
*  You know how like if somebody if an artist does an unthinkable action
*  We cancel their art like maybe watching Cosby's specials are fucked up
*  Or maybe you take them off the air the Cosby show off the air because right yeah
*  If a scientist did some foul shit back in the day like every Greek scientist would just bang in 14 year old girls
*  No dudes actually dudes right yeah, yeah, but it was okay back then okay
*  Keep going this is interesting. Yeah, it was okay back then
*  Times change now. It's not okay. Yeah, right do we stop using fucking algebra?
*  No, we don't and I know there is a distinction
*  And I understand that we're like the art is like a piece of you and math is something that you find right math always exists, right?
*  That being said I bet you there are some people who would cancel
*  The scientists yeah, and what if art this is and I'm not one of these fucking like hippie art guys
*  but like what if art had like
*  Healing quality you know like some people like songs can lift their mood and like movies and stuff like that like can like ease pain
*  Like ease trauma that they went through you know for sure and it's like like my girl has all these amazing childhood memories about Harry Potter
*  You know so like anytime we're in a fight. I just put in a Harry Potter, and then we're fucking everything's good
*  It's amazing
*  We just sorcerer's stone boom I'm back in it everything's fine
*  But so what if you could make that argument were you big hey? This is very powerful. This is very important work
*  You can't cancel is that is that the Michael Jackson effected like did Michael Jackson make such good music. Yeah, that's the art
*  It's more than art. Yeah, that's the argument with Woody Allen as well
*  Roman Polanski same argument that like you go back and watch Rosemary's baby
*  Even though you know he's a piece of shit right because the art is so good
*  So valuable valuable it approaches science in its value. Yeah, there's something about it where it's also ingrained into people's lives
*  I guess Bill Cosby was so egregious and what he did was on a network television
*  It wasn't like he was making films, but you know what's wild is that like?
*  Cosby was like you know putting shit in there. You know drugging people and fucking them right mm-hmm
*  Joe exotic
*  Was drugging dudes and fucking yeah, but they wanted to be drugged
*  They were good point good point good point good point good point. They're already messed out married him
*  Come on. Yeah, dude method is a powerful drug. It's a powerful drug dude that is that dude's teeth
*  It shows you everything you need to know about meth dude do with the four teeth. That's what was that line somebody else a hell of a drug
*  What was it?
*  Was it was it?
*  But okay, it's a hell of a drug, but cocaine don't make you gay bro. Maybe math does meth is that good
*  Maybe they're just gay. I don't know dude. Maybe they just can be tricked into being gay. It's like we were talking about earlier
*  I really do believe that people can be talked into things okay things sure for sure really yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, I had a bit about it. Okay. I had a bit. I had a bit about
*  Okay, cuz Mormons there was a thing called a proposition eight and it was all about gay marriage
*  It was repealing gay marriage, and you know well as crazy was
*  That Mormon the Mormon Church spent a lot of money trying to repeal gay marriage
*  And I said if anybody should be scared of gay marriage it should be Mormons
*  Okay, because someone could talk you into being a Mormon they can definitely talk you to suck in their dick
*  They just need a more alone time with you like you really you really believe a 14 year old boy
*  Found golden tablets that contain the lost work of Jesus, but only he could read it because he had a magic rock
*  Like someone if some guy can get you to suck his dick
*  He's just got to be around you long enough and tell you that the prophets told him to tell you that there's wisdom in his
*  Dick and that you have to do something that seems horrible to get the glory of God
*  100% remember that documentary that came out about the guy who like fucked the whole family
*  Remember he fucked the mom the dad and the kid yes
*  They were Mormon oh no of course
*  Interesting
*  They get super gullible when they're in that fundamental religion
*  It doesn't make sense right people that buy into religions and grow up in religions that don't make sense
*  Yeah, I know a lady who was a Mormon, and she actually admitted this yeah
*  It was her admission that made me think about it
*  Yeah
*  She goes I have so much vulnerability when it comes to people who are like crazy yoga guys or cult members
*  I buy into it because she grew up her whole life in this fundamentalist religion where you just believe nonsense
*  So you're used to handing over your consciousness to nonsense
*  Let me see if I can poke holes in it. Let me see
*  Let me see here I
*  Yeah, you become
*  Trained to believe yeah and not be skeptical
*  Yeah, so that anything that makes you feel good and included you feel like oh, it's true is rewarded. Yes
*  Yeah, okay fucking
*  Homeopathic bullshit yeah all kinds of nonsense that people believe reiki healing
*  Yeah, I'm gonna touch you and heal you with my my hands. Yeah all that nonsense
*  You know and what you're talking about earlier about people in their art yeah and people being canceled and their arc gets canceled
*  There's a whether or not they do do that with scientists. There's actually a great example that there's a guy named Fitz Harbor Fritz Harbor and
*  Fritz Harbor, that's how you say it and Fritz Harbor
*  Invented the harbor method of extracting nitrogen from the air that's responsible for a giant percentage of the fertilizing
*  Like when you eat food like that
*  I think they say that 50% of the nitrogen in most people's bodies actually comes from the harbor method
*  Mm-hmm. He figured this out and like I guess it was World War one or World War two
*  And then one World War one so he figured this out and then right afterwards
*  He figured out how to make zyklon gas okay, so he made zyklon a gas which was a gas
*  That was a pesticide and they used zyklon a gas for for crops to kill off bugs
*  And it stunk to high hell was fucking horrible so
*  It had this smell attached to it the Nazis
*  Turned that into zyklon B and were gassing Jews with his invention on top of that during World War one
*  He talked the Germans into using poison gas on the troops so on the Allied troops
*  There was the first war where they use like large-scale gas chemical weapons
*  Yeah, and so he was both at both at the same time
*  getting the Nobel Prize
*  For for the harbor method of extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere and then on top of that
*  wanted for crimes against humanity
*  Fuck so he was wanted for war crimes for gassing yeah
*  first time they've ever used poison gas on troops it was thought to be a
*  Terrible violation of the rules of engagement have we developed a new fertilizer thing no
*  We still use that that's still the standard you there's two ways of getting nitrogen
*  You either get nitrogen through natural sources
*  Which is like fish and fertilizer and cow manure and those types of things and that's what compost is for and you get it
*  That way yeah, or you get it from the harbor method because the oxygen like when you think about air
*  That's the best argument for like what is it mulching? What is the thing not mulching compost compost?
*  That's the best argument for compost. It's like don't support the Nazis right, but he's already dead
*  Yeah, it's large-scale like large-scale composting is a real issue
*  Yeah, you need a lot of biological waste to make some large-scale composting yeah, but that this harbor thing is really
*  It's a crazy story man
*  Yeah
*  because it sort of
*  embodies like this the situation where you've got a guy who did this incredible thing that helped so many people but also did this
*  Horrible thing that killed so many yeah, why were the Germans so advanced technologically at that time?
*  I don't know man they advanced with engines with car design. Yeah rocketry, but why what is it?
*  It's hard to say I mean they're just brilliant fucking people
*  They it's not like they weren't in close proximity to other people in Europe you feel like you think that like that technology would
*  Would be shared that's just so dude
*  It's so it was so crazy how advanced they were that the United States took the Nazis in to run NASA right?
*  Yeah, yeah, Space Force Force. Yeah, it's new
*  Operation paperclip they brought in not right yeah, yeah, didn't the Russians too. I think they like split up all the scientists
*  Either the Russia the United States all the biggest killers and Werner von Braun was a fucking straight-up Nazi really yes
*  The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if he was alive today that would prosecute him for crimes against humanity
*  Yeah, Werner von Braun the guy was the head of NASA fuck bro
*  Awful shit, man. Yeah, yeah, they used to hang the five slowest Jews in front of his rocket factory in Berlin
*  Yeah, yeah, dude like real legit, Nazi shit. Yeah, whoa yeah
*  That was the head of NASA they just took all those brilliant scientists look at him there
*  He is Werner von Braun Wow the Nazis yeah, yeah smile
*  Oh
*  It is interesting that like they never like the brands that happened around the Nazis never like rebranded
*  You know how like Volkswagen is still
*  People's car yes like which people right you know which people right and then like Hugo Boss
*  I think is just Hugo Boss
*  Like if you have a little boss was a Nazi company they made the fucking outfits
*  Oh, that's right. Did we talk about this?
*  But isn't that like don't you you know how now if you have like a little like Pizza Hut was like we remade the pizzas
*  They're way better like you would think that
*  You would rebrand if you're attached to that you'd switch the name up right you know in some way Jake boss
*  Well they used to people had a different sensibility when it came to things back then what you mean is you got to think because
*  They let things go
*  Like the only thing that never let go is the swastika you can't bring back the swastika
*  Yeah, but like in those days
*  Thing right isn't it a Hindu yeah, it is simple. Yes, these poor Indians are walking around
*  Say again, it's in the other direction
*  Okay, but um but still you can't wear it Hogan's heroes with the fucking sitcom
*  About Nazi concentration camps yeah, I mean they joke around about it
*  1970s and that was just 20 years afterwards dude. That's an interesting like discussion
*  It's like imagine we had a sitcom about 9-eleven
*  That's what Hogan's heroes is like yeah same amount of time yeah, that's crazy
*  Yeah, dude. There was a time
*  I'm trying to think I'm trying to see if it's possible, but like we're like comedy and
*  Corporations could work together
*  What was this at the time you're describing like I don't think comedy and corporations can work together
*  I think it's very difficult right so it's like
*  Well because they think comedy have to work with corporations, or they couldn't work at all right, but the corporations were like okay
*  Just be funny. That's fine. You could do a show about this
*  Like oh you mean a show about like they're not like Nazi concentration camps exactly like they're not policing
*  I mean and you know the dude Bob Crane on the far right was a freak
*  What he was like one of the first guys to film himself fucking okay?
*  That's a great great great can you're movie big cameras back then big big you need like another person film
*  Yeah, it wasn't like your iPhone which is nice and silent. Yeah. Yeah, you have to like set it up
*  Okay, but the back of it
*  Who was filming somebody had to do it he there was a movie called wasn't home
*  something focus
*  Autofocus right thing was called autofocus
*  But it was a film about him and he got murdered by this dude that he used to bang girls with
*  Why because they had a dispute they had a falling out maybe they touched dicks
*  It's a crazy movie yeah shows you how this guy was just like he was at a sitcom
*  But it's like fuck movies managed want to bang. Yeah, this was
*  He just became a porn star. I think about that all the time
*  Take a pot that all the time just fucking what was holding? I don't know I think back then there was just very few rules
*  Is this the movie autofocus or we just cared less about shit? Yeah, there was like wasn't that good
*  Well, I think there was just less people yelling at you. Okay made the wrong choices, too
*  What about there was no social media back then that's also true, right?
*  So the less people have a voice about what's wrong, but I also think like in times of luxury
*  Rules present themselves and then in times of chaos rule strip like at least in New York
*  I don't know how I was here, but like during during the shelter-in-place during the pandemic. There was no more rules, right?
*  Like seems here. Hey, you can't drink alcohol in the streets, and then all of a sudden was like yeah, I guess you can
*  Like they just said you can and then there wasn't it was dangerous. There was anything like that
*  You can't deliver alcohol. You can only deliver food. Oh, yeah, you can deliver alcohol
*  You can't serve out you can't eat on the street without a permit. Okay, you can eat on the street
*  I'm it just exposed. That's all this corona thing did is expose a lot of bullshit. It definitely didn't like it fucking
*  It took the makeup off
*  You know what I mean? Like, you know, like you're at the club and like the girls like beautiful and then like you guys go for
*  Like a skinny dip and then you're like
*  And I feel like yeah like that happened happen with fucking TV
*  Well, they adapted right they adapted with these new looser regulations in order to keep us safe during this corona time
*  How does it keep me safe? I saw the funniest thing today was that something that said use social distancing unless you're protesting
*  Can I tell you something bro? See that they put it on Fox
*  It was like an official report. I got the screenshot in here. I'll beat you to it. Jamie
*  I couldn't believe this. Let me find it. There it is right here. Look as public health advocates
*  As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for kovat 19 transmission
*  What?
*  This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings particularly protests against stay home orders. So protests against stay at home
*  That you can get corona that hey, don't say corona five times or corona comes right but protests for anything else
*  You're good. It is really interesting. Isn't it? It's pathetic. What if it's tell me if this is unethical
*  But what if tell me this is right? What if?
*  we
*  In support of Black Lives Matter
*  Donated a percentage of all of our live shows so that we could have full audiences
*  Now it's a public gathering in support of this cause and we're putting money towards a club putting money more amount
*  Now some people of course say you're using this cause to perform in front of more people then you're right
*  Yeah, but at the same time we're doing everything everyone's benefiting. It's mutually assured
*  That would be interesting
*  I'm just it's but then but then you're giving up your power to whether it's Black Lives Matter or whatever you give it up
*  Your ability to just have a show
*  It's based in time. It really should be that you want to give money to valid organizations, right? Of course
*  Of course, but the idea that you could get away with it. Like we have like a three month
*  exemption window
*  Where you could you could have full crowds until they lift it
*  You could only have full crowds if you give five percent to fill in whatever the blank whether it's Black Lives Matter
*  Whatever whatever people decide isn't this how they treat rich people anyway. Hey rich people you got to pay taxes
*  Yeah, unless of course you'd like to donate to a charity and then you have to pay that in taxes exactly
*  You could take some of that out. Yeah, that's true in that way
*  You can kind of decide where your taxes go and then who wins
*  These organizations that are truly trying to help people but then will the organizations drop it after a while
*  Like when do you have to keep paying them? Oh, it's like what happens with them?
*  They become a big corporation and then they shame people for not paying right and then it becomes a thing
*  Like if you don't pay you don't care
*  They have power over you and this is one of the things that happened with kovat
*  Yeah
*  Power over you to tell you to wear a mask are they really concerned is that what's really going on because it turns out historically they
*  Were wrong they were wrong. Yeah wrong and yet you still you can't go to places. I would have tacos at Santa Barbara yesterday
*  I don't know fucking mask. Can I tell you the good tacos? Where'd you go? Cuz I was in Santa Barbara to
*  We've had this conversation taco. Do you remember the place? I don't some outside joint. It's the shit
*  I went to an outside joint. I was probably right there with you. Shall hoops. I don't remember the name
*  It's called shall hoops. It could have been they go
*  Please put your mask on as we take you to your seat
*  Now when we're at your seat, you can take your mask off
*  Hilarious, can anybody explain to me what they thought I was gonna do in the 10 feet before?
*  That's LA now LA is opening up restaurants and I had my friend Janet and Evan the
*  Janet is the owner and Evan is the lead chef of this restaurant Felix in
*  Venice, okay
*  And they said that when people are in the restaurant people have to wear their masks until they sit down
*  Then when they go up to pee if they get up to pee they have to wear their mask
*  If you go to leave you have to wear your mask
*  Intimate restaurant in Venice, it's not a big restaurant
*  It's the weirdest time it's fucking dummies that they fucked up the first thing now they're fucking this up
*  Yeah, cuz they just don't want to admit they're wrong. They just don't admit they're wrong. I get it
*  I've been in that you know
*  I've been that argument you're with a friend or your girl or some shit like that New Zealand lifts locked down as it declares virus
*  Eliminated for now and what did they do?
*  Well, there's only like a million people there no active coronavirus cases and no new infections Wow
*  But you can't go over there like get out of you dirty bitch. Yeah
*  They have a beautiful country with very few people I mean I think the whole population of New Zealand is like what is it like
*  10 million hmm. They are letting some exceptions though some people can come in yes like for instance
*  people making avatar to
*  Good so there are exemptions for professional purposes. I see how well if you had a showbook what if an Andrew and I have
*  style better
*  We gotta go see is he
*  What have we got a show talk to your boy?
*  We might have to do is take a test. How about I take a test?
*  There's no way to take a test without shoving that fucking thing all the way down my nose now the new one
*  What's the one just a little q-tip?
*  It just barely goes in the inside of your nose and then done and then you're done. Yeah, I haven't taken a test
*  I've taken seven of them. I think and you're passing yeah every one of them. Yeah, I don't know dude
*  I don't I don't know I don't think I yeah, maybe I got it. I don't maybe I take vitamins no never no hmm
*  I
*  Yeah, I don't know I think I got like I don't know like I know I was over it say again
*  How well do you eat? I don't know I just eat in the morning you see
*  Yeah, I just I don't eat a lot of bread and I don't need a lot of refined sugar none
*  I try to cut them all out. That's good. Yeah, my girls an amazing cook, so she throws it down
*  Oh there you go, and then yes, I'm healthy. I'm healthy. Yeah, I try to exercise, but like I
*  Did it you know I was like super
*  Put the lotion on the hands and cover everything up for like maybe a couple weeks, and I was like now
*  It's not gonna happen. I was nervous. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie in the beginning
*  We so when did you stop care? I knew I knew the moment I stopped Karen well
*  I got my first test I took my first test like
*  Maybe three two three weeks in yeah, everybody was clear. I was like alright. We're all good
*  Yeah, my whole family was good, and then I started testing everybody in here
*  Yeah, and then I knew eight people that got it yeah, and the eight people that got it everyone was fine except for Michael
*  Yo, Michael. Yo got it pretty bad. Yeah, but
*  In the interest of telling the whole story if anybody ever have heard this already
*  I'm sorry, but Michael Yo flew all the way to New York
*  No sleep does fucking press does radiology did two shows did choose two shows the next day flies back home no rest
*  Gets in a car drives to Vegas to see his wife's family hangs out there for a little bit drives home same night
*  Next day auditions next day after that more auditions
*  So you got no sleep worn out a lot of travel stress stress stress and then audition stress and then boom it hits them
*  Mm-hmm, and it hit him and it hit him pretty bad
*  And then he got on advil and he said that once he took at started taking advil it fucking spiked
*  And he got real bad wound up being hospitalized meanwhile his mother got it
*  And she was all she's in her 70s. I believe yeah
*  Kicked it in a day. Yeah one day cuz she wasn't traveling she wasn't wearing herself out. She eats healthy whatever whatever the reason is
*  I'm I firmly and he also had deficient vitamin D. He that was a problem with with Michael. Yeah, I think
*  Mike just caught the perfect storm of being tired
*  He felt like he might have been run down already like maybe he had a little bit of a cold
*  Yeah, then got the cove it yeah and got the code with a bunch of his friends, and I think they were all fine
*  Yeah, they all got it. They got sick a little bit, but then they walked it off
*  Yeah, I think that's the case, but he got it real bad
*  Yeah, he's the only one that I know they got it real bad. Yeah, everybody
*  I know that got it they they got sick they coughed a little bit and then after a while it was over
*  Yeah, it's just tricky. You just don't want to kill your dad
*  You want to kill your mom like that's really what it comes down to like I don't give a fuck for we we said like
*  The guys that that they work with me we all basically said you know if one of us gets it
*  We all get it. Yeah, and that was the thing we just have work on the house right like yeah
*  You know just white boy fun. You know
*  The other thing is with Mike on a bowl on a bowl like spitting each other's mouth while you're riding a bowl
*  That's white boy shit. Yeah, one of the things they were saying is that the kids yeah
*  They were like my kids they were like you know we don't know they're ever gonna be able to go back to school again
*  Might have to do remote schooling and all this different my kids aren't even getting sick yeah, and if they do get sick
*  It's not very many of them meanwhile. You don't shut down shit. Yeah flu and the flu kills kids
*  Yeah, this disease kills an
*  Incredibly small number of children. It's always a tragedy when a kid dies obviously yeah, so it's not like we're saying
*  That those kids don't count right but to say that it's dangerous for kids
*  It's dangerous for a very small number of kids
*  Yeah, very very small the flu is dangerous for all kids the flu fucking kills kids right
*  You don't test these teachers to see if they have the flu you don't test the secure
*  You don't test people you tell if they have the flu stay home. Yeah, get the flu all the fucking time
*  Yeah, and last year in America sixty one thousand people died from it from yeah
*  So more people died from kovat. Yeah, I don't know how many more
*  I don't know. I don't know I mean the I think that the number they're attributing it to to it is 110 now
*  110,000, but I don't know if that's more or less than the real number because they're wondering like how are they are people dying of?
*  Kovat that they're not counting are people dying of other things that counting it as kovat
*  Yeah, there's a lot of dispute as to what the real number is. Let's say it's accurate. Yeah a hundred and ten
*  It's basically less than twice as bad as a bad flu
*  I don't think that's enough to shut down the fucking economy. Yeah, I think people need to take
*  Make good choices, but meanwhile they don't say a word about taking care of yourself
*  Not a word not a word about don't drink so much not a word about don't eat sugar. No word get your sleep
*  Yeah, here's how important sleep is to your immune system. Not a word
*  Yeah, what do you think? What do you think changes? What do you think doesn't recover after this?
*  But you think people are fucked. I think people go right back
*  They will go right back but the restaurants don't have the money to stay open
*  Oh, yeah, so like businesses that operate on the fringe. Yeah, I've done like the businesses are like, alright
*  I got money this month. We can stay open
*  I think they they operate in a world that never considered that we could have some sort of calamity like this
*  Well, that was what Janet the owner of Felix was saying is that most these restaurants they operate on you know
*  They make like 14% profit. Yeah, that's like what they operate on if you shut them down for three months
*  Yeah fucked. Yeah, and some of them don't even operate well that well, though. They're operating on 4% profit, right?
*  You know, they're barely making it they're barely getting by they're not doing so well. Yeah, it's like yeah Corona exposed
*  pre-existing conditions both physically and
*  Economically, you're right. Like if your business had these pre-existing conditions you are barely surviving Corona's cutting you out of there
*  You're right. I think that's I keep on looking at like TV
*  You know like you see all these like shows going to being filmed in their home and it's like oh
*  Jimmy Fallon like found all these guys they're doing in their home now and it's like weird not only so weird
*  It's like without all the lights. Yeah without all the makeup
*  How about no without the laughs the laugh tracks all of a sudden it looks real elementary, right?
*  And and people kept hitting us out that you were so gracious
*  We post all the stuff and like for me when I saw everybody come to YouTube I was like, oh it's a home game now
*  Like you can't go to the studio and we had the studio built and my guys were like timing me your studio perfect timing
*  Bro
*  It was and if I if I did explain to anybody why I was gonna build a studio prior to all this they'd be like
*  You're the stupidest guy with money. I've ever heard in my entire life
*  No, they didn't say it
*  But if I explained like how much money I spent on the studio and I had zero way of making the money back
*  Because I never think I know this is bad like investment strategy
*  But I never go if I put this in now ten years later
*  All I go is I really want to do this and if I love this enough
*  I'll find a way to make money on it, right?
*  My whole life
*  If you're investing in fucking companies that you have no clue what they are
*  Maybe you do it other way, but if you're investing the shit that you love
*  It will work out it sounds stupid we sound like Gary Vee, but you know what?
*  It works because you're chasing what you really enjoy
*  you know that if you build a studio you'll get to do some of the clips like these things that you're putting up on Instagram and
*  It's what you really enjoy dude. It is it was so cool
*  It was so cool just to see everybody come in and it was like, you know
*  You know in the super movie superhero movies were like the super villain loses their powers
*  And then has to fight like fight the hero and like even playing grounds and it's like, oh, this is what we're doing now
*  It's over because I really I really genuinely believe and it's a pain the end like it's hard work putting out the pieces man
*  It shouts to my guys who do an amazing job mark Agnon comic
*  He writes it with me and
*  In the back Alex match all the shit you're talking about. Yeah, and you know, we stole the
*  John Oliver graphics or like background where they go
*  It's no not where they go but like the the image like the imagery in the background
*  We literally just looked at every show or like alright, who's the best and we're like we want to look just like them
*  So they compare us immediately
*  It was like I want the smoke right now it's like now for once you guys gotta fucking compete with me
*  You know, you gotta do it grassroots. We're in the fucking jungle. It's just YouTube clips. It's just a few guys making it
*  You're unshackled. I
*  Like the prolific use of the word retard is a perfect example. Yes unshackled you can you could basically say whatever you want to be funny
*  Yeah, cuz who's canceling me? Yeah, I'm strong. Yeah, I'm strong. First of all, it has to be a television show keep going
*  This is interesting. Yeah, it has to be a television show which has advertising
*  So it has to be even though he's on the internet now essentially means doing it from his home from a webcam
*  You still have to do it under the same FCC restrictions. You don't have to do that your buck wild
*  Put it on YouTube and putting those clips up on Instagram not only FCC
*  Constrictions DNC constrictions, you know what you gotta say. Yeah, you know you got to the company line
*  You know, it's like yes, you have affiliations
*  Honestly, I really believe the reason why our shit blew up so quick outside of you reposting it obviously that's magnificent
*  Thank you so much. But like keep doing it. I'm 100% keep posting that we will I really believe and I think it's a similar effect to
*  What happened with you guys which was?
*  We just said the truth
*  Obviously in a funny way
*  It's five minutes jam-packed a fucking laser beam
*  Somebody who needed some bars this week someone who needed to be told that they're fucking idiots, right?
*  but we said
*  the truth doesn't have a party and
*  If we just find truth and I'm not talking about statistics or any that kind of shit
*  I'm literally talking about gut feeling funny shit. What's funny look at Biden. Yes, you're not going this is a president, right?
*  Right, you're not going you're not saying that at all. No, so it was like and is and I'm just sitting here
*  I'm going is nobody fucking talking about this like I'll message some guys that work for CNN
*  I won't say their names, but I'll just DM my big bro. I appreciate your support. You're great. You're sweet. Is he senile?
*  They'll say yes, and I'm like, why aren't you saying on a fucking TV?
*  Because they want him to win no matter what I know so everybody's Trump. This is the thing with the
*  What I was saying with like corporations and comedy
*  What do we do as comics we make fun of the absurd the fucking ass the asinine we make fun of institutions
*  That's what we do right you and I will be out there
*  We'll be fucking playing pool and we'll be thinking about these institutions that we want to give justice to in a weird way
*  We give justice with words, right? Well, like you're not gonna get away with it. And that's what we operate
*  We operate in the space like oh, no, you're not getting away with it, right? But right now there's such a cost
*  For saying the wrong things even in your friend group even your friend group
*  So what we basically said is we sit down we're like, okay, I know I feel this way about something
*  We're gonna construct an argument around this thing that is true. That is so solid
*  Yeah, I don't care if you're on the left or the right you cannot refute it right and it's fucking painstaking
*  Yes, but it works and if the coolest thing is seeing these people on the left and the right
*  Watch this clip both find it funny and both agree and you realize
*  99% of us are not left or right. There's one fucking issue that takes us over. We're literally in the middle
*  Watching these idiots on either side of the extreme say stupid shit. We don't give a fuck about
*  99% of the right here and a lot of us in the middle night
*  Okay, 90% in the middle and then abortion might take us left or right but the rest of stuff or yeah the economy
*  There's a few things but the thing about the Biden thing that made it so maddening is it's not like he's the only one
*  It's not like they didn't have a lot about the candidates
*  It's not like there wasn't a lot of other people that could have put in office that people would have voted for over Trump
*  Including Bernie because guess what right now don't get me started Bernie was running right now
*  If Bernie was still in the heat right now, he could have won, you know
*  you know the the term a lot of people are saying like
*  Don't talk about the good cops because if they were good, they would have called out the bullshit right? Right? Yeah, that's Bernie to me
*  In a lot of ways, right?
*  Bernie is and I fucking support it Bernie man and not because I agree with his policies at all
*  I just thought he genuinely wanted to help he didn't want to win
*  He seemed like he wanted to help and I was like I'll support a guy that wants to help
*  What was the bill that he didn't show up to vote for? I don't know. There was something Jamie
*  What was that thing that had to do with it was in the Patriot Act?
*  It was a new revision that everybody was freaking out all the progressives like Bernie didn't even show up for this
*  Like that this is really important. It was it had something to do with surveillance. What does it have to do with?
*  Put it up
*  Okay, but check this out man. Yeah, if you want to be mad at him more
*  Well Senate voted to let the government keep surveilling your online life without a warrant. Yeah, so for this, yeah
*  Failed by just one vote and it was Bernie that what didn't show up. There's like three people
*  Here's the thing. Here's the thing with Bernie that I'll say. Okay. Hold on a second
*  Many senators wanted to forbid the government from secretly collecting information about your internet habits
*  But an amendment failed by just one mo meaning if Bernie was there
*  He could have made that thing fail could have stopped it, but he didn't yep. He didn't
*  That is fucked up look two others Ben Sasse and Bernie Sanders
*  Didn't respond to requests for comment on where they were during the vote. Yeah
*  Couldn't vote because he's quarantined what so one guy said he couldn't vote Lamar Alexander couldn't vote because he's quarantined
*  Why didn't they just ask him? Hey Lamar can we get you on video? How you voting? Yeah or nay?
*  Yeah, why do you need to be in the room? Right and then Bernie didn't show up and they didn't respond to a request for comment on where
*  They were during this important vote that
*  That's like exactly what you were talking about
*  This is another great example the most egregious example to me is you got ass raped by the DNC twice
*  twice they bent you over no saliva and
*  Fucked you and you didn't say shit
*  Just fucking say it dude now granted. You weren't good enough
*  Trump is an example of someone who was good enough to beat the party that didn't want him to be there
*  Right like nobody in the Republican Party wanted Trump to win right right
*  But then they all eventually got behind it because you tell the company line whatever
*  He wasn't good enough and also the Democrats have systems that don't allow that shit, you know
*  These super delegates and all this bullshit, right? It's sneaky. I love it when the Democrats talk about why do we why do we need to?
*  Abolish the Electoral College. What about your primary?
*  Before it's like it's crazy, but but the thing is like you could have done it man. You had the opportunity
*  Well, how about the fact that they all backed off at the same time and
*  Set his ass up bet yeah, yeah for super Tuesday
*  But call that out dude, yeah call that shit out. Yeah, he's not that guy
*  I mean, I don't know. I mean he seemed like a really nice guy when I met him and talked to him
*  I think he's maybe too nice the but the fact that he didn't vote against that though
*  Yeah, the ability to just surveil you anytime they want without a warrant without a warrant. Yeah, it's weird
*  I mean, I assume they're looking at all our shit anyway, of course for you. They're definitely your shit
*  You think 100% why you say that cuz you're funny
*  You've got a lot of influence talk a lot of shit
*  Yeah, I mean if somebody watches your video on Joe Biden, it's very possible. They might not vote for him. That's real
*  Interesting for sure looks at man. This is a meme society. Yeah barely paying attention
*  if you're if you get into that box, yeah, and and you
*  Had you started thinking about some of the funny punchlines you had in that Joe Biden video come on man people
*  I said fuck that dude. I voted for Trump. Yeah, that's real possible man
*  Especially like the Midwest the areas look in California. It's not gonna matter in New York
*  It's not gonna matter people vote blue no matter who but when you get to those middle states
*  Swing either way who fucking knows but you don't find it weird dude that like there's no
*  Fair
*  Comedy in this lane and by fair I'm not trying to say that people aren't unfair like I think
*  you know Trevor and John are really good, you know like an SNL in these places, but like I
*  I know what they're gonna say before they say it right like I know the opinion before they say it right
*  So doesn't that take away some of the most necessary
*  Component to comedy which is surprise
*  Well, it's what Dennis Miller did back when Bush was president right do you remember that now?
*  You do wouldn't make fun of him said I'm giving a pass. He's my friend
*  You get these bars, bro, everybody gets these bars. That's that's what you gotta do. You gotta write the ecosystem. That's what I hate
*  Over inflating our importance as comics because I know a lot of people can do that
*  But I really think we're here to manage the ecosystem. Well, you know in other cultures
*  It's actually an important function like in the Lakota and the Lakota Indians. They had a thing called a hey, okay
*  Yeah, and a he'll go was a guy who made fun of everything. There's a clown who's a country
*  Contrarian yeah mocked all the important things. Yeah, and they they were like
*  They mean that's my tour is called sacred clown tour for that reason why yeah, it's like that's what heoka means
*  Yeah to the Lakota people. It's a sacred crowd. They understand the important secret crowd a sacred clown
*  Yeah, someone who makes fun of important things because it's important anything that you can't make fun of is bullshit
*  Yeah, you can't make fun of it. Yeah, like like if you say
*  You know the Lord's name in vain. Yeah, you can't say that don't say god damn it. Like really. Mm-hmm
*  Like what what are you saying? Like why can't I say it? What what what is it about?
*  Not being able to say things. What is it? Well people have power of you
*  Yeah, tell you that you can't say those things and whether it's talking about certain subjects or using certain words
*  It's all the same thing. It's people enforcing their ability to call you out and have control over you
*  but that and that's the thing where it's like if you wear comedy and institutions are tricky because
*  You can't make fun of the institution you're in
*  Right, right. So you have to make fun of the opposite institution
*  Even if you don't necessarily believe that way, right? So all these institutions tend to be left-leaning
*  They only are allowed to make fun of the opposite institution
*  Right. So we here we came in literally just in the middle and going
*  Oh, yeah, the joke is actually right wing this today or like yeah, the topics actually left wing
*  We balance side by side, but it's not
*  It's not based on what the institution wants us to be a part of it's literally based on what the joke is and what the
*  Best version of joke is and what is what I guess I would call like truthful
*  What is the truth like I want to make the argument so you're not fucking scared to talk to your friends about how you feel
*  But if you tried to pull that shit off on NBC, they would pull you aside dog
*  This is you they would have a little conversation with you. This is it's it drives me crazy man. It's like
*  honestly
*  Maybe it's in popular opinion. I don't know. It's like
*  I'm really impressed with with like Trevor and John's
*  John's got great writing bro
*  They're great. John is John is is is really great. The writing is really great and it's produced well
*  But I'm impressed that they even do it
*  like
*  imagine like move into another country and
*  Then immediately making fun of half the country that you've never even visited
*  You got some fucking balls
*  Like if I moved to England and I lived in London and just trashed northern England on a TV show
*  Would that be I would never feel comfortable doing that. I'd be like, I don't know enough about y'all and like that's weird for me
*  Just do this for a living guys
*  That's not weird to you. It's weird. Like how accepting is America?
*  We just let people just come and just track half you never lived in Alabama is Alabama's a punchline
*  Have you ever lived in Alabama?
*  Arkansas's a punchline. Have you lived there?
*  You know, it's just shocking to me that you could feel comfortable doing that and then I hear all these jokes about like
*  Calling out the greed like conservative greed and it's like you guys could make tons of money in your own countries
*  But you came here because you wanted more
*  It you wanted more money
*  That's definitely true I'm just saying dude it's just but it's also everybody knows our politics
*  Like our politics are global like you go to Australia. They make fun of our president
*  Yeah, no fucking idea the president of Australia is it's kind of different in that way
*  And it's other thing the other thing that's an issue is we get hoodwinked by salesmen
*  With British accents every time keep going
*  Whatever it is watch late-night TV when someone's trying to sell you a fucked-up mop that you don't really need that
*  They're doing it through an English accent. They have a British accent
*  They have some sort of an accent. It makes them think they are superior. It is look at this product
*  It's an amazing thing. Look at what it does. It's a radio. It's a blender
*  It's a fantastic accent whether it's yeah, whether it's David Attenborough. Yeah
*  Narrating some the guy talks about Beatles. Yeah, like they're the most fascinating thing
*  You don't want a guy from Brooklyn talking about chimps
*  You don't want a guy from Philly talking about tuna this fucking tuna
*  This is a bonobo it fucks its sister these tunas are out there these gigantic pecs
*  Yeah, women around even if they're saying all the right words
*  You don't want them sounding like that even if they're saying super intelligent shit with any kind of an East Coast accent
*  Sounds dumb as fuck. Yeah, same as southern, right?
*  Someone says some like super intelligent shit about the ocean the ecosystem, but they say it with a southern accent
*  Yeah, same words yeah British accent we're all in yeah, so if someone is mocking our culture
*  What better way than a culture that's known in to be very proper?
*  So you think it's by design they're like people will trust these opinions more because it's coming from these guys
*  Who have this accent that has equity? Yes
*  Interesting there's definitely something to that, you know
*  Because look they could have hired Al magical to run a daily show they could have hired a lot of other people that it
*  Would have been amazing at that job. I think John Oliver is great. I really do
*  I think he does a show is something funny about the way he attacks things the show is is is really well done
*  Yes, the show is writing too. Yeah, it's the second best show after ours. It's really good
*  But it's there they're saddled down by the fact that they're on HBO
*  like if you're in that liberal establishment, yeah, you're in that like
*  There's weird conversations that are had where people aren't looking at the jokes that are about the left
*  They're not gonna make fun of Hillary. They're not gonna make fun of Joe Biden
*  Yeah, they're not gonna make fun of Nancy Pelosi or any other prominent liberal
*  They're not gonna do it even if the joke is there. So what's the point? Well, it's weird, right?
*  It's the fucking point is when you see it in the news, right? Like the difference between the way they covered
*  Women that had allegations against Trump versus women that have had allegations versus Joe Biden
*  Yeah, very different very different the way they cover it. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's true. Yeah, there is that there's that like obvious bias
*  I guess maybe it's because like I was looking up like news organizations
*  I think like back in the day everybody knew that they were bias like you just knew like like like like late
*  1700s to like early 1800s
*  I think they even like enacted a law that said you couldn't criticize
*  The president or his views or something like that in the press, but well, that's how it is in China
*  I mean, yeah journalists have fucking been ghosted in China. Oh really? Oh my god. Yeah, they people disappear
*  Hundreds of journalists they just disappear. Yeah, dude, they don't fuck around in China
*  Yeah, so then why can't they close down the bat thing?
*  Well, they I hate that they make this argument that they have control of everything and everybody can get killed
*  It's like well, you can't just close the market where they sell the penguins
*  First of all, they did kinda and then they open back up and make a leak
*  But but if you listen to them, I don't listen to them
*  I don't think they're telling truth
*  But their story is that only 30,000 people died
*  Now if you think about the hundred and ten thousand people that died here and then in China you're talking about literally a billion people
*  Come on, bro. Yeah, I don't buy it. Come on, bro. I just it's just it's a weird time man
*  It's like and I'm surprised these corporations don't get it
*  Like when you see platforms like this which literally let people speak and they have different opinions in different points of view
*  And you see the entire world gravitate towards it because we're addicted to truth. Yeah, like we like truth
*  We like to confirm our bias. We like even more of the truth
*  You know, I mean like there's a reason why conspiracies are so fun, right?
*  Cuz we're like wait a minute. Is that the truth? Like what's going on in here?
*  I want to really know like deep down. Don't you really want to know what's going on? You want to know how all this shit works?
*  Oh, yeah, you know, so it's like it's exciting. Yeah, man. It's also people like to solve puzzles
*  That's why that you go and you know, you play games. Hmm
*  People want to win. Yeah, I solve things if I can catch you being a lizard person behind the scenes
*  Look at that the fucking world's flat. I knew it. Yeah the evidence. I'm gonna send you some evidence man
*  I'm telling you my change my here's a lot of people that want to tell you about things
*  Yeah, you know, I got a dude just sent me a Bigfoot thing the other day smart guy
*  Leaves in Bigfoot. Yeah, Charlemagne believes in Bigfoot. Does he 100% Yeah. Well, it used to be a real thing
*  Well, that's the problem. Yeah, it used to be gigantopithecus. They've actually found bones of a large
*  Bipedal hominid that lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago
*  So it lived alongside of people and they found fossilized bones in China in the 1920s
*  That this there was an anthropologist that visited this apothecary shop and he found these bones that were
*  Primate bones much larger than any primate bone
*  He never seen before and so they said where'd you get this and they took them to the site and they started digging up
*  Bones and so they know it was a real animal that was they think it was very orangutan like but it was huge
*  You never heard of it before never heard of it show the the picture of
*  Gigantopithecus
*  Well, here's where it gets even crazier yeah, this animal lived in Asia
*  Asia is connected by the Bering Strait
*  And that's what you see that's what it the northwest see
*  Go to
*  Which one that one right there you would just we just add it a little bit about right there bang. Perfect. Look at that
*  That's what it would have looked like. Yeah, so that is a you know a recreation, but you're talking about a bipedal animal
*  That's eight to ten feet tall and it was an enormous primate
*  With like, you know a bigfoot looking face man, just go to that picture just make that picture bigger that motherfucker was bigfoot
*  I mean, yeah
*  So the reason why there's all these stories these myths is that as recently as a hundred thousand years ago
*  That was a real thing. So people definitely saw that thing walking around
*  Yeah, so they probably talked about it in folklore and in stories and who knows what the fuck that thing even ate
*  I mean it might have eight people we don't know. I don't know
*  I mean, there's a lot of primates that eat other primates like chimps eat the fuck out of monkeys really
*  David Attenborough, you want to watch? Yeah, okay pull up the David Attenborough. They hunt they hunt monkeys. They corral them in
*  It's the most ruthless shit because there's video this champ eating a monkey while it's alive
*  No, it's holding on to the monkey and biting its hips and just pulling chunks of meat while the monkeys screaming like
*  like his little
*  Primate face screaming while this monkey is eating them alive. I thought that they do like ants on a stick
*  I do everything they can eat. They're omnivorous means they mean they eat everything huh? They're like humans. Yeah, omnivores
*  Yeah meat they vegetables they fruit
*  But they didn't figure this out until the 1990s Attenborough was doing this documentary and there it is
*  So these trackers took him and they show how the monkeys are
*  Just the one
*  There is okay, okay, that's that is a champ eating a monkey this one is on the forest floor
*  I think the one I saw was in a tree
*  That was the monkey's hand
*  This is the this is the video so
*  It's just really dark shit man because they they chase these monkeys and the monkeys get scared
*  They're trying to figure it out and they're trying to run away
*  But the chimps are bigger and stronger and they corral them in and so once they get them man
*  They they're tearing them apart. It's horrible to watch. Yeah
*  You see there see now they're the monkeys trying to get away
*  Mm-hmm, and this is the footage of the monkey trying to escape and the chimp comes chasing after them and grabs them
*  And now once you grab them, it's rough, bro, they get they kill babies everything they eat them all so he grabs them
*  So he's got them there
*  See that shit, so he's gonna pull him down and then once the chimp has the monkey
*  He gets to a spot where he can eat and I think they fight over who gets to eat the monkey and then
*  Eventually he wins. But look he's got this monkey in his hand and he's gonna just gonna pull it apart
*  It's rough man
*  The when when you see them eating it like look here it is, that's all
*  We'd have to get Jamie the right video in advance because there's probably hundreds of them out there
*  But there's one that came from that show that's really rough to watch because this monkey is alive and awake
*  Yeah, this champ is biting them and pulling them apart. Yeah, but anyway, yeah, you got it. Yeah, here it is
*  So here's she's grabbing it. Look. Oh
*  Dude
*  So this is one where they're just pulling it apart but there's there's a great one where the the monkey is fucking screaming
*  Yeah, it's hardcore man. How do we get onto this?
*  I
*  Don't know something
*  Gigantopithecus might eat people that's what it was. Thank you, Jamie and why were we on gigantic? Oh, it's real
*  Charlemagne believes in Bigfoot. Oh, yeah
*  As a real thing, but here's the thing. Yeah that thing eat people
*  I don't know if a chimp can eat a monkey like that. Yeah, why wouldn't that thing eat a person or the monkeys?
*  Yeah, it's everything you can't monkeys to that thing's so big if that thing was
*  Omnivorous and I don't think they know if it's an herbivore. I mean they didn't even know chimps were like again till the 90s
*  Yeah, this is just so all this shit is so odd
*  Like the deeper you go down the rabbit hole the more you know, the less you understand, man
*  So where you see Bigfoot like if you're one of them Bigfoot freaks in the north, it's all the north west
*  Yeah, the northwest. Yeah, it's all that mean there's sightings all over the country, but that's just people are full predominantly over there
*  I think most of it was in that spot. Yeah, I mean that's a rainforest up there the Pacific Northwest is so dense
*  I bet it probably lived there for a long time. You know and I died off
*  that's all you need you need like a shred of truth for stuff like I remember when I was a I
*  Was in Egypt right and I texted you when I was in because I watch every one of your fuck
*  I'm going to Cairo to like see the pyramids, right and I realized I haven't even really researched the pyramids
*  So I do this deep dive and I'm watching like Graham Hancock Hancock and there's another guy
*  That you had a Carlson. Dr. Robert shock. Maybe that was it
*  I don't know, but like I'm just watching the shock is the geologist that he was the one passed recently or something
*  No, no, he's still Oh John Anthony West West. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's the he's the godfather of it all
*  yeah, and
*  I'm this I watch I'm watching everything. I'm obsessed and
*  we go and we check them out and
*  It was the single most like
*  Unbelievable thing I've ever seen it makes you like question reality of it really
*  Yeah, like I get why people go Oh aliens in the same way like have you ever seen the northern lights?
*  No, I haven't but like you see them in real life and you're like, oh shit. What's going on?
*  I got all right. Yeah, like it's believable and when I see them Alaska
*  Yeah, yeah, I just go on just to see them. No, I did comedy. Yeah, not in Anchorage the other city
*  Juno, no, it's like a little military sit Fairbanks Fairbanks really far north. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, what do you get? What time of the year was it? Uh, I don't know cold
*  I really don't know I forget but maybe like maybe fall
*  You know, it has to be like the winter time, right? I don't think it was winter
*  I would have I would remember if it was like cold cold
*  Oh, I think in fall if it gets cold enough you can see him
*  So I'm one day the second I landed is it right after the airport
*  Just fascinating in the same way that with the pyramids like I remember watching them and I'm like, okay
*  This question is reality like things are different now and I remember reading or watching the videos and one guy said like time
*  Is it or like human progression isn't linear and that was the coolest argument I've heard for it
*  Yes, the idea that like a society could
*  pop up
*  Be somewhat insulated. So they had tons of time and like wealth and I guess wealth would be in resources back then develop technology
*  die out
*  That technology never goes to anybody else
*  It just exists and then dies and then a few thousand years later another group of people end up going there like oh
*  It's some cool shit. I'll hang out right and that is the most reasonable explanation for me
*  Yeah
*  They were building on that old stuff and trying to figure out how they did it and do their version of it
*  Yeah, there's there's a bunch of different very distasteful instruction style
*  Like isn't that how we are as like humans like okay, the Empire State Building is in this neighborhood. That's a cool building
*  Yeah, I want to go building over there. How the fuck they do this. I want to hang out
*  It's cool. And he broke it down his adoption
*  He was like that specific spot is that there's an impenetrable forest on one side and there's a desert on the other side
*  And there's a river that when it overflows just fruit and vegetables just are sprouting out of the ground
*  It's like oh, this is how you would be able to have the wealth and time
*  Yes to develop cool shit like of course we're developing cool shit in America because
*  We're not busy fighting motherfuckers in our country right all the time like yeah
*  Elon can develop all these cool things drill a hole in the ground why I was got nothing else to do right?
*  We're not in war. We're not fucking we're here right like if you were at war constantly
*  How could you develop right and they were free for like thousands of years thousands of course you develop cool shit
*  You'll find like I'm not talking about like internet, but obviously cool water technology
*  I mean it completely is plausible
*  But how they describe it no way and you know it's not the same human beings because Cairo is a dump
*  Like Cairo is so awful that there's no way that the people who made
*  Cairo also made the pyramid which is perfect
*  It's unreal dude
*  Half a year it was unbelievable. That was a different time
*  I mean look at this the structures man look I can imagine seeing them in real life look how small the people are compared
*  Goddamn, that's big. I mean you just can't fathom it
*  That's a big fucking building and what's crazy is it used to be covered in smooth limestone
*  Mm-hmm, but they these fucking people that built Cairo they pilfered all that shit
*  Yeah, they broke all the chunks off of it to build other cool things. Yeah, this was a cool little trip
*  That's Morocco. I think no is it what was
*  Did you feel safe one into the streets there was it a little sketch?
*  I didn't do a lot of wandering and my girl with me also so that's always like a different
*  Yeah, a different thing and it's like
*  Yeah, I was told I had a guy who I knew there's a comic that was out there
*  And he's like I'll show you around so we did that with that comic in Egypt
*  Well, he's a comic in New York
*  Funny guys having a hard time getting controversial jokes to go over not gonna happen
*  Not gonna happen did kill you quick. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, we're really lucky like oh, yeah the shit we complain that we can't say. Mm-hmm is really funny
*  You just did see this is the thing like because we're not on a network that's controlled by some sort of a business
*  Yeah, the worries one way or another right this business worries when people aren't controversial because then the podcast don't do well
*  They're boring want chaos. Yeah, like, you know, well chaos is the is the antidote. I mean, that's the
*  Also, you know what we're saying, you know, we're not talking about people like if you're if you're on this podcast
*  You're you're saying things to be funny. Yeah, that's what you're doing
*  Yeah, if you're making points you're making interesting points that you think there's a really a valid
*  Valid, you know
*  Perception of something that you've established and there's also talking shit. That's talking shit talking shit is fun
*  Judge me by my intent not your interpretation. Yeah, what did I intend to do? Yeah, I intend to just fucking make us laugh. Exactly
*  That's all us. That's the problem with banning a word like retard like sometimes it's not nice to say it about someone with a disease
*  But it's not nice to let someone keep making YouTube videos about the world being flat either without saying to him. Hey, man
*  That's fucking retarded. That's what that is
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it's not it's not a disease it is a slow
*  Form of learn you you're slowing learning. Yeah, so we're calling people slow using people
*  Yeah, too because people watch those videos and no one's interrupting you while you're making those videos
*  Yeah, so it can make sense. Yeah, you're articulate and smooth and use a lot of big words
*  Yeah, show a lot of faulty science. Yeah, people can go. Oh my god. I can't believe all these years
*  I've been lied to yeah. Yeah, there's a bunch of people out there
*  Look at hashtag space is fake
*  No, you want to see a failure of the American educational system? Yeah, Google hashtag space is fake and start reading
*  Reading on YouTube and Instagram and fucking Twitter all these knuckleheads that really think that space is fake, right?
*  Space is fake. It's not really the moon. It's not really
*  260,000 miles away or whatever the fuck it is. Yeah, look hashtag space is fake
*  Let's say for example, I'm so many of them coincidence. Let's say for example, the world is flat, right?
*  Let's give them that so dumb
*  But if it is
*  So what?
*  Well, I mean you still gotta go to work like before though about conspiracy theories about we like them they're fun
*  You want to solve the puzzle and if you listen, let's be honest most of the people look to some people
*  They just love conspiracy theory. Yeah, but most of the people they get really attached to some of the really dumb ones
*  They don't they're not doing so well in life
*  Okay, they're not they're not they're not thriving. They're they're they're knuckleheads
*  Yeah, and knuckleheads get attached to these certain kinds of ideas
*  Yeah, and then if they could just prove that all this is bullshit
*  It doesn't matter how well you're doing right just a fucking world. They've been lying to us man
*  Yeah, the stars are not really stars. Yeah, the lanterns being hung from some ceiling. It's like
*  Look man, you could you can go deep on this and find people that are of varying levels of intelligence
*  Yeah, I believe dumber and dumber things but you'll tap in a some conspiracy stuff, right? Oh, okay. So yeah. Yeah
*  So what do you what do you go into and you're like I kind of buy some of this I
*  Want to know what the deep state really is can can we tell them what I texted you?
*  So there's no sports so I have nothing else so I just start getting into conspiracies and every time I think I'm going
*  Too far. I like text Joe and I remember I texted you was I was like, I was like, bro
*  What do you think about this? Tom Hanks is a pedophile stuff
*  I think you called me. I think you were so concerned. You just called me like dude. What are you? What are you reading?
*  He was going pump the fucking breaks for whatever reason on the internet
*  Became a thing to write in Tom Hanks's comments the photo that he's a pedophile dude, I don't know what start
*  Do you know what started that? I?
*  Think it was this pizza. I don't know what happened, but someone like sent me something
*  I get I start going in on it and then I remember I came across something
*  It was like yeah, and that's why him and his wife Rita Wilson have have coronavirus or something
*  I was like and I remember going to you and I was like his his wife's last name really Wilson and like yeah
*  I'm like like the fucking volleyball
*  I'm like what is happening right now?
*  I was like dude what's going on?
*  That's the problem with conspiracy
*  That's how it works bro
*  That's how it works
*  That's how it fucking works you almost lost me dude
*  Or we could be in the matrix
*  Keep going we could be in a simulation
*  If there is a simulation one day it's going to be impossible to tell they're going to get it to a point
*  Have you ever done any VR? You ever fucked with VR?
*  Dude I bought the sets
*  I saw you got the Oculus out there got the same one
*  Yeah obsessed
*  It's pretty amazing right?
*  It is
*  It's the pyramids
*  That's the second thing that I saw in my life
*  The VR headsets were the second thing I saw was like this makes me question reality
*  It's crazy
*  Dude picking up the things that's nuts
*  Picking up the fake gun or picking up the ball throwing it
*  I watched that Alex Honnold thing you know the guy who like climbs with no ropes or whatever free solo
*  There's a five minute version you could watch on the VR
*  And you're up there with him
*  You're up there with him looking down
*  Oh my god
*  It's unreal
*  I can't do that one I get sweaty hands just watching his videos
*  Oh yeah
*  Like watching a YouTube video literally makes my hands start perspiring
*  I'm afraid of heights big time
*  He's so calm it's crazy
*  Something's off right?
*  He's really nice man super normal like when you talk to him nothing seems off at all
*  No like
*  He seems like a guy who enjoys the challenge
*  But like fear receptors or something like that
*  No because he's had moments
*  He's had some moments where he's like generally the only time where you should be freaked out is when something's going wrong
*  He goes most of the time it's really mellow
*  But he climbs this kind of shit
*  And that's too crazy
*  He's going this way man
*  He's going up at an angle
*  Yeah that's nuts
*  He's hard to handle
*  But go deep state
*  I don't know man I mean we were talking earlier about George Soros videos
*  All these people that think that someone's pulling the strings from behind the scenes
*  You know the more I see crazy shit like the Jeffrey Epstein thing
*  Where I mean again I don't watch much of the documentary because it was bumming me out
*  And those 17 year old girls talk about
*  Heavy heavy
*  And some of them are 11 and 12
*  Like what?
*  Heavy
*  12 year old girls
*  And he was purposely targeting them
*  But he also
*  Had Bill Clinton fly to his island 20 times
*  You know he had all these different people
*  Flew on his planes
*  He had all these celebrities
*  Hillary Flew there
*  All these scientists
*  All these actors
*  What is that? Who does that?
*  What's going on there?
*  Was there some grand scheme to compromise those people?
*  To get those people on his side?
*  Whose side is his side?
*  Who worked for him?
*  Of Bill Clinton in his foyer
*  Of his house
*  With a dress on
*  Like a woman
*  Like what better way to say
*  I fucking own you bitch
*  I own you bitch
*  My curiosity is this
*  And this is just from watching
*  I watch the thing and again I don't know a lot of people listening right now know way more about this
*  Like anytime I have questions it's either you or Tim Dillon
*  I call up Timmy and Timmy fucking goes in
*  Tim will go in forever
*  If you think what you see in the videos is any different than him you got another thing coming
*  He brought me a book the first time I met him
*  He came on the podcast a book on conspiracy theories
*  He's like we're trying to get you back in
*  We're trying to bring you back in there
*  But that's genuinely him
*  This is him
*  Unapologetically, authentically him
*  Great stuff go check out Tim if you guys haven't
*  But he was breaking down some interesting things
*  As far as this goes
*  I'm just watching this documentary
*  And it's blaming everything on Epstein
*  Okay this guy is the fucking criminal mastermind really
*  He's the criminal mastermind but he's doing all the secretarial shit
*  I can't believe that
*  And then they introduce this other guy
*  This like less Wexner guy
*  The guy that owns Victoria's Secret and that kind of stuff
*  And they introduce him quick
*  And they kind of make it seem
*  They go oh he was actually
*  I guess Epstein was like his only money manager or something like that
*  He managed his Wexner's money
*  And then there's a clip of Wexner going
*  You know I was tricked and I was manipulated
*  And like they have these other guys going
*  Oh my god Epstein is the most manipulative person in the world
*  He charms you so much
*  It's really setting it up like he tricked the billionaire into giving him tons of money
*  At the end
*  Of the documentary
*  This girl maybe you can get this picture up
*  The girl paints a picture and shows people
*  Last episode at the end
*  And she just painted a picture of her experience
*  There right
*  In the picture
*  It's her experience
*  All the things that were going on
*  All these like fucked up characters etc
*  They're talking about the picture
*  And they use this section where they talk about Epstein
*  Right? Epstein's off to the right
*  He's on a fucking UFO
*  He's not even centerfold in the picture
*  He's barely in the picture
*  Guylaine
*  The girl who's like his a comic
*  She's front and center
*  And then below her I believe is Wexner
*  And I'm like
*  That's weird why would you include this guy
*  In front and center
*  Of the picture but this guy over here
*  Epstein with this whole thing he's the criminal mastermind
*  He's doing all this kind of stuff
*  Is all by himself
*  That's weird
*  I would have to see it in the context of her story
*  I would have to see it in the context of her story
*  But yeah it is weird
*  All of it's weird though
*  Just the fact that there was a fuck island
*  How weird is that
*  But is that what they do?
*  But imagine if there was a movie
*  Imagine and in the movie
*  This guy would set up these freak parties
*  On these islands
*  And have all these guys fly in
*  Scientists, celebrities and bang
*  15 year olds
*  And film it and hold it against them
*  That was the worst
*  But if you saw a movie
*  You'd be like come on Bill Clinton's not gonna fly
*  20 times to a fucking island
*  He's got prostitutes
*  He's got girls he can call he must
*  If he needs it that bad
*  Is he really gonna fly to this fucking island
*  But if this guy was intelligence
*  And he let them think that they're safe
*  Don't worry
*  No one's gonna say a fucking word
*  Everyone's on board this is fine
*  You can let you freak out on this island
*  This is like the real Vegas
*  What happens on fuck island stays on fuck island
*  This is the real deal
*  That's what they want
*  Do you know how many of those guys
*  In the 60s and 70s politicians back then
*  Just did openly
*  Had affairs
*  Like Kennedy, openly
*  Everyone knew it, the press all knew it
*  How many guys were doing that?
*  How many mayors were doing that?
*  I bet a lot of them
*  I bet that's why they became a mayor
*  Or a fucking president in the first place
*  A lot of them wanted power
*  A lot of them are like these politicians are like ugly actors
*  They want to be an actor
*  But they're not good looking enough
*  They're not going to be righteous
*  And they pretend to be the guy who's going to solve the mess
*  The guy who's going to solve the problem
*  And in the meantime they're hobnobbing with
*  Industry and big bankers
*  And celebrities are coming to their inauguration
*  It's a big
*  It's a big influence
*  Someone explain this to me
*  Whoa is that just Lane?
*  How do you say her name?
*  I thought it was just Lane
*  How is she free?
*  So she's the lizard
*  But look who's front and fucking center
*  Dude what is going on?
*  Look at all the heads
*  That's a creepy ass picture
*  Where is Epstein?
*  Who's that guy with the blue shirt with the sandwich in his hand?
*  I don't know
*  Is that John Podesta?
*  I don't know
*  Look to the right though
*  No
*  He's in the fucking UFO dude
*  Top right you're telling me the criminal mastermind of all this
*  Is the fucking
*  Supporting act
*  You're in the top right
*  Just Lane or Gillen
*  Why is she front and center dog?
*  And why does she have a body of a lizard?
*  How weird is that?
*  She's got some creepy lizard body
*  I don't know
*  See this is my point
*  If you put this in a movie
*  Before all this shit had happened
*  You'd never believe it
*  I'd be like no one's that fucking manipulative
*  They can get all these politicians
*  To just fly to some island
*  And film them having sex with underage people
*  And if they did they'd get caught
*  Someone would rat it out
*  And then well they caught him
*  And they brought him to jail
*  And oh he just died he hung himself
*  Like what?
*  Where's the security cameras?
*  Well the security cameras weren't working
*  It's off
*  No one's talking about it
*  We just get swept away with the news cycle
*  New stuff, new things
*  This is the craziest thing about the Napsing thing
*  They literally took El Chapo
*  And put him in that jail
*  Because they're like
*  Nah something will happen to El Chapo
*  In Mexican jail
*  So we gotta put him in jail or something will definitely not happen
*  Super top secret security clearance
*  The best jail
*  The best possible jail
*  And then this guy just randomly
*  And the security cameras weren't working
*  Whoops no big deal
*  Meanwhile that Michael Baden guy the autopsy doctor
*  From HBO
*  The autopsy series
*  This is a guy who's worked on a bunch of high profile cases
*  He did the George Floyd case
*  He said the guy was murdered
*  The injuries
*  Well the injuries of
*  The Epstein injuries were indicative of being strangled
*  Because the bones in his neck
*  I was talking about Floyd but yeah
*  We did that as well
*  More doctors have done that as well with Floyd now
*  With George Floyd
*  It's clear you can just watch it
*  You can't imagine a world where that's not homicide
*  It's so fucked up
*  The Epstein thing
*  It was too low on his neck
*  It wasn't indicative of someone who was strangled
*  Or it wasn't indicative of someone who hung themselves
*  It was indicative of someone who was strangled
*  It was low on the neck
*  Like the guy's behind him pulling his fucking neck
*  With a wire or a rope or some shit
*  Question for you
*  Do you think they tell them yo we got the underage shorties on the island come through
*  Or do you think they say everyone here is overage
*  Don't worry about it, everything's good
*  Then they got it videotaped
*  And they're like by the way
*  They're all underage
*  I think that's more the case
*  I think if I had to guess the most nefarious version of it
*  I doubt is people sitting around going hey
*  Do you want to bang underage girls
*  I think they probably say hey
*  We're gonna have this party
*  It's on an island, no one's gonna be there but us
*  It's fantastic, it's top shelf combinations
*  We have girls there
*  They're lovely
*  Maybe they don't even tell them they have girls there
*  They probably tell them they have girls
*  Hey you wanna bro out
*  You guys wanna go fishing
*  We got some jet skis dude
*  Coconut milk, trust me
*  And I think once they get them there
*  They get them drinking
*  I bet they start partying
*  There's the island man
*  So I think they start partying
*  They're probably either paid to or trained
*  To be friendly to them
*  And I mean
*  The men are probably disgusting
*  And you got a guy like Clinton
*  I mean that guy
*  He would fuck a warm jar of peanut butter
*  He's an animal
*  You know
*  He's an animal
*  Right, that's just who he is
*  This is how twisted my fucking brain is
*  This is what happens when you're a comic and you're just gonna think about
*  The different angle all day
*  When you said fuck a warm jar of peanut butter
*  I'm like what would be the best condiment to fuck
*  Peanut butter
*  What would it be? Peanut butter?
*  What would it be? Jam?
*  You need something thick and something that gives you resistance
*  You know what you want?
*  You want organic peanut butter
*  This is why you gotta open up the comedy clubs bro
*  Cause otherwise we would talk about fucking peanut butter
*  Bro just open them up
*  But Clinton has always been known to be a wild man
*  He fucks everything
*  He tries to fuck girls
*  And they yell and they scream and they run away
*  He's got women that have said he raped them
*  I mean he's a fucking animal
*  I would imagine you get that guy alone
*  On an island
*  Get a couple of drinks in him
*  And then Epstein is connected to these people
*  Who assure you
*  Don't worry, everything's covered
*  This is how we do it
*  Look the world's too, there's too much scrutiny out there
*  Bill, you gotta be yourself, okay?
*  This wasn't always scrutinized
*  Right
*  You got songs, fucking Rolling Stones
*  Don't they have a song talking about banging some 15 year old girl or something like that?
*  I believe there's a song, right?
*  Look it up, Rolling Stones
*  You have songs about people talking about
*  Well, Kiss had a song called Christine 16
*  Dude, every movie in the 80s
*  She's only 17
*  17
*  Remember that?
*  I'm just saying, every movie in the 80s there were like
*  14 year olds, 14 year olds, 14 year olds
*  And then like where are the freshmen at?
*  Right, they're 14 year olds
*  Granted you're all in high school, but you still maybe would have college kids
*  Okay, so
*  There was a time where it was probably
*  Okay, right?
*  To sleep with younger women
*  I'm not talking about the 11 and 12, I'm talking about teenage women
*  It was probably okay
*  At that time, how did they
*  Compromise people
*  Because if we really want to know who's behind this
*  Just figure out what they were doing
*  Before the
*  Pedophile stuff
*  Yeah, but they controlled the press, like before that no one could say anything about it
*  So you're saying they didn't need to compromise
*  Back in the day
*  And then they were like, well fuck, we need to find a way to compromise
*  Little kids
*  Exactly, exactly
*  I feel like you always had to compromise, you always had to have something on someone
*  Like, you don't think that
*  You don't think that
*  No?
*  You don't think it's like coincidental that like, you know, maybe Clinton had some
*  Fucked up shit that happened in Arkansas
*  Like, alright, we're going to get you out of that, but you know, you're going to
*  You're going to keep on, you're going to have an interesting political career
*  Just look out for your boys
*  I don't think so
*  I mean, I don't think they had film footage of it
*  And I think they controlled the media
*  But you know, the Clinton stuff goes way back
*  I don't know enough
*  Do you know the Mina, Arkansas shit?
*  No, no
*  Clinton was the governor of Arkansas when Barry Seals was running cocaine through Mina, Arkansas
*  He would go to South America
*  And there's always footage
*  There's a great movie about it with Tom Cruise
*  Yes, that's about Barry Seals
*  And that was a real guy
*  Who was a pilot
*  Who would fly back with coke
*  And they would drop the coke off in Mina, Arkansas
*  They dropped the coke off
*  And these two kids found it
*  They found the drop, they murdered these two kids
*  And they said the kids committed suicide
*  The kids were doing drugs
*  They fell asleep on the train tracks
*  They just made this shit up, right?
*  So when they
*  When they did the autopsy
*  They did the autopsy on the kids
*  And they said, oh, the kids died of suicide
*  They got high and they slept on the train tracks
*  The parents were like, that's not our kids
*  Our kids would not do that
*  So they do a separate autopsy
*  Separate, independent autopsy
*  And they find knife wounds in these kids
*  So the kids have been murdered
*  It gets worse
*  So then Barry Seals agrees to sell everybody out
*  So he agrees to testify
*  He is on his way to the courtroom
*  With George Bush's phone number
*  George Bush's phone number in his fucking pocket
*  When he's gunned down in his car
*  Yeah, he's assassinated
*  On his way to testify
*  A guy who is an absolute
*  And also in the movie, the Tom Cruise movie
*  They showed Bill Clinton partying him
*  He got caught for something
*  Bill Clinton partied him
*  Whoa, what if
*  What if compromising people
*  Saves their life?
*  What if back in the day
*  You're like, yo, if you talk I'm gonna kill you
*  And then you're like, actually I think you're gonna talk
*  You're dead. Like that's what the mafia does, right?
*  You're gonna snitch, we're killing you
*  Any gangs, whatever, you're gonna snitch, we're gonna kill you
*  But what if their technique is like, dude, I'm tired of killing people
*  You're gonna fuck some kids
*  Or you're gonna do something that you do not want getting out there
*  You better not tell
*  Yes. Well you gotta think of a guy like
*  Any prominent big time politician
*  They know so much shit about so many people
*  And so many different things that are wrong
*  So many different things that are illegal
*  So get them to fuck a kid
*  You gotta wonder about Anthony Weiner
*  Keep going. Anthony Weiner
*  Was the guy that was
*  Showing that dang. He was showing that dang
*  And he was married to
*  Did you see it? Not to distract. No, I didn't look at his cock
*  I heard he had a good sized cock though. He had a good sized cock?
*  I look at a famous dick. Look he's a fucking
*  Bold man. And he was an amazing
*  Speaker, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah
*  And they were worried about him. They were thinking this motherfucker
*  Could be a big time politician
*  So we need to compromise his ass
*  I don't know whether he was just a freak
*  Or whether this is how he's always been
*  And this is his kink
*  But he liked sexting with underage girls
*  Bad. So they put him in fucking jail
*  For it. Bad. But here's what's interesting
*  About it. The very laptop
*  That he was using
*  To sext with these underage girls
*  Also has Hillary Clinton's emails on it
*  Like that was part of the problem
*  Like his wife was communicating
*  With Hillary Clinton. Joe, we need
*  What is this? We need a
*  FBI communication of discovery
*  Of Hillary Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop computer
*  So they found
*  Her important emails
*  On the laptop that he's using
*  To sext with these underage girls
*  To have these messages
*  It's pretty convenient, isn't it?
*  Look, I'm not saying he didn't do it
*  Because I think he did
*  Because he sent pictures of him
*  With his dick. You can't
*  I think he's a freak
*  And I think, like I said, they're
*  Ugly actors. Their people are ugly
*  I think the guy's a comic. That's what I think
*  Who? Weiner? Weiner. Weiner.
*  I mean, he's a comic
*  Just nobody ever taught him how to do comedy
*  So he just expressed his
*  Freakitude in terrible
*  Awful ways. But there's a picture of him
*  He's got his phone up like this
*  And he's got his hog, like half
*  Hard, in his underwear, lying
*  There, and I think he was like lying with one
*  Of his kids. Oh, that's foul.
*  It's crazy. That's weird.
*  Because he's sending these to girls just all willy nilly
*  Do you know how nuts that is?
*  That he just doesn't even know these
*  Gals? So maybe
*  He was just a sex addict. Maybe he
*  Was a sexting addict
*  With underage girls. See, there's a picture of his hog
*  And his kid asleep. See right there?
*  Right there? Question.
*  And now you got me on this
*  Fucking rabbit hole dog. But look at those
*  Selfies. No, no, I see it. But go back
*  To, look at the upper left-hand corner
*  Like, he was a freak
*  Okay? It's not like he's getting
*  Roped in. He was a freak. He was clearly
*  A freak. There was something about him
*  That was a freak. But also
*  I mean, he's sexting with a 15 year old
*  Did he know she was 15? That's the other question
*  Did he? Was he aware of the age? Maybe they edited it
*  Who knows?
*  Or maybe that's a picture he sent to his wife
*  Wait, what?
*  Who knows? That's what they do. But maybe that was
*  A picture he sent to his wife and they're like, now we're going to send that
*  To a 15 year old because now we got your laptop
*  We could do whatever. And then we got some worse
*  Shit on you and you're going to take this little charge right here
*  Before we tell you what we're really up to
*  He was very bombastic
*  And very argumentative in the Senate
*  And he would yell and scream
*  And the Senator is out of order!
*  The Senator would yield the floor!
*  And he had this way of talking
*  Very powerful speaker
*  Go ahead, Jamie. He knew. He knew.
*  I don't want to, we don't need to get into this
*  But he knew. I don't want to, no, no, that's gross
*  So maybe there's a culture
*  Of these creepy guys
*  Doing this shit to younger girls
*  In politics
*  There is a culture of that
*  Maybe he's an example
*  Of that culture
*  It's not that
*  Politics makes you do that
*  Politics has something that is
*  Enticing to those type of people
*  Which is obviously power
*  It's like the Catholic Church doesn't make you
*  Touch kids, but if you did want to touch kids
*  And you want some smoke screen
*  Okay, here's a perfect
*  Situation. You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, I do know what you mean
*  I don't think Catholicism makes you do that
*  But if you did want to do it
*  That would be the perfect place to go
*  I think one of the ways
*  That Catholicism does do that
*  Is you go there when you're young
*  And you get molested
*  And then you think that that's normal
*  And then you start molesting other kids
*  That is one thing that does happen
*  To people that get molested
*  There's not just a high rate of them
*  Molesting other, there's a high recidivism rate
*  But there's a very high rate of them molesting people as well
*  That's one of the horrible, it's almost like
*  You're a vampire
*  When you do that to some kids
*  It's like you put it in them
*  And then they go out and perpetrate
*  The same evil that was done to them
*  That's a good way of putting it
*  It is like that in a way
*  Because you hear all these stories about guys
*  Who molest kids who were molested
*  I think there's a sickness when someone wants to fuck a 15 year old
*  Even if you want to text them
*  And pretend you want to fuck a 15 year old
*  Especially a guy with kids
*  Yeah, it's just so fucking
*  But how many of them were there?
*  I told you about that Breitbart Podesta quote
*  We talked about that
*  That's a crazy quote
*  I don't know if it's true
*  I don't know what the fuck
*  Do you believe it?
*  Do you believe it?
*  I don't know what to believe
*  And this is after all of this
*  Here Jamie, I'm going to send you this
*  I'm going to air drop this to you
*  Hold on one second, I'm peeing
*  Go pee
*  Alright we're back
*  Feel better?
*  So we're talking about creeps
*  And people who want to fuck kids
*  This is a thing that Andrew Breitbart tweeted in 2011
*  Before he died
*  How pro-guru John Podesta
*  John Podesta isn't household name
*  As world class underage sex slave
*  Op cover upper
*  Defending unspeakable dregs escapes me
*  Right, now what does that mean?
*  What does that mean?
*  Maybe Breitbart's crazy?
*  Maybe he's crazy
*  Why do all these crazy people die
*  Randomly
*  It's kind of weird right?
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  That's so crazy
*  And then Hank's wife being named Rita Wilson
*  It's just a coincidence
*  It's just a coincidence dude
*  You know what's before
*  You got to do a bit about it
*  But you were saying how there's no more crazy
*  We were just talking about random things
*  What happens is just crazy
*  And back in the day maybe we put too many things
*  Under the umbrella of crazy
*  Maybe
*  And now, maybe way back in the day
*  When it was just anybody who was like
*  You're left handed, you're fucking crazy
*  And crazy
*  There's certain things that we exempt from
*  Possibility of crazy
*  But this is something we always allow as crazy
*  Right?
*  That can't be real
*  If you call out somebody
*  And you end up getting murked
*  And you're like maybe there's a coincidence going on there
*  What are you crazy?
*  You must be insane to think
*  Well there's a bunch of those man
*  That's when Seth Rich got murdered
*  Everybody was worried about that
*  We gave them the information on the DNC
*  Being corrupt
*  Rigging the vote with
*  With Hillary Clinton
*  When they conspired against Bernie Sanders
*  That's when Donna Brazil
*  Wrote about it in her book
*  When Seth Rich was murdered
*  She got really scared
*  She was a top operative
*  What do you think, what if we sat down with the deep state
*  Or the powers, whoever is doing all this
*  What would they look like?
*  What would the deep state look like?
*  Oh that's a good question
*  Who are they?
*  And how do you get the job?
*  And how do you move up in it?
*  You've been really deep bro, we want to give you a raise
*  Hey dude, you've been going deep
*  Is it bankers?
*  No name bankers that none of us
*  Know who they are?
*  I went on a fucking
*  It was bad
*  There's this guy named Bill Still
*  Please interview Bill Still
*  Back in the day
*  Did this documentary, I don't know if it was PBS or something like that
*  It was just about
*  The banking institutions
*  And how they've been controlling every policy decision
*  Back into the 1700s
*  And then before that in Europe
*  And how these few banking families
*  Have all kind of worked together
*  Anybody who criticizes the banks and
*  Breaks up the banks, they're remembered poorly in history
*  I believe that
*  Like Andrew Jackson for example, he got rid of the Fed
*  He killed the banks
*  And he's remembered, he has the worst reputation as a president
*  He's that racist president
*  Like all the other presidents had slaves
*  But Andrew Jackson, he was really racist about it
*  Dude, this guy Bill Still
*  So I get this, I'll send you the link
*  I mean it probably only has like 40,000 views
*  But it was for television, it was on like some sort of
*  I don't know, what is PBS?
*  Just like regular
*  Regular broadcasting
*  Channel 1?
*  But yeah
*  And I just watched it and I was like, oh this is really fascinating
*  I was like learning about money
*  Learning about fractional reserve lending
*  And just like these interesting
*  Things that make the economy go
*  And like how it works
*  When you find out that the Bilderberg group is real
*  You're like, wait, what?
*  The Bilderberg group is the group that
*  Oh, the Jekyll Island thing
*  Well that is, isn't that how the IRS was formed
*  Isn't that Jekyll?
*  Boy we're so dumb
*  No, it's home currency, there was something about
*  Yeah, Jekyll Island is a different
*  He makes this correlation where any
*  President who tried to create currency
*  That wasn't dependent on the banks
*  Got murked
*  And then I go, and I'm looking at this, I'm like
*  Yeah, Lincoln, what did Lincoln do? Lincoln do that
*  And then he goes, you know why our money is green?
*  Because in the Civil War, he went to the banks
*  And asked for a loan for the Civil War, and they were like
*  It's going to be 20-25% interest on the loan
*  He was like, nah, fucking, I'm printing my own shit
*  Greenbacks
*  Well, and then some
*  Fucking actor shoots him
*  Why would an actor care about slavery?
*  Like, you're some theater nerd
*  You're some theater dork
*  Come on, dude
*  Doesn't this seem weird?
*  I know I'm getting really conspiratorial, but like
*  Yeah, but you're allowed to with Lincoln
*  It's long enough ago
*  It doesn't matter
*  You're telling me, just imagine a theater nerd
*  Let's go, like who's the biggest theater nerd right now
*  Like give me a
*  Pat Noswalt
*  John Wilkes Booth brother
*  John Wilkes Booth brother
*  Also a famous actor in New York
*  And I think it was the week before Lincoln was killed
*  He saved his son from getting hit by a car
*  Randomly
*  As though that's a random occurrence
*  And this is back in the day
*  There was barely any cars
*  Fun fact, on the Booth family
*  There was no cars back in the day
*  The car's going 20 miles per hour
*  There was no car
*  Like a buggy or something like that
*  I was like, car?
*  Car?
*  1865?
*  A-oo-ah
*  It's wild though, right?
*  So check this guy Bill's still, I don't even know if he's still alive
*  I don't think he got murked
*  But he was really passionate about it
*  And he's really passionate about breaking the bank
*  And not having our sales be tied to these banking institutions
*  To dictate monetary policy
*  Wasn't that a part of Kennedy as well?
*  Of course, Kennedy, I got got, bruh
*  He wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve
*  Everyone that wants to get rid of it
*  He wanted to get close? Adios!
*  I'm te-
*  Bro, it's, the way he puts it
*  Who else got shot?
*  Oh, he got shot Jackson, he got shot but he lived
*  Reagan
*  He got shot by a psycho
*  But they're all psychos
*  They're all crazy
*  They're all crazy when they need to be crazy
*  Oh, well you gotta read this book called Chaos
*  Go
*  Oh my god, oh my god, it's about Charles Manson
*  Right, starts out about Charles Manson
*  Wasn't he involved?
*  Oh yeah, CIA
*  Listen, he was a
*  Prisoner who they gave acid to
*  And they trained him how to do that to other people
*  So he took these impressionable youths
*  And dosed them up with acid
*  And then he would pretend he was taking it
*  And he would guide them and tell them what to do
*  And then he had them go out and murder people
*  And every time he got arrested they let him out of jail
*  There's a guy named Tom O'Neill who started his book
*  He started his book as a story that he was writing
*  For Premier Magazine
*  And he would go deeper and deeper into the case
*  He was like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Well how about this, there's a free clinic
*  A free clinic in Haight-Ashbury
*  That the CIA operated under
*  With this program
*  Where they were doing tests on people
*  Doing tests on hippies and giving them acid
*  Until his book comes out
*  His book comes out
*  Three months after his book comes out
*  The clinic goes out of business
*  This is a clinic that had been in operation for 50 fucking years
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it's a tricky
*  Dude, it's a tricky thing
*  Right? It's like, my girl said something
*  Interesting to me, shoot, you know, cause there's all these
*  Serial killer documentaries on like
*  On Netflix and all that kind of stuff, right?
*  And I'm like
*  Are there serial killers in other places?
*  Why do we just have it here? Or do they have it
*  In London? Do they have it in Paris?
*  Jack the Ripper
*  And then after that, I don't think there was a lot of ripping
*  Right?
*  Like, he did it and then there's no more ripping
*  I don't know
*  And then she goes this, and she just goes
*  Honestly, I think it was all the acid
*  And I go, what do you mean? She goes, well they're doing all these drugs
*  In the 60s and 70s and all of a sudden in the 80s they just start
*  Tearing through women
*  And there's just all these serial killers that pop up out of nowhere
*  And I'm like, holy shit
*  Were the people they experimented on?
*  Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber
*  And they didn't talk about this in the
*  Netflix documentary
*  The Netflix documentary, they kind of briefly touched
*  Upon that about drugs
*  They used the
*  Random word drugs
*  Or the blanket word drugs
*  But he was a part of the Harvard LSD experiments
*  He was a part of these
*  They talked about
*  The psychological experiments they did
*  Where they were breaking him down for three years
*  But he was already a little loony
*  To begin with, and then they fucked with him
*  For three years and probably forced
*  Phetum acid, they did it to a lot of people
*  There was a thing called Operation Midnight
*  Climax they did back then
*  Where they would run whorehouses
*  They would run whorehouses
*  But they're not even hiding it
*  It's the most obvious name
*  For the bucket
*  The other one was MKUltra
*  That's the one I heard about
*  But a part of MKUltra was Operation Midnight Climax
*  And they did this in San Francisco as well
*  The same people
*  That were involved in that clinic
*  Were also involved in
*  They would make these brothels
*  And then they would hire these ladies to come in
*  And have sex with these guys
*  And they would dose the guys up with acid
*  So these guys would go in thinking they're gonna just get some sex
*  And they'd have a drink
*  And they'd be on acid just tripping their balls off
*  And then they would just run experiments on these fucking guys
*  What are you gonna do? Tell people?
*  Tell people you went to a whorehouse, you got drugged?
*  Really, is that what happened?
*  Is that what happened really?
*  So here's my question to you, let's say that we're in charge of like
*  Nation building or whatever it is
*  Let's say we're Deep State, right?
*  And we are tasked
*  With keeping America on top
*  By any means necessary
*  This is a good argument
*  You and I
*  Our families, our kids, everything is
*  Dependent on us developing
*  The coolest, well I don't wanna use the term cool
*  But most effective weapons
*  Of manipulation
*  To maintain our status
*  In the world, and because of that
*  We get to live the lives that we get to live
*  And if we don't do it, there are other countries
*  That are doing the exact same thing
*  And the second we slip, they're gonna body us
*  Right?
*  Would you go so far?
*  Would you go so far as to do these types of things?
*  The right answer is obviously no
*  But if you knew the exact same experiment
*  Was happening in China right now, and the second they figured it out
*  They were gonna find ways to manipulate
*  The powers that be, and then the next trip
*  A politician ends up in China
*  All of a sudden, they get doused with some shit
*  Now they're controlled, I don't know exactly how it works
*  This is the argument to accept some sort of
*  New world order, or accept some sort of
*  A totalitarian regime
*  That controls the people the same way
*  China controls the people, because otherwise we can't compete with them
*  Keep going
*  China has this connection
*  Between the big businesses
*  And corporations in China, and the military
*  And the government, they're all connected, it's one thing
*  There's not two things
*  It's not like you have a business, and then
*  There's the government, no, your business
*  Is a part of the government
*  If you're wanting Huawei, you're hand in hand
*  With the Chinese government
*  The only way the United States is gonna compete
*  Is if we run things over here
*  The way they run things over there
*  Because they can cut corners
*  Take chances, they have mass surveillance on their people
*  That way it keeps things running smoother
*  And there's, well they also have COVID tracking
*  We need to track you, we need to track you
*  Put a chip, put a chip in your ass
*  Not a chip, we don't need a chip, you got your phone
*  You ain't leaving that alone
*  You never needed a chip
*  Exactly, you don't need a chip
*  You get addicted to a game
*  Question, don't you think we
*  Run the Chinese government
*  Chinese government, yeah
*  I've been killing it with TikTok
*  I'm not gonna lie, I gotta show you, I got some good ones
*  Okay, here's the thing
*  Don't you think we're already there
*  And let me clarify
*  Do you really think
*  Google
*  Isn't sitting down with the US government
*  And the US government isn't going
*  And we're gonna need access to all that
*  We'll pretend like you guys are operating by yourself
*  But y'all know what time it is
*  Well, for sure they do
*  And Google's actually sat down with the Chinese government
*  And the argument of
*  Censoring over there was that if we don't
*  They're just gonna steal our intellectual
*  Property and just remake Google
*  In a Chinese form, we need to work with them
*  Well you don't need to do anything Google, you want
*  To work with them
*  No, no, no, we need to, we need to, we don't have enough money
*  Cause what we don't have, we need more, we need more
*  I just think, I wonder that even like
*  Like with Elon
*  Even with Elon, it's like you reach a certain
*  Level, you must have
*  Look, if I'm the guy, if I'm Deep State
*  Right, and I know we got this smart South African
*  Dude, right, and he
*  Can invent anything, he can do all this cool shit
*  And I'm gonna be like, alright yeah
*  Bring him over here, and he's like
*  Maybe I wanna go, you know, sell some shit to Saudi
*  Arabia, and I'll be like, maybe you don't
*  You know what I'm saying
*  Right
*  Right, and he's like
*  Just simple as that, he's like I'm gonna go
*  On Joe Rogan's podcast and smoke weed, you're like
*  Do whatever the fuck you want, we don't care about the stock prices
*  I just wonder if
*  If the exchange
*  Is, hey, we need some cool rockets
*  We need some great shit, and if
*  You have any ideas, throw them
*  Our way first, what are those network
*  Deals, first right of refusal
*  No, no, not development, remember like
*  First right of refusal, it's a, you know, if you build some shit
*  That's fire, we look at it first, if we don't like it
*  We're like, sell it to Saudi Arabia, but we look at it
*  We got it first, and if we ever need some
*  Real dope shit, you make it, now what is the exchange
*  If you wanna keep your factory open during
*  Covid, you get to do that
*  I think he's got so much
*  Influence, and they realized that their law was stupid
*  This, this
*  It was stupid, but most places are still closed
*  And he was like, yo, I'm staying open, and then the government
*  Was like, alright, you staying open
*  Why are you staying open, cause I need to make cars
*  Well, the California state government, because other governments were allowing him to open
*  So this is not deep state shit
*  This is like a state to state thing
*  He could have that much influence
*  Hey y'all, come on over here
*  And we have oil
*  And we'll still let you do the electrical
*  So there are states that were willing to let him rock and roll
*  But wouldn't you do that
*  With like a Bezos, like wouldn't you go
*  Hey guys, operate
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is like, there's like this structure in America
*  Right, where at the bottom
*  You have no power, and it fucking sucks
*  And you're just barely surviving
*  You make some money, you're good
*  You're good, your life is good, but you're still attached to your job
*  You need to do that in order to survive
*  You get into like the millions, ten millions
*  Hundred millions, right
*  And you actually have freedom
*  And the second you get into the billions
*  You get a knock on the door
*  Where it's like, you got a lot
*  You got a lot of stuff
*  And we're gonna need to have some conversations about how you use that stuff
*  And the people you talk to, and the deals that you do
*  Because you got too much power
*  Like I'm shocked
*  Like for years I've been shocked even with this platform
*  I'm like how is there one guy
*  That can speak to the whole world
*  And the US government isn't fucking surveilling you
*  And they're having drones everywhere
*  Well they can watch the show
*  Anyone can get it
*  That's a good point, you're not hiding
*  No
*  It's like there's freedom in exposing
*  Yes
*  You can really be free if you just give
*  Also, I'm a fucking cage fighting commentator
*  Who's gonna listen to me
*  Who's gonna listen to me
*  Dude, what if you're Deep State, that was really your smoke screen
*  Imagine if you just got really good at these things
*  Just so you could be Deep State
*  The problem is that's not how people get good at things
*  You don't get good at things from no motivation
*  You'd never be able to compete with guys
*  Who are out there really hustling
*  You have to be really hustling
*  And then they bring you to Fuck Island
*  And they give videos
*  Do you think
*  I have a question about MMA for you
*  Okay
*  Why do we keep hearing about the underpaying stuff?
*  Well, right now in particular
*  There's probably less money
*  Because the fighters have to
*  There's no gate
*  There's no live gate
*  Yeah, there's no live gate
*  And that's an extreme amount of money
*  But there's also fighters that agree to certain deals
*  They agree to like an 8 fight deal
*  X amount per fight
*  And then they become more popular
*  And then they want to renegotiate their deal
*  And the UFC is like
*  Look, we're just trying to stay open
*  We're not going to renegotiate anything
*  You can take it or you can leave it
*  But this is what it is
*  I think it's a matter of that
*  But looking at it from the fighters perspective
*  Fighters would be certainly
*  Better off if there was more competition
*  That's always how it works
*  So whether it's Bellator
*  Or 1FC
*  Or all these different companies
*  The more of those there are
*  The World Series of Fighting
*  The Moral Professional Fighting League
*  The more those rise
*  The better it is for everyone
*  It's just how it is
*  It's like if there's only improvs
*  And then you get banned from the improvs
*  You're fucked
*  Yes, yes
*  It's exactly like that
*  I've seen that happen before with people
*  I've seen that happen with comedy clubs
*  And I've seen that happen with fighting too
*  You get banned from a big organization
*  It's not a monopoly
*  In that you do have choices
*  But there's one clear top of the food chain
*  choice
*  But it's because they do it the best
*  They're also the only ones that are having fights
*  During this quarantine
*  The only people that are putting on any live sporting events
*  But they're also
*  A part of a company in WME
*  That's hurting
*  Really bad
*  So there's not a lot of money to throw around
*  To keep the doors open
*  To keep people employed
*  A lot of money
*  Is missing
*  All these shows got canceled
*  There's all these
*  Audience members that aren't going to be there
*  Buying tickets
*  So it's tricky, man
*  So this is why I think they're complaining about
*  Fight or Pay
*  I think they should get paid more
*  I think everybody should get paid more
*  I think it's a crazy way to make a living
*  I think you should get the most amount of money you can possibly get
*  But it's also a business
*  And I think that if they are
*  Struggling as much as I think they are
*  I don't talk finances with them
*  But I know that WME
*  People own it
*  They're hurting bad
*  They're laying people off
*  Most businesses are hurting
*  All the entertainment business is fucked
*  Live Nation is fucked
*  All these people are fucked
*  So what do they do?
*  That's what I think
*  For me as a human that likes fighting
*  I know how fucking dangerous
*  That shit is
*  You should get paid an incredibly generous
*  Amount of money to step into a
*  Cage fight for millions of people to see
*  Yeah, it is interesting because
*  You have
*  You have this situation where
*  The quality of
*  The fights is
*  Undeniably better
*  Because it's not in the free market
*  You have people that are
*  Really good at picking out fights
*  And for the most part
*  I say this as a boxing fan
*  So I grew up in boxing where there are tons of different
*  Divisions or tons of different companies
*  WBC, WBO, all these different
*  And sometimes they do, sometimes they don't
*  But it's a mess
*  And sometimes what happens is you have guys
*  Who are really boring fighters
*  But they get a position where they have the belt
*  And then it actually hurts the sport
*  But they earned it and they deserve it
*  So as a sportsman
*  I'm like, they deserve to have it
*  A lot of people, I love Floyd Mayweather
*  I think he's the best fighter in the history
*  Of fighting, right?
*  I think he's actually one of the greatest
*  People at their job ever
*  I think he's Michael Jordan of boxing
*  He's without a doubt one of the greatest
*  Boxers, if not the greatest boxer that has ever lived
*  He's unbelievable
*  But he, for average people
*  For me, I loved it, but for average people
*  I thought it was boring, so he needed the antics
*  He needed to get people angry at him
*  Yeah, they get me, right? And it worked
*  But the thing is with the UFC is
*  I'll watch guys I don't fucking know
*  And I'll enjoy it
*  And I feel like I don't know
*  If that's just because of the sport
*  But also because of the way that they're matching
*  The fighters, and it's not specifically
*  Hey, you're ranked here, you're ranked here, we have to match you
*  Part of it is
*  You're ranked here, you're ranked here, but also your styles
*  Would make something interesting
*  So I wonder if it's... You're correct
*  Do you think it's better to not be
*  A strictly free market? Do you think it's better to have
*  The fights for the quality of the sport?
*  If you're a fan
*  It's certainly better for you
*  If the fighters get
*  If they all get together in one organization
*  And then that organization makes them fight each other
*  That way there's not as many
*  Dream matchups you never get to see
*  Like one of the things that everybody got upset
*  Was by the time Floyd fought Manny Pacquiao
*  It was like past Manny's prime
*  And Manny had a bum shoulder
*  And all these different things
*  We would have liked to see that fight five years earlier
*  And in the UFC
*  That fight gets made
*  But it gets to a situation where
*  Like John Jones says
*  Hey, I've got a contract for light heavyweight fights
*  But what do you want to give me to fight
*  Francis Ngano
*  Because I want a lot of fucking money
*  Because that guy's terrifying
*  And they say you get what you're paid in your contract
*  That's what you get
*  And he's like, well, I'm not fighting then
*  It is interesting
*  See, that's one of those situations where I don't know who's right or who's wrong
*  Because I don't know how much money they would make for that
*  If there's no audience
*  Let's say the Francis Ngano fight's a big fight
*  And he gets like
*  500,000 pay per views, 600, 700,000 pay per views
*  That's a lot of pay per views
*  But a live gate
*  How much in the whole are they?
*  How much money
*  How much money in the whole are they?
*  How hard is it to make money right now?
*  How much can you afford?
*  How much do they make?
*  I don't know these answers
*  How much do they make for a pay per view
*  700,000 buys, a million buys
*  How much do they make?
*  Which is the overhead?
*  I don't know
*  It's less but it's not
*  It has to be less because you're not maintaining these venues
*  The venues are much smaller, you have to pay way less people
*  That being said, the ticket prices
*  The live gate
*  20,000 people, 18,000 people
*  All spending on average $150 a ticket
*  And on top of that there's merch, there's all sorts of shit
*  I'm sure they probably get some sort of
*  A piece of all that stuff
*  Yeah, so there's a lot
*  And then there's also, they had to operate
*  They didn't fire anybody, it's one thing about the UFC
*  They would not fire people
*  So they stayed open
*  Wouldn't fire anybody while they were
*  Going on for months just paying people
*  Trying to figure out how to put this together
*  And make fights happen
*  They tried to do that one at the Indian place
*  Tai Chi Palace in Lamore, California
*  They got real close to doing that
*  But then the fucking governor got a hold of
*  The head of Disney and Eisner
*  And they called Dana White and they told them to pull out
*  Pull out!
*  So they back out of that and then two weeks later
*  Florida's like, come on in
*  So then we do one in Florida with no audience
*  And then finally they're allowing us
*  To do them at the APEC Center
*  In Vegas
*  I think right now it's a triage
*  They're trying to stop the bleeding
*  And they're trying to patch back up the sport
*  And the UFC
*  The UFC's operating with full costs
*  For months
*  Without any money coming in at all
*  So you have to think that
*  Yeah, that's right
*  WME I think paid $4 billion or something for them
*  A little more than that
*  So they have this giant monthly nut
*  They have to cover every month
*  And people I guess don't realize is like
*  An agency makes money off of the commission of their clients
*  And if their clients can't work
*  Because of Corona
*  No revenue coming in
*  None, zero
*  I guess there's some TV shows getting made
*  But still they're not doing production on films
*  No
*  It is interesting
*  They're starting to do films next week
*  They are, it's coming back
*  What was your thoughts on it?
*  Until someone gets sick
*  And then you're liable, that's the tricky thing
*  They don't want, god forbid
*  Somebody ends up, one of these like
*  NBA coaches who's old
*  God forbid Greg Popovich who's fucking 70
*  Oh yeah
*  Gets Corona
*  It is, and now you want to be the NBA commissioner
*  That killed Greg Popovich?
*  Oh my god
*  Or be a UFC promoter
*  That a fighter gets sick, goes home
*  And kills his mom who works with him
*  You know, maybe your mom helps cook for you
*  Your mom gets sick
*  Maybe your mom's helping you in camp
*  Your mom gets sick and dies from Corona
*  Because they had the fights
*  Yeah
*  I don't think that's going to happen
*  I think particularly now when you're hearing these reports
*  Of the cases diminishing
*  The viral load that they're finding
*  Like in Italy is so small
*  That's barely detectable
*  The hope is that
*  Same shit happens here as it gets hot out
*  That Italy thing was so funny
*  Why is it funny?
*  Because like they said that
*  The symptoms of Corona
*  Were like you couldn't taste and smell
*  And Italy was like the first country
*  There was like it's a pandemic
*  Like everybody inside
*  We can't eat, we can't taste pasta
*  We gotta get to the bottom of this
*  We can't smell great food
*  Exactly, and then people in Sweden
*  Which has like trash cuisine anyway
*  They're just like yeah let it rip
*  It gives a fuck, what do the English say?
*  We're going to take it on the chin
*  Right, what are we living for anyway?
*  Our food tastes like shit
*  They're good meatballs
*  And then there's all this concern
*  That they're doing it wrong
*  Or they're doing it right, we need to watch Sweden
*  Look Sweden's fine, why can't we do it like Sweden?
*  No, the death rate is very high
*  The death toll
*  All of it
*  Was it high?
*  Comparatively, I think it's higher
*  I think letting it burn through the city
*  Is comparatively higher
*  I think the question is
*  What would you rather have? Would you rather have the freedom
*  To decide for yourself and
*  Know that there's some risks involved
*  Or would you rather have the government
*  Lock everything down, save people's lives
*  For now, but then the economy crashes
*  And for every
*  Unemployment rate
*  There's some sort of
*  Some sort of a graph
*  That they use, or some sort of an equation
*  But for every percentage the unemployment rate
*  Goes up
*  More people are unemployed, X amount of people die
*  That's a fact, they know that
*  Roughly
*  And this is not taken into account at all
*  The deaths that we're looking at are only the deaths
*  Due to disease
*  That's why you know it's been politicized
*  Because the politicians aren't going to be accountable
*  For the deaths because of unemployment
*  Because they could blame it on the pandemic
*  But they will be responsible
*  For the deaths from Corona
*  If they're opening up too early
*  Dude, they should have quarantined sick people and high-risk people
*  People that have
*  Illnesses, pre-existing conditions
*  And they should have been able to
*  Re-register people, people that are vulnerable
*  We could have done that, that could have been done
*  If all these people
*  That have gone out and marched
*  I mean like just yesterday we were at a march
*  In Santa Barbara, we're in the crowd
*  We're talking to folks
*  Do you think if nobody ends up getting Corona
*  Or the numbers don't spike that high
*  We'll forever lose
*  Or at least for our lives lose faith
*  In what our public health sector
*  Tells us we need to be concerned about
*  Already people are losing faith
*  But especially after this right now
*  Especially, yeah, especially
*  But I think people already, when they find out
*  How many people actually got it versus how many people died
*  Versus what they thought
*  How many people are going to get it versus how many people
*  I mean it's a tiny fraction
*  They keep trying to scare us
*  Have you seen the image of downtown LA yesterday?
*  It was wild
*  It's insane, there's an overhead view
*  Where you can see 50,000 people filling the street
*  It's crazy
*  It's not real
*  You're going to get a call bro
*  You're going to get a call from the FBI
*  I wonder what the numbers are going to be man
*  In two weeks, I mean are we going to have a sharp
*  Increase in deaths in two weeks
*  Because of these
*  Protests
*  Dude, you know how I knew that I wasn't taking it seriously
*  Because like for the first
*  Maybe
*  Two weeks, I washed my hands
*  After I peed
*  I'm like man I'm good bro
*  Just right now
*  When we peed
*  I only washed my hands
*  I actually walked out and I realized you were still in there
*  And you were like
*  That's a classic guy move
*  But that's how I knew it wasn't
*  I was like whatever dude
*  But that doesn't make any sense
*  What if it was the play
*  What if it really was real
*  What if it really was something that takes like 17, 18 days
*  And it's super contagious and everybody gets it
*  17, 18 days and you're just deathly ill
*  Everybody no matter who you are
*  That's nothing to do with your immune system
*  Stop it with your health privilege
*  It has to do only with this horrible
*  That's what I just said, I just made it up
*  Health privilege
*  That's what it is, they're shaming you for health privilege
*  Stay home, save lives
*  Look at that
*  That's downtown LA
*  Imagine if this really was
*  Just a political ploy to crush
*  The economy and that they knew it wasn't
*  Going to be that bad, they knew it was going to be bad
*  But it didn't require shutting
*  Everything down for months and months at a time
*  But it's a good thing to do if you want to
*  Kill the economy, start civil unrest
*  Let's go deep state theory, right?
*  Deep state! Deep state theory
*  Pull the strings! You know you can't
*  Let Biden debate
*  Because it's going to be a massacre
*  Not good
*  I got hairy legs
*  Did you see the clip?
*  It was great
*  What the fuck are you saying?
*  Just a wild dude
*  So you don't want him to debate, right?
*  And whose power is actually
*  Public appearance
*  Whose rallies
*  Trump
*  So now you take away
*  The ability
*  To have those big rallies
*  Which are incredibly persuasive
*  If you're someone who's on the fence
*  And you limit
*  The liability that is
*  Biden in a potential debate where he could
*  Have these gaffes, etc.
*  Then on top of it, you have civil unrest
*  And you blame it all on him
*  But here's the thing, you can see how it all played out
*  That guy is just a piece of shit
*  In Minneapolis
*  He's not some deep state player
*  Just a piece of shit
*  Just a piece of shit
*  And he killed that guy, we all saw it
*  And he's got a long history
*  As a corrupt cop, really he's just a deep state
*  Long player
*  So in 2006
*  They brought him in as a
*  Manchurian candidate
*  We're gonna let you marry a hot Asian
*  You know his wife was Miss Minnesota
*  She's hot as fuck
*  She dropped him though
*  Immediately, that's how you know it's set up deep state
*  So set up deep state, dude
*  It's set up deep state
*  And then they're gonna say, you can't say he's a white supremacist
*  He's an Asian wife
*  Good call
*  What is that thing that they do, what is it called
*  When someone's a sleeper, when they wait for a long time
*  Before they act
*  Cause of the victim
*  No, no, no, no
*  When someone is like, they're undercover for a long time
*  Manchurian candidate, wasn't that the movie?
*  No, but the Manchurian candidate is someone who's been hypnotized
*  The thing is like a sleeper cell
*  Like someone who doesn't
*  They don't do anything for a long time
*  And they just wait
*  And then like, alright, we're getting close to the election
*  Get in there
*  Go kill a guy, and if a young girl's gonna film you
*  You're gonna kill her anyway
*  Kill him anyway
*  The girl was filming him
*  A 17 year old girl filming him with her camera
*  A 17 year old girl got the George Floyd video
*  Yeah, there was a lot of people out there, wasn't there?
*  Well, there was a 17 year old girl
*  It was a video that we all saw
*  17 year old girl, and a lot of people
*  Were giving her a hard time
*  Why didn't you do something?
*  A fucking cop, a 17 year old girl
*  A grown man is killing another grown man
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah
*  You want her to step in, really?
*  Deep state
*  It's all a long game
*  It's 4D chess
*  What are your thoughts on what has transpired since?
*  Look, that gives me hope
*  When I see 50,000 people
*  Walking through downtown LA
*  All peacefully protesting
*  That gives me hope
*  There's a real chance for a real shift
*  A real shift
*  Also, here's the thing that bugs me
*  All that money they came
*  To bail out
*  All these corporations from the coronavirus
*  The pandemic, why couldn't they have used
*  That money already to bail out these inner cities?
*  Why couldn't they have
*  Find the money to
*  They have all these cities that have this
*  Systemic crime and violence
*  And racism that's been going
*  Forever, forever
*  A place like Baltimore
*  That are directly fucked up as a result of
*  Racist practices and selling houses
*  And they don't do anything to fix that
*  They never try to stop
*  Where the crime is coming from
*  They never try to make those cities better
*  They never try to add
*  Community centers
*  And figure out a way to
*  Do something
*  There's nothing on the table
*  It's just crime written neighborhoods
*  Just how they are, like forever
*  Yeah, crime doesn't matter until it affects the pockets
*  Like if the crime is happening in a poor neighborhood
*  And it's not affecting somebody's money
*  Then nobody cares
*  The second they started breaking windows on 5th Avenue
*  Now all of a sudden
*  It's more
*  Now it's what's fucked up
*  Now it's what's wild about de Blasio, just says stand down, let them do it
*  Let them burn themselves out
*  We did this in the video but it was really interesting
*  Because we had to like
*  I had to really process how I felt about it
*  Because the looting obviously was wrong
*  And we did that clip on it
*  But the writing I understood
*  I was talking to this
*  I want to say his name because he's a college professor
*  I don't want to get him in trouble for talking to us
*  And helping us out
*  He distinguished gentlemen, were these ruffians
*  But he was like, he's really savvy with constitutional law
*  And stuff and he said this argument
*  I thought it was really interesting
*  When it comes to riots, not looting, destruction of property is wrong
*  And you're doing it to benefit yourself when you loot
*  You're taking advantage of the tragedy
*  The tragedy of the smoke screen
*  So that you can benefit
*  And we made an interesting distinction
*  And I think the Instagram model that's also taking a picture
*  At the thing
*  But not really actually doing anything
*  You're looting too, you're enriching yourself
*  Did you see that one chick that borrowed the guy's drill
*  That's the one that we did
*  That's looting though
*  You're enriching yourself off of tragedy
*  That's fucking looting
*  So peaceful protest, obviously great
*  Looting wrong
*  Rioting in the middle
*  Which is destruction of property, right
*  To send this message
*  We're putting together the piece
*  We're talking to this dude, he made this interesting point
*  He goes, as a citizen
*  You have the right to life, liberty, pursuit of happiness
*  But also property, right
*  And if the state
*  Is destroying the most valuable piece of property
*  That you have, which is your body
*  Right, you have to
*  Take some sort of recourse
*  In order to protect that, right
*  They broke the social contract
*  They broke it, right
*  When they maybe are shooting you or shooting your neighbors, etc
*  You peacefully protest
*  If that goes on deaf ears
*  For decades
*  What the fuck else are you supposed to do
*  Like what, you can keep saying peacefully protest
*  But if it keeps on happening
*  There really isn't anything else
*  Available to you
*  So the next thing
*  Is destruction of property
*  I think the best way to do it would probably be to destroy public property
*  Not private property
*  But if you destroy public property
*  You'd actually be taking the high road
*  Because that's a response to having life destroyed
*  You destroy my life
*  I just fuck up your park
*  Who's reasonable here
*  Well if it was all coordinated
*  And thought that way, yes
*  And I think what happened in Minnesota
*  In particular what happened with the precinct
*  The police precinct, where they burnt that fucking thing down
*  That was fascinating
*  It's when it spreads across the country
*  And then it just becomes two things
*  It becomes peaceful protest
*  People mad at the cops
*  And looting
*  And the looting is different
*  What's crazy is
*  Along the way we get
*  More evidence of police brutality
*  Instead of the cops saying
*  Hey, this guy killed this guy
*  It makes us all look terrible
*  We are not like that
*  We're better than that
*  Most of them probably did do that
*  But a lot of them
*  They fell back to their cop ways
*  They fell back to their ways of smashing fucking shields into people
*  Running over pedestrians
*  All the crazy shit that we saw
*  Shooting a guy in the fucking face
*  With a tear gas canister
*  See that? They pepper sprayed him
*  And then they shot him with a flash bang
*  Right in the fucking face
*  Oh my god, it's crazy
*  I think Joe Schilling has that on his
*  Instagram page
*  My friend Joe Schilling
*  He was a kickboxer
*  He's been saying
*  For the last 6-7 days
*  He's not one bad apple
*  He goes, look at all these fucking asshole cops
*  That are doing shit
*  So he's putting video after video after video
*  Of cops grabbing a woman
*  By the neck throwing her to the ground
*  She's just
*  What are you saying to me?
*  Why do I have to listen to you?
*  Fucking get on the ground
*  Just grab her
*  Macing people, macing young girls
*  Macing people for no fucking reason
*  This one guy was talking shit to the cops
*  Pepper spray him, drag him
*  Throw him to the ground
*  You're taking away his freedom of speech
*  The guy's not committing a crime
*  You're violating the first amendment
*  You're violating his constitutional rights
*  So my friend Joe has
*  Video after video after video of this
*  And I think one of them
*  I don't know if he has that in there
*  But one of them is this dude gets pepper sprayed in the face
*  And then they fucking flash bang him
*  It hits him right off the dome
*  It's crazy, so many people got fucked up
*  My buddy is a captain in the marines
*  Right?
*  He was, and he was in Iraq
*  He goes, here's why I have no
*  Tolerance whatsoever for police brutality
*  When we were in Iraq
*  The mission changed
*  And it went from going there and
*  Fuck shit up, that's how it is when you're trying to win a war
*  To win minds and hearts
*  And they explained to us while we were there
*  We're winning minds and hearts
*  And that means you guys are going to have to take on more risk
*  That means you don't just kick in the door
*  And then light it up
*  You have to make sure that you're not taking out innocence
*  At least try
*  You are taking on more risk
*  You are risking your life
*  So he goes, when I see police brutality, I'm like
*  If we can afford that luxury to a country
*  That we're at war with
*  How the fuck can we not afford that luxury to our own citizens?
*  He goes
*  If I'm told to take on more risk
*  Then maybe these cops
*  Have to take on more risk and pay them for it
*  Increase payment, increase training
*  Don't defund
*  But increase the requirements
*  And really make them heroes
*  But he said this, he was like
*  It seemed to me that the culture
*  Of policing in America
*  And I could be wrong, we gotta talk to the cops about it
*  But what he said, it seems to me
*  That the idea is
*  No cop ever gets left behind
*  No cop ever goes down
*  Instead of protecting people at all costs
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I don't know, I mean poke holes if you can
*  No, it makes sense
*  Well I'm fully in agreement that they need
*  Better funding, it needs to be a higher paying job
*  That's much more difficult to get
*  But when you see cops
*  Throw that old man to the ground
*  He bounces his fucking head off the ground
*  You see the blood come out of his head
*  And no one does anything
*  No one picks the guy up, no one calls an ambulance
*  No one checks on him
*  That, you can't do that
*  That's not serving, that's not protecting
*  A guy sets up that you didn't like
*  So you threw him to the ground, you knew he was old and feeble
*  You knew he was
*  And you did it with potentially
*  A confidence
*  Of knowing that nothing would happen
*  There wouldn't be any recourse
*  And that's when people go like
*  A bad apple ruins a bunch
*  And it's like no it doesn't, you just removed the bad apple
*  But if you can't remove the bad apple
*  If there's systems in play that don't allow it
*  Then it ruins the bunch
*  So if there's one systemic change
*  We make, maybe it's
*  People get prosecuted
*  Or cops will get prosecuted for violating the law
*  Because I really would allow
*  Not allow, I'd really love
*  If we
*  Had this relationship with the cops
*  Where we're like fuck you guys are brave man, thank you
*  Like fuck, because it is a fucking dangerous job
*  And thankless in a lot of ways
*  A lot of ways
*  So it's like, how do we shift this
*  And how much risk do they have to take
*  Or what change do we make so that we can look at them and go
*  Thank god we got these guys around
*  Fuck it's scary sometimes
*  Listen to what you said about your friend being in the marines
*  It's fucking hard to get through boot camp man
*  It's hard, it's hard
*  There's a long road that you have to travel
*  To be a Navy SEAL
*  That's how it should be to be a cop man
*  It should be fucking hard to make it
*  And they should weed out the people
*  That are assholes, the people that are sociopaths
*  The people that would be willing to lean their shin on a man's neck for 8 and a half minutes
*  Those people are sick
*  You gotta find those people before they get to the position where they could do that to a person
*  And how do you do that? Do you do psych evals?
*  Yes, you gotta train them
*  You gotta train them like they are the type of people that potentially could fucking kill somebody for the wrong reason
*  You gotta train them like you're weeding them out
*  Like this is a great honor
*  And we can shift that
*  But we have to think about it in terms of allocation of resources
*  Cops don't get paid enough
*  Teachers don't get paid enough either though and they're not killing their kids
*  But they fuck them
*  They fuck them sometimes
*  And nobody goes, we should just stop school
*  Right
*  Hey these teachers are fucking the kids
*  We defund the teachers
*  We defund school, get rid of school
*  Too many teachers are blowing these kids
*  This is fucking crazy
*  I gotta end this man
*  We've been doing it 3 and a half hours already
*  3 hours, 3 hours, we started a little later
*  The deep state will cut about half of this
*  Always great to see you
*  But it's always a good time
*  Hopefully next time we'll be doing comedy
*  I think it's gonna be soon
*  When are you gonna be back here again?
*  I don't know, I'm gonna do some shows though
*  I heard you're doing, I don't wanna mention
*  I got some shows
*  I'm about to pop off
*  Some shit might be going down in Ohio too
*  Chappelle's got some shit he's planning
*  Lots of things are happening
*  My agent said that
*  That you were going around
*  And I was like, you know what, maybe I'll like
*  Do you have anything around your date?
*  I'll help it man, I'll promote it
*  No you don't have to, what I'm saying is like
*  We'll all just hang
*  Everybody could just do each other stuff
*  And it would just be like a fun
*  We could reward the clubs that are going
*  Let's open up, we'll talk about it off air
*  Texas is going guns blazing, Arizona
*  So it's wild west states
*  The ones that survived the fucking wars with the Indians
*  They're opening up
*  Right away
*  Disease don't kill us
*  Andrew Schultz ladies and gentlemen
*  Love you brother
