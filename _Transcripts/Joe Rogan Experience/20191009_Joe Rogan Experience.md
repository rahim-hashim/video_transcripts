# Joe Rogan Experience #1364 - Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2fUl0Ldxgg)
*  Hello Brian. Hello Joe. What are you doing? Just hanging. Yeah, um, you're not sober are
*  you? This isn't sober October for you. Oh no. You're not doing it? Nah. You can get
*  high. I'll watch. Okay. Can I blow it on you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think that counts.
*  There's a... I'll take one of these. Oh, this is a joint. This is fat. Oh really? Yeah,
*  that's all weed. That's Mike Tyson's weed. Oh sweet. Yeah. Look at this. I got a torch.
*  Cigar torch. I could smoke a cigar with you. Oh sweet. That's legal. Ari and I were thinking
*  that when we started Sober October, we started smoking cigars, we were thinking maybe that
*  will disqualify us and we could just quit. Yeah, what does... like, kibucha has alcohol.
*  Kibucha? Yeah. But it can't really get you drunk. You stay sober. You'd have to drink
*  a case of it to even catch a bug. But if you schedule a doctor's appointment, like a dentist
*  appointment, they gave you some pills or something. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You get lit up. Okay.
*  Yeah, like what if you get surgery? Like what if somebody got their appendix taken out?
*  Yeah, are you allowed to do any kind of like medication or medicine or... No, you have
*  to die. There's no real rules for that. I mean, look, it's not... the thing about this
*  contest that's really stupid is there's no consequences. Not even a friendly penalty
*  of like... No, there's nothing. ... open for someone. There's nothing. I could have a glass
*  one right now. Nothing could happen. Yeah. Oh no, I lost. Yeah. Oh my God, I lost. I'll
*  tell you what though, I've been getting a lot of messages from people that are inspired
*  and it makes me feel real good. I reached out to some dude yesterday on Instagram because
*  he lost something like 200 fucking pounds. I mean, it's crazy. That's the dude who had
*  the scars all over because he got his... the extra skin removed after he lost all the weight.
*  That's amazing. Sober October. Sometimes you just have to have a thing like that where
*  everybody goes, I'm going to do it too. And then it gives you the reason, like a motivation
*  to get going. Sometimes that's all people need, man. Yeah. I just got over the keto
*  thing. So now I'm just like, fuck that. I feel like I'm free again. Like I can have
*  normal food again. And that's hard to do, man. Keto's hard to do. It kind of got to
*  me to the point where now I'm doing the opposite. I'm just like, I want to eat everything because
*  I've been wanting to eat pizza for so long. Like Catholic school girls. Tell them to stay
*  away from tech and they can't wait to get ahold of one. 100%. That's what it is. People
*  don't like being told what to do. They don't like being forced into something that they
*  don't enjoy. That's why school is ineffective. That's why so many things don't work. But
*  the keto thing, the problem with it is I think it's a healthy thing for a lot of folks. If
*  you have epilepsy, apparently it's the thing because it can stop your seizures. You know,
*  there's people that have epilepsy, they get ketogenic and it just kicks it off. You don't
*  get seizures anymore. But it's boring. Every now and then I want pasta and also fruit.
*  I like fruit. That was the biggest one for me. Just fruit. Like watermelon. You know
*  how great just having some watermelon in the morning is? It's the most delicious fruit
*  ever I think. Like a good perfect watermelon on a hot day. My God. It's amazing. You know,
*  it's a fucked up fruit though because it's only racist fruit. You know, it's like the
*  only fruit that's attached to racism. There's no other fruit where you can make fun of someone
*  for eating and it's like racist. If you ever had that durian shit. Yeah, that's good. It's
*  not bad, right? But God, it smells horrible. It smells horrible. Have you had it, Jamie?
*  They have it in Thailand. In Thailand, they love it. I tried it in Thailand. It's like
*  this weird. It's like spiky looking. Yeah, spiky on the outside. Then the inside is kind
*  of mango like. Sort of like a pale mango. It's not my favorite, but I tried it, but
*  God damn it smells like dog shit. It smells so bad that they ban it in a lot of hotels
*  because people will go into hotels and you know, like folks that they come from a culture
*  where they eat that stuff all the time, they'll bring bags of it. The whole family's eating
*  that stuff and it wafts down the hallway and people are like, what in the fuck? It says
*  it smells like Limburger or has been compared to Limburger. Yeah, it's got a weird smell.
*  You can't take it on public transportation in some places either. Wow. Yeah, it stinks.
*  It's weird, but it tastes good. My friend did that fasting diet. You know, that's that
*  one that everyone's not fasting the one where you only eat like a small part of the day.
*  Yeah, I do that. Yeah. Intermittent fasting, intermittent fasting. And he woke up sleepwalking
*  one night and found out on his Nest cams, like his security cameras, he goes into the
*  bathroom passes and like not falls down and hits his head and he showed a picture. It's
*  just blood everywhere in his bathroom goes back to bed. Didn't even know about it wakes
*  up and he sees blood everywhere. I checked his cameras. Finally, sleepwalking a couple
*  days later, he starts having seizures like, like out of the blue goes to the doctor and
*  doctor says it's because of that, that diet he was doing his brain was starving. That's
*  what that doctor said. That doctor's making shit up. Yeah, you think that guy needs to
*  go to the neurologist. He's probably got a fucking brain tumor. One thing though, I did
*  know is that when I was on keto, I slept walked a lot and it was, I think it was my body trying
*  to find sugar. Really? Yeah. Cause I never sleepwalked cause I have cameras in my living
*  room and I can't do this on YouTube. Yeah, I know it's kind of weird. But when I was
*  on keto, I slept walk maybe 10 times. Haven't since I've been off, haven't slept walk once
*  and I was, can you say slept walk? Is that the right? Slept walk? Sleep walk. Is it sleep?
*  When you talk about past tense, is it sleep walked or slept walked? Slept walk. What is
*  it? It's sleep. I've never heard anybody say sleep walked. Yeah, it's probably sleep walked.
*  But I don't think I've ever heard anybody say it's past tense. You can't pass tense
*  the first part of the compound word. Oh, it's a weird one. It's a weird one. Slept? I slept
*  well last night, but I slept walked. Yeah. I did some sleepwalking. You could say that.
*  Sleepwalking? Yeah, but I think that's kind of interesting. I wonder if it was my body
*  craving sugar so bad that it woke me up. Cause I was like going through the cupboards trying
*  to find sugar. Oh, well that makes sense. Yeah, but I don't remember any of it. How
*  long were you keto for? Seven months. Yeah. Eight months. The intermittent fasting is
*  a good move because I think most of the time, look for me, I eat when I'm bored. I do it
*  all the time. Like when I come home from the store and I'm writing, I just start eating.
*  And then I'm like, what am I doing? Because I try to do intermittent fasting. So that
*  means if I come home and it's midnight and I'm writing and I start eating, that means
*  I can't eat until two in the afternoon the next day. And then just don't wake up till
*  two in the afternoon. I can't. I got work. I got stuff to do. I have kids. I have responsibilities.
*  I'm not like a Peter Pan like you. Right. No, I think that would be the diet that makes
*  the most sense, but because I already seem to only eat once a day, which that's not healthy
*  though to eat once a day. No, it's not. You should get a nutritionist. You got some cash.
*  You should hire a trainer and get a nutritionist. Yeah. I'm thinking about going back to Weight
*  Watchers. I'm almost at my fattest level. I want to get really fat and then take a picture.
*  You said that before. You were on a strategy before. I'm like, you keep saying you're going
*  to lose weight. You're like, I know what I'm doing. I'm going to get really big and then
*  I'm going to lose weight. I'm like, what? Because I always forget to take the before
*  photo and then I'm halfway through a diet. I'm like, God damn it. Now I'm just, I'm going
*  to quit this. Now I'm normal. Now it's like, oh yeah, but you didn't look that bad before
*  you diet. Right. I got my big fat beard on. Just this beard. It looks like I gained 20
*  pounds. Yeah. Just shave the beard at the end. It's sort of like when people get a tan
*  and their after photos and they look more ripped. Yeah. You know, like before after,
*  like the after you just tan bro. Tan with better lighting. Yeah. Yeah. I follow a lot
*  of bodybuilder girls and I don't know why it's disturbing to me, but when they start
*  cutting down weight and then you see them like monitoring their food and watching their
*  portions and shit and they're getting leaner and leaner, it bothers me. Like I get
*  nervous. Why? I don't know. I'm like, don't do that. Like, ugh, it's fucking why? Like,
*  what are you doing? Just losing all your fat just so you can get on stage and squeeze
*  everything and pose. I get it. You know, but I don't see, I don't think that looks the
*  best. That's why I don't understand. That's what weirds me out. I don't think it looks the
*  best, especially for ladies when you're like super shredded. It just doesn't. I don't even
*  like when they have those, those man shoulders, you know, where you see like a really beautiful
*  girl and then she takes off her cardigan or whatever. And you're like, oh, she has like,
*  her frame looks like a man. That doesn't bother me. I mean, she's durable.
*  It bothers me when they get shredded. I don't know why. I just see, it seems like they're
*  suffering. Like it's, it seems like a mistake. You know what I mean? Like, like I guess maybe,
*  I guess this is probably what it is. I guess I connected to anorexics because anorexics
*  legitimately freaked me out. There was this one girl that I used to do yoga with
*  and it was so sad, man. It was so sad. She would come in and everyone would be like,
*  fuck. She was like 80 pounds. Her whole body was bones. She was just bones.
*  Yo, Queen Phoenix and the Joker. Oh my God. What the fuck did he do to get down to that?
*  He lost 50 pounds. And his shoulder looked all fucked up too. Well, he was just posing in weird
*  ways to, I mean, he nailed that role, dude. He really. He hasn't seen it. I didn't want to
*  know spoilers. So you think I should go to the theater for this one?
*  No, you can watch it at home. Okay. I mean, it went to coming out at home. You'd have to wait.
*  It just came out. So you just have to wait. Oh, there's a new thing, apparently where you can get
*  home movies at home or home movies. You can get theater. No, no, not even torrents. You can get
*  it like legitimately and you pay quite a bit of money. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a some
*  new thing. Yeah, that should be a thing. Like you pay how many people would you normally go to a
*  movie with? Like four people, each ticket's about 20 bucks nowadays. Pay 60 bucks so you can rent
*  it for 24 hours. That would be the shit. Yeah. I wanted to do the opposite. I was trying to look
*  up to see how much it would cost to rent Interstellar to have a screening at the Chinese
*  theater in Hollywood. That was the coolest movie and sound I've ever seen. And I want people I know
*  to experience that. Oh, right. Right. Right. With good sound. It was fucking so awesome.
*  How much? Do you look up how much it is? You can do screenings there. I think you'd have to figure
*  out how much it costs to rent the print of the movie. Yeah. It used to be 35 millimeter prints
*  when I was a projectionist. People would rent like, hey, we just rented back to the future for our
*  company picnic. And you would like as a projectionist, you would get it in the mail with all the other
*  films. And you're like, what the fuck? Why is back to the future here? And I don't think it's that
*  much. I think it's only a couple hundred. Why don't we have a JRE movie night? That'd be perfect.
*  We rent a movie theater. Hey, that would be the shit. Where would we go though? Any big theaters?
*  I don't know. You know where you want to go. You want to go to the one of them Cineopolis,
*  Cineopolis. They have like drinks. Yeah. They have drinks and food and does the seats lean back.
*  You get an assigned seat. You could do those. Yeah. We should find out. Yeah. We could wanted
*  to watch those movies like that roar movie with the tigers or the other line. Oh, some stupid movies.
*  Well, according to Joey Diaz, the new Rambo is Roadhouse times a million. He goes, Joe Rogan,
*  you got to see this fucking movie. I was crying laughing. I was crying laughing. He goes, it's
*  Roadhouse times a million. It seems like it looks ridiculous. Well, he's a thousand years old and
*  he's fucking everybody up. I also read it was low budget though. Like, like really like what?
*  That's surprisingly low budget. Maybe he's like decided and he's going to keep all his money.
*  When you're that age, right? Like how old is Stallone now? Is he 77? 72 I think. Let's guess.
*  How old? 74. I bet. And do you think he's older or younger than Arnold Schwarzenegger?
*  I think he's older. How old is he, Jamie? I want to say 72, but I'd go with a year older.
*  Let's try. I'm saying 76. 74. 73. 73. Just turned 73 July 6th. Okay. So when you're 73, you got to
*  feel like at the most, if everything goes amazing, you got 30 years and the last 10, you ain't going
*  to remember shit. So you got 20 years to burn through a big ass pile of cash. What are you
*  going to do? You going to spend it all on Rambo movies? Yo, there's a fucking dog over here.
*  What is that picture? A fake coyote on a golf course. Why is there a fake coyote on a golf
*  course? Is that to keep like birds away or some shit? I don't know. Whatever the protection.
*  Come get me. What is he doing? Playing around. He's got some skinny legs, man. Take that picture
*  of his legs again. That is crazy. That makes me nervous that he can walk upstairs. Why is
*  his leg so skinny? That looks like an injury or something. Like his leg is shrunk. Doesn't that
*  look weird? I mean, he doesn't even look like he has any body right there. He's so jacked though.
*  Apparently in that movie, he's super jacked. He might have like knee and back problems though.
*  When you got back problems, man, your legs shrink. This is me when I was younger. I was fucking
*  jacked. When you, I know a dude who's got a severe back problem and one of his legs is like shriveled
*  up because his nerves aren't firing correctly. He went to Germany apparently and he got a bunch of
*  discs replaced and it just didn't work well. And he's just got all sorts of inflammation and scar
*  tissue and his nerves are blocked off. Like he, you know, he had a bunch of fucked up discs.
*  So we went and he got a bunch of them replaced in one shot and stayed over there for a few months.
*  And now his body's just fucking up like left and right. When you get Rick, real back problems are
*  fucking scary as shit. I sent Dean Del Rey to lifespan, lifespan medicine to deal with his neck.
*  Dean Del Rey has got a bulging disc so bad he's like, dude, I worry when people bump into me.
*  When people bump into him, he's in pain. I thought I had a stroke. Yeah. Like if you, if you pass,
*  if you pass by him and accidentally like bump into him a little bit, he's like, ah,
*  like he gets a stinger from a head banging or, um, no, from a motorcycle crash.
*  So messed up lady nailed him on a light over from a few years ago. Yeah. He got fucked up pretty bad
*  and it's not getting any better. Yeah. And it was so weird because he's like, I quit riding bikes,
*  you know, for after that, but then you got a bike like six months later and like,
*  what the fuck are you doing? You, you, you almost died. Well, I think for Dean, you know,
*  he's trying to make some, he bought a nice car, like a Porsche. He had a great deal on it. And
*  then he flipped it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not flipped it like died, like in a crash, like Kevin Hart style.
*  He, uh, just, he turned it over and made some money. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that's
*  when he bought a bike. Yeah. I guess people who love bikes, man, they, they think it's worth the
*  risk. Fuck that out here. I can't believe that there's not more of those scooter deaths everywhere.
*  I know, right? Yeah. Dude, those things are goddamn fast. When we were in Denver, they're everywhere
*  and everybody's riding those electric scooters all over the place. You're like, is that really
*  how you want to go out? You tried mine yet. Did you know, is it fast? 24 miles an hour.
*  Dude, yours looks pretty good. Way faster than those bird to all this. Do you trust that shit?
*  I don't trust that shit anymore. I flipped over my bike a couple of years ago. I'm like something
*  that's a message. I know too many people that are broken. My friend broke both of his arms on one
*  of those scooters. He flipped and he landed on his arms, both of his arms. And he had to have his
*  mom live with him for like a couple months because he couldn't do anything. When I was doing a zoo
*  keeper with Kevin James, I did a lot of my own bike riding and I fucking wiped out hard because
*  I didn't realize that if you're, we were in this scene where he was beside me and I was trying to
*  hit him with a flag and he was beside me on his bike and I was holding on to the handlebars with
*  my left hand, which is your front wheel. So when I hit the brakes on my left hand, I just went
*  flying over the top of the handlebars. I didn't do it just once either. I fucking wiped out pretty
*  hard. Like here, watch. It shows in slow motion. DVD extra. Hey watch. Yeah. It's a pretty good
*  wipe out. Yeah. That's exactly what I did on my bike. I flipped over like exactly like that.
*  But I got lucky. Didn't get hurt. But it's just luck. You know, you land on your arm wrong. Your
*  elbow goes backwards and then you're fucked. And then I was just grabbing the break to the wrong
*  break. Yeah. Yeah. I just went over the fuck, went over the handlebars, but you can, you know, bikes,
*  you could get fucked up. When I was in Utah recently, we were driving down the road and
*  we saw this lady fall on her bike. She was across the street on the other side and she was trying to,
*  she was trying to do something and she just got tangled up in her pedal and just dumped over and
*  landed on one arm, tried to post on her left arm and snapped her arm. And then she couldn't get up.
*  She was screaming. So we went over and pulled over and uh, people don't know how to deal with
*  injuries. So people are like, okay, let's take your backpack off. I go, don't touch her. I go,
*  she has a broken arm. Listen to me. Don't touch her. You know, and I'm like, listen, we got,
*  we're going to get you a hospital, you know, we'll get you an ambulance. It was lucky that
*  she was like a block away from the police station, but people want to do things. They want to like,
*  okay, let's take her arm and put it in a splint and let's, let's, let's tape it up. No, no, no,
*  don't do shit. Yes. Neck injuries also in back, like car accidents. People are like, not even.
*  Well, Kevin Hart's accident, they pulled them out of the truck, out of the car. And then they took
*  him to his house. I'm like, and he had three broken vertebrae. Like, yeah, don't, don't do that.
*  Don't touch anybody. Like you can, like, you can just yank someone the wrong way after an injury
*  and make them way, way worse, especially some like this lady's arm was so obviously broken.
*  The cops didn't even notice it. The cops came over and they're like, oh, so how's everything
*  right now? Are you feeling okay? Anything wrong? I go, she's got a broken arm. He's like, where's
*  the arm broken? I go, look at her left arm. He's like, oh, like, like, look, her fucking left arm
*  was so broken. It's like when you see someone's broke, like broken bones and unfortunately I'm
*  really used to it. I see so many injuries from fights, you know, from the UFC. I'm so used to
*  seeing breaks and things broken. I'm like, I just looked at it. I'm like, yep, that's, that is like
*  her elbow was like her arm went straight and her elbow went back. I'm like, we're not moving. Don't
*  take her backpack off. But she started hyperventilating. She had never broken anything.
*  She was 50. She's like, I've never broken a bone before. I'm like, it's not a bad one. It's just an
*  arm. Like you're going to be all right. Put it in the cast, you know, six weeks from now, you're
*  going to be laughing at this. People sign your cast. You'll have a funny story. You know, it's
*  just a broken arm. Have you ever broken an arm, Jamie? I knock on wood have not broken a bone.
*  No bones. What about you? Same here. We got that Ohio water.
*  Get the good dairy. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. Ohio dairy that in no contact sports.
*  Big football state. Come on, Joe. Did you play football? Yeah. Not, not in high school, but
*  up to high school, up to high school. Well, when you're a little kid, it seems like you can just
*  get fucking plowed over and you're, you bend and they throw you into each other. They're just,
*  the dads will just grab you and just smack you into each other. But kids are so light.
*  They're so light and they just bounce off each other. I was going to, when we talk about bikes,
*  have you seen this before? I'm going to play this video, but fuck this. Yes. It's called the like
*  mountain of hell. There's another name for it too. I can't remember like mountain,
* ocalypse or something like that. They start in France on the top of the Alps,
*  2000 bikers. Is that snow? Yes. On the top of a glacier, you end up going like 5,000 feet
*  downhill. So it gets like a mile or two down. You go through riding on ice. Yeah. These are the guys
*  in front, but here in a second when they have to turn, it creates this fucking insane pile up of
*  you can't avoid. Yeah. So you have to be in front. Oh my God. It'll happen here in a second. Here's
*  the first one. And then it just causes a major pile up. Bing. You're just getting fucked up. Bang.
*  Boom. And then dudes are trying to dive out of the way. Yeah. And you're just going downhill.
*  It's like on a ski slope, but everyone's on mountain bikes for those that are listening.
*  Oh, now. Oh, it's like ants. And then dudes are breaking early to try to avoid it. And they're
*  just wiping out at the top. Oh my God. This is what a stupid thing to do. When you know that that
*  many people are going to crash, like this guy on the outside trying to go, fell on his own. I haven't
*  made it down there yet. There's still the top. Yeah. And then you're going to try to figure out a path,
*  but you can't really hit the brakes, right? You're on ice. You're going downhill on ice. So I don't
*  know how that works. This is so dumb. Look at that. Boom. But if you make it out of there,
*  you're safe and you get to win. What is that? What do you win? There might be some money at the end.
*  I don't know. It's like doing sober October. For you and croissant. You get a croissant. Yeah. It's
*  just like sober October. It's just stupid. Yeah. Well, the best thing, I really believe the best
*  thing about sober October is it inspires people that actually do have a problem. Burt Kreischer
*  inspires people to... Burt Kreischer. And here's a crazy thing that Burt Kreischer told me,
*  because Ari Schaffer and him had a little bit of an incident with some MDMA. I don't know if you
*  know about that. Burt said that ever since taking that MDMA, he has zero desire to drink. He said
*  it really cleaned it out and that he heard that when you take ecstasy, that ecstasy kills your
*  desire to drink, that it does something to make... It makes drinking seem really silly. And he said
*  he's super focused. It probably was actually, honestly, a really good thing for him if he
*  hadn't done it in a while, because there is positives for doing it. I mean, circumstances
*  were not the best. The circumstances were the worst. At home with his kids, Ari dosing them.
*  But he said that he feels amazing and that he really does feel focused and clear.
*  That's great. If Ari would have done it to me, I wouldn't have cared as much. But...
*  Yeah, but your body's like a fucking... I know. I was wondering because I did his podcast the
*  day before. You wondered if he was going to dope you? I was wondering if he did, and then it was
*  like, oh, that didn't work, because we ended up podcasting. Red man's sitting around hoping he's
*  getting drugged. But it was a four hour podcast. And I'm like, did I? Because we did smoke a lot
*  of weed, but I'm like, did I? Maybe I was... Nah. Nah. Well, I remember I gave Chris McGuire
*  some weed and he was sure that it was laced with something. He was sure, he was like,
*  this is not regular weed. There's something in this. He was really paranoid that there was
*  something in it. If you're not used to this California weed and you don't smoke a lot,
*  and then you're like, oh, all right, I'll have a couple. Come on, guys. And you get peer pressured
*  into it. Yeah. Well, I had something the other day that fucked me up. Because they don't tell
*  you, especially when you're at the comedy store and everyone's just passing joints and stuff.
*  This one person was one of those weed fanatics where he had put keif on it and whatever oil,
*  THC oil. It had like three things on it. Those guys can fuck off. Yeah. Those guys,
*  they give you these joints and it's got like, it looks golden when you open it up. It's just got
*  so much keif and all the oils and the hash oil. That's ridiculous. Why do you want to get that
*  high? What is wrong with them? Their tolerance, I guess. I don't understand it because I could
*  take two hits of the shittiest joint and be like, you know what? That was great. I'm fine.
*  If you ever do be real smoke box, be very careful. Oh yeah. I've been asked to...
*  Please be careful because you got to drive home after that and you don't even know where you are.
*  If it wasn't for navigation systems, I'd still be living in downtown LA. Yeah. I would have never
*  figured out how to get home. That's what the Tesla comes in for. Let it drive for you. Yeah.
*  It's like these guys just smoke all day every day and to them, that's their baseline. Like their
*  normal is just being super duper high. So they're used to it. We got so high before we even got into
*  the car. And then you get into the car with the cameras in it and they do like this podcast and
*  you're like, it's surreal. It's like an out of body experience. Yeah. And you feel really paranoid
*  and really worked up like, oh. Yeah. No, thanks. I don't like that shit. I don't like that. Why
*  even bother doing that? No one likes that. They do. Obviously somebody likes that. There's people
*  that like that. Yeah. They put the leaf blowers full of weed and just blow it on each other.
*  There's tons of videos of that going on. Yeah. Like high times conventions and
*  yeah. Cannabis cups. They take a leaf blower and they pump a bong up. Yeah. It's ridiculous.
*  I mean, but this is like, these are the arguments for weed being illegal.
*  It's like, look at these idiots. It's also butt chugging, but butch. Yeah. But the thing is like,
*  it's weird. It's like we have this line of personal responsibility, right? You can go to any bar and
*  they don't check to see if you've already been drinking. They don't know what your tolerance is.
*  They don't know anything. You get any bar, you give me two shots of Jack Daniels and a gray goose
*  on the rocks. They just give it to you. Bang. Nobody cares. They just think you could figure it out.
*  You know, how much of a responsibility does a bartender actually have? A lot. Who then? Yeah.
*  They can go. They can go to jail too. The bartender can. If they don't stop you. I think. Yeah.
*  That to me is so ridiculous. I don't think the bar, I think.
*  Overserved. Like if you get over served and they can prove it, you're just as responsible if he
*  like drives home drunk and kills somebody. Do you? Well, if you know someone's going to drive,
*  the problem is like, I was talking about this on stage once that the real problem with drunk driving
*  is not that people can't drive when they're drunk. The problem when you're drinking is you don't know
*  if you can drive or not. You don't know how drunk you are because you're drunk. Like you might have
*  three drinks and you might fail a drunk driving breathalyzer, but you might be able to drive
*  perfectly. You know? But if you have four drinks or five drinks, you might think it's okay to have
*  six or seven. Like you don't know where you are. You don't know like where you are on the spectrum
*  of drunk or not drunk when you're really drunk. That's part of being drunk. You don't know what
*  the fuck's going on. That's why like, that's why the consent issue when you're really drunk is weird.
*  You know, it's because it's like some people like to get drunk and have sex and then some people say,
*  well, you should never have sex with someone when they're drunk because they can't consent
*  because they're drunk. Okay. But then that's like 90% of all people having sex.
*  How many people have sex while they're drunk? I only have sex when I'm drunk. I have to be drunk.
*  Dealing with a bunch of stuff.
*  Yeah. Well, I think autonomous cars, it's gonna, that's gonna be very interesting how they deal
*  with alcohol and autonomous cars. Because if like you have a drunk mode, like if autonomous car,
*  like say if you have a Tesla in 2026, right? And it has the option to be completely autonomous,
*  it drives on its own or you can go manual. So it detects that you're drunk. It says, Mr. Redban,
*  you are intoxicated. We would like to drive. And then you have to let it take you. Like,
*  would you get, do you think there's going to be a come point in time where drunk driving doesn't
*  apply because your car is going to drive you home? It makes the final decision for you. I'm all for
*  it. Like just wouldn't be hard to have a breathalyzer on a car. I did do that now. Yeah. I have a friend
*  who he, he got arrested for a DUI, like more than one. And he had to blow into his thing on his van,
*  his work van. He had a blow into his little thing before it would let him start the car.
*  This is another demolition man coming full circle again, because there's that scene where he gets
*  in and he makes the car. He's like, give me, give me control. And she's like, what the fuck are you
*  doing? You're going to drive? He's like, yeah, manual control. Give me that shit. And he chases
*  after it. What year was demolition man supposed to be in? Now, I think I'll double check.
*  I might need to watch that again. They're doing that THC, a breathalyzer next year.
*  What are they going to find out? Supposedly it detects there's THC. Like if you have smoked in
*  the last whatever three hours. The problem with that is there's, I don't, they've done studies
*  that show that people drive well when they're high. You know, they have done studies. There's
*  been these tests and they're not, you know, it's not randomized double blind placebo controlled
*  studies, but they are, they have done some studies when they show that people drive well high.
*  I know they have. Look at me. 2032 is when I take it. That's actually pretty close. It gets frozen
*  for 36 years and wakes up in 2032. Oh, wow. Isn't that funny? What they used to think is going to be
*  going on. You know, like, yeah, 2000, they'll just be able to freeze you.
*  Wasn't that back to the future that was like 2017 or something like that? Oh yeah. And then you look
*  at it, you're like, yeah, when they came back, yeah, the second one, back to the future too.
*  Yeah. I don't know what it's like. Nobody ever gets it right. Like they get a couple things right,
*  but everybody thinks we're going to be way more advanced than we are. Remember space 1999? Do you
*  remember that? What's that? That was a TV show. Oh, they thought that 1999 we're just going to be
*  flying around in spaceships and living on the moon. They're always wrong. Where was the Jetsons
*  supposed to be? That was like 1950. What year was that supposed to be? Yeah, the Jetsons,
*  they had flying cars, but see the problem with three dimensions is you got to keep people locked
*  into grids because that way you can keep them from just going up or down or left or right,
*  randomly like birds and slamming into each other. That's probably how it's going to be though. It's
*  probably going to be automatically, you could only do it with the Tesla driving. Right. Right. If it
*  goes flying, you mean, do you think they'll have that? Yeah, because they would have to stay in a
*  grid. There have to be some kind of traffic to that. People can't be flying all over, like you say,
*  all over the place. So they'll have to have like lanes in the sky, but by that time we're probably
*  not going to have any control of it. It's probably all going to be. Probably, right? Yeah. Well,
*  that's why helicopters are so weird because helicopters, if you get a pilot's light, like
*  when I went up with Burr, I was surprised at how much freedom you have. Like we were flying around
*  downtown LA. He was like, let's go here. You just take a left in the sky, go right, go down, go up,
*  go around here. We were, we were really close to buildings and you'd be amazed at how many buildings
*  in downtown LA have helicopter pads on the roof. And so you land on the roof, you get out, you open
*  a door, you go downstairs, you avoid all the bullshit. Apparently that's the move in New York
*  City. Tommy Buns was saying that, right? I think it's called. Yeah. Uber has, Uber has helicopter
*  now in New York City. Uber helicopter. Imagine some chatty Uber driver that's flying a fucking
*  helicopter and won't shut up. That's what Kobe Bryant did when he first got like his first big
*  contract. I heard he moved down to Orange County and was just flying a helicopter every day to
*  practice downtown. Imagine flying a helicopter to the store. Be sick. Yeah. If he just goes super baller,
*  Kevin Hart style, put a fucking helicopter pad on the roof of the store. Probably one on the higher,
*  right? No. Oh no, they have a rooftop like bar up there. Yeah. I mean the, the next door,
*  when was the last time it was the Hyatt? You weren't even living here. It wasn't that long ago.
*  Yeah. It's been a while. I stayed there when it was the Hyatt. Really? Yeah. But it might've been 10
*  years ago before I actually lived here. That's probably what it was. Yeah. It seems like it's
*  been, when, what was it when that dude jumped off of it? Oh, that was a long time. That was before
*  our time. Well, it was the seventies, I think, because it was during the strike when people
*  didn't get paid to do comedy at the store. Right. And the guy who jumped off, they said he wasn't
*  even good. It's like one of those guys that's like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to fucking do this for
*  everybody. And everybody's like, Hey man, you're not even really working. You know what I mean?
*  Like there's always those guys. That's one of the weird things about the store.
*  There's, there's comics that are hanging around there that are all working, you know, and then
*  there's a few people that will never work and you know, they'll never work and they know that
*  never, but they're always, they're kind of comics because they've done it a few times. Right. They're
*  more just there for the bar. They're there for the hang. The hang. Yeah. But it gets weird, right?
*  All of a sudden they're in your conversation and yeah, there's a lot of people like that,
*  but luckily lately I haven't, there hasn't been as many, I don't think,
*  because I think they've been kind of getting called out more by other comics.
*  Wow. It gets weird. It's, you know, can you imagine if that was the case with other occupations,
*  you know, like CEOs of corporations, hang out with people who want to be CEO, but they never
*  really started a business and they're all just hanging out together. It's one of the weird things
*  about art is that anybody can create it and no one's to say that someone who sucks
*  can't just figure it out. There's nothing stopping you from figuring it out,
*  but something is like something keeps you from figuring it out, but you don't know what it is.
*  Like how many comics do you know that used to suck and that became good? I know a few. I know
*  quite a few. I know some of them, some of them who struggled early in the day and you're like,
*  wow, I don't know about this guy. I hope he makes it. And then look, look, Sebastian had a hard time.
*  Sebastian used to have a hard time. Now he's one of the biggest comics on the planet earth.
*  He's fucking huge. My friend, Mark Deligrate sent me a picture of Sebastian on stage
*  at Boston garden in the round, 18,000 people. And I'm like, look at him, look at him. Like,
*  I remember when he was, I remember when he was first starting out, he was, he's like a great
*  success story. He really is. Cause he was a waiter at the four seasons. He was waiting tables and
*  also doing standup at night. You see him. He makes me laugh. He's fucking hilarious. You see him at
*  the MTV music awards this year. Yeah, that, that was a mistake. I could have told him that was a
*  mistake. But it's still funny. Like he's coming out to like, he's like, Hey, he's, you know,
*  I don't know. That's like, that's like a bad, like higher, like, uh, it doesn't make sense.
*  Nobody wants to do it. Who the fuck wants to do it? Jesselnecks not going to do it. You know,
*  who the fuck's going to do it? Who are you going to get to do it? Jeff Ross, would he do it? He
*  would. Yeah, he would definitely do it. He'd probably do it. I mean, you can probably get
*  some comics to do it. And then Jeff could probably pull it off. He's that's, that's like his kind of
*  gig, fucking around, talking shit, writing jokes about it. But Sebastian is like, he's Sebastian.
*  That's his thing. His thing is being Sebastian. Right. Kind of old school, you know, that's his
*  joke. Like these phones, you know, whatever. But you don't want to see him like host something. You
*  want to see him do an hour set. You want to see him do his set. You don't want to see him host some
*  fucking malarkey award show, bunch of music that you know, he doesn't listen to. He's probably
*  listened to the temptations every night and shit. You know, who does he listen to? Probably goes to
*  bed to Frank Sinatra. Springsteen, dude. What are you talking about? I did it my way. On repeat.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He probably plays it over and over again. Yeah. The summer winds came blowing in.
*  Did you see the Phil Hartman documentary? No. That was interesting. I didn't know a lot of it. They
*  really, really, you're in it a little bit. I didn't know a lot of things. One thing I didn't
*  notice how they gave you a part in the show where it was supposed to be Phil's character
*  writing you or something like that, like a will or something. And they gave it to each person
*  of the cast and they didn't let you read it beforehand. So that when you were reading it
*  in the show, it was actually your first time reading like this letter that was supposed to
*  be from Phil. Yeah. And I didn't know that. That was amazing. Yeah. That was, that was one of the
*  weirdest moments of my life. You know, getting phone calls that he was dead. The phone just
*  kept ringing. People just kept calling and friends and loved ones and family members. And
*  it was just, it didn't seem real. Like who would kill that guy? He was the nicest guy.
*  I wish you had met him. He was so cool. Like fucking everybody liked that guy.
*  And he used to like to get high and go to strip clubs.
*  Yeah. He's like to get high and go to strip clubs, get high and ride around his boat.
*  I went to a strip club with him. Do you remember which one? I think it was Bob's classy lady.
*  I think that's what it was called. I don't think it's around anymore, but he had an appreciation
*  for these young ladies that was like, it was, it was almost childlike,
*  but it wasn't creepy. He was like, God, you're beautiful. You look at me. Cause he was high.
*  He was like, you look amazing. This is incredible. Like he was having a good time.
*  He was a, he was a really, really unique character. I remember there was a guy who was,
*  um, some guy was blackmailing him and, uh, some guy had filmed him at a strip club with his wife
*  and his wife was getting a lap dance and he was getting a lap dance too.
*  And the guy was like, he wrote some really creepy letters saying that this is going to
*  violate the policies. Cause you know, Phil had had endorsements and commercial deals and he was
*  doing movies and stuff like that. He was just blowing up, got a Ferrari, you know, he was
*  blowing up and, um, this guy had, uh, went to his house and nailed this VHS tape in an envelope to
*  his garage door. And, uh, I was with him on, on a phone call. So it feels like I'm going to talk to
*  him right now. I'm going to come, come, come, come in my room. So I went in his dressing room
*  and the guy calls me and he was like, Hey, what's going on, buddy? He was talking to the guy. Like
*  the guy was his friend and they were setting the guy up and you know, Phil was going to give him
*  like, I forget what the money was. Tens of thousands of dollars. Meet me at this place
*  and I'll meet you there. And he had, uh, these, uh, for lack of a better term, he had someone who's
*  a dangerous person meet this guy and let him know in no uncertain terms that his life was going to
*  take a terrible turn for the worst. If he continued down this path. And, but it was, uh,
*  it was weird to see like someone trying to exploit him. And the guy was so dumb, he actually met with
*  Phil, like Phil knew who the guy was. Like he saw his face, you know, he was there with the guy and
*  the guy was like, look, you know, I just need some money. And Phil's like, I get it. It's no big deal.
*  You know, just, it's weird when you see someone trying to like prey on, like they think that's
*  their way out. Like, this is my way out. I'm just going to get this guy to give me some money and
*  I'm going to put it all together. You get it, Phil. I mean, I just need some money. He's like,
*  I get it, buddy. No big deal. It was just playing this guy along until the dangerous men came and
*  talked to him. Wow. They also really focused a lot on the wife, which I didn't really know much about,
*  about how she wanted to be an actress also. And like she was trying to get Phil to like put her
*  into shows and do that, you know, stuff like that. And she was very resentful of him. Yeah.
*  She would insult him. I consult him publicly. Like, uh, it was just really gross. It was sad
*  that he didn't think he should get divorced because he felt like it was bad for his image.
*  He was like really concerned about his image because he was like this squeaky clean family guy
*  who was, you know, I mean, it was really starting to take off for him. See, Phil didn't really make
*  it until he was older in life. Like, I don't think he was, I don't think he got on Saturday
*  live until he was in his like late thirties. Might've been older than that. Yeah. When he
*  was on news radio, I think he was like 46. Yeah. So he was like, he had worked as a graphic artist,
*  you know, he that you see that, um, uh, album cover that's out there pinned to the wall. Yeah.
*  That's him. Yeah. He drew that. Yeah. He's drawn a few amazing things. I was very surprised about
*  that. He's a super versatile guy. He could do a lot of different things and his work ethic was
*  amazing. Like he would have a binder and his scenes, he would have different color tabs for
*  each scene and he would go over his notes and go over his lines. Like I'd never seen anybody do
*  it. Like none of us did. No, none of the rest of us did. Like the only, the only one who's like him,
*  like Steven Root was even more different than him because Steven Root was a character. Like you played
*  Jimmy James and he in real life is like the sweetest, most normal guy. But when he was
*  playing that character, like he would become this Jimmy James guy. He'd be like, Oh, he was spooky.
*  Like you've seen him in a million, like off. Uh, what is the movie? Like staple. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Stapler. Yeah. What is that movie? Off the space. Yeah. Yeah. He was great in, um, that new Western
*  too. What is it? The, uh, ballad of scrubs, buster scrubs. What is it called? It's a Cohen
*  Brothers thing, right? Isn't it? Yeah. It's really weird. Have you seen that? No, I haven't seen it.
*  It's very weird. It's very weird. It's really good, but it's like, Whoa, all right. It's just weird.
*  You know, but, but Steven Root is in it. It's amazing. He's just a real actor. You know,
*  one of those dudes, I would never do a sitcom again ever, but I'm so glad I did do it. Like I learned
*  a lot and it was a great experience. You see Andy Dick got arrested again. Yeah. I, if you and Tommy
*  weren't like buddy cops, you wouldn't do that. Um, shooting people with guns. I do a sketch.
*  Yeah. Who cares about TV anymore? Right? Like it's anything I don't watch any TV shows except for
*  the South parks and the, you know, the cartoons and stuff, but there's not like a sitcom I give
*  a fuck about, you know, they don't really exist anymore. I caught up on Mexican Joker last night.
*  It's great. I was trying to catch up cause I saw their, they have a new one tonight. They got
*  controversy with China for those. Those are the guys that still to this day, I look forward to
*  watching every week. They go hard in the paint. Do you see the response that traded to China? No.
*  No. So yeah, trade did an official response to China. And that that's what
*  explained to everybody what happened. So they had a South park had an episode that kind of mimic or
*  made fun of the MBAs response or the president of the MBAs response to China that was in the news
*  recently. And it's about how Hollywood edits their films. Like Iron Man three has a whole
*  12 minute scene that they added just for the Chinese release. They like make things to make
*  China happy so they can make more money. Cause there's so many millions of people in China.
*  What did they add?
*  You know, I, it was a scene of an Asian doctor in like, I think they were taking out the thing in
*  his chest and saving his life or something like that. They added Asians to it. And I think they
*  cut a lot. This happens a lot in Hollywood, I guess they, they, they edit for like a Chinese
*  version where they even add stuff to it and make it more Chinese happy. So that, so Trey Parker and
*  Matt Stone made this whole episode about that. And of course, you know, they got banned from China,
*  China scrubbed the whole internet free of everything.
*  Official apology to China from Trey Parker, Matt Stone, like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese
*  censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy.
*  What, how do you say XI?
*  Xi, I think.
*  Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10.
*  Long live the great communist party of China. May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful.
*  We good now, China? Oh my God, he's the best.
*  He's the best. They are the best.
*  They are the best. I love them.
*  They're the best. We too love money. Say that, pull it, put the exact quote again. What does it say?
*  We too love money more than freedom and democracy.
*  I like how he said also Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. I like it.
*  Yeah.
*  Just adding that just.
*  Oh my God. 300th episode.
*  Oh, I love it. That's a lot. We welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,
*  like the NBA. Well, the NBA thing is a weird one, right? Like the guy, like he's,
*  he's like super social justice warrior. He's always criticizing this and that. When it came
*  to China, he's like, huh, everything's really good over there.
*  Oh, the, the commissioner of the NBA?
*  What did he say?
*  Yeah. I don't know what he said necessarily.
*  He definitely soft-pedaled.
*  Yeah. He's flung over there now to like have a meeting about it.
*  Yeah. And there's a, there's a chance even that I heard that he might even
*  could even get fired from this because that's how much money that NBA as a company is going
*  to be losing from China. Now, what is the big deal about China? They just like basketball
*  or is it just just a giant market?
*  Just so many people.
*  Yeah. They've got them hook line on, on basketball since like y'all main back in the
*  15 years ago got in there.
*  What about Lynn sanity? Is that still going on?
*  He got popular. He's he, uh, signed to play over there this year, actually.
*  What happened with him? He took off. He was kicking ass for like a very short period of time.
*  He had a very good NBA career. He just won an NBA title with the Toronto Raptors.
*  But how come people stopped talking about him?
*  It was a hype train that happened and he like had a very good run of like 10, 12 games. He was in
*  part of it was he was in New York with the New York media train, the Knicks. They weren't very
*  good. They're still not very good now, but, um, that it all got wrapped up in all that kind of,
*  um, and then he got sent off to another team. And once you're in a small market,
*  everyone kind of forgets about you.
*  The whole China thing is very strange, man. We got hit up by someone from Huawei
*  wants to come on the podcast. Yeah. No, thanks. Good. Yeah.
*  Oh, the phones.
*  Yeah. Drop some phones off that listen to everything you do. Follow you home.
*  That's, that's really interesting.
*  That'd be like one of those phones you leave at work and you wake up in the morning and sit on
*  your sink. Hey, no fuck what's going on here. Hey man. I feel like a black mirror episode.
*  Those Huawei phones are fucking bad ass though. That's the thing. It's like,
*  look, I went, no, here's the deal. Okay. I gave a thorough examination. I went from the, uh, iPhone
*  10 S max, whatever the fuck the last one was. Um, and then I got a note 10
*  and then I got the new one, the iPhone 11 X max pro fuck your mother, whatever it is, the note
*  can't fuck with it at all. Right. The notes just not as good. It's clumsy. They're not as good.
*  They're clunky. They're, they're keyboard sucks. Worst keyboard ever made. I don't understand why
*  people don't bitch about that more than there there's ad, you could add those other keyboards,
*  they're a little bit better, but not Apple just got the keyboard down, down, down. It's like,
*  you don't realize how much better Apple's keyboards are until you try. And this is only on
*  their phones. Their laptops are dog shit. The laptops keyboards are so bad. I got a 15 inch
*  one. There's companies that take the old ones, the old 15 inch ones from like 2012 and they put a
*  SSD card in it or, um, they do it, put a solid state hard drive in it and update the processor
*  and update the graphics. They update everything and they give you like one terabyte of storage,
*  but they basically pull modern internal components into the old shell. So you get the real keyboard,
*  a keyboard that you can actually feel the keys. You actually feel where they are and you feel them
*  moving around the new keys. Those flat fucking keys are just so bad. You're going to hate the
*  future of MacBook pros. So you might as well just switch over right now. Cause the definitely is
*  going to become a screen on the bottom as a keyboard. What? Yeah. They're definitely going
*  to use the hype, whatever feedback or that, you know, so it's so it's sound feels like you're
*  tapping on the screen, but you're actually just going to have a whole screen in the, they pulled
*  that, uh, pressure sensitive off the new iPhones. Yeah. So it's just long press now, but it's not
*  pressing because no one used it. Yeah. Nobody's very depressed or whatever. I used it. And I,
*  I'm one of the few people, cause there's one thing that they haven't replaced yet. Like a lot of the
*  other things you hold down, it does all what it used to do, but, uh, I don't know if a lot of
*  people didn't even know about it, but when you're on the keyboard and you just like hold your thumb
*  down, you used to be able to use it as like a, a mouse, like a cursor. So if you're trying to,
*  you know, be accurate with the spacebar, you can still do it. Now you hold the spacebar down.
*  Okay. Nevermind. Or just the spacebar. People don't know, explain that because it's pretty
*  dope. The spacebar, when you hold the spacebar down, you can move that cursor around anywhere
*  you want. Yeah. So it's really nice. Yeah. When you're typing or anything like that, it's like
*  having a mouse and a thing. Yeah. Thanks man. That was one of the, I was so bummed about that.
*  I'm like, I was like, like there was, I was, that was really pissing me off. Well, they do a lot of
*  things that you don't know what they do. Like a lot of people don't know how to make a screenshot
*  or how to do screen, screen record. There's like a lot of things that people don't know how to do
*  that. It's like, I mean, it's a really complicated device and most people will use like three tenths
*  of what it's capable of, but there's so much better than Android phones right now. I mean,
*  maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Huawei has a better keyboard, but the Samsung keyboard in comparison
*  to Apple, there's no competition. There's so much there. There's so less accurate and they,
*  their prediction, like prediction of like what you're going to say next is so bad. It just doesn't
*  work good. The notes, uh, camera was very good. That's very intense. I like the camera. I like
*  the focus video you could do. You can pretty much do the portrait mode, but in video mode, which
*  you can't do on the iPhone, which sucks. That's better. That's one thing that the note does
*  better. That pen, I never use that thing. Yeah, me neither. It's cute. I like having it around.
*  I like showing people, look, you can take a picture with it. You press the button. It works
*  like a remote control. Never used it once. Yeah. Did you see this, the new essential phone that got
*  leaked yesterday? Now I like this. I think I've talked about this before, how I wouldn't mind a
*  thinner skinner longer phone. Skinner? This is just leaked so they don't, we don't know. Slep walked.
*  What is that? It looks like a remote control. Yeah. That's the phone. It's a central phone too.
*  Can you show the video of it? Cause there's a video of it. Uh, that's really cool when he's
*  like scrolling through the, maybe that he's scrolling through the operating system. One
*  of the videos. It's a new Android operating system. They have put on the phone. I don't know if it's
*  going to have like things removed from it. Cause so is it their own thing? I think it's a proprietary
*  for them. Huh? Is that a camera on the back? That's a huge fucking camera. That's going to be like
*  one of the best cameras ever. Well, it's a really small phone. So like if that iPhone camera was on
*  something so thin, that would look huge too. And that's a, it's a very thin thing. It's like not
*  even, it's, it seems like it's almost half the size width wise of your iPhone. Why, why would
*  you want that? I don't get that. Different. Just everyone. I mean, I tell you what, hand cramping,
*  you like how, how wide the phone is. Like I'm constantly like trying to lean over. That's so
*  weird. I've are an Apple TV remote size. It looks like, yeah, exactly what it looks like. I like
*  that. Do you, I really do. Well, I'll tell you what though, who had, was it Dan Aykroyd? Who had the
*  old iPhone in here the other day? Oh, commander Fravor, David Fravor had an iPhone four when them
*  little, the, with us, the flat sides, metal. Yeah. The metal sides. It's so small. Like he was showing
*  me pictures on, I was like squinting to see the picture. That's so little, but it's so tiny. Just
*  like fits in your hand. Yeah. That's what I like. Cause my hand's sore. It hurts. Like I bet it's
*  at night. Like it's, it feels like I've been typing all day, you know, or stretching it out.
*  Is it really that big of a deal? My hands are way smaller than yours though. Yeah. But if you,
*  if you just got a smaller iPhone, just get the small one, I could barely reach over. Yeah.
*  Well, it's, it's, it's pretty big, but when you're watching YouTube videos, it's the shit.
*  I'll tell you what, that is one thing that, yeah, I have a hard time getting all the way over there
*  too. You guys have the max, right? The big one. Yeah. Yes. My girlfriend has the smaller one.
*  I have the, yeah, the smaller one. I like that better. My girlfriend has that size and I might
*  be the move. Cause it used to be a bigger deal. Like there was like a camera stabilization for
*  going to the small to the bigger one. Do we have any pop sockets here? We have the Jerry pop sockets.
*  Give me one. Nikki Glaser stole it. Did she? Well, I gave it to her. I thought there were more over
*  them. Well then that's not stealing. I know. I know. I'm sorry. Nick. She took it with some weed.
*  Oh, we gave her about five pounds of weed. I hope she didn't try to fly back with that.
*  Imagine if she got arrested. She has a new special, right? Yes. It's out right now. It's hilarious.
*  See, that's why I let her take that. That lady's fucking funny. She's great. She's very funny,
*  but a pop sockets. My point was if you have a pop socket, you just, that's way easier. You could
*  text like a motherfucker with a pop socket. Just slide that bitch right in there like that.
*  My new favorite thing, Joe, is Apple watch now allows you to record voice memos on your watch.
*  So when you're doing stand up, it's right there. So it's a perfect recording because it's right
*  next to your mouth. One thing though is to turn your phone on airplane mode before you do it.
*  Because then it sometimes switches to the phone mic. Oh, but what, so what I do is I put them
*  both on airplane mode. So then I have audience and then voice right next to it. So if I wanted
*  to mix it, I would have almost a perfect sounding stage recording. So it's two separate recordings
*  in the same show. Yeah. So if you keep your phone on the stool, you're recording the audience and
*  then you have your voice right next to it. Do you have to sync them up? Yeah. You just,
*  whatever, grunge. Okay. Wow. That actually sounds badass. Yeah. That actually makes sense. Like a
*  real reason to have an iPhone watch. Yeah. I like it. Also, you could monitor your sleep now. You
*  wear it or I guess it's coming soon, but you could wear it and tell us how many times you wake up and
*  it tells your heart rates and stuff. I already have that with this thing. I have this whoop strap.
*  This thing is amazing. This thing, it doesn't just measure that. It measures heart rate variability.
*  It measures all the disturbances, how much REM sleep you had, how deep your sleep was. It also
*  measures, because of heart rate variability, it measures how much you've recovered from your workout,
*  measures how many calories you burned. I mean, the application that comes with it, this whoop
*  application is fucking incredible. It's got, I mean, it takes a long time to learn all this shit,
*  but there's so much data that you get off of these things. And it gives you like these little things
*  to fill out, little questionnaires that lets you know, like here, my recovery today is only 16%.
*  But I just got done running though. So it's not a watch at all. It's just a strap. No, it's just a strap.
*  I like that. It doesn't tell you the time at all. It has no readout on it, nothing. You just keep it on you.
*  Oh, that's badass. Cause that looks cool too. Yeah. And it measures all your shit. It measures
*  your recovery, your strain. It's got a sleep coach. And so here with Sober October, we're all wearing
*  them. So we all get to see, like today, Burt, Burt the most, well, how is he number one when he burnt
*  1700 calories and I Burt 1800. Is it alphabetical order? Cause Burt? No, no, it says 12 point,
*  his day strain is 12.2, mine's 12.1, even though my activity was harder than his. Oh, look at this.
*  It's on the internet. They have a website, SoberOctober.com. Yeah, you can track it,
*  track it and watch it. No shit. Yeah. Cause I'm, I'm a big fan of this strap. This thing is really,
*  really effective. It's pretty fucking amazing. Maybe Ari's wearing Burt's strap for him because
*  he felt bad. No, Burt's not even talking to Ari. They're not talking right now. Oh, this is for
*  recovery. It depends on what you're looking at. I guess. Yeah. I mean, there's a bunch of different
*  metrics. Oh, sleep. You can look, so you can read your strain, your recovery. You can read your
*  performance, like how much, how many calories you're burning, how much, how much you've recovered,
*  how efficient your body is. It just lets you know where you stand physically. It also lets you know
*  whether or not you should push it or whether or not you should slack off. Oh, look, we're asleep.
*  Like look at all that shit, man. It's incredible. We're sleep Burt. Oh, of course. He's haunted by
*  Ari. Ari's the memories of Ari drugging him, keeping him awake at night. I was going to say
*  on the new, on the iPhone, something I didn't notice that you were getting close to was that
*  they added in the health app, your headphone audio levels. So it tracks how loud you're listening to
*  stuff over time. And it tells you when you're in a good or bad audio listening range. Like if you're
*  listening to shit too loud, you're starting to damage your hearing. So this then gets into the
*  Apple watch. They, if you turn it on, on your watch, it listens to the ambient sound. So if you're in
*  an environment, like in a city where it's too loud, it adds that into your, your audio health.
*  It gives you warnings also, because one thing I've been doing lately at the comedy store,
*  you know, the back, back, back place where you smoke the weed, you can download a audio meter
*  that tells you how loud it is. And so I've been down, I downloaded that a long time ago. It is
*  so bad back there when there's a lot of people back there that it's like emergency, get out of
*  that area. It's bad for your eyes or ears. It's like a bar. Yeah, I know, but it's way high,
*  higher. Well, yeah, you got a bunch of comics back there. It echoes off the,
*  oh, that's true too, right? The concrete and everything. Yeah. I would say though,
*  allowing them to listen to all these microphones, you're just giving them access to listen to you
*  everywhere. What are they gonna listen to you? Shit. I mean, that's where like, yeah, plotting.
*  Yeah. You're plotting against the government, Jamie.
*  What are you worried about? There's an article that went around recently about this stuff called
*  like a mesh network that's created with some of these cameras on people's doors. There's like a
*  test that happened in the LA basin. 700 cameras gave them access to almost the entire LA area.
*  Whoa. Because of the way that they link to each other. And there's like some like watchdog people
*  are saying that like, even if you're smart enough to like not do this, the person next to you might
*  not be or your neighbor might not be, they might have it on. And just because your proximity is
*  close enough, your iPhone knows that your iPhone's next to it. And it just goes, oh yeah, you were
*  here. Joe was there. Yeah, you can't, it's going to be really hard to pull shit off in the future.
*  And it seems like with all these nest phones and ring phones and, or, you know, not ring phones,
*  ring cameras and net cameras, nest cameras that people have on their front doors,
*  after a while, it's everywhere you go, you're going to be filmed. They passed a law, I think today
*  that the California like body cameras that cops use can't be used for facial recognition.
*  Like the ACLU got a law passed through that said like that won't be able to happen or something
*  like that. Too bad, but we would have caught a lot more people. That seems, that seems weird
*  because that seems like when you would want to use it. It's when you're a cop looking for bad guys.
*  It's like. Yeah, but I think what's happening right now that I've been reading is like there's
*  third party companies are getting access to that stuff and like they can buy it.
*  And that's where some of the discrepancies, because it's just happening too fast. There
*  aren't laws in place to stop some of these things from happening. I just think that's just like a,
*  there's lots of great area that can, people can maneuver in. It seems to be just a matter of time
*  before you have surveillance everywhere, everywhere you go, everywhere, everything is
*  available to everyone except inside your house. Like people are going to tin foil up the inside
*  of their bedrooms just to try to keep people out. And then you have the fucking television
*  that probably has a webcam on it. You know, people probably watching you. Fuck, Jamie.
*  They do watch, they'd listen to the, like some TVs have that stuff on to listen to what's going on
*  in your house and what your, do they cross references, audio signals? Alexa is serious.
*  All of that is. Yeah, they're listening to everything. I mean, even contractors who work
*  for Alexa and Apple pods and all that shit was, or I think Apple's one of the ones it did is,
*  is that Apple as well? Because Apple's pretty damn strict on privacy, which is kind of interesting.
*  It's one of the reasons why Apple maps is not very good because they don't collect data on everybody
*  the way Google does. Like the benefit of the Google map, the Google data collection is you get like
*  really detailed analytics on everything. And so they know exactly what's going on. That's why
*  something like Waze works so well because there's so many different people giving up information,
*  you know, that's mean it shows you where the slowdowns are and where the cops are. And,
*  you know, it's, it's, there's benefits to it. It's super effective, but the drawbacks are,
*  you're going down this weird road where these companies are selling your information.
*  And that's what, what Google is, is a company that provides you data. They provide you information,
*  but they're also selling your data. They're constantly selling what you're interested in.
*  Like if you ever went and like, say like you're interested in a watch, like I want to get a new
*  watch. Let me look at watches. Every fucking time you go to any website now, those Google ads will
*  be a watch. It's weird. It's like they're, they're, they're just tempting you like, come on, Jamie.
*  I was listening to a podcast about the beginning of the history of the internet. It's called like
*  Mintcast. This was a couple of months ago, but he was talking about how like when ARPANET was
*  starting up in the sixties, there were a lot of protests about just even turning it on because
*  people were new that it was going to be a surveillance system, like sort of like what
*  is happening now. Really? Yeah. Even back then? And the ability, it doesn't work if people aren't
*  using it kind of like it needs to spread and get grow. And that personal computing is sort of like
*  tied in and came along the perfect time for this to like grow more and like phones or is it even
*  the next, the next evolution of it now, but doesn't it make life better? I mean, there's
*  pros and cons, right? And the cons were all terrified of, but isn't it amazing that you
*  could just Google things? Yeah. Like, you know, like I, I said something the other day that I
*  thought was a line in a movie. I was like, is that a line in a movie? And my wife is just Googling
*  it. And she's like, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope. Like, how crazy is that? You can just find out like in a
*  movie, like how many goddamn movies are there? You just type in something in quotes and it'll say,
*  Oh, that was from the shining. And then bam, the lyrics for every song are on the internet.
*  Every song, every song. It's just the, the, the pros I think at least right now outweigh the cons.
*  It's just, we all wonder where it's going. That's what's scary. What's scary is the unknown.
*  You know, what's scary is this unknown surveillance state aspect of it all.
*  You know, it's just, it's better though. It's like, there are benefits. I've bought some of
*  the ads I've gotten shit for. I do it all the time. It's great. Well, John Carmack had an
*  interesting take on that, you know, you know, cause Carmack is the guy who created quake and doom and
*  all those games. And he was talking about Oculus and we were talking about technology and people
*  being addicted to their phones. He's like, yes, but it makes your life better. He's like, his take on
*  it was, but people's lives are improved because of this technology and that this is, you know,
*  like, yes, people do get addicted to be on the screens. But one of the reasons why is because
*  it seems better to them than not being on the screens. Like there's benefits. It's making their
*  life more enjoyable. I'm like, okay, but you're, I see how you're looking at it that way, but that's,
*  you know, convenient when you're in technology to look at it that way. But the people that look at
*  it, like in terms of like human beings and our connection with each other, like how much of it
*  is getting eroded because so much, I mean, how many times do you and I, unless we see each other at
*  the store, how many times do we talk on the phone? Like I called you up the other day and like, hey,
*  what's up? How you doing? I was like the first phone call of 2019. I've been doing that to people.
*  I called Santino yesterday. I'm like, I just want to talk on the phone, man. Can we talk on the phone?
*  Yeah. Like I think it's good to talk on the phone. I don't think people talk on the phone enough.
*  I definitely don't. Well, we're lucky too, in that our job, we go out at night, we see each other.
*  We all see our friends, you know, we talk. Like there's a lot of folks who don't do that. They
*  see each other at work during the day. And then at nighttime, they're sitting at home,
*  watching TV or staring at their phone and their interaction is severely limited.
*  Like our business is a social business. Like we're always out, you know, we're always out and
*  about and talking to people and interacting with people. But I think some folks today,
*  because of this technology, they're socially a bit stunted. And that's what I worry about.
*  Yeah, I see it 100%. I mean, that's, it's weird that how it's, you know, when texting came out,
*  everyone's like, who's texting? And that's kind of taken over from more people. Like I know a lot
*  of people that don't answer the phone anymore. And email addresses, I think that's kind of on the
*  way out. Who emails anymore? Unless it's like work or something like that. Like I mostly text or I
*  mostly message each other. I saw some girl complaining about people FaceTiming her. And she was like,
*  she was like, do you FaceTime me for no reason? She goes, that's like just knocking on my door
*  without telling me you're coming over. Don't just FaceTime me. She was angry. Don't be FaceTiming
*  me. People FaceTime people now though. That's the thing. Like Chappelle's FaceTiming. Really? Yeah,
*  he FaceTimes. That's the new talking with the phone open on speakerphone. Yeah. Well,
*  Killer Mike FaceTimes, he FaceTimed me. I was taking a shit. Yeah, I was watching. Did you answer? Yes.
*  I was watching Santino live. Santino was live on his Instagram and I popped in and he tried to make
*  me like join him. And I was all looking. I just woke up and I was very haggard and it was dark.
*  I was like, no, I'm not joining your shit. My eyes aren't even open. Like I can't do this. Don't be
*  scared, Jamie. Don't be scared of your looks. You're a wonderful looking man. How many ugly people
*  would be happy to look like you? Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think you and Joey and my parents are the
*  only ones that I answer phone or FaceTime. I'm calling people every day now. I call a lot of
*  people. I always call my wife. I hardly ever text her, but I'm trying to call more people.
*  I think it's a move that's a healthy move. You get a real conversation, a little back and forth,
*  a little laughter, joke around with each other. Texting is just so fucking impersonal, so bland,
*  open to interpretation. Yeah. Do you use the voice memo thing that the text messages allows you to use?
*  No. You know who does that, man? Alex Jones. He'll send me these long, Joe Rogan, what's going on
*  right now with the deep state? What are they trying to do with Trump? He'll send me these long fucking
*  voicemail messages that come in a text message, voice memos. Yeah. They go away too. They go away
*  after a few days. Oh really? I save them every time. They have a save button.
*  People are into those though, those little voice memos. I don't know why. Get to hear the voice?
*  I guess. No back and forth. That's true. But my voicemail is always full, so that's the sneaky
*  workaround. I keep my voicemail full. Get out of here with that thing. No spoiler alert,
*  but screening phone calls over answering machines popped up in that movie. And that was a thing that
*  I kind of forgot. Oh yeah. You used to be able to do, be like, hey, no, no, no, I'm here. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You would let it go to, hey, what's up, Joe? Not here right now. Leave a message. You'd
*  probably say something cool. Try to say, you'd have some cool music, like some white snakes playing
*  in the background. I get so many scam calls every day now that I spend most of my time just going
*  through my missed call list and then Googling the phone number to see if it's a scam scam call or
*  not. Is there a way to block that? Isn't there a robocall blocker? Well, T-Mobile does. New iPhone
*  thing lets you block numbers that you don't have saved. So it goes straight to voicemail. Yeah.
*  That's key because you know, if you don't have it saved, then you'll just check the voicemail later
*  or see that they called. Yeah. I don't check any voicemails. All my shit's off though. Like I have
*  it on like silent mode, do not disturb everything. So it might, I have to just make sure I check it
*  every like 15 minutes or so. Well, for me, I'm glad I got the note because I wanted to know what the
*  dark side was like. I was like, you know, cause I watched a lot of tech videos on phones and stuff
*  like that. And I was like, well, maybe Android has caught up. Maybe it is better. It's not still
*  clunky. It's good for watching YouTube. It's good for Googling stuff. It's good for Google maps. It's
*  really good for Google maps. Like Google maps on Android is it's native, you know, to Android. So
*  it's, it's actually slightly better than it is for iPhone, but that's it. They gotta have a,
*  when you connect it to your car, there's like an Android thing, Android play auto. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's okay. But like a lot of car manufacturers don't even fuck with it. Like BMW doesn't even
*  fuck with it. They use Apple car play. And if you have an Android, you can go fuck yourself.
*  They don't care. My Honda has both, which I thought was cool. So you could, it has the
*  Apple play and the Android play. Yeah. A lot of the aftermarket ones have both. I've never tried
*  Android auto. That's one bad thing about Tesla though. Huh? Yeah. I mean, he needs to do something
*  cause there's no messaging app on the Tesla. But I think that's better that way. You don't
*  fuck with it while you're driving. Yeah. But it's nice just to be at least like, Hey, you got a text
*  message, you know, or any, it doesn't have anything. I guess. I don't know, man. I just,
*  I think it's something, there's something good about not fucking with that at all while you're
*  driving. You know, if you can look at your phone, if you want to, it's still there. Yeah. But that
*  big ass beautiful screen's worth it. I like it though. When you know, the Honda, you just hit a
*  button and it just reads your text too. And so, Oh yeah. Like auto. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Apple car play.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That does that. I have that on my Toyota, but see the thing about Tesla is though,
*  their navigation system is so superior. Like what I love about it is it works like a phone
*  because it's all connected to the internet. So you could say to it, Hey, you know, navigate to
*  Tom's barbecue and they'll just bang and they'll just take you to Tom's barbecue. And it says like,
*  would you like to go on autopilot? Like, fuck yeah, I would. You press autopilot. Would you like us
*  to change lanes? Fuck yeah. Change lanes, bitch. It'll change lanes for you. I mean, it's, it's so
*  superior in like its application. Like the way, the way it, first of all, the screen is enormous,
*  right? So you're, you're looking at the entire grid of the city basically, and you see where you go
*  on a mile away. It's not like sometimes you're looking at like a little screen on a phone and
*  you're like, what is this next? Or is it the next block? Is it this one or the next one with a Tesla?
*  There's no confusion, you know, and you get it on the front screen on your dashboard. Yeah. You see
*  a part of like what's coming up next zoom. It's the closest part. Like, oh, there's the left right
*  there. Dude, it's so good. It's so good. And then driving it other cars feel stupid. Don't they?
*  Yeah, I tried to drive my Civic the other day and it sucks. Like this used to be the coolest car to
*  drive like fun. And now it just seems so dumb. They're dumb. Yeah, they're dumb. He's got me.
*  I like, I am, I am Tesla for life because of this. I don't know enough about all these analysts that
*  are predicting that Tesla is going to be doomed. Like some guys said that Tesla is going to lose
*  80% of its stock or go away. Like some financial analyst, like what they've been saying that
*  forever. What are they basing that on? I've read that stuff too. I, they have competitors that
*  don't want them to do good. That could be, I don't know. They're doing very good. Like they're talking
*  about like the new Porsche. I don't know if you saw that. Yeah, they're dope. But guess what? Try
*  to charge it. Try to go, try to go like across the country with that thing. They don't have the
*  supercharger network that Tesla has and that's everywhere. Why wouldn't they have the same
*  interface? The Tesla doesn't know that you have a Tesla, right? It just knows it's electric and it
*  goes into the socket. Like the charging port thing. Right? I don't know how that works. I think that's a...
*  Well, the one at the airport is just electric. Like yeah, you're using one of the airport.
*  Yeah, it's... You got to put on a little adapter, but who cares? When you're going to the airport,
*  you leave your car parked and you plug it in, you come back, it's fully charged. There's one in the
*  middle, LAX. Oh yeah. Oh, I don't know. Are they open? Like a lot of them open? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
*  That's a game changer. Well, it's hard to get them sometimes because a lot of people have electric
*  cars now, but I got one the other day. I was at the airport the other day. So everyone got mad
*  that you have to pick up your taxis and Ubers now like in a satellite lot or take a shuttle over there.
*  Well, they need that for the god damn comedy store. Those dorks always park right in front
*  of the driveway. You can't get in or out and it's a nightmare. Yeah. It's out of control. And they
*  get mad at you. Like, you're not supposed to be here, stupid. Yeah, it's out of control. But look,
*  at least less people are drunk driving. The congestion... To fix anything there is a great
*  idea. So I don't know like what you could plan about them doing anything, at least they're trying.
*  It's awful. Less traffic definitely. It just sucks. You mean LAX? Yeah, yeah, it's just the worst.
*  It's terrible. Well, I came home from Italy with my family at 11 o'clock at night and it was bumper
*  to bumper. It's the worst at night. It was so bad. I couldn't believe how many people were at LAX.
*  It's so bad. And then you go to like Salt Lake City and it's just smooth sailing. You know, you go
*  to a night, a smaller town airport. Salt Lake City is a goddamn hidden gem, kids. Five o'clock at night,
*  five o'clock PM, Tuesday night, nobody's on the road. It's just smooth sailing. They don't have
*  traffic. Their traffic is non-existent. The Mormons scare everyone away. Like it's beautiful,
*  the weather's gorgeous, they're surrounded by mountains, but everyone's like, ah, these Mormons.
*  And they get scared off and they don't move there. Yeah, I think Salt Lake's great. I mean,
*  the only bad thing is the snow, right? Did you fart? No, that was my lips. You get a four-wheel
*  drive. Just get a truck, you know, and fucking, you know, stay home when it snows. When Tesla
*  releases their truck, they are coming out soon. I sent Elon a picture of a truck and I said, hey,
*  man, this looks fucking dope. He's like, that's not really our truck. He said, what was his words?
*  It's more Blade Runner-esque. That's what he said. It's more than that picture. The picture that I
*  think you're talking about, the black one, that's already pretty Blade Runner-y. But that I could
*  tell is fake because if he's going to make a truck, he has to have more of a bed space in the back,
*  right? I think he's trying to make something. Yeah, that's fake. That's like, that looks
*  fucking dope, man. It looks pretty tron too. I like the lights. Oh my God. It looks amazing.
*  But I think whatever he's doing is going to look even doper than that. But no one has seen it.
*  He's somehow or another been able to keep it under wraps. Yeah, that's going to, how many people have
*  trucks in the United States? That's going to be a game changer. I'm surprised that he hasn't
*  released it yet because- And it's American. That's an American product. I mean, all these people that
*  want to, it's a weird thing. People are like, yeah, I like fucking engines and Ford and Chevy.
*  They think that's American. Well, guess what else is American? Tesla. That's an American invention.
*  It's American. And it's good for the environment. Don't you love the outdoors? Yes, you do. Good.
*  Get a fucking electric car. Drive around in that. Yeah, that's the best part. It's going to be
*  interesting to see what it looks like. Have you got solar at your house yet? You ever try to fuck
*  with the Tesla solar? We were going to get the Tesla roof panels, but our roof has the wrong pitch
*  for whatever that means. Oh, direction. Yeah. So we have another setup, another solar panel.
*  Oh, badass. Yeah. But the, I think solar is in California. It's a silly thing to not have.
*  It's like, you can get all your power from the sky. It should be the law. Every house has to have.
*  Well, I think it's a matter of time. Like Tesla has these solar panels that act as tiles. They
*  look like roof tiles. They look really good. They look like real nice roof tiles. But I think,
*  you know, they didn't have that 10 years ago. And 10 years from now, they'll probably have something
*  even more efficient. The real problem is battery capacity. Like battery capacity is the thing that
*  holds back these electric cars. And they think they're going to be able to fix that too. And
*  they think with new battery technology, you're going to be able to get more mileage and to be
*  able to charge far quicker. That's going to be the real game changer. Cause once people, there's a
*  lot of people that like Brendan, Brendan Schaub. He's like resisting the Tesla. I drive it around.
*  It's like, you're driving that again. He gets mad. Cause he's like, why don't you drive one
*  of your muscle cars? I'm like, I love those, but I love this. You got to drive this man. He's like,
*  I'm not driving. It's too quiet. It doesn't matter when you drive it once. You're like, holy fuck.
*  When you realize how fast they are, it's like it time travels. It just goes, just cuts the distance
*  between spaces in a way that no other car can do. I don't, I've never seen another car that could,
*  and it does that without being obnoxious. Like it doesn't go, it doesn't make some crazy loud noise.
*  It just goes, whoosh. Elon should definitely have an update where it makes your car speakers match
*  with your acceleration. And you get like, so you feel like you're inside like a rumbling car
*  while you're driving down. They do have, they have that with some cars where people get mad at it.
*  Apparently the new Corvette pipes fake sound into your, into the car. Because when, when they make
*  cars that are turbocharged, when you have forced induction with a turbocharged, these, these
*  turbos, they make the engine sound shitty. Like a naturally aspirated engine is the loudest, most
*  rumbly kind of an engine. And when you have turbocharges, it mutes the sound of the engine.
*  Cause it's all, I don't know why, but I guess it's because of all the forced air. They, they don't
*  sound as good. So what they've been doing is they've been forcing like fake sound. Like BMW does that.
*  Like when you're driving the car and you hear the cool acceleration sound, it's kind of fake.
*  That's great. It's just, it's coming into your speakers, which is really weird. They're about
*  to release a fart horn also on the Tesla. Yeah, I heard about that. That's a great idea. I saw this
*  video today and you started mentioning something that triggered. Did you see, have you seen this yet?
*  It says solar, a game changer for technology developed in San Antonio to pull water from humid
*  air. So this guy, Moses West, he was retired and it took him four years. He developed this machine
*  called a AWG. I don't know. I'm trying to find out what that stands for, but it's a big machine
*  that pulled literally makes drinking water from the air at very low cost. He said lower cost than
*  groundwater. I, he already has them in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and Flint. I think he's made 12 of
*  them so far. I've talked about this with my dad before because I have a humidifier and it does the
*  same thing. I have to empty out the water container out of it. Every, a dehumidifier, I'm sorry. Right.
*  And it has this big tank that when I use it, I have to like throw it out. And I was like,
*  that just pulls from the air. And I was like, dad, why can't you drink it? And he's, he says it's too,
*  it's still water. So you can't, you know, you can't drink still water, right? Like it's not,
*  still water, you know what, like pond water kind of shit. No, like the puddle water,
*  it's not still water. The water you can buy distilled, distilled water. Right. Yeah.
*  That's not good for it. You got to add electrolytes to it. The science behind the technology is simple
*  condensation, the same principle that creates beads of water on the outside of a cold glass
*  of water on a hot, humid day, the warmer and more humid, the air outside, the better this,
*  his machine is able to condense the water in the air, making it rain inside the shipping container
*  device. A spigot and a hose allow people to fill up any container with fresh potable water.
*  It's like an endless source of water. It's a water generator. That's really cool for places
*  that are humid. I wonder if that would work in LA though, cause it's dry as fuck here. Right.
*  Do they have any water in the air here? They must have some. Yeah. And I was,
*  I'd looked on the other day, I was at 62% humidity outside and I was like, this is,
*  that's Ohio levels. Like it's crazy. Right now it is. There's just the other day. I was,
*  must've been cloudy day. Yeah. I don't know. So on a regular day, but is it ever 0% humidity?
*  It's not, no, it's low, it's lower, but it's still not like, I always thought it was zero,
*  but it's not always. Well, if what he's saying makes sense, right? Like you've always been able
*  to take a glass with ice and a drink and you get condensation on the outside of it. Always. So all
*  they would have to do is, I mean, if that works on a hot day in LA, they could get water out of the
*  air. That's amazing. Yeah. I mean, he's just, it's, this is new as far as I know. It's probably not
*  a brand new technology. He just figured out how to make it viable, but God, I love smart people.
*  Yeah. So I'm so glad they're real. I'm so glad they're out there fixing things. I'm, I'm,
*  I'm really hoping. And I've, I've talked to many technologists that believe this as well,
*  that technology is going to be the solution for our, our environmental problems, that they're
*  going to be able to pull carbon out of the air. Is this it right here? That's the machine. That's
*  him. Yeah. He was the next here cuts to him, like filling it up. What is this John was named? Moses
*  West powerful Moses West. Yeah. Figured it out. And he's got, that's like a truck container. Like
*  it looks like the, like a look at that. Yeah. That's crazy. It looks like one of those things
*  on a, like a caboose on a train. What's a caboose? No cab. What's one's, what's one's the, the cargo
*  holder? What are those? It's like the front of the engine, right? What's all those ones in the back?
*  What are those called? The locomotives, the front, right? Yeah. Look at all that water. They're
*  getting out of the fucking air. Texas man plans to take water machine to the Bahamas. Dude, the
*  Bahamas is really depressing. Have you paid attention to the devastation in the Bahamas?
*  From the hurricane? Yeah. Yeah. You know, Eve Edwards is from the Bahamas. So he went down there
*  and he's, he's helping out. And I looked at some of the video footage of the devastation down there.
*  The Bahamas essentially got wiped out. I mean, they got crushed by that hurricane. Yeah. The airport
*  was disappeared. Just gone. Yeah. Pull up some footage. You ever been to Bahamas? No, I've never
*  been. Yeah. What's it like? Very beach. Like it was the only place where everyone was trying to
*  give you, sell you drugs everywhere. Like, like I was at pizza hut and the guy goes, here's your
*  pizza. And like, I went to pizza for some reason. I don't know why, cause I was like, oh, I went
*  American poor cheap pizza. And the guy, cause here's your pizza. Do you want to buy any Coke?
*  Pizza and Coke. I figured if you're the type of guy who gets pizza in the Bahamas,
*  right? The type of guy who does Coke. Look at what it looks like, man.
*  Fuck. Look at that one on the right, the far right, the big picture, go large with that.
*  Look at that, man. That's insane. I mean, it essentially wiped out the island.
*  See, when you, when you're in the path of hurricanes on a regular basis like that,
*  and you're stuck there, that's gotta be such a helpless feeling. Like, you know, the destructions
*  coming basically every year. Well, did it, it wasn't this bad like 10 years ago, right? Like
*  all these people probably were like, yeah, we had a hurricane once 20 years ago, but now it seems
*  like they're just getting fucked every year. Well, part of it is because of climate change,
*  the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean is a warm ocean, right? That's why we don't get hurricanes
*  out here in the Pacific is because the water is cold. The pros and the cons, the pros are
*  it, we don't get hurricanes. The cons are it's cold to swim in. But to me, I'll take that all day.
*  I don't swim in the ocean that much. The hurricanes seem to come every fucking year.
*  Side benefit of Tesla is that they could drive under water. Did you see those videos of Tesla's
*  like, not submerged, but like, crazy? Really? Because it's airtight. Tesla's are airtight
*  because they have the nuclear bomb mode for the air conditioning. You know what I'm talking about?
*  The radiation mode. Nuclear bomb mode. So they have the filtration system, at least in the X,
*  I think it's in the S too, has the, it's so airtight that like if the air quality is bad or
*  whatever you could do, forget the name of it, it's not called nuclear bomb mode, but it's the
*  nuclear symbol. Like fallout mode? Yeah. And it makes it so no air, it's only filtering the air
*  that's inside the cabin and it's airtight so that like if there's bad gas outside. How long would it
*  take for you to run out of oxygen though? I don't know. Right? Because like, there's only so much
*  air in there. If you just breathe in air and blow out carbon dioxide, it wouldn't eventually fill up.
*  Or maybe it's, it's filtering the air because the filters can, it's like wearing a gas mask.
*  Like it's filtering new air into it. Yeah. What is it called? Does that really work like that?
*  I think so. I remember I was watching an episode of Top Gear and they were saying that the air
*  that comes out of a Porsche 911 Turbo is actually cleaner than the air it sucks in in downtown LA.
*  So if you drive around a 911 Turbo in LA, the exhaust fumes are actually cleaner than the
*  air it pulls in. Bioweapon defense mode is what Elon Musk calls it. Bioweapon defense mode.
*  It's the advanced air filter systems to the point that automaker has been making incredible
*  claims about it. Now, how does it, does it filter out carbon monoxide? Like can it give you a
*  continuous supply of oxygen while the battery's charged? When those fires were going on, I remember
*  they were like, I remember he was tweeting something about like they were like being used as
*  escape vehicles to get people out because they had such good HEPA filters on them. Yeah. Oh,
*  hmm. That makes sense. Yeah. Haven't been in those fires myself. It's stunning how weird it gets
*  you're seeing like fire everywhere and then the air is just everywhere you go. It's just filled
*  with smoke. The worst I ever saw was one year we were filming Fear Factor and the entire ride home
*  for more than, more than 50 miles. The whole right side of the highway was on fire. I thought it was
*  more water than that, but there's a lot of water, bro. What's so funny, he makes a wave that attacks
*  this reporter. Look, he's like, Oh, that's a weird feature because you remember those,
*  um, carmas, those Fiske carmas, they blew up at the dock because the dock got overrun with water
*  and they all started exploding. Yeah, that's fucked up. Yeah. They didn't figure that out.
*  It's going to be interesting to see who steps into the electric car world. Like now that Porsche
*  has got this really sweet looking new car that's coming out, but apparently it doesn't have as many
*  miles, doesn't go as many miles as a Tesla. And it's not as fast as a Tesla. Right. But that's
*  weird. Like you're Porsche. Like, why don't you have a faster car than Tesla? Like how did they
*  do that? Like, why would they release a car that's not as fast? I think they all can agree that Elon's
*  10 years in the past, all the carmakers right now. Oh, he's 10 years ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, it makes sense. I think Apple's going to have something pretty cool bringing, because once,
*  if Apple really does finally release their electric car, you know, that's going to be the
*  iPhone of cars. Do you think they're really doing that? I really do. I think Elon even said that
*  they are. I haven't heard that. I thought they could buy someone maybe or like put their name
*  on something, but for them to get in the car, but it seems pretty tough for Tesla to do it,
*  to make their own cars. No, I think they're teaming up with like Volkswagen and it's going to be like
*  an Apple car or something like that. It seems like an insane waste of time.
*  Let's just go buy a Tesla. Apple has so much money though. It's amazing how much money. Yeah,
*  they definitely could. It's amazing how much money that company has just stored up.
*  They could, they could buy Tesla and just turn them into apples easily. That'd be great. If
*  Elon wanted to sell, I don't think he wants to sell. I think he wants to prove everybody wrong.
*  When everybody says that the company is going to go out of business, it's going to lose 80% of its
*  market share. I don't know how he does everything. That's what doesn't make any sense to me. How does
*  he do that and pay attention to the tunnels that are digging under LA and pay attention to SpaceX
*  and pay attention to SolarCity? I mean, how the f**king one guy have so many different
*  irons in the fire. A lot of assistance, I bet. I'm sure. But how does he rest? Like how do you
*  rest when you have that many different things going on? That s**t ain't good. Like when the
*  most busy you've ever been, how many podcasts were you doing? There was a point where with yours and
*  Death Squad, I was probably doing like 11 a week. I was pretty much only doing podcasts. They ruined
*  all my relationships. God damn. Yeah. See, that is just not wise, right? That's just too much.
*  It's too much to do. When people do that, when they just take on too many different tasks.
*  I've thought about other stuff, like doing other stuff. I've had offers to do other stuff and I
*  start thinking about it. Maybe I can find time for that. And then I give myself coaching. Like,
*  I'm like, what would you tell yourself? I'm like, what the f**k is wrong with you? You're not doing
*  anything else. Like you go barely do all the stuff you're doing now. I think for me too,
*  as I get older, especially like right now in my life, my leisure time is very important to me.
*  Like it means something. And I don't mean leisure, like sit around doing nothing, but like hobbies,
*  like stuff that I do. Like lately I've been shooting guns. Yeah. I was jealous, man. Dude,
*  you should come with us. I'm thinking about buying a gun. You should get a gun. You want to come with
*  us tomorrow? Oh, um, wait a minute. What's today? Wednesday. I might be going tomorrow. We'll talk
*  afterwards. But, um, I'm going soon. Cool. You should come. It's fun. It's fun. You learn how to
*  shoot your tactical. Yeah, it is fun. You know, it's like video game, but some people get mad.
*  A lot of mad comments. Why just get mad? They don't want you shooting guns. Jesus. Stop it.
*  Stop it. Think of the children. Stop it. Blanks. Well, we're not shooting blanks. We're shooting
*  real bullets. But it's, um, there's also a game that you can get. We're going to get for this
*  studio. That's a, it's a real pistol. Like it looks like a real pistol and has a six pound pull. So
*  it feels like a real pistol when you pull the trigger. And, uh, it's like that techno hunt thing
*  where you got a laser beam that shoots out and, uh, it even makes a noise. Like a gun, like bang,
*  bang, bang, and you're shooting zombies. No way. Yeah. And it's heavy like a pistol. So you have
*  to hold it like a pistol. Yeah, dude. That's bad. That's next. Keep score and whatnot. Oh yeah. Oh
*  yeah. It tells you how many civilians you shoot, how many zombies you got. Cause sometimes people
*  come running around the corner and it says it's a zombie and then there's a civilian behind them.
*  You gotta make sure not to see you guys rolling around and shit out there. Or are you just standing
*  still in that, uh, we're not in a movie, bro. I know, but I didn't know how much fun you guys are
*  having. No, no obstacles. I don't think it's a good idea to have dummies like me roll around with
*  a gun in my hand. Somebody told me to buy a Glock 19. That was the gun to buy. That's a great gun.
*  All right. Cool. Yeah. You should, before you do anything, you should learn how to shoot.
*  I've shot before. I've gone a few times with you. Yeah. Yeah. For rifles, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah.
*  But I've shot in Burbank at a shooting place where you can just- Oh, they have a place near you? Yeah.
*  Oh, that's cool. It's right down the street. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun, man. It's fun. We should have a JRE
*  shooting range somewhere. Hell yeah. Have a- We all went before to that thing that- Yeah, we shot
*  all the hard drives. Yes. That was fun, man. That was fun, wasn't it? It was. Rifle shooting is fun,
*  but pistol shooting when you're holding in your hand, it's way more difficult. It seems to me-
*  Is it? You think it's more difficult? More difficult to aim. Yeah, because he gave me a rifle
*  and I shoot rifles so much or I have shot them so much. It's easy. You just have trigger discipline.
*  You just don't yank the trigger. Just pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, bang, and let it go off
*  like a surprise shot. And I hit everything I aimed at. And he was like, okay, you've shot that before.
*  But pistols, I've only shot pistols at a range with no instruction. I didn't know what I'm doing
*  at all. And once you learn how to grip it, how to hold it, how to aim, you don't really hold that
*  hard with your right hand. Most of the pressure is with your left. And the grip is very- It's not
*  intuitive. You have to learn it. It's something that you have to be taught correctly. And there's
*  so many people there that are like, they shoot in competitions. And so when you watch them do it,
*  you're like, oh, wow, Jesus Christ. There's levels to this. There's guys that can pull their gun out
*  and shoot four shots inside of a second, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, in a second. Pull, draw,
*  pull, shoot four shots inside of a second. That's crazy. Yeah, it's ridiculous. But they're just
*  begging for someone to break in their house. There's people like that out there. There's people
*  like that where you break in their house, you've fucked with the wrong person. Well, Tent City's
*  growing, so I think I need to get one. Just need to move. LA's going to be a giant homeless
*  encampment. It really is. If you looked at the spread, right, if it was a disease, a deadly
*  disease that was killing everybody, and you saw like patient zero, and then it spread like two
*  people, four people, six people, 10 people. Now LA has more than 60,000 homeless people. And every
*  single underpass that you go to, you see camps now. It's not like it used to be. It's a totally
*  different animal now. It's like the walking dead, man, where it seems like it's growing.
*  Laurel Canyon, when you're going to Laurel Canyon off the 101, it used to be pretty normal.
*  Last night, or two nights ago, when I went through it, it was like there was no sidewalk anymore.
*  It was like if somebody had to walk on that sidewalk, good luck with, you're going through
*  Ewok Village. Yep, and needles and all kinds of fucked up and human shit. I mean, human shit's
*  all over downtown LA. I've seen a lot of people shit like that. And that's nothing compared to
*  San Francisco. That guy Zuby, who's on our podcast, he did a bunch of posts about his
*  trip to San Francisco. It is so much worse. He was saying it was so much worse than he thought it was.
*  It's so beyond comprehension how many people are just openly shooting up drugs,
*  shitting in the streets, homeless people everywhere. How do you fix that? And like,
*  if you would think that if there's something that LA needed to fix, out of all the things that LA
*  complains about, the homeless problem is like one of the most insurmountable problems. Like,
*  what do you do to curb that? How do you get these people homes? How do you clean these people up?
*  How do you get them off drugs? How do you get them off the streets? How do you make it not a public
*  nuisance? How do you make it so people aren't scared to go down streets? Because there's
*  certain streets in downtown LA where you see the street, like you're at the beginning of the mouth
*  of the street and you're looking down the street like, I'm not walking down there. Like, this is
*  terrible. They need to open up the mental hospitals again. Whenever they closed them down, what, in the
*  70s or the 80s? That's what caused all this. They don't have those anymore. It definitely
*  was a problem, but it seems like it's gotten way worse, right? Like, think about what it used to be
*  10 years ago. Now think about what it is now. I mean, this 10 years ago, it was still
*  decades after they closed down the mental institutions. They changed the standards.
*  So what it was was they had certain standards where you would be institutionalized and they
*  changed those standards under the Reagan administration and just sent these people out
*  into the streets. And everybody thought it was like really cruel because here you're just releasing
*  these people with all these like severe mental health problems and just releasing them out into
*  the street. But that was a long time ago. Something has happened recently. I guess it's the economy.
*  I mean, I don't know what it is, but another thing you're seeing around this area is mobile homes,
*  like those campers, like Winnebago's, fucking everywhere. People just get enough money to get
*  one of them mobile homes. They just park it on the street and they live in those things,
*  which is just like a mobile camp, you know, and you get these gypsies that hang out and they cook
*  on the sidewalk and shit. Like we used to have them here. They would, they would like,
*  they were hanging out in sunbathing on the lawn out here and the owner of the building is like,
*  get the fuck out of here. Like, what are you guys doing? This isn't a park. Like go to the park.
*  You know what's worse? Sovereign citizens. What is that? There's people that don't drive. They
*  travel and they don't follow the rules. And they like, if you watch it live PD, they have
*  one every episode, two every episode. It's they'll get pulled over and it's like,
*  they won't even roll down the window. And they're like, I don't have to follow your rules, sir.
*  I am, you know, they never have driver's license or insurance. They, it's like people that don't
*  think taxes apply to them. They don't think the law applies to them. That's grown so big recently
*  that it's so many people now that do this shit. And it's the most grossest. Like, uh, if you watch
*  on live PD, you'll, you'll, what is live PD? Like these cops nowadays, it's, but it's, I think,
*  I think it's way better. Why is it way better? Cause it's live. It's like four hours long in the
*  host. It's live, live in the moment. Yeah. They're like in seven different cities. They have a whole
*  control center. Like, all right, we got a speeding going on here. We got to, Oh, there's a chase
*  going on here. Let's go live over here. Yeah. It's my favorite. And they have it. They also
*  have in Columbus, Ohio where they used to, but they just got rid of it. Yeah.
*  I didn't even know this was a thing. And so the sovereign citizens, like, what are they saying?
*  They get pulled over and they say, I don't have to listen to you. Yeah. They, they pretty much say
*  like, your rules don't apply. And they'll be like, uh, get, you know, give me your driver's license.
*  I need your, I'm like, take you to jail for just a seatbelt, you know, violation. Give me your
*  license. They won't like, I don't need to give you a license, sir. Please. And like, they have
*  this shit. They keep on repeating, uh, like, and they all go to these websites and they're like
*  reading it on their phone, sir, I don't have to, you know, do this and that and this. And then
*  they finally have to like break their window and just drag them out and arrest them just for a
*  seatbelt. Finally, some people are smart and you know what they're talking about though, but other
*  people have just like watched another video and like, Oh, I don't have to listen to this guy. I'm
*  a YouTuber. There's something uniquely satisfying about watching that I get pulled over by the cops
*  and he knows exactly what his rights are. And the cops are fucking up and he calls the cops on
*  different codes and laws and the constitution. And then he winds up driving off. I've seen that
*  before. Yeah. Pull over the DA on accident. They're like, Oh, did you see that? Yeah.
*  Or that woman who was it? Uh, New York, uh, she was like some kind of high up person that got pulled
*  over and she starts yelling at the cops and shit. Like she lost her job the next day. Yeah, I saw
*  that. Yeah. Yeah. That was ridiculous. She was trying to throw her weight around. Yeah. She
*  didn't realize she was on camera being a corruption man. That's corruption. You're a citizen,
*  bitch, you know, everybody needs to realize there was one where a judge got pulled over and they
*  let him slide, but he got in trouble afterwards as well. Cause it's on camera, you know, and then
*  someone finds that video and it's like, Hey man, you are a citizen. You're like us. Like if you're
*  speeding or something like that, and they pull you over, you can't get out and act like you own
*  these cops. It's, I mean, you gotta give your fucking driver's license. You gotta, you gotta
*  show them your identification. If you're doing something that's an infraction or a violation,
*  that's the whole reason why we have cops. Do you want everybody just driving 150 miles an hour,
*  no ID and masks on? No. So you have to have rules. So these are the rules. If you do something that
*  breaks the law, they gotta be able to pull you over and give you a fucking ticket and incentivize
*  you to drive correctly. And also find out if maybe you're running from the cops, you know,
*  so they pull you over, they get your ID, they go, Hey man, you got a murder warrant out for you. So
*  please step out of the car with your hands up. I mean, this is the whole reason why we have cops
*  in the first place. And these people that think they don't have to pay taxes and the laws don't
*  apply to them, it's all unconstitutional. Good luck with that case. Good luck with the ass. Wesley
*  Snipes, how that worked out. Yeah, it's shit. They put Wesley in fucking jail for a long time. Lauren
*  Hill too, from the goddamn Fujis, they put her in a cage for like a year, right? How long did she go
*  to jail for? And it was a taxes thing too, man. They get these wacky, whether it's an attorney
*  or a tax professional or some wacky advisor tells them they don't have to pay taxes. And they read
*  some internet thing and says, actually, it's unconstitutional. It's only supposed to apply
*  during war time. Like, listen, pay your fucking taxes. Okay, you can protest all you want. You
*  think it's unjust. That's good. They will put you in a fucking jail. And if you're a famous person
*  is trying to pull that off, especially a famous rich person, look, it's not good, but it is what
*  it is. They're going to make an example of you. How long did she go to jail for? Three months.
*  That's it? She only went to jail for three months? Can't tell. Hmm. So she was released from a federal
*  prison, women's low security, all facility, all female facility. Just the fact they put her in a
*  fucking cage is crazy. Like, is she a danger to the public? Like, what is going on here? She owes you
*  money? How come that's the one money that you can't just pay back? You know, you can't just pay it
*  back. How come I can't just pay it back? Nope. Not good enough. You still have to pay back and go.
*  Yeah. And yet they take away your ability to earn a living for a long time. Like Wesley Snipes,
*  how long was he in jail for? He was in jail for like a solid year. A whole year behind bars,
*  put a halt to his career. And all because he owed some taxes because he had some wacky dude that
*  was telling him he didn't have to pay taxes. How long? He had a three year sentence. Three years.
*  Imagine that man. How long? How much did he pay you? Because of money. They lock you in a goddamn
*  cage. It's not like he stole money. It's not like he held up a bank. It's not like he was a violent
*  person that was a danger to society. No, he owed some taxes. He made money. Yeah. And they had,
*  they're taking his money. Yeah. He made money, but he didn't give his share up to the government.
*  So the government decided to lock him in a cage to punish him and to make a statement to everybody
*  else. It's also like you pay taxes, you get taxed on your paycheck, and then you get sales tax.
*  You're getting taxed how many times? You know, getting taxed a lot. 10 times. Well, then that's
*  why places like Nevada, people like, because in Nevada, you don't have to pay state taxes. So you
*  make a, you can save a lot of money. Florida, same thing. Like I know a dude who moved to Florida
*  because he was going to sell his business. So he's like, look, I'm going to move to Florida and
*  establish residence in Florida for a few years and then sell my business. So I'm a Florida resident.
*  And then I have to pay nearly as much money. You can see if you own a big business, it can save
*  you a ton of money. It's just weird that it's different everywhere you go, you know, like some
*  places just don't have state tax. You don't have to pay. Yeah. Montana has different taxes. Colorado
*  has different taxes. They're all have, everybody's got like a different setup, different amount that
*  you have to pay for this and that. Over. There's a weird thing that like a lot of the big corporations
*  have their headquarters in Delaware for some reason. It's like somewhere tax law for that.
*  A nice little tax haven. Well, isn't that why the Jews moved to Florida? Didn't OJ move to Florida
*  because they couldn't take his pension that way. Well, he owes money based off the lawsuit. Right.
*  For the civil suit. Yeah. But he has a pension right from the NFL. Yeah. So they can't take,
*  right. They can't fuck with that pension. Dude, I got to tell you watching him on Twitter every day
*  is one of the strangest thing and him talking about football. So there's certain things like
*  if you're, if you're a guy who went to jail for embezzlement and you got out, but you're a football
*  fan and you still talk about football. Okay. You're just talking about football. But if you're,
*  you're a double homicide guy, you killed two people with a knife and then you got away with it,
*  but everybody knows you did it. And then you're talking about football. Hey, Twitter world.
*  What is he saying? Run your studs. He's talking about fantasy football all the time.
*  Let me hear some of those. Go from the beginning. Well, the fifth week is in the can and some
*  things are beginning to reveal themselves. One, the Dallas Cowboys may not be who we thought they
*  were. The Buffalo Bills defense is for real. They are great. Teddy Bridgewater is more than the
*  seat holder. If and when the time that Drew Brees decide to move on. This is so strange.
*  What if you just give an MMA like picks?
*  What if somebody gets out? Stop and it was great this weekend. Yeah, that would be weird. Hey.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously he was a great football player in his day. So it kind of makes
*  sense that he's talking about football, but it is strange. And then if you look in the comments,
*  it's all knife emojis and you really cut me up with that one juice. His choice of words,
*  sometime almost make me feel like that, that he's doing some shit on purpose though. Like,
*  um, I don't think so. Have you ever, have you ever,
*  it's like college. Look at that. South park, south park, coverages. It's so strange.
*  Yeah. I mean, man, his, it's like, you're never getting away from that. That's 700 replies.
*  It's never going to go away. Right? I mean, that's who he is. At least now he's wearing
*  sunglasses in every pick. It's so strange though. Every video. Hey, look at it. He's got his glass.
*  Those are reading glasses. He's got them in his hand, but it's all like jovial football talk.
*  So strange. It's just what a weird time we're at where a guy is a, is a murderer and he's on
*  Twitter. Yeah. Allegedly he's on Twitter and just talking about football. Like,
*  what do you think he gets out of that? Like, why do you think he thinks that's a good idea?
*  Has he just missed attention? Does like, I don't think he has anything going for him. He has to
*  do that to promote like book signings. I bet he signs at malls. I bet he does that shit at the
*  mall in Vegas. I don't know what the fuck he does. Like what does OJ do for money?
*  Pete Rose type shit. He just gets that pension, right? Yeah. That could, he might be honest. He
*  might be trying to build his Twitter account to a point where he could use it for that.
*  How many people do you have on it right now? He's almost up to a million. It's 916,000.
*  Right. Yeah. Well, it's one of those things where it's kind of an oddity, right? It's like an
*  attraction. He's going to be boxing screech any day now. He's really old and he doesn't move that
*  good, but he's got killer instinct. I liked him on naked gun. Look, he's, you know, before the
*  murders, he was a beloved person. It's just such an unusual, like society today is so strange across
*  the board. You know, like, look at us, we're wearing NASA costumes. Millions of people are
*  watching. Like, what are we doing? But what's the matter? According to this TMZ article, I guess,
*  it says that what he originally owed to the Goldman family due to 22 years of interest is
*  over a hundred million dollars now. And they can't make him pay, huh? Well, that's like why I guess
*  he can't really work because they just take all of that money. Any autograph signings he does,
*  probably would get stolen right away. So, how does he live? He has to have like a certain allowance?
*  Guess that NFL pension or he has a friend who gives him money.
*  Yeah. I don't know.
*  Probably has like a, I don't know how would he do that?
*  Like, what would he do with his Twitter? So the strange thing is like, do you think that this is
*  a calculated effort to try to start a social media business or do you think this is just him
*  just trying to connect with people?
*  Someone has to be in a deal. There's no way he just figured out Twitter. He's just bored and
*  was like, what's this Twitter thing? I mean, he has somebody pushing him to do it.
*  For sure. Read an article.
*  He's got to be the oddest guy on Twitter. Him and John McAfee. That John McAfee guy.
*  Still running around.
*  Oh yeah. He's like halfway trolling people. It's hard to tell what he's doing. Like what he's doing
*  seems to be like almost like a, some of it's very theatrical. You remember when we interviewed him
*  when he was on the run? We interviewed him remotely when he was on the run for murder.
*  And he was saying that it was all nonsense. And when I was asking him about meth, like how much
*  Matthews, you really smoking meth? Like I read an article that showed that you had a meth lab that
*  you built in your backyard. And he's like, that was all fiction. Yeah. He was like, that was a
*  prank. I was trolling people. I believe that. You think so? Yeah. I don't know. He's old school.
*  He's an old school. I don't think he was cooking it. I think he was straight up breaking bad in his
*  backyard. Where was he even Belize? Like where was he? Something like that. But some place where it
*  all went sideways on him, right? Didn't his neighbor wind up getting murdered. That's why he was on the
*  run, right? Yeah. What a character. What a character. The guy was a fucking antivirus mogul,
*  you know? I mean, that's McAfee, McAfee antivirus. He was the, like the, it was like Norton and McAfee.
*  Those are the two big names in antivirus. I wonder what Norton's up to right now. He's probably hanging
*  out in McAfee's old place and Belize smoking his leftover meth.
*  Those dudes who fucking escape society and go move to some small island and get some little, little,
*  you know, native girlfriends. That's a weird move, right? That's a great move. Do you think you'd
*  ever see yourself doing that? Hell yes. You could podcast from an island somewhere. As soon as that's
*  possible being hologram stuff, hologram style anywhere. That's when like, like you could have
*  you somebody on as a guest as a podcast, but in hologram form. Well, listen, if we decided to set
*  up a studio, like on an island somewhere and do the podcast from an island somewhere and we'd have
*  to fly some guests in, right? Like say if there's a few of us, we just talk shit about the news,
*  all the things that are going down, the Trump impeachment, this and that, we all did it from
*  an island somewhere. And occasionally we fly people in. Say if you do it in on Lanai, right?
*  Everybody flies in the Four Seasons, stay in a nice place.
*  Has to be somewhere where there's no hurricanes though. So they don't get too many hurricanes.
*  Sounds like what like a Jeffrey Epstein pitch to get people on his plane to come out to his
*  island. Come on now. We're just having a conversation. We're not banging any kids.
*  Yeah. He's still alive anyways. We can just go to his island. Do you think he's still? Oh yeah.
*  Really? Yeah. He's, he's on that island. How funny is it that people just stop talking about the fact
*  that guy get whacked for sure. They whack that guy. I mean, out of all the things that I'm sure about
*  that I don't know. And this is one that I'm most sure. I'm most sure they murdered that guy.
*  He knew so much from so many different people and all the things that went wrong. Even Michael
*  Shermer, who is like a professional skeptic who doesn't believe in anything. He found out that
*  the cameras were broken and the, they weren't working on the day the guy got off. He's like,
*  oh, maybe this is a conspiracy. You think you think the guy Clinton flew to his fucking island
*  26 times. He flew with Epstein. Well, I don't know if he flew into his island, but he flew on Epstein's
*  jet 26 different times. They held El Chapo there for quite a, quite a long time and nothing happened
*  to him. What? At that same facility. Oh, did they really? Yeah. Like no one had died there for like
*  26 years or something like that since the nineties. What I heard. They whack that guy.
*  The most hilarious thing is you ever see who his cellmate was? That no, his cellmate was a fucking
*  gorilla. Like the biggest guy you could ever imagine being in your cell. Like the guy looked
*  like you're like, if you were going to have a movie about the worst possible cellmate you could
*  ever have, it would be this guy. Look at this guy. Look at the fucking size of the guy. I'm so glad
*  he's white. And he's a former cop, a former cop built like a brick shit house. I mean, he's
*  enormous. What is that guy's name? Nicholas Tartaglione or something. Yeah. He was a bad
*  cop. The cop went bad. But when you look at the size of them, you're like, come on, man,
*  that's really his cellmate. Looked like before he went in. Look at that bad dog. And that's him now.
*  Yeah. Wow. He's fucking huge. A huge, gigantic muscled up dude was his cellmate. And was he
*  there when he got offed? No, he wasn't there. What a convenient. He was there the first time,
*  but he committed suicide. Oh, the first time he tried. Yeah. What saved him? What did this
*  ex cop do? He killed four people on a bad coke deal. Whoopsies. They had a co- No big deal.
*  Whatever, whatever. A bad coke deal. But how funny is that? That's his cellmate. Like, what do we
*  got? What do we got? Well, we only got a murderer that's built like a brick shit house. Let's put
*  him in there with him. He got some wet cocaine. He's transferred out the eve of his suicide.
*  Like a Vincent. And then they had the doctor picture with, uh,
*  Delaine Maskewell at the In-N-Out and Studio City. Yeah. It was just like, well, they put that out,
*  disappeared, right? Made the news, doctor Photoshopped for some reason. Where's that
*  lady? No one knows. They didn't even know where she was at the time. And then she,
*  that picture came out. They thought she was in Boston or something.
*  Out of all the high profile cases, out of all of them, that's gotta be the most strange, right?
*  This guy has an island. On the island, he has a building that's colored in the, the mate,
*  it's painted in the colors of the Israeli flag. They think he's a Mossad agent. He's some sort of
*  intelligence agent. The reporter that said that he was released earlier was given a sweet deal
*  because he was intelligence. That's not been verified, right?
*  Pete Slauson Right. That came from one article, the Vanity Fair thing.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson Piece on him. That got repeated a lot, but I don't know that.
*  Pete Slauson We don't know if it's substantiated.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson Right. Jesus, the whole thing though, Jesus Christ, what a crazy story.
*  This is the strangest time because every day there's new things coming at you so hard and fast,
*  you can't keep up with it.
*  Jared Slauson This was his drone. There was someone
*  flying a drone over his island. They stopped three weeks ago, I guess, but for like, almost every day,
*  there was updated drone footage for some reason. I don't know how this person was getting it there.
*  Pete Slauson They must have had a boat.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, he paid something like $50,000 extra to have a cement truck delivered there
*  a couple months before he got arrested.
*  Pete Slauson What?
*  Jared Slauson Like he had a cement truck shipped out to his island and they think
*  they had some shit got buried in that tunnel or something. I don't know.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ.
*  Jared Slauson So, they've been like,
*  they have footage on this island, pre-raid and post-raid of the FBI making it there.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, there was one like last week or two weeks ago where they
*  supposedly saw him sitting in a jeep.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, they thought so. It was just like a worker from the islands.
*  Pete Slauson There's gonna be so many stories about this, but we're never gonna know. It's
*  gonna be one of those things that's like the Kennedy assassination or something where decades
*  will go by. You'll hear all these crazy different stories. People will write books about it,
*  but you'll never really know exactly what happened.
*  Jared Slauson Hey, we should get this island.
*  Pete Slauson What happens to this island? What happens to it?
*  Jared Slauson How much do you think an island costs?
*  Pete Slauson It's probably gonna be cheap because no one wants to live on
*  Pedofilo Island. So, this could be the place, Joe.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, it could be.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, bro.
*  Jared Slauson This helicopter stops there. Look at that beautiful water.
*  I don't know if that's really smart. It doesn't seem like a good move. It seems like
*  you want to do like what Roseanne did. You get a place on an island that is already populated.
*  Bunch of nice people. You establish yourself as a valuable member in the community.
*  And then you set up a little camp there. Imagine the big island. The big island might be the move.
*  You set up a fucking studio on the big island.
*  Jared Slauson Hell yeah.
*  Pete Slauson What do you think?
*  Jared Slauson Let's do it.
*  It's not a bad idea, right?
*  Pete Slauson Tech Observatory? Can we do it up there where they let us?
*  Jared Slauson No, they won't even let them build a new telescope.
*  Pete Slauson What if we take a tent and a microphone up there?
*  Jared Slauson No, they'll get mad at you. You're littering.
*  Pete Slauson Temporary?
*  Jared Slauson No.
*  Pete Slauson All right.
*  Jared Slauson No, you don't want to be up there anyway. There's no air.
*  So, that's really hot. It's like 11,000 square feet. Red Band would be blacking out.
*  We need to have something near like Kona, like where the Four Seasons is. See, again,
*  the Four Seasons.
*  Pete Slauson Bring oxygen with us.
*  Jared Slauson Four Seasons minded.
*  Pete Slauson Oxygen Basement.
*  Jared Slauson Fly people into the Four Seasons. We rent a suite of the Four Seasons, set it up as a
*  studio.
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Jared Slauson Sounds great.
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Jared Slauson But we have to have an escape oxygen basement we can go to just in case of a hurricane
*  or something crazy happens.
*  Pete Slauson An oxygen basement?
*  Jared Slauson Or like an escape room.
*  Pete Slauson We could Airbnb it out to other podcasters that need a vacation. Not anyone,
*  but like your friends. Like a good friend of yours.
*  Pete Slauson Fuck that. They would ruin it.
*  Jared Slauson Maybe.
*  Pete Slauson Come on, Ari's going to go there and fill it with MDMA,
*  all the seal and the water be broken. Yeah, trust me, bad idea. He's going to put acid on all the
*  doorknobs. Someone could go meditate there quietly. Someone like that.
*  Jared Slauson Sam Harris goes on those things where you don't talk for 10 days.
*  Pete Slauson Exactly.
*  Jared Slauson Get the fuck out of here with all of that. He comes back, he still seems the same.
*  I don't get it. These guys, they go on these fucking retreats. I mean, I'm sure there's a
*  benefit. I'm sure there's a benefit to silent meditation, but you can take it and stuff it
*  deep in your ass. Fuck you. I like talking to people, man. There's not enough time in this life.
*  Jared Slauson You don't like to meditate?
*  Pete Slauson I do meditate for 10 minutes every day. 10. 10 minutes. That's not much.
*  Jared Slauson It's not much.
*  Pete Slauson And I cancel it out when I do yoga. I don't meditate on yoga days because I feel like
*  yoga is basically meditation anyway. It's like a strain and meditation all combined. And I cancel
*  it out on days I get in the tank. But other than that, it's beneficial. It definitely helps me,
*  man. I got too much just bouncing around inside my head, you know, but it's like it's controllable.
*  I just need to be, I just need to get out ahead of it, you know? Like today. Today, I went for a nice
*  run. I went running with the dog and I feel great, you know, because I got it all out of the system
*  and just like, ah, I did what I had to do. Come here to do a podcast with you. Everything's
*  wonderful. Life is beautiful. It's all falling into place. But when it's not and there's like
*  loose ends that need to be sealed up and I'm behind on this and I don't think good, you know,
*  it doesn't, doesn't. If I don't take care of all the things that I'm supposed to take care of,
*  I do not enjoy my time. That's to me, I found that like, that's a painful lesson that took forever to
*  learn. That if I don't have all my ducks in a row and my T's crossed and my I's dotted, I'm not happy.
*  I'm just, there's too much, there's too much things to think about, too much anxiety. I think that's
*  what's going on with a lot of people. I think there's a lot of people out there that just don't
*  have their shit together and they don't ever just say, look, before I do anything else, I got to get,
*  like Jordan Peterson talks about this. He says, just clean your room. Like start with that. You
*  can clean your room and most people don't. You keep your room a mess and then your life's a mess
*  and there's an analogy there. There's a metaphor there. Whatever other word you would like.
*  You know, I'm talking about Brian. Yes. So now that you're not keto, what are you doing with your
*  diet? Trying to be healthy? No, not really. No, no, but it definitely has made me understand sugar
*  more. So smoking cigarettes? I'm vaping a lot more, but yeah. How much cigarettes you smoke a day?
*  Half pack. Still a lot. Yeah. But I don't smoke in my car. So I, my cigarette has gone down like,
*  because of that, because of that, like 75%. That's good. Yeah. What would you think if we
*  decided to do that as a project? Hire you a trainer and hire you nutritionist. Would you be
*  down with that? Sure. Like film it as a project? Yeah. What would you like, what do you weigh now?
*  Would you, you don't have to tell everybody, but what would you like to get down to?
*  Well, see, that's the problem. When I, when, when I got down, what are like 15 years ago or 13 years
*  whenever, when I, whatever, I think that was like 65 pounds or something. And I just thought I looked
*  like I had, had AIDS or something. Well, you're just used to yourself looking big. Yeah. But I
*  think some people like they have a body shape or look that looks way better, way better with a
*  little chub on them than they do if they look, I don't know. I feel like, you know what Joey Diaz
*  said when he lost a lot of weight, remember when he lost a lot of weight? My head looked too big.
*  Yeah, exactly. But you know what that is? It's like, you got to build up your body because
*  something happens to people when they gain weight, your head gets bigger. It's like, when people get
*  really heavy, their head gets bigger. And I don't know if like a biologist can back us up on this,
*  some sort of science, but it seems like really overweight people. Their head gets really big too.
*  Like it grows with them, which kind of makes sense because there's like your bones definitely get
*  bigger and thicker when you lift a lot of weights, right? Now when you're 450 pounds,
*  you're carrying weight everywhere you go. So everything's got to be thick. Like I always said,
*  if Ralphie May wanted to lose and all that weight, he'd be able to kick a hole through a fucking wall
*  because that guy's carrying around 500 pounds everywhere he goes. His leg muscles had to be
*  gigantic. Like underneath all that, his legs must have been fucking huge. So if you could just
*  put some muscle on while you're losing the fat. See, that's the difference. Like when you were on
*  that, look at, you look great then, dude. Look at you, you sexy bitch. How could you think you
*  look bad there? Stop. That's an okay picture. Stop it. You're a handsome, beautiful man. I was
*  thinking more of the one. How good is he look, Jamie? How good is he look? You look fucking
*  great there. I was thinking more of the time when the photo of me and you with that weed guy that
*  died at the 420 Awards, where I just looked like an eight. That's when I was at my lowest.
*  The weed guy that died?
*  The one that has all the, shit, I can't even think of his name. He has weed named after him.
*  He's very famous. Jack Herrera.
*  Oh, Jack Herrera. Yeah, yeah. Stroke.
*  Yeah. We were hanging out with him.
*  There's a picture of you there.
*  Me and you. And that's when I was at my skinniest. I think I was like 165 or something like that. I
*  don't even remember. But I just looked like a sick dog.
*  Didn't you feel so light though when you move around?
*  I guess so.
*  Like you can just get places quicker. Like, oh, lighter.
*  Definitely had more energy, that's for sure.
*  Dude, you can do this. What would you think about doing this as a project?
*  We'll announce it on the podcast. We'll start it off. Would you be into doing something like that?
*  Yeah. I mean, eventually. Not like this month because I have to go to Australia and all this shit.
*  Why would I start it now?
*  Well, I have to go to Australia. I'm going to be out of the country.
*  When are you going back? Are you doing Kill Tony out there?
*  Yeah, doing Kill Tony. And then, yeah, so this month is all I'm on the road.
*  Okay. Well, I'm busy being sober this month, too. It's very difficult for me.
*  It's fucking surprisingly easy. You know, it's not hard at all.
*  I do enjoy a glass of wine with a steak. I do miss that. I like a glass of wine,
*  but it's not that important. It's like a tradition thing. Like I'm missing
*  the like something to look forward to. A nice glass of red wine with a steak like a gentleman.
*  I think it's only hard when I'm at the Comedy Store.
*  Everybody's drinking.
*  Yeah, it's almost impossible.
*  I do like a shot of whiskey before I go on stage, too. I like that.
*  Yep.
*  But I can't. It's almost over.
*  Yeah, it's halfway.
*  It's not even halfway. It's the tenth.
*  One third.
*  One third.
*  The ninth. One third. Yeah, it's been easy.
*  The weed part's easy. It's really easy. Show's been great.
*  Had a great time last night. Did three shows.
*  That I'll tell you one thing, though, that Jeremiah's show's not as easy.
*  Stand up on the spot. It's not as easy when you're not high.
*  That's true.
*  When you're high, you can just ramble about nonsense. You come up with bits.
*  I've come up with so many bits from that show, but not when I'm sober.
*  Last night was basically useless.
*  That's the only show that I purposely do shots, drink, smoke a bunch of weed before I go on.
*  Usually I don't like to get that stoned before I go on stage.
*  No, that's the perfect show to be out of your head.
*  Yeah.
*  He really should listen to you, though, and rename it Thunder Pussy.
*  That was the best name. When you called it Thunder Pussy, it was the perfect name for that.
*  I didn't need to make any show called Thunder Pussy.
*  It's not like he's the only one who's ever done a show that has people just making things up.
*  I used to do that at the end of my shows. Remember?
*  I used to have people call out, but they would call out things to talk about.
*  They would yell out subjects, and I would just ramble about them.
*  The reason why I would do it is occasionally, one every two or three shows,
*  I'd come up with an idea that actually would come up and become a bit.
*  I just remembered something. We were in Dallas last weekend for Kill Tony,
*  and there was a bisexual on stage. He was talking about how he's bisexual.
*  A lot of times when people are on stage on this show, I'll be on my computer typing in
*  bisexual on Spotify or something to see what comes up. You come up number one or number two
*  on Spotify, if you just type bisexual, it's you. I point to Tony while we're interviewing the guy,
*  and he goes like that. I'm like, you know what? I'm going to try to just play. I can't hear
*  anything. I'll just play, because I do sound effects on Kill Tony.
*  Was it that bit that I used to have?
*  The old one.
*  Don't believe in bisexual men.
*  Yeah, shiny happy jihad. I just randomly, with my eye, look,
*  oh, it looks like Joe's yelling something here. It would be like, crafty gay guys.
*  Something like that. I started mixing in just random picking things. Then there's a part of
*  the joke where I think you're talking about if you were the gay, the bisexual guy,
*  because there was one where it was like, so yeah, I have experimented once in a while.
*  Oh, that was a different bit.
*  That was a different bit.
*  It's when I was shiny happy jihad.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But it worked so hard. Dude, people were on the floor because it sounded like you were just in
*  the back of the room.
*  I like yelling it out, heckling. That's a funny thing, if you have one minute on stage,
*  the first thing you're going to talk about is being bisexual.
*  Isn't it funny how that becomes for people's identity? Their sexuality becomes an important
*  thing about their identity that they want to blur it out to everyone. But if you're
*  heterosexual, nobody does that, because it's the norm. It's the norm. You don't feel like
*  you have to get it out of the way. You don't say, well, my name's Brian. I really like girls.
*  Right. Right. Everybody would be like, what? Yeah, I'm heterosexual.
*  What? But if you say you're bisexual, people are like, oh my God, you're adventurous.
*  Yeah. And people always tell you when they're bisexual, at least guys.
*  Yeah. Or girls. They love telling you. But it's like a thing they do to get attention.
*  It's like, you know, certain girls, they're always around guys. They just talk about their
*  guy problems. And it's like, oh, groan. I know what you're doing. You're like fishing for saviors.
*  You're fishing for some guy to come along and send you some dick and fix your problem.
*  You know what I mean? Like some girls like, God, these guys I date, they just never want to have
*  sex. You know, those those little bait traps that girls set up and you're like, oh my God,
*  who's going to fall for this one? Stop. Well, no, it goes prime. Of course I do. Hey, man,
*  it's two o'clock. We got to wrap this up. Tickets for Australia. They're still available.
*  Yeah, there's some left. Also, San Francisco next weekend. We're going to have four shows.
*  Cobbs. Oh, Friday and Saturday. Yeah. Oh, two shows each night. Oh, damn. Kill Tony mania.
*  Oh, that's fun. Are you doing stand up tour or just doing Kill Tony? This we're just doing
*  Kill Tony because it's like our yearly like, like, OK, cool. Is there a lot of comics up in San
*  Francisco? Yeah. And there's a lot of comics that just come down or come up for this. Like,
*  oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. From all the area. OK. Red band on Twitter, red band on Instagram.
*  Yes. Nope. That's it. Check me out on Ari Shaffir's podcast. I just did a skeptic tank.
*  Bye, everybody.
