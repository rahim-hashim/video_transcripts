# Joe Rogan Experience #2342 - Jim Norton
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=0.0s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6.0s)]
*  Why the fuck did I put this up? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=14.0s)]
*  Riley, what are you going to do with it? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, I should have thrown it out, but I'm just, I feel like if somebody put effort into it and gave it to me, just keep it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=22.0s)]
*  Well that's how I wound up with this fucking snake on the desk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=24.0s)]
*  This is from, this during the entire podcast, Harlan Williams had this in his pants, and he was saying that he got a worm. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=27.0s)]
*  He named his worm Demetri, and at the end of the podcast he pulls it out, and then he got such a fucking kick out of the fact that it was still on the desk when I interviewed Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=39.0s)]
*  I hope you explain where it came from. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=49.0s)]
*  I didn't say shit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=51.0s)]
*  As president, hold that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=52.0s)]
*  I didn't say anything. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=53.0s)]
*  I think it's funny, because when you said that, I was like, who gave that to you? Is that a seven year old? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=54.0s)]
*  It works out perfect. That feels correct. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=58.0s)]
*  He is so unique. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=62.0s)]
*  He is, and I forgot he was in something about Mary. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=64.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=67.0s)]
*  Which is literally one of the funniest movies ever made. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=68.0s)]
*  Ever. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=70.0s)]
*  And I watched him again, and I'm like, god damn I wish I was in that. I wish I had one line in that movie. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=71.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. Well the Farley brothers, they're the best. They have some bangers, Matt. Kingpin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, Bill Murray. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=81.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=82.0s)]
*  You don't like them? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=83.0s)]
*  No, no, they're fine. I'm so used to them. I hate my own voice, and hearing it come back, it's like I've been doing radio for 20 years, and I still don't like to listen to my own fucking voice. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=84.0s)]
*  Well you used to do one. You used to do the one ear thing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=92.0s)]
*  But I saw Rich Voss, like too many times I've seen clips of Voss, and he just does that, and I'm like, do I look like that? Have I looked like that for two decades? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=95.0s)]
*  I'm like, fucking Rich, put it on or take it off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=103.0s)]
*  I like one ear. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=105.0s)]
*  He just likes one ear open. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=107.0s)]
*  I like one ear. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=109.0s)]
*  I firmly believe that's some kind of like a childhood defense thing. Like there was something fishy that happened in childhood where you just kind of somehow stay present. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=110.0s)]
*  Always be aware. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah, somebody fumbled. Yeah, somebody fumbled around. I just got to keep my ears open. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=121.0s)]
*  I don't know, that's a thing though. A lot of people like one ear on. It's not uncommon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=126.0s)]
*  You feel, when you have both ears covered, I just feel like I'm lost and I'm not in the room. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=132.0s)]
*  And I guess I've gotten a little bit better with it, but just now I'm like, wow, I really can't hear. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=137.0s)]
*  I always feel like I'm just fully locked in. You know, I don't hear anything else. I don't hear any distractions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=143.0s)]
*  When the headphones on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=149.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like the headphones on. I like to be locked in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do, but I just feel like, it feels like I'm underwater sometimes. I went in for an MRI. I just go for them like once a year. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=152.0s)]
*  Do you? Just for the fuck of it? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=160.0s)]
*  I want to. Yeah, I'm getting older and I'm like, you know, I want to fucking make sure I'm good. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=161.0s)]
*  Like make sure there's no lumps or anything. And they give you those shitty headphones. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=164.0s)]
*  And I'm so claustrophobic. I'm laying there and I'm terrified. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=169.0s)]
*  And the noise. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=173.0s)]
*  Yeah, being married prepares you for that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=174.0s)]
*  You get good at blocking out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=182.0s)]
*  Oh my God. You feel claustrophobic. There's a loud noise. You want to kill yourself. Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=183.0s)]
*  My wife will be in full conversation with me. I have no idea what she said. I'm just fully blocked it out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah. How many things have I agreed to? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=193.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=195.0s)]
*  Because I want her to shut up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=196.0s)]
*  I told you about it the other day. I'm like, you did? I don't want to argue. I'm like, I forgot. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry. I just. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=202.0s)]
*  I don't want to tell you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=203.0s)]
*  But it's, I asked the guy, he goes, do you want music? And I'm like, yeah, I'll have the, I'm like, play rock. I just rock. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=204.0s)]
*  And he was fucking like, he didn't speak English that well. So he started playing the Rocky theme song over and over. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=209.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=216.0s)]
*  I actually bailed out and got out of the machine. I couldn't finish. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=217.0s)]
*  Because you couldn't hear the song anymore? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=220.0s)]
*  No, I just was too freaked out. I'm like, this guy's not hearing me. I'm squeezing that fucking ball. It's awful. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=221.0s)]
*  So he had to take me out. And I'm like, I'll go back in. He goes, no, we'll have to start over. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=228.0s)]
*  Because once, apparently in an MRI, like you have to be in the same position. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=232.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=237.0s)]
*  So I just, I said, fuck it. They did my whole body and they just, they couldn't finish with the brain. I was just like, I'm done. I'm out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=238.0s)]
*  Your brain's fine. You don't want to look in there anywhere. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=243.0s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=245.0s)]
*  No, I don't really want to see what's going on. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=246.0s)]
*  No, no, no. Just little pliers across the wrong way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=248.0s)]
*  Imagine if you look into your brain and see your memories. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=253.0s)]
*  Eventually. I mean, Black Mary did an episode of that where you're like, I love how they keep the technology simple. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=257.0s)]
*  Where you're just kind of scrolling through something and they can see all the memories. And you'll eventually be able to do that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=263.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah. Eventually we'll have a hard drive in our head. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=270.0s)]
*  I would do it too. I like, I would absolutely link up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=273.0s)]
*  We talked about Ray Kurzweil, who talks about like singularity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=276.0s)]
*  I still think his time frame is wishful thinking. He thinks by like 2045. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=281.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=285.0s)]
*  He'll be in his like 90s. So I think he's just trying to hope it happens. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=286.0s)]
*  He might be right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=290.0s)]
*  That makes sense. 20 years from now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's correct. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=293.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=295.0s)]
*  I think everything's moving in exponential pace. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=296.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, if you just look at what's happening with AI, AI 10 years ago was non-existent. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=299.0s)]
*  You never heard anything about it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=306.0s)]
*  And now everybody uses it on their phone all the time. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=307.0s)]
*  I use it. My wife's obsessed with it, which is irritating because she like literally will just talk to it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=310.0s)]
*  And so I'm like, all right, let me try it and see. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=315.0s)]
*  But it's great if like you get an error message on your computer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=317.0s)]
*  Like what is fucking Mac error one one one mean? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=320.0s)]
*  And then you add it and it actually tells you in a very comprehensive way what that error message means. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=323.0s)]
*  Better than Googling something. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=328.0s)]
*  So I'm using it for that. It's great for a lot of things. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=330.0s)]
*  Kids are using it, though, unfortunately, for like term papers and shit. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=333.0s)]
*  And they're getting busted because AI knows when it's AI. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=336.0s)]
*  So they just run the paper into AI and AI goes, oh, yeah, I made. Oh, yeah, that's that's my work. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=344.0s)]
*  But I mean, it's good for for looking things up right now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=346.0s)]
*  I'm just using it as a better Google. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=349.0s)]
*  But when I attach it to my brain, no, because I was in it the other day and it said we detected suspicious activities. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=351.0s)]
*  So they want me to log in. Maybe because I had a VPN or something. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=358.0s)]
*  Because in Texas, you can't jerk off without a fucking VPN. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=361.0s)]
*  They want your license to watch porn. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=364.0s)]
*  Is that crazy? It sucks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=366.0s)]
*  It's a we're protecting children too fucking late. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=368.0s)]
*  First of all, is if kids don't know about VPNs, they all do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=372.0s)]
*  It's one of those things where I get you don't want your kids to watch porn. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=376.0s)]
*  That's fine. And it's a lot harder. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=378.0s)]
*  It was harder when I was a child to get you to find like magazines in the woods. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=384.0s)]
*  But I meant the smell of those old shitty magazines. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=385.0s)]
*  Yeah. Find them and fucking it was the best. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=388.0s)]
*  But now if I had it on my phone or I had the availability, I mean, my sex addiction would have been even worse. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=390.0s)]
*  So I guess what I get why they want to protect kids. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=395.0s)]
*  Oh, it's got to be fucking kids up. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=397.0s)]
*  It's not just that, but the violence that they say you see so much violence. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=399.0s)]
*  I see way more violence now than I've ever seen in my whole life. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=402.0s)]
*  Way more murders and car accidents and animal attacks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=405.0s)]
*  And I see Tom Sager and I have this horrible text thread. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=409.0s)]
*  We text each other the worst shit we find every day. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=413.0s)]
*  We're trying to freak each other out. And we've been doing it for years. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=416.0s)]
*  And so it's just my algorithms fucked. Yeah, it's just fucked. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=419.0s)]
*  Do you there's there's certain sites and I never promote the site just because it's just too gruesome. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=423.0s)]
*  But there's one site I go to where you can do everything. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=428.0s)]
*  They'd be headings. And I would look at this stuff before bed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=431.0s)]
*  And I don't know why. I wouldn't enjoy seeing it, but I would look at it and it just gives you some kind of a weird, horrible feeling. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=434.0s)]
*  But there's certain things I can't watch at this point. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=443.0s)]
*  Like I can't watch people burning anymore. That's a roughly more. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=445.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. At one point, all burnings were all the race. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=449.0s)]
*  I can't watch them anymore. It's all that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=452.0s)]
*  That's such a crazy thing to say. I can't watch people burning anymore. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=454.0s)]
*  I'm just I'm all burnt out. It bothered me. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=457.0s)]
*  It got to a point where I could I can't see beheadings anymore. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=460.0s)]
*  Like there was a point where I could watch them and just almost watch detached. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=462.0s)]
*  But now I just it's too. Remember the journalist? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=466.0s)]
*  It was like Daniel Pearl. Yeah, yeah, that's right. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=469.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was like the first. But the camera man panicked and kind of came off him a little bit. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=472.0s)]
*  And so they didn't it was kind of they showed it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=477.0s)]
*  But that was the first one. Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=480.0s)]
*  And then that guy they called Jihad John, who was like because he was British when they eventually caught him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=482.0s)]
*  I forget the other people he did, but it was like certain contractors and stuff that they would they would put those orange jumpsuits to mimic Guantanamo. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=489.0s)]
*  And they would just prove gruesome shit, man, really gruesome, gruesome shit. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=496.0s)]
*  And it does fuck you up. A hundred percent. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=500.0s)]
*  I don't know what it does, but it fucks you up. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=502.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know how it messes me up, but it definitely is not healthy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=506.0s)]
*  Well, it makes you feel the anxiety and just knowing that that exists and then seeing it are two very different things. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=509.0s)]
*  Yeah, knowing it exists and seeing it. And then I'm always like, well, I like watching. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=517.0s)]
*  I can still watch car accidents because it's tangible. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=520.0s)]
*  Like a car accident is a tangible thing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=525.0s)]
*  Like if you if you're not careful, you drive like an asshole. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=527.0s)]
*  This is what happens to you. Or if someone's driving like an asshole, you're not paying attention. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=530.0s)]
*  You've got to be aware of everybody. Right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=534.0s)]
*  So I try not to text and drive anymore. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=536.0s)]
*  I remember one time I was doing a gig and I was in full sex addict mode and fucking Sam Roberts. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=538.0s)]
*  He was still an intern at that point came with me because Kenny was busy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=543.0s)]
*  So Sam came to help me sell merchandise. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=547.0s)]
*  And I remember he was I think I let him I drove, but he was in the passenger seat and I was just dirty talk texting the whole way home because I couldn't text and drive because he was in the car. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=549.0s)]
*  And I was like, I can't get fucking I can't be texting some woman and kill the intern. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=560.0s)]
*  That would just be a loss. It's a happen. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=565.0s)]
*  So it's like the texting and driving thing I've kind of backed off of. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=567.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's what Apple CarPlay is for. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=570.0s)]
*  You know, you don't do that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=572.0s)]
*  Fuck, dude. The idea of I mean, I did that one time. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=575.0s)]
*  I connected my phone to a BMW X6. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=578.0s)]
*  My girlfriend at the time, my ex-girlfriend came with me to the dealership and the guy is telling me, oh, you should connect your phone. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=583.0s)]
*  And I do. And my fucking phone, my my phone book, my contact list comes up. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=589.0s)]
*  Right. And one of the girls, you know, I put where how I knew her. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=596.0s)]
*  And it was like a domination fantasy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=599.0s)]
*  So that came up her name and domination fantasy came up on that little window in the X6. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=602.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'll never connect anything to my car again. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=607.0s)]
*  There's just just too much going on. Just change the name. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=611.0s)]
*  I mean, I mean, how much time do I have to go back and change all the names? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=613.0s)]
*  Change the name to like personal trainer. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=617.0s)]
*  But that's another code word. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=620.0s)]
*  I got busted one time talking dirty. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=622.0s)]
*  I was texting dirty and the girl, the escort's name came up on my phone. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=626.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like one of those names that cannot be like a regular person. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=630.0s)]
*  So I ran my girlfriend was fucking screaming at me in the car. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=633.0s)]
*  Who the fuck is that? I'm like, it's fucking Anthony. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=637.0s)]
*  I'm like, I have a code word for Anthony in case I ever lose my phone. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=640.0s)]
*  So I had to run up into the bathroom and just like my fingers were shaking and change it to Anthony. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=643.0s)]
*  And I came in 15 minutes later. I'm like, see, it's Anthony. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=647.0s)]
*  But it was by then it was like you blew it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=650.0s)]
*  He got caught. So I don't connect anything. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=652.0s)]
*  Even though I don't I'm not fucking anybody else. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=655.0s)]
*  I still don't I don't trust it. I don't I don't connect anything to my car. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=658.0s)]
*  Well, your phone is listening anyway. Mine is for sure. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=661.0s)]
*  Mine. I've come to grips with the fact that everything that I text is getting read. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=664.0s)]
*  Probably 100 percent. No questions through the ads, including like stuff that's on signal. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=668.0s)]
*  You know, Tucker told me that he said that they found his the government knew that he was going to meet poochy. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=675.0s)]
*  Because they read a signal. And he's like, I didn't even know that that was possible. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=681.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is that the one that they got? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=685.0s)]
*  They got caught using in the defense chat signal. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=687.0s)]
*  But that was because there was another guy in the signal chat that I think someone let in the signal chat on purpose. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=690.0s)]
*  Was it on purpose? Or do you think it was one of those things where you fuck up and you just like, you know, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=696.0s)]
*  how you'll send something and a predictive text like name comes up and you just hit like if I'm going to text you [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=700.0s)]
*  and I accidentally J.O. and all of a sudden it's Joe DeRosa comes up. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=706.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And I just send him. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=710.0s)]
*  I've done that before, but this was a giant group of people that are in the Defense Department. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=712.0s)]
*  How do you include a reporter in that? That's a terrible mistake. That doesn't make any sense. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=717.0s)]
*  My ex publicist was bad mouthing me to somebody and she actually sent it to me by mistake. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=722.0s)]
*  What did she say? It wasn't an overt. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=727.0s)]
*  It was one of those things where we weren't working together anymore. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=730.0s)]
*  And I was doing a Neil Brennan's podcast and like blocks where you talk about these things that blocked. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=732.0s)]
*  And I think she sent something about like, oh, well, Norton's on three blocks already. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=739.0s)]
*  No shock. It was just it was some comment that was not complimentary. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=743.0s)]
*  And then it was like, oh, sorry, I meant that for him. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=746.0s)]
*  And I just kind of left it there. Like, I got it. I knew you didn't like me. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=749.0s)]
*  That's why I left you. Your own publicist hate your guts. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=752.0s)]
*  Publicists can be such a problem. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=755.0s)]
*  And you're so incompatible with people that are wild. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=758.0s)]
*  Yes, because all they want to do is they have to paint it in a way that's palatable to everybody. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=762.0s)]
*  Like, I understand that it's a hard job and you have some fucking asshole who's out trying to get laid. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=768.0s)]
*  That's the like a guy like you or someone who says wild things. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=772.0s)]
*  You know, it's like that's part of the fun of being you. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=776.0s)]
*  Yes, but it also comes back. And it's it's it's here's where it's negative. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=779.0s)]
*  I do on YouTube. I have the podcast and I'm trying to do podcast ads. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=784.0s)]
*  I've never you know, I never bought ads on YouTube before. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=787.0s)]
*  But I'm like, it doesn't buy you views. It just puts it like where people will see it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=790.0s)]
*  And if they like it, they click on it. Every one of my ads gets shot down. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=793.0s)]
*  They accuse me of election advertising in the United States. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=796.0s)]
*  I put up an ad and they said this violates election advertising. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=800.0s)]
*  And I didn't even know how to respond to that. What was the ad? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=804.0s)]
*  And it might have been a joke. I had George Santos on. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=807.0s)]
*  But it was it was just a funny podcast. That guy's hilarious. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=811.0s)]
*  He was fucking he told me how bad Jerry Nadler smelled. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=813.0s)]
*  I asked him what the worst breath in Congress and he wouldn't answer. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=818.0s)]
*  But he told me the worst body odor was Jerry Nadler. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=821.0s)]
*  It was funny. He's funny. He's a character. He is. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=823.0s)]
*  It's just amazing that he was a congressman. I know. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=826.0s)]
*  I have a real affection. You know how it is when you meet somebody. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=829.0s)]
*  It's like they're they're always more human when you meet them. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=831.0s)]
*  It's harder to not like somebody like I don't agree with Lauren Bo Bard. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=834.0s)]
*  But I met her and she couldn't have been nicer. I'm like, I can't dislike her. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=837.0s)]
*  She was nice to me. Right. Right. So whenever you meet someone and I had him over and he was great. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=840.0s)]
*  He was funny. So a sense of humor about himself and he was shit talking and caddy. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=844.0s)]
*  And yeah, fuck, I love this guy. But they accused me of election advertising. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=849.0s)]
*  So now so many times I've tried to put ads after and they continually say it's either shocking content or election advertising. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=852.0s)]
*  Oh, they're just targeting. They're just talking to me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=859.0s)]
*  And so how are you supposed to advertise comedy with with some profanity in it if it's shocking content? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=861.0s)]
*  How was that election? I mean, he's not even running for anything. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=867.0s)]
*  And it wasn't it wasn't a political rally podcast at all. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=869.0s)]
*  It was just us talking about what happened and we chatted politics. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=874.0s)]
*  But I don't I don't push political views on. They've got you labeled right wing, which is kind of funny. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=877.0s)]
*  Is that it really is so funny. And people don't know what to like the conservatives. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=883.0s)]
*  It's so funny. People come see me from Gutfeld. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=887.0s)]
*  So I do got thought a lot and his people will come see me. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=889.0s)]
*  And it's just fun when I talk about my wife to watch the joy drain out of their faces like a trans woman. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=892.0s)]
*  We had no idea. That's not the type of Tucker we like, buddy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=898.0s)]
*  They get very it's a very weird place to be. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=904.0s)]
*  Yeah. People who like my humor don't necessarily like my personal life and people who like my personal life don't necessarily like my humor. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=907.0s)]
*  It's a weird I guess if nobody feels like you're 100 percent in with them, they don't know what to make of you. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=914.0s)]
*  Well, you were saying that about Oliver Anthony and that I wasn't aware of that he was getting in trouble [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=921.0s)]
*  apparently right after Richmond North of Richmond came out that people were saying he wasn't really conservative. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=926.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were giving him shit about saying like, oh, he's not who we thought he was. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=932.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, he writes this great song and people love it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=937.0s)]
*  And they look at his art and they love his art. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=940.0s)]
*  But because he feels a little bit differently, a lot of people turned on him and it was like, what do you I wasn't even aware of that at all. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=942.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know. Do you know what the subject was? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=948.0s)]
*  I don't remember if they if he had said something after it or if they went back and found out things he had said prior that they felt like his politics didn't line up. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=952.0s)]
*  It's almost like when they got mad about fucking Dylan Mulvaney, like needing to connect to the belief system of somebody who drinks the same beverage is just such fucking psychotic. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=962.0s)]
*  And again, I've drank piss. I don't expect a whole lot of people to line up politically and rally behind me with fucking yellow flags. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=974.0s)]
*  But I just don't care. I don't give a fuck. I don't care who who believes it or like I don't care. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=981.0s)]
*  Like what the I mean, I'm a fucking Sabbath fan. I don't give a shit who those guys vote for. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=988.0s)]
*  It's so so stupid, inconsequential to me. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=992.0s)]
*  Well, it's just a symptom of this bizarrely disconnected society where everybody's so separated. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=996.0s)]
*  It is. And you got it. It's got to be driving you crazy or maybe you detachment because you see things. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1003.0s)]
*  I mean, I know you. So I'll see them say like he's just right. And I'm like, you guys don't really know Joe. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's like it's they don't to see yourself painted in such a way has got to be at one point frustrating. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1012.0s)]
*  And then you have to just let it go. Right. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1017.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to let it go. But when I mean, the most frustrating thing was seeing it on CNN. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1019.0s)]
*  I was like, OK, so this thing that I thought was the news for right now, I know you're not accurate at all because you're you're attacking me. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1024.0s)]
*  And you're painting me in this very bizarre light because it's convenient for you. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1032.0s)]
*  There is a weird thing. And maybe this is again, because I'm in my 50s and I remember like thinking the news was real and accurate. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1036.0s)]
*  I mean, you remember Walter Cronkite and all that shit. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1044.0s)]
*  And it's it's this constant sense of disappointment, like, fuck, like they're really not what I like. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1047.0s)]
*  I'm still an idiot who believes in like the adults and they're going to do the right thing. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1053.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it just constantly is a confirmation that they are they're liars. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1057.0s)]
*  They're fucking biased liars. Yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1061.0s)]
*  And they're paid to lie. They're just propagandists. That's what the news, the mainstream news is. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1063.0s)]
*  I mean, there's real news now. Sure. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1068.0s)]
*  You can get the real news from Glenn Greenwald. You can get the real news from Matt Taibbi. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1070.0s)]
*  There's a few people out there that will give you unbiased news. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1074.0s)]
*  But it's so funny, like even them, you know, when they will highlight a very particular thing that maybe Trump did or someone did on the right. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1077.0s)]
*  And everybody attacks them. It's like, do you want them to lie? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1085.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just because you want your team to be infallible. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1088.0s)]
*  Like, what do you what do you want? And Glenn Greenwald, I had never heard of him. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1092.0s)]
*  I don't really follow a lot of like what people are saying. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1096.0s)]
*  I don't watch debates, but I obviously heard about him when that video came out and I saw and I loved how he handled that. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1098.0s)]
*  Yeah, he handled it great. Privacy invasions are so fucking disgusting. Right. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1105.0s)]
*  They're disgusting when they're done to anybody. I don't care how much you hate the guy's guts. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1109.0s)]
*  But I was I was like, I don't even know who this guy is, but I like how he addressed that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1113.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's my private life and tough shit. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1116.0s)]
*  You know, I kind of I like that he handled that. I thought very, very. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1118.0s)]
*  Yeah. He took it head on. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1122.0s)]
*  And well, John Ronson talked about that in his book. You've been publicly shamed. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1124.0s)]
*  You know, like if you're not ashamed, then it doesn't work. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1128.0s)]
*  And that's the reality of it. And Glenn handled it perfectly. He's not ashamed. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1131.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we can't let them see you're ashamed because I'm you know, I wake up and just dipped in it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1135.0s)]
*  I fucking the first thing I think of. Good morning, shame. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1141.0s)]
*  But that's you're open about it, though. I mean, that's the thing. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1145.0s)]
*  It's like they can't really attack you for something that you're attacking yourself for. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1148.0s)]
*  Yes. And if you tell them like I did something like I it's so it's so I watched my special premiered [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1151.0s)]
*  and I went into YouTube and I watched it with people as they were watching and just commenting and talking [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1158.0s)]
*  and this horrible feeling of shame, even when people are being nice. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1163.0s)]
*  I can't get away from how embarrassed I am. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1168.0s)]
*  Like it's almost like when people see you doing something, you're like, oh, Jimmy's trying. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1171.0s)]
*  Look at little Jimmy. Yeah. And I was typing back and everything, but it was it's so anti what feels good for me to do. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1175.0s)]
*  Even when people are being nice, I find it horrifying and humiliating. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1184.0s)]
*  I don't know where that comes from, but I kind of wish I didn't have it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1187.0s)]

*  Well, I think everybody hates watching themselves. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1252.0s)]
*  First of all, because when I watch a comic, I want to watch a comic doing material either that I know and I want to see again. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1255.0s)]
*  You know, like if I'm watching Shane and he's doing his bit on the Navy Seals, I want to see it again. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1262.0s)]
*  Or I want I just want to see it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1267.0s)]
*  You know, I want to I want to just I've never seen it develop. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1271.0s)]
*  I want to see the thing. But when you're doing it, you're aware of everything. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1275.0s)]
*  You're aware of all the edits you've made. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1279.0s)]
*  You're aware of all the different ways you've done it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1281.0s)]
*  Yeah. Your way of when you're trying to sell it a little too much and you're not in the moment. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1283.0s)]
*  You know, like there's all the grossness that you see that other people aren't going to see. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1288.0s)]
*  We like, oh, it's fun. I hate watching myself. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1292.0s)]
*  Dude, it was so hard. It was so hard not to just attack myself in the chat. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1296.0s)]
*  Like all I wanted to do is watch it and go, oh, boo, boo. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1300.0s)]
*  Nice blinking 56 year old. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1304.0s)]
*  But I didn't do it. I'm like, don't be a fucking I think it was Jay Okerson was doing something. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1310.0s)]
*  He did his special and he shot it at Skankfest one year. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1315.0s)]
*  And I think Lewis took him out and they were looking at the stage before. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1317.0s)]
*  And I was one of those guys like, you know, Jay is just like, oh, he's a fucking fuck it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1320.0s)]
*  I think Lewis goes, you know, sometimes I know we're like that, but you just got to enjoy it like once. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1324.0s)]
*  And I thought of that. I'm like, sometimes just enjoy things are going OK. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're happy with what you did. I love the special. I love the material. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1332.0s)]
*  Don't put yourself in a position where you're like, you fucking suck. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1336.0s)]
*  Like it doesn't have to be that way. Just put it out there and walk away from it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1339.0s)]
*  Leave it alone. Let people decide what they decide. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1343.0s)]
*  And if you don't like it, you just work on the next one and make sure that you don't make the same mistakes twice. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1347.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can do. But I spent a lot of time like I wouldn't. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1353.0s)]
*  I don't think I've ever loved anything as I put it out. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1357.0s)]
*  This I like more. But the older you get, the better you get. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1359.0s)]
*  So it's like a little easier now than it was. Yeah. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1361.0s)]
*  The first Tonight Show I did was 2004. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1363.0s)]
*  And I was out in L.A. and I was doing my buddy Joey Silvera, who works for Evil Angel and would film a lot of the greatest porn. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1366.0s)]
*  Joey was a fucking you'd recognize him if you saw him. He was in old movies. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1372.0s)]
*  So I went to his house to watch my first Tonight Show with another guy, this other guy, Brandon Iron. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1375.0s)]
*  And I went to the basement while they watched up. I couldn't watch it in front of other people. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1383.0s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious. It was just and it's not to be because I think I'm an artist. It's just humiliating. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1387.0s)]
*  It's fucking it's embarrassing. Yeah. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1391.0s)]
*  Because I feel like I'm lucky. You know, laugh like I just I don't people to feel pressure to laugh. Right. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1394.0s)]
*  Because I'm around. It's weird. It's weird watching yourself. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1399.0s)]
*  Some guys can do it, though. Yeah, they're psychos. They are fucking psychopaths. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1403.0s)]
*  They're probably not healthy. Oh, my God. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1407.0s)]
*  You know what? Mental illness. You need to sit someone down next to you when you're special playing. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1410.0s)]
*  How about people that want you to watch their thing and they want to sit there with you? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1414.0s)]
*  Like, hey, watch this. And you're like, I don't know. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1418.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's it's it's it puts you in a weird if I if I do an acting role, I don't love acting, which is great, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1421.0s)]
*  because nobody loves when I do it. It works out nicely. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1427.0s)]
*  But if I do something I like, I have to see it first and I have to watch it and go, OK, I'm not embarrassed by this. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1430.0s)]
*  I can go and watch it in a premiere. Like, you know, I mean, like I have to see it first. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1435.0s)]
*  So no, if I'm going to feel humiliated, the Irishman I didn't see first, obviously, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1439.0s)]
*  he's not going to send me a fucking cut. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1444.0s)]
*  And I didn't know I made it until like literally the night before. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1446.0s)]
*  But that was different. I'm like, I don't care how whatever it was. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1449.0s)]
*  It was just it was a stand up performance. Right. Right. Right. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1452.0s)]
*  A little bit easier than, oh, yeah. Acting. It's humiliating. Yeah, it's gross. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1454.0s)]
*  I don't like any of it. I went I've been in a couple of movies. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1458.0s)]
*  I've refused to go to the red carpet. I sneak in through the back. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1462.0s)]
*  I'm like they were like, I want you to walk the red carpet. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1466.0s)]
*  I'm like, nope. Is it because you don't like because everyone would talk to you? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1468.0s)]
*  I'm afraid no one's going to talk to me on the red carpet. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1471.0s)]
*  Like, do you know how embarrassing it is when you hear that person who walks you through in the front [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1473.0s)]
*  and like you're standing there ready for your moment and you hear them going Jim Norton. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1480.0s)]
*  And then you'll hear a second and then she goes, Jim Norton's comedian. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1484.0s)]
*  That's like, oh, fuck, they have no idea who I am. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1487.0s)]
*  It's just humiliating. So I don't like doing it, man. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1490.0s)]
*  But I just don't like the attention. I don't like standing there where they take pictures. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1493.0s)]
*  Just stand there. Just looking around. Look at me, Joe. Look at me. Look at me. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1497.0s)]
*  Over here. Over here. Some people love it. Actresses love it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1501.0s)]
*  They pose. They like give you their good side. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1505.0s)]
*  Give you a little bit of practice in the mirror. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1510.0s)]
*  But I almost understand that I have more tolerance for actors who love it [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1513.0s)]
*  because even though they're big attention idiots as we are, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1517.0s)]
*  they don't get the constant feedback. For them, it's their night of feedback. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1522.0s)]
*  Right. Right. Whereas with us, we're like, I mean, I've been on a run for like four nights. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1526.0s)]
*  Before I came here, actually, at the cellar, I had four like shit nights in a row. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1532.0s)]
*  Just all the material I'm doing now is new. So it's like I'm trying this. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1535.0s)]
*  And, you know, it just feels like you're Frankensteining it. It's not there yet. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1538.0s)]
*  But I know I'm going to have another night and another night. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1541.0s)]
*  And that comes and goes quickly. But actors, they have like one night to stand there and smile. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1544.0s)]
*  And then they just get attacked in the fucking in the comments or in the reviews. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1549.0s)]
*  So I'm a little more tolerant of them than comedians who because comedians who love that. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1553.0s)]
*  It's like, how much fucking attention do you need, dude? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1557.0s)]
*  You constantly get feedback. Yeah. You should be shying away from feedback. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1560.0s)]
*  Too much feedback is bad for you. Do you really believe that? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1565.0s)]
*  100 percent. And I stopped. I stopped reading Twitter comments. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1568.0s)]
*  Occasionally I'll do it now. And it wasn't just to say I wasn't reading them. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1571.0s)]
*  It was because even positive feedback, I call me you needy fuck. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1575.0s)]
*  How much how much, you know, how many taps on the shoulder do you need? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1579.0s)]
*  How many like, good job, Jim, or you suck. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1582.0s)]
*  Like how much interaction from people do you need? It's not normal. It's not healthy. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1585.0s)]
*  I stopped reading almost everything, even stuff that's not me. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1590.0s)]
*  And I stopped a couple of weeks ago. I just stopped going on social media. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1594.0s)]
*  I will occasionally if someone sends me something funny, I'll watch it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1598.0s)]
*  But then I get off my phone right away. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1601.0s)]
*  I just and I think on my new phone number that I'm going to get, I'm not going to have any social media. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1603.0s)]
*  I'm just going to keep my old phone number and only use that for social media. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1608.0s)]
*  I just don't think it's good for you. It's not. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1611.0s)]
*  And although there's times like my algorithm, I'm obsessed with I think we talk about just Japanese hornets and a lot of MMA. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1613.0s)]
*  Like my algorithm is healthier now than it would be. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1619.0s)]
*  There's still a few things that will pop up that, you know, show what I've been looking at. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1622.0s)]
*  Like if my wife is next, she'll see what I'm looking at. I'm like, oh, no, it's just, you know, you know how it is. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1626.0s)]
*  You go down the rabbit hole, you probably shouldn't go down. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1630.0s)]
*  But it's not as unhealthy as it would have been at one point. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1633.0s)]
*  Like a lot of it is just MMA stuff and animals and nice shit. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1635.0s)]
*  Yeah, I get a lot of that. A lot of us people get knocked out. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1640.0s)]
*  You like the knocked out. I like watching jujitsu tips because then I'll bring them in and ask the guy to show me like, how do you is it possible to do this? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1643.0s)]
*  And he'll kind of show me and I'll just forget it. But it's fun. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1651.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've got a lot of that, too. But it's just I just think it's a giant waste of time. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1654.0s)]
*  And it's also your brain needs time to just think and you need time to just be in your own head and think about your own thoughts and trying to formulate them properly. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1659.0s)]
*  Really like get an understanding. Like, why do I think this way? What is what is it about this that is that I've decided is correct? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1669.0s)]
*  Right. And roll it around. And when you're constantly looking at other people's thoughts, I just don't think it gives you much time for that. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1676.0s)]
*  That's exactly it. Why do I think what I think? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1682.0s)]
*  Hitchens did a great speech. It was in Toronto about free speech. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1685.0s)]
*  And one of the things he was talking about is when somebody says something that you don't agree with. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1689.0s)]
*  I think the example he gave was Holocaust denial. He goes, you have to protect that person's speech because if nothing else, it makes you examine. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1694.0s)]
*  OK, well, how do I know what I know? How do I know other than someone told me? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1702.0s)]
*  Like, you have to kind of examine how you come to your own conclusions. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1706.0s)]
*  And I do that a lot. Like in the shower, I'll just kind of stand there. It's really like we all have a weird showering method. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1711.0s)]
*  I just kind of stand there with my hands like this. Bizarre. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1716.0s)]
*  I just stand there and I think or I go through arguments or I go through conversations or debates. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1719.0s)]
*  And that's the one time I really get to think during the day where I don't let anything else interfere. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1725.0s)]
*  But being off social media is probably a lot healthier. Just again, it's other people's thoughts. I don't care what people think. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1731.0s)]
*  I don't know why I read it. Well, I care what people think, but I don't care enough to have that intervene and invade my thoughts all day long. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1736.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm fascinated by people, but I like to talk to them for real, for real like this. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1745.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is like, you know, because I think that's also having a podcast and having what I think is the best way to communicate with people and to be able to be so lucky to be able to do it all the time. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1749.0s)]
*  I think I get plenty of other people's input. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1761.0s)]
*  Right. And you get the real opinions and you sense up in a room with a person. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1764.0s)]
*  Again, it's harder to dislike or to caricature somebody when you've met them and when you've actually sat with them. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1769.0s)]
*  It's like, I know this person. I kind of felt their energy and it's like they're just a regular person. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1776.0s)]
*  It's easier when you look at somebody to hate their guts. Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1781.0s)]
*  And I've bashed a few people. It was always so embarrassing. We would do Jocktober. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1784.0s)]
*  And ONA never went into other people's studios, but I would. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1789.0s)]
*  And I'd be on the road and it was the fucking I was in Boston with Kenny one time. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1792.0s)]
*  He's like, they're having you in, but you jocktobered them. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1796.0s)]
*  So I went in and you know, you just go there like, yeah, you really. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1803.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, man, it was just something we do. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1808.0s)]
*  But you have you face it and you realize they're nice guys. It was just a dumb radio show. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1810.0s)]
*  I had fun and I'd actually become friendly with a couple of guys who we used to attack. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1814.0s)]
*  But you only get that through meeting somebody and actually talking to them. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1818.0s)]
*  Right. The worst is when you meet someone and you have a conversation with them and you're cool. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1821.0s)]
*  You think, oh, we're good. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1825.0s)]
*  And then they'll go and talk shit about you somewhere else and completely mischaracterize you. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1827.0s)]
*  Have you had that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've had that. Yeah, that's embarrassing. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1831.0s)]
*  It's sad. It feels bad. Yeah. Well, it's just like, OK. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1836.0s)]
*  Well, I'll never talk to you again because I know that you do this now. It's crazy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1839.0s)]
*  Yeah. And but it's also it's like, why are you doing that? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1843.0s)]
*  Generally, it's when I had a conversation with them and it didn't go well for them. Right. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1846.0s)]
*  So then they just harbor that thing and then they just fucking stew it in their head. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1851.0s)]
*  And then they just mischaracterize you and try to twist you around because they're trying to win this argument. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1855.0s)]
*  They already lost. Yes. You know, it's like, you know, when you get an argument, you didn't have anything to say. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1860.0s)]
*  And then you're in the shower like, I should have said this. Yeah, I should have said that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1865.0s)]
*  They're just doing that and they're just going and doing that on another podcast. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1869.0s)]
*  Yes. Re-litigating what the jury is already coming out. Yes. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1872.0s)]
*  And it's human instinct to do. I also think sometimes people do it and they don't think you're going to see it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1877.0s)]
*  Like, especially when you're you know, you've such a high level of like recognition that if somebody they'll probably never see this and I can just and then you see it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1883.0s)]
*  They're probably like, I shouldn't have said that. But I've read things that hurt my feelings. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1890.0s)]
*  I'm like, why would you say that? Like, yeah, I was nice to you. I don't know. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1894.0s)]
*  It's weird. It's like, you know, humans are so strange. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1899.0s)]
*  We're so strange in our weird little quirks and the way we communicate with each other. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1902.0s)]
*  And what is truth? What's real? Who are you? You know, who are you? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1906.0s)]
*  You're different every day. Yeah, you're different depending on how your day went. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1911.0s)]
*  You know, your reaction to something is I remember one time this guy wasn't paying attention. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1915.0s)]
*  Traffic was stopped and he rear ended me and he didn't have a license. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1920.0s)]
*  He's from Mexico, but I had been doing yoga like every day. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1924.0s)]
*  And I was like, you OK? He's like, yeah, I'm OK. I'm like, all right, man. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1928.0s)]
*  And I go, why don't you have a license? He's like, can't get a license. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1932.0s)]
*  I go, well, so why are you driving? He's like, I got to work. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1936.0s)]
*  All right. I get it. I wasn't mad at him. But it was because I was doing yoga like every day. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1939.0s)]
*  We were doing this hot yoga challenge. Ari and Tom and Bert and I, I remember that we were doing it like I was doing yoga. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1944.0s)]
*  I was doing yoga like every day. So I was so calm. I was like, OK, well, take care of yourself. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1949.0s)]
*  I'm going to get out of here because his car was fucked. My car was fucked, but it was it was drivable. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1954.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a Porsche. It was a really nice car. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1959.0s)]
*  And he had like this fucking shitty Honda. And he but you know, the way he broke, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1962.0s)]
*  like when you break your your front end dives down. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1967.0s)]
*  And so he kind of got under my car and lifted my car up a little bit and caved in my back bumper a little bit. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1970.0s)]
*  They just replaced the bar and the engine wasn't fucked and my exhaust was dented a little bit. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1977.0s)]
*  His car was fucked. He couldn't drive. So he got to be there when the cops came. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1981.0s)]
*  And, you know, he couldn't drive away. Right. And I was like, I don't know. I'm going to get out of here. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1985.0s)]
*  Oh, you just left. Yeah. I was like, he doesn't have any money. Like I'm going to pay for this. Yes. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1990.0s)]
*  And I'm like, this is going to hurt me. I have the money to fix it. So all right. Take care, man. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1994.0s)]
*  Glad you're OK. Being Zen like that, like because it reminds me of I was leaving the Lincoln, the Holland Tunnel with Karen Fiehan. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=1998.0s)]
*  We were doing a gig in Jersey. It was bumper to bumper. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2004.0s)]
*  And I came, you know, there was like that merge where you think you're never going to get out of it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2007.0s)]
*  And a guy stopped. He goes, you hit my car. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2011.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I know I didn't hit his car, but he made us it was bumper to bumper. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2015.0s)]
*  Let's just talk on the other side of the tunnel. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2020.0s)]
*  Like, let's get out of this fuck. I was going to be late for the gig. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2022.0s)]
*  And he goes, no, we're going to pull over and wait for the police. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2024.0s)]
*  So I got this piece of shit is trying to shake me down. Yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2027.0s)]
*  So we wound up one of those awful traffic women was there. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2031.0s)]
*  You know, the people that just they work for the city and they dress like cops, but they're not cops. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2034.0s)]
*  But if you assault one of them, it's like a big deal. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2038.0s)]
*  So we pulled over and I said, is it OK if we just trade licenses? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2040.0s)]
*  And she went, yeah, just trade licenses, which I think kind of shamed him into like letting us move on. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2044.0s)]
*  Otherwise, he was going to have me fucking held up there or pay him on. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2049.0s)]
*  So you didn't hit his car at all. Karen said I didn't. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2053.0s)]
*  It was a merge. And if I did, it was a one mile an hour bump. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2056.0s)]
*  But there was no mark on his car at all. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2059.0s)]
*  I think the whole thing was a scam because we traded licenses and I never heard from the guy. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2061.0s)]
*  I've seen that thing where people get in front of people's cars and slam on the brakes. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2065.0s)]
*  It's I've seen it. Oh, and I mean, it's terrible. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2068.0s)]
*  And the best of what you have a dash cam. Oh, you see them. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2072.0s)]
*  They recognize the dash cam and then they just scurry back into their cars. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2075.0s)]

*  There was one recently, I think it was in New Jersey, where these people, they tried it and it didn't work. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2160.0s)]
*  Then they threw it in reverse and backed up fast and slammed into this guy's car or this lady's car. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2165.0s)]
*  But she had a dash cam the entire time and she's on the phone. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2172.0s)]
*  Oh my God, these people just backed up into me. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2174.0s)]
*  And then they got out of the car and they're like, what did you do? What did you do? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2177.0s)]
*  And then they saw the dash cam and they're like, oh, fuck. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2180.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen that. I think that's what I'm referring to. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2184.0s)]
*  They scurry back into the car and take off. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2185.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2187.0s)]
*  When I saw, like I'm so cynical, like people in Philly, you got to let people in Philly, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2188.0s)]
*  like if a bus hits something, there's like locals that will just run up and just lay next to the bus like they were in the fucking accident. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2192.0s)]
*  Which is, I get it, you know what I mean? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2198.0s)]
*  They forget that there's cameras everywhere and they can just see you walking up. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2200.0s)]
*  But this India Air India plane crash, my first thought was that this guy, they said survived. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2203.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, he's bullshitting. He didn't. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2207.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2209.0s)]
*  He's faking it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2210.0s)]
*  No, he survived. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2211.0s)]
*  But he did survive. Yeah, because he said one guy, his brother, was on the plane or something. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2212.0s)]
*  11A, seat 11A. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2215.0s)]
*  And by the way, to all the people who are going to now look for 11A, stop. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2217.0s)]
*  Yeah, stop. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2220.0s)]
*  If anything else, that's the last seat you should take. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2221.0s)]
*  Usually it's the back where you're best off. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2223.0s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if the plane broke open and he just got, there's a woman who was, I think she was a teenager when it happened, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2225.0s)]
*  it was called the woman who, the girl who fell from the sky. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2232.0s)]
*  And she had apparently, they were like two miles up and her, the plane blew up, whatever, and it came apart and she fell two miles. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2234.0s)]
*  Somehow survived. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2241.0s)]
*  She hit a barn, right? Didn't she go through the roof of a barn or something like that? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2242.0s)]
*  No, she fell into the, what do they call the fucking, the Brazil rainforest. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2246.0s)]
*  Oh, the Amazon? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2252.0s)]
*  The Amazon. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2253.0s)]
*  She fell into the Amazon, was gone for 10 days. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2254.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2257.0s)]
*  Apparently, again, unless I was bullshit, they said she found an old boat with gas and she had to pour one of her wounds to kill the maggots. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2258.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2264.0s)]
*  And then she finally did get out and get rescued. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2265.0s)]
*  And look at this. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2267.0s)]
*  17 year old girl miraculously survived, falling 10,000 feet from a plane, then surviving 11 days. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2270.0s)]
*  Isn't 10,000 feet, isn't that two miles? No, what's a mile? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2275.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's about two miles. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2278.0s)]
*  Two miles? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2279.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2280.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. You imagine falling two miles from a plane. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2281.0s)]
*  She survived 11 days alone in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2284.0s)]
*  After the plane, she was struck by lightning. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2287.0s)]
*  Jesus, I didn't read that part. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2291.0s)]
*  The plane was struck by lightning and disintegrated in the air. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2292.0s)]
*  Still strapped to her seat, fell from the sky and survived. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2296.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2299.0s)]
*  What did she hit though? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2300.0s)]
*  Did she hit like a mountain and slide? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2301.0s)]
*  Like how do you the impact? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2303.0s)]
*  I don't know how you survive that impact. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2304.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2306.0s)]
*  She had a broken collarbone, a torn leg knee ligament. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2307.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2310.0s)]
*  After the crash, she spent 11 days alone in the jungle before being rescued. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2311.0s)]
*  She found a lumberjack camp. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2314.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2317.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2318.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2320.0s)]
*  She became a respected scientist specializing in memology and focusing on bats. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2321.0s)]
*  Wouldn't it be funny if she was the lady who released COVID? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2327.0s)]
*  Because her memory is no good anymore after the plane crash. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2331.0s)]
*  Drink this. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2334.0s)]
*  She specialized on bats and she got a job in Wuhan. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2335.0s)]
*  She had no idea. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2338.0s)]
*  She had no idea. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2339.0s)]
*  She's like, be free. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2340.0s)]
*  Bits some guy selling fish on the corner. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2342.0s)]
*  And he went home and fucked somebody. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2344.0s)]
*  But there was another one too. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2347.0s)]
*  There was a flight attendant and again, who I think was trapped. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2349.0s)]
*  The front of the plane fell. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2353.0s)]
*  And I think that she was almost from 30,000 feet. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2355.0s)]
*  And if I remember correctly, it hit a mountain and it was almost like she hit it on the right angle and slid. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2357.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2363.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2364.0s)]
*  Highest fall without a parachute in history. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2365.0s)]
*  Thirty three thousand foot plunge after a plane explosion. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2367.0s)]
*  Seventy two. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2370.0s)]
*  She was the only survivor crashed into the mountains of Czechoslovakia after a suspected bomb detonated. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2371.0s)]
*  She's the only lady who felt her parachute didn't open and she landed on a pile of ants, fire ants. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2376.0s)]
*  And the fire ants kept her alive. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2383.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2384.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2385.0s)]
*  Their body and. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2386.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2387.0s)]
*  Somehow or another, the fire ants, the shock of the sting of fire ants kept her alive. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2388.0s)]
*  Why did it slow her heart down or something or stop it from? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2392.0s)]
*  No. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2394.0s)]
*  What? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2395.0s)]
*  Imagine the odds of falling into a fire ant pile. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2396.0s)]
*  It's usually a bad thing to land in a mound of fire ants at 80 miles an hour. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2398.0s)]
*  But not if you're Joan Murphy. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2402.0s)]
*  Oh, Joan Murray. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2404.0s)]
*  Fourteen thousand feet right into a fucking pile. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2405.0s)]
*  Fifty percent chance of surviving a fall of 48 feet. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2410.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2413.0s)]
*  Which is a four story building. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2414.0s)]
*  Mortality rate rushes all the way up to 90 when you fall 84 feet, a distance of a seven [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2415.0s)]
*  story building. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2420.2s)]
*  So if you're falling from a whopping four, fourteen thousand five hundred feet, just over [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2421.2s)]
*  two and a half miles, safely bet you're almost definitely not going to get out alive. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2424.88s)]
*  One woman did. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2428.74s)]
*  So she fell a backup parachute opened at 700 feet, quickly deflated. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2430.22s)]
*  She continued to plummet towards the ground at 80 miles an hour. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2435.3199999999997s)]
*  She survived. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2438.2999999999997s)]
*  There it goes. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2439.2999999999997s)]
*  She survived thanks to the fact that she landed directly on a mound of fire ants. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2442.98s)]
*  Doctors believe the intense shock being stung over 200 times by the ants released a surge [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2448.06s)]
*  of adrenaline that kept her heart beating. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2452.8399999999997s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2455.3799999999997s)]
*  Finally, does that prove to you how little I know about the human body? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2456.3799999999997s)]
*  My instinct said that, oh, your heart slows down. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2460.02s)]
*  Like I thought like, oh, maybe it would slow your heart down when they bit you and it does [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2462.42s)]
*  just the opposite. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2464.98s)]
*  I thought like maybe maybe it slows your beat down like being frozen. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2466.06s)]
*  I bet that's just a wild guess as to why I kept her alive, because if she was putty, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2469.5s)]
*  you know, there's no way it would have kept her alive. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2473.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2475.74s)]
*  Maybe it stopped her heart from maybe they got to a right after to who knows. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2476.74s)]
*  You watch that guy who fucking lets things bite him in the woods coyote something. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2480.38s)]
*  You know, he's a psychopath. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2485.42s)]
*  His stuff is very entertaining. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2488.42s)]
*  But I think he's the bullet ant. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2489.86s)]
*  The bullet ant or the Japanese hornet was the bullet ant supposed to be the worst. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2491.54s)]
*  The bullet ant supposed to be like 24 hours of intense pain. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2495.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2499.02s)]
*  My friend Steve got bit by one of those on purpose or no. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2500.02s)]
*  No, he was in the Amazon. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2502.66s)]
*  He got bit on his foot and it wasn't as bad as he said. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2504.94s)]
*  He said for hours it was just impossible. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2508.06s)]
*  The pain was just impossible. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2511.02s)]
*  There's that it's slowly dissipated to like kind of manageable. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2512.82s)]
*  Is that what they put in the gloves? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2517.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2519.2599999999998s)]
*  You see that one that the tribe where they do that and their hands are like blackened [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2520.2599999999998s)]
*  by bite. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2522.94s)]
*  Did Steve do that? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2523.94s)]
*  Yeah, he did that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2524.94s)]
*  Yeah, he put the gloves on. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2525.94s)]
*  How long did he last? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2528.74s)]
*  Well once you get bit, it's a 24 hour experience. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2531.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very squeamish. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2534.86s)]
*  Insects. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2537.06s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2538.06s)]
*  I've never gotten over this insect. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2539.06s)]
*  I think I saw a kid. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2540.06s)]
*  There was a brother and sister when I was a kid. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2541.06s)]
*  We were all the same age. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2542.82s)]
*  I think she was a year older than me and him were. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2543.82s)]
*  And they were such a bizarre little friendship because they used to pee their pants and I [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2545.74s)]
*  would ask them to sit on my face with their pants. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2550.18s)]
*  It was a really bizarre. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2551.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2552.8999999999996s)]
*  It was a very lovely childhood and good old Edison. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2553.8999999999996s)]
*  Good old Edison, New Jersey. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2557.02s)]
*  But I saw him get stung by yellow jackets. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2558.74s)]
*  What is that? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2560.74s)]
*  That's the worst thing? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2562.2999999999997s)]
*  Execution or wasp. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2563.2999999999997s)]
*  But Coyote Peterson said it was worse than a bullet ant. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2564.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2568.3799999999997s)]
*  Watching a guy run with bees on his arms and screaming. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2569.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that scarred me for the rest of my life with insects. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2572.8999999999996s)]
*  We used to break up bee's nests. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2575.62s)]
*  And I'll never forget the sight of this kid running with just three yellow jackets on [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2577.2599999999998s)]
*  his arm. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2582.3399999999997s)]
*  And that stuck with me for I guess 49 years now, 50 years. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2583.3399999999997s)]
*  It bothers me. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2587.66s)]
*  Insects have a very weird effect on people. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2590.66s)]
*  To be so skeeved out by something. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2593.14s)]
*  It's like rats. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2595.02s)]
*  Instead of small bunnies don't bother you but rats do. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2596.02s)]
*  Maybe it's in the DNA or something where it's supposed to bother you. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2598.9s)]
*  I think so for sure. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2601.2999999999997s)]
*  I think that's what aphidiophobia and arachnophobia comes from. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2602.34s)]
*  I bet someone in your DNA, someone down the line, was either killed by a spider or really [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2605.5s)]
*  badly hurt by a spider. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2612.98s)]
*  And it's just in your DNA to be absolutely terrified when you see a spider. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2614.7400000000002s)]
*  Phidiophobia is snakes. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2620.1400000000003s)]
*  Some people just have it so bad. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2621.9s)]
*  They see snakes and they just fucking start panicking. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2624.1000000000004s)]
*  They have a panic attack and they just can't handle it. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2626.86s)]
*  Other people, I'm scared of snakes for sure but I can look at them. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2629.54s)]
*  They don't freak me out. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2634.3s)]
*  Can you hold them? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2635.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2636.3s)]
*  I can hold them but obviously I don't want to be around them. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2637.3s)]
*  They're fucking serpents. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2640.14s)]
*  They're literally in the Bible. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2641.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2642.22s)]
*  The Bible does frown. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2643.22s)]
*  The snake and a bed wrap in the fucking Bible. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2644.22s)]
*  It's fucking Satan. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2646.74s)]
*  Satan comes in the form of a serpent. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2647.74s)]
*  I can hold one if I know it's not going to. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2650.86s)]
*  Again, I have a healthy fear. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2652.7799999999997s)]
*  If I know it's a boa constrictor. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2655.94s)]
*  Look at that guy in the granite village who walks around the giant yellow one. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2658.22s)]
*  Which kind of creeps me because if it was to really attack someone, I mean I guess you'd [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2661.8999999999996s)]
*  have to kill it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2666.18s)]
*  There's nothing you can do. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2667.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2668.18s)]
*  It's a large boa constrictor. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2669.18s)]
*  There's not much you can do once it's around your neck. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2670.18s)]
*  You need help. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2673.2599999999998s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2674.94s)]
*  I mean they crush deer and swallow them whole. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2675.94s)]
*  They do. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2679.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2680.06s)]
*  I mean you got to be a real special kind of fucking idiot to have one of those things [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2681.06s)]
*  as a pet. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2684.7s)]
*  Because you just have a monster as a pet as long as you feed that monster. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2685.92s)]
*  But if you leave a baby in a room with a python, you come back a half an hour later, you're [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2689.6s)]
*  going to have a fat python and no baby. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2694.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2696.2000000000003s)]
*  And a quiet night's sleep. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2698.2000000000003s)]
*  That's what they're there for. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2700.04s)]
*  Nature has designed them to kill everything they can. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2701.04s)]
*  I can't. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2704.08s)]
*  Annie Letterman has a lot of snakes. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2705.08s)]
*  She has them as pets and her fiance has them. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2707.12s)]
*  They have a room full of fucking snakes. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2709.32s)]
*  And I don't get it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2712.76s)]
*  I'm like they're not warm. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2713.76s)]
*  They don't have any recognition of you. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2715.68s)]
*  They're interesting I guess. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2717.3999999999996s)]
*  I guess but we have a puppy and I've never owned a dog before. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2718.96s)]
*  And it's nice to have. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2722.64s)]
*  I don't like taking care of anything. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2723.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't have that instinct in me. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2725.7599999999998s)]
*  I just don't like it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2727.2799999999997s)]
*  But this dog kind of, I get why people like having a dog. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2728.72s)]
*  Oh I love dogs. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  My wife only lets me have one. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2734.3599999999997s)]
*  I have one dog. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2736.12s)]
*  But if it was up to me, at one point in time I had five dogs. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2737.6s)]
*  You did? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2741.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2742.58s)]
*  Does he shit in the house? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2743.58s)]
*  No. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2744.58s)]
*  He eats things that are bad. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2746.48s)]
*  He gets diarrhea. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2747.48s)]
*  And he gets diarrhea at least a couple times a year. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2748.48s)]
*  Oh he does? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2749.74s)]
*  Yeah he's a dumbass. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2750.74s)]
*  He's a golden retriever. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2751.74s)]
*  He's not that smart. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2752.74s)]
*  Like he ate a turtle recently. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2753.74s)]
*  And he got horrible diarrhea. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2755.1s)]
*  Shit all over the place. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2757.06s)]
*  He got little pieces of shell stuck in his stomach. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2758.06s)]
*  He had to go to the hospital. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2760.86s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2762.86s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2763.86s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2764.86s)]
*  And he also ate gravel. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2765.86s)]
*  At one point he ate five pounds of gravel. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2766.86s)]
*  Because someone accidentally dropped some chicken food on the gravel and he just assumed [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2768.62s)]
*  that the gravel was food. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2773.42s)]
*  So he ate all the gravel. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2774.42s)]
*  It is crazy how nothing registers halfway through the gravel pile. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2776.02s)]
*  He's just a dumbass. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2778.7000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't taste like chicken. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2779.7000000000003s)]
*  He's a dumbass. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2781.3s)]
*  But I fucking love dogs man. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2782.3s)]
*  I wish I could have. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2784.06s)]
*  I can't go to a pound. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2785.82s)]
*  I can't go. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2787.54s)]
*  She's going to bring them all home? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2788.54s)]
*  I'll bring them all home. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2789.54s)]
*  I'll just like, I'll take them all. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2790.54s)]
*  If I had a giant piece of land I would probably just have all, every dog I could ever get. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2791.54s)]
*  We went to North Shore Animal Rescue and actually Beth Stern helped me. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2797.82s)]
*  I don't know her well. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2802.14s)]
*  I went through Whitney and I met her. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2803.18s)]
*  But she's like, she's huge there and has great connections and helped us get a very nice [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2804.8599999999997s)]
*  little, what is it, a fucking Yorkie. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2809.8599999999997s)]
*  We were so stupid. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2813.18s)]
*  We thought it was a, I thought it was a Cavapoo. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2814.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what the fucking kind of dog it was. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2817.18s)]
*  What's a Cavapoo? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2818.18s)]
*  It's like one of those things where it's like a bread dog. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2819.18s)]
*  It's a cavalier and a poodle I think. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2822.3799999999997s)]
*  But it's hypoallergenic. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2824.7799999999997s)]
*  I can't have dog hair. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2825.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2827.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh look at that. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2828.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean come on. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2829.2599999999998s)]
*  Aww. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2830.2599999999998s)]
*  Is that not phenomenal? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2831.2599999999998s)]
*  Come on. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2832.38s)]
*  Come on. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2833.38s)]
*  Look at the little bow. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2834.38s)]
*  That used to be a wolf. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2835.38s)]
*  That's how fucking creepy people are. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2836.38s)]
*  They turned a wolf into that thing. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2838.5800000000004s)]
*  That little adorable no shedding thing. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2839.98s)]
*  Look at that little face. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2842.46s)]
*  Aww. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2843.94s)]
*  He's very cute. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2844.94s)]
*  But that's what we thought we were getting. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2845.94s)]
*  I didn't know, because a Yorkie looks a lot like that when it's young. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2846.94s)]
*  It was like this big when we took it home. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2850.5800000000004s)]
*  But yeah, I love it. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2852.3s)]
*  My dog photographs like shit though. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2853.6200000000003s)]
*  I never put up pictures of my dog. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2854.98s)]
*  He's a sweetheart but he looks like a fucking wig and a hamper. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2857.0200000000004s)]
*  Just sucks. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2860.26s)]
*  I can't humiliate an ugly fucking dog I have in pictures. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2861.26s)]
*  But in person he's great. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2864.6600000000003s)]
*  But I just never post pictures. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2865.6600000000003s)]
*  Put a filter on him. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2867.6600000000003s)]
*  Nothing's going to help. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2868.6600000000003s)]
*  He's just kind of sitting there. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2869.6600000000003s)]
*  He looks like he's fucking homeless. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2870.6600000000003s)]
*  Like some homeless guy's dog. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2872.6600000000003s)]
*  But I do, I love having him but the shitting in the house is very difficult. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2874.6600000000003s)]
*  Aww. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2878.86s)]
*  I think that's when I first got him. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2879.86s)]
*  But you see he looks a little like a Cavapoo. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2881.86s)]
*  That's adorable dog. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2883.7000000000003s)]
*  Then he was. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2885.7000000000003s)]
*  But as he's gotten older and his hair's gotten longer. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2886.7000000000003s)]
*  He's gotten shitty looking? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2888.7400000000002s)]
*  In person no. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2890.42s)]
*  But he photographs fucking terrible. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2891.42s)]
*  Let me see a picture. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2894.42s)]
*  Let me see a bad picture of your dog. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2895.42s)]
*  Let me see if I have. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2897.42s)]
*  On my Instagram I think I put up a video recently and the screen grab. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2900.42s)]
*  I tried to find the cutest screen grab and I just couldn't. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2903.42s)]
*  So let me see here. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2906.42s)]
*  Maybe it's just you. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2907.42s)]
*  Maybe if I saw him I'd think he's adorable. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2908.42s)]
*  I can guarantee you're going to go like he might be great in person. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2910.42s)]
*  But I would never classify this as a cute dog. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2913.42s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2917.42s)]
*  Alright. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2918.5s)]
*  It's not opening because of. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2919.5s)]
*  But I'll find it. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2921.5s)]
*  Oh there's no cell phone signal in here. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2922.5s)]
*  Is that on purpose? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2924.5s)]
*  No. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2925.5s)]
*  It's just the walls are thick. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2926.5s)]
*  Do you guys have Wi-Fi or no? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2927.5s)]
*  Yeah I can't find it. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2928.5s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2929.5s)]
*  Alright. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2930.5s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2931.5s)]
*  I get it. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2932.5s)]
*  Oh wait. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2933.5s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2934.5s)]
*  That's actually not that bad. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2935.5s)]
*  Aww that's cute. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2936.5s)]
*  But there was one I put up. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2937.5s)]
*  Come on. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2938.5s)]
*  That's actually a very nice one. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2939.5s)]
*  Look at the little blue bow. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2940.5s)]
*  Yeah we've fucking. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2941.5s)]
*  Somebody in the house really mowed him up. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2942.5s)]
*  That wasn't my fucking. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2943.5s)]
*  That's a cute little dog. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2944.5s)]
*  Yeah alright that's a nice picture. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2945.5s)]
*  But. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2946.5s)]
*  Typically he photographs very poorly. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2947.58s)]
*  But he won't stop shitting in the house. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2950.58s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2952.58s)]
*  I can't. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2953.58s)]
*  Will you live in an apartment? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2954.58s)]
*  Live in an apartment. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2955.58s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2956.58s)]
*  We'll put him on the terrace. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2957.58s)]
*  And she'll go out there with him and she walks him. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2958.58s)]
*  I won't walk him. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2960.58s)]
*  It's like it's your dog. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2961.58s)]
*  I don't want to fucking. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2962.58s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2963.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2964.58s)]
*  Like I'm not. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2965.58s)]
*  Again I don't have that instinct. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2966.58s)]
*  I'm happy you have him and you love him. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2967.58s)]
*  But. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2968.58s)]
*  He just won't stop shitting in the house. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2969.58s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2972.58s)]
*  I'm getting to a point where like I'm like this is why I didn't want a fucking dog. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2973.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2976.66s)]
*  I can't handle dog shit in my house. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2977.66s)]
*  It's kind of gross. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2978.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2979.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2980.66s)]
*  It's pretty gross. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2981.66s)]
*  I heard that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2982.66s)]
*  I'm debating do I pay for a trainer. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2983.66s)]
*  Do I pay for someone to come in and just. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2985.66s)]
*  They might not be able to. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2987.66s)]
*  It might be one of them broken little fucking tiny dogs. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2988.66s)]
*  You just can't stop shitting in your house. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2991.66s)]
*  I don't know though. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2993.66s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2994.66s)]
*  I've never had like one of those kind of dogs. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2995.66s)]
*  In New York it helps. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2996.66s)]
*  Like you have a small little. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=2997.66s)]
*  First of all I'm not qualified to own a big one. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3000.66s)]
*  I don't know how like people own like Mastiffs. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3001.66s)]
*  In New York City that's crazy. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3004.66s)]
*  You can't and you can't get insurance for them. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3005.74s)]
*  That's what made me like if you have a Doberman or a Rottweiler or Pitt you can't get insurance [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3008.74s)]
*  homeowners insurance. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3012.74s)]
*  So if somebody gets bit you're fucked. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3013.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3015.74s)]
*  And that's what scared me about those dogs. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3016.74s)]
*  German Shepherd. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3017.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3018.74s)]
*  Especially German Shepherds. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3019.74s)]
*  Well also like those dogs need a lot of exercise. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3020.74s)]
*  They need a lot of activity or they get anxious. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3023.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3025.74s)]
*  They get kind of crazy because they're not supposed to be penned in like that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3026.74s)]
*  They're working dogs. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3029.74s)]
*  They're supposed to be out there running around. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3030.74s)]
*  And if you don't run them if you don't exercise them every day. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3031.74s)]
*  They they get like people do when they don't exercise every day. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3034.8199999999997s)]
*  They get kooky. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3037.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3038.8199999999997s)]
*  I became a little obsessed with the use of those Caucasian Shepherds. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3039.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3042.8199999999997s)]
*  Like I want to pet one of those things or those. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3043.8199999999997s)]
*  That's a big giant fucking thing. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3045.8199999999997s)]
*  It comes up like 200 pounds. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3046.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3048.8199999999997s)]
*  It's fucking hairy. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3049.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3050.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3051.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a werewolf. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3052.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a monster. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3053.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3054.8199999999997s)]
*  But something like that I would love to spend a moment with or go someplace and play with [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3055.8199999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3057.8199999999997s)]
*  But I just you know. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3058.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3059.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean look at that thing. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3060.8199999999997s)]
*  Geez. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3061.8199999999997s)]
*  Slobbering over your fucking sofa. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3062.8199999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3068.9s)]
*  And Russian prisons I think. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3069.9s)]
*  I've seen footage of Russian prisons like where they have them around the perimeter. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3070.9s)]
*  There's a fence in between like freedom and the jail and they kind of keep them in there. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3075.46s)]
*  I wonder what their temperament is like. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3079.06s)]
*  They're aggressive. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3080.98s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3081.98s)]
*  They're very bad with people. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3082.98s)]
*  Strong powerful alert quick dominant calm. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3083.98s)]
*  What? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3086.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3087.78s)]
*  They just somebody just threw adjectives up there. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3088.78s)]
*  How they throw common there. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3089.78s)]
*  Steady strong independent faithful self-assured. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3090.78s)]
*  Calm. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3094.7400000000002s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3095.7400000000002s)]
*  The dough you ever see those dough. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3096.7400000000002s)]
*  What do they call dogo are those. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3098.7400000000002s)]
*  They look like giant pit bulls. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3102.1000000000004s)]
*  They're gorgeous dogs. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3104.2200000000003s)]
*  But again they're hyper aggressive. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3105.34s)]
*  They are aggressive. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3107.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3108.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3109.02s)]
*  Great guard dogs. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3110.02s)]
*  Hyper aggressive. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3111.02s)]
*  They will fuck you up. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3112.02s)]
*  And I think those were the dogs that Ving Rhames had when someone he killed like someone [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3113.1000000000004s)]
*  working at his house. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3120.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3121.7400000000002s)]
*  When he was Ving Rhames or before. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3122.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3124.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was Ving Rhames. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3125.4599999999996s)]
*  I think something happened and someone maybe they were there where they're not supposed [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3128.22s)]
*  to be there or something happened and someone I think it was someone working for him got [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3133.2599999999998s)]
*  killed by his dog. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3138.1s)]
*  Was he is it him or Charles Dutton who did time in jail for murder. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3139.5s)]
*  I think it was murder. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3144.14s)]
*  I don't get sued. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3145.14s)]
*  I think it was Charles Dutton or him that actually before they were actors went to jail. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3146.14s)]
*  I just don't remember who is Ving Rhames or Charles Dutton. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3148.9799999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3150.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3152.3s)]
*  He is one of those guys that had like a really interesting backstabbing. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3153.3s)]
*  Let's go find out with Ving Rhames dog first. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3155.3s)]
*  Then we'll Google did Charles Dutton murder somebody. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3158.3s)]
*  I think it might have been Dutton. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3160.78s)]
*  I think this is the funny thing to Google. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3163.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3166.7000000000003s)]
*  He said that he did not die from in the Ving Rhames case did not die from dog bites. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3167.7000000000003s)]
*  They were waiting for a toxicology. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3172.6200000000003s)]
*  Maybe he had a stroke and then the dog bit him. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3174.82s)]
*  Like sometimes that happens. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3177.38s)]
*  Like if someone has like a seizure, dogs will bite them like dogs don't know what the fuck [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3178.66s)]
*  is going on. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3183.02s)]
*  They freak out and they bite them. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3184.02s)]
*  When animals attack humans or other animals victims usually end up with bites around the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3185.8599999999997s)]
*  head and neck. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3189.02s)]
*  He had none. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3190.02s)]
*  This leads us to believe he went down for some other medical reason. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3191.46s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3194.7s)]
*  So the bites were around his arms and his legs. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3195.7s)]

*  Yeah, I mean Liberace was a fucking weird case, right? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3364.78s)]
*  Because he had to pretend that he was straight forever. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3367.94s)]
*  And it's so obvious. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3372.3s)]

*  No. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3386.7s)]
*  So this is a song that played on television in like the 1950s. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3387.7s)]
*  When the world was innocent and there's a woman who was swooning when Liberace would [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3393.7s)]

*  And so they played... [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3400.18s)]
*  So it's Liberace playing the piano and looking at the girl and winking. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3401.58s)]
*  And they made a twinkle in his eye when it w... [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3405.7799999999997s)]

*  It looks like it's 1967. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3518.94s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3519.94s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3520.94s)]
*  He's playing. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3521.94s)]
*  Groovy. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3522.94s)]
*  Look at these guys with their pants. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3523.94s)]
*  God, look at their pants. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3529.94s)]
*  The piano's got flowers on it. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3546.7000000000003s)]
*  God, people really lost their fucking minds in the 60s, didn't they? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3550.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3554.3s)]
*  This is very drug-inspired. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3555.3s)]
*  Imagine putting those pants on. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3556.3s)]
*  Where's the broad-rachi? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3558.9s)]
*  He does come out. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3560.9s)]
*  I'm not sure where he does... [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3562.9s)]
*  Oh, there he is. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3563.9s)]
*  At least he's dressed for the occasion. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3564.9s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3565.9s)]
*  He's got the thumbs up. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3566.9s)]
*  Look at his fucking fist. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3567.9s)]
*  God, that's so weird. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3569.26s)]
*  Liberace is turning on. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3592.26s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3603.82s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3604.82s)]
*  That's so weird. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3605.82s)]
*  And look, the piano's moving. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3606.82s)]
*  And he had to hold two girls. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3608.82s)]
*  Like yeah, he's here to get some puss. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3610.7000000000003s)]
*  He's turning on. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3613.2200000000003s)]
*  This is like the acid days. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3614.9s)]
*  But it's so crazy that this was actually probably not meant to be shitty and ironic, but it [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3617.2400000000002s)]
*  was meant to be like, hey, he's this cool guy getting with the scene. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3621.42s)]
*  He's getting with the scene, man. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3625.38s)]
*  And he's out there with his piano and all these weird people with flowers on their pants. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3627.78s)]
*  And the dance routine is just not the straightest. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3631.9s)]
*  Look at him go with the vest. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3634.7000000000003s)]
*  The vest is hilarious. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3636.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's like plastic. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3637.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's like this fucking raincoat that they turn into a vest. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3638.3s)]
*  A long, like orange, almost like Shakespeare sleeve type of shirt. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3643.26s)]
*  So strange. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3647.82s)]
*  God, people were so weird. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3650.3s)]
*  But you got to think like in the 1960s, television had only been around for like 20 years. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3652.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's weird. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3658.06s)]
*  This is really weird if you really stop and think about it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3659.86s)]
*  It was so new. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3661.98s)]
*  It's kind of like the Internet, right? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3664.34s)]
*  Like the Internet was the Internet is older today than television was then. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3666.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3672.9s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3673.9s)]
*  It's 30 years old now. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3674.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3676.3s)]
*  Yeah, the Internet basically came around. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3677.3s)]
*  I got on the Internet for the first time in 94. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3679.54s)]
*  I got on America Online. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3682.2200000000003s)]
*  You've got mail. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3684.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3685.14s)]
*  And I remember this is crazy. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3686.14s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3687.14s)]
*  It hooked up to my phone. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3688.14s)]
*  It was a 14-4 connection. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3689.14s)]
*  Yeah, 14K. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3691.14s)]
*  Slow as shit. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3692.14s)]
*  Then I got 56K. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3693.14s)]
*  I thought it was a boss. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3694.14s)]
*  Like look at me, 56K. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3697.14s)]
*  And I remember thinking this is crazy. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3700.5s)]
*  This never existed before. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3702.9s)]
*  So that was 30 years ago, 31 years ago. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3704.52s)]
*  This was just 20 years after TV really. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3707.78s)]
*  When did TV really start happening? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3711.5s)]
*  I want to say in the 50s. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3713.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it was in the 1940s. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3714.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean it was in the 50s. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3716.42s)]
*  What was the first television? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3717.42s)]
*  Hitler broadcasted. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3720.02s)]
*  But that must have been in the 40s. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3721.02s)]
*  There was because in the movie Contact where they show you that Hitler broadcast, which [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3722.6200000000003s)]
*  they say was like one of the first. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3727.02s)]
*  He broadcasted on the radio or on television? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3728.82s)]
*  No, it was the TV. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3730.9s)]
*  I know they used to do a lot of World War II stuff in the movie theaters. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3732.5s)]
*  You'd go to the movie theater and you'd get the news. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3736.46s)]
*  The Allied front and they'd show you the news. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3738.82s)]
*  They'd show you like propaganda footage of the news. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3741.26s)]
*  Our troops are out there fighting for your freedom. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3743.94s)]
*  Yes, and the Japanese. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3747.2200000000003s)]
*  They'd show you. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3749.2200000000003s)]
*  The brave American troops smiling. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3751.46s)]
*  And then they'd have those propaganda movies. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3753.82s)]
*  1953, 50% of American households had a TV set. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3756.26s)]
*  By the end of 1960, almost nine out of ten did. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3760.2200000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3763.7400000000002s)]
*  What was the first television? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3764.74s)]
*  When did it first? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3765.9799999999996s)]
*  Oh, they had them. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3766.9799999999996s)]
*  They started in the 20s. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3767.9799999999996s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3768.9799999999996s)]
*  They were expensive as shit and probably very big and there wasn't anything to watch. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3769.9799999999996s)]
*  So why would you have one? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3772.06s)]
*  And then there was. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3773.8999999999996s)]
*  When was the first broadcast? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3774.8999999999996s)]
*  The first television broadcast? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3775.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, up until the 50s it was really just like public information it says. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3777.9799999999996s)]
*  Oh, so just like the news? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3782.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean, there wasn't a lot of shows being made. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3784.3799999999997s)]
*  What was the first television show? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3787.3399999999997s)]
*  Before Cavalcade. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3790.9399999999996s)]
*  Van Gleeson did Cavalcade. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3792.14s)]
*  I think it was called Cavalcade. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3793.14s)]
*  When the Honeymooners debuted, he would do Reginald Van Gleeson. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3795.14s)]
*  But that's definitely not the first one. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3797.98s)]
*  I Love Lucy was probably the same time or before that. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3799.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3802.1s)]
*  And what year was that? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3803.1s)]
*  That had to be the 50s, right? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3804.1s)]
*  53 maybe? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3805.1s)]
*  55? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3806.1s)]
*  Or it might have been later. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3807.1s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3808.1s)]
*  So probably the television really became, when did it become a thing where people would watch [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3809.1s)]
*  the news? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3812.98s)]
*  Probably like late 40s maybe? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3815.58s)]
*  Yeah, because 63, again the Cronkite broadcast. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3817.42s)]
*  So by then it was in full effect. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3820.3799999999997s)]
*  So you got to think that 63 with Liberace or the 55 one with Liberace, that's so new. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3822.22s)]
*  That's crazy new. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3831.1s)]
*  And then 12 years later, when he's fucking dancing with the flowered pants on. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3832.1s)]
*  There's a Wikipedia version. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3836.46s)]
*  First national color broadcast, the 1954 Tournament of the Rose Parade, the US Kurd, January 1st, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3839.14s)]
*  1954. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3845.74s)]
*  So the 1936 Summer Olympics. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3846.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, they have the Summer Olympics they broadcast. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3849.02s)]
*  World Series it says was the first catalyst, like big buying. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3851.74s)]
*  Wow, you must have been a boss if you had a fucking television in 1936. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3856.14s)]
*  And then first variety show was Milton Berle's show. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3860.8599999999997s)]
*  So he became known as Mr. Television. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3863.54s)]
*  What year was that? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3865.9799999999996s)]
*  47? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3866.9799999999996s)]

*  Yeah, and you're not supposed to film a lot of this stuff. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3995.58s)]
*  These guys take really, really like clandestine footage. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=3997.66s)]
*  You're allowed to film in certain areas, but I think your phone you have to leave at the [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4001.34s)]

*  I remember watching some of this. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4012.66s)]
*  It's like a random Coke or something somewhere or a Red Bull, I think. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4013.94s)]
*  That's so fucking risky. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4017.62s)]

*  And he said that they set up a fake restaurant for him. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4044.42s)]
*  They pretended that they had restaurants and so they had a fake restaurant. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4047.5s)]
*  He went there, there's like only him there and people are serving them. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4050.9s)]
*  Bizarre. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4053.94s)]
*  It was really weird. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4054.94s)]
*  I guess when you're seen as a god and everybody just cosigns it, you don't know how bad of [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4056.1s)]

*  So they have no idea. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4066.98s)]
*  Kim Jong-un has no idea that people look at him and go like, that's not real. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4067.98s)]

*  They're not connected to the rest of the world. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4078.06s)]
*  No, they would, I guess people will like sneak in thumb drives and stuff like that. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4080.38s)]
*  I know South Korean TV. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4086.38s)]

*  But you know, you know, Sad Maseni, he's from Afghanistan and he ran, I think it was called [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4090.06s)]
*  the Moby Group in Afghanistan, but they would go next to the Iranian border and pipe in [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4095.62s)]
*  American TV shows and they would illegally send them over the border to try to get people [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4102.42s)]
*  like a little bit westernized or to at least see things a little bit differently. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4107.860000000001s)]
*  But it's an illegal feed. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4111.66s)]
*  You're just shooting it over somehow and you know, hoping they don't kill you. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4112.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4125.1s)]
*  But no one's surprised. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4126.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4127.1s)]
*  Like I bet the guys who got killed were surprised. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4128.1s)]
*  They were supposed to meet with Trump to have a peace negotiation. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4130.58s)]
*  Wasn't the time up? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4133.98s)]
*  No. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4136.42s)]
*  Didn't the time, I thought the time lapsed. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4137.42s)]
*  No. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4138.42s)]
*  Did the Israelis jump the gun on the time? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4139.42s)]
*  Well, the speculation according to Grok, I sent Jamie this. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4140.98s)]
*  Somebody said, did, were they killed, like asked Grok, were they killed because they [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4145.94s)]
*  were negotiating for peace? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4153.22s)]
*  You know, that the Israelis wanted, they didn't want a negotiation. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4155.74s)]
*  Oh, because they wanted to get those nuclear sites out of there. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4159.82s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't trust the Iranians and they wanted to make sure that these guys were gone. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4163.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4168.0599999999995s)]
*  They essentially killed everybody that he was negotiating with. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4169.0599999999995s)]
*  So this guy's response above it, it says, what evidence might there be to support this [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4172.1s)]
*  position? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4176.0599999999995s)]
*  And the position was go above that. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4177.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4179.22s)]
*  Israel did not attack Iran because Iran was about to attack Israel. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4180.46s)]
*  Israel attacked Iran because there was about to be peace. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4183.58s)]
*  And then this guy asked Grok, what evidence might there be to support this position? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4186.22s)]
*  And then Grok says, evidence suggesting Israel's June 13th, 2025 attack in Iran aimed to disrupt [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4190.3s)]
*  US-Iran peace talks includes its timing coinciding with the sixth round of nuclear negotiations [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4196.900000000001s)]
*  scheduled around June 12th through 14th, 2025. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4202.58s)]
*  International reactions like the UN and the Oman condemning the strikes as undermining [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4206.700000000001s)]
*  diplomacy support this view. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4211.46s)]
*  However, Israel justified the attack as a preemptive strike against Iran's nuclear program, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4214.14s)]
*  citing its noncompliance with the IAEA. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4219.42s)]
*  No direct evidence proves intent to stop peace and the focus on nuclear sites suggests security [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4222.9400000000005s)]
*  concerns drove the action. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4228.34s)]
*  The issue remains debated with perspectives varying by geopolitical stance. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4230.660000000001s)]
*  Now, ask Grok. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4234.9400000000005s)]
*  Grok is kind of Twitter's AI. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4237.22s)]
*  How influenced is it by, like a chat GPT I've gone to and I was kind of curious because [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4240.06s)]
*  my wife's obsessed with it so I was like, I think this is probably still ideologically [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4245.620000000001s)]
*  influenced. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4248.700000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4249.700000000001s)]
*  So other people have done this but I put in, write five jokes about Jesus and it did five [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4250.700000000001s)]
*  Jesus jokes and then I put in write five jokes about Mohammed and it came back with, well [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4255.360000000001s)]
*  we like to keep things respectful and blah blah and I did the same thing with write five [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4260.22s)]
*  jokes about white people and then write five jokes about black people and it did the same [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4264.780000000001s)]
*  thing. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4268.42s)]
*  But the black people jokes wouldn't write. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4270.14s)]
*  So I was like, oh, okay, this is still somehow tied in. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4271.9s)]
*  There's guardrails and it's ideologically slanted. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4276.7s)]
*  It may not always be that way. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4280.06s)]
*  So I'm wondering if Grok is the same way. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4281.18s)]
*  Like, is any answer it gives you almost like coming from either somebody at PBS or somebody [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4283.26s)]
*  from some place else? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4289.08s)]
*  Grok is probably the best of them for that but the worst was Gemini. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4290.66s)]
*  Remember when they asked Gemini to make photographs of Nazi soldiers and they had a diverse group [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4294.58s)]
*  of Nazi soldiers including Asian women, Native American women, black people. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4299.26s)]
*  Keep it fair folks, keep it fair. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4305.54s)]
*  They just got locked up in this woke ideology thing to the point where the images they created [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4307.58s)]
*  of Nazis were woke. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4312.66s)]
*  I don't know what happened where people become so afraid of like, I know truth can be unpleasant [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4314.22s)]
*  sometimes but like where it goes to that level, like we will write jokes about Jesus but not [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4318.860000000001s)]
*  about Mohammed. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4324.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4325.54s)]
*  Like who's programming that and thinks that's a good thing? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4326.54s)]
*  Well they're scared. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4329.1s)]
*  They are. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4330.1s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4331.1s)]
*  I'd almost respect them if they said they were scared. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4332.1s)]
*  Like if they could look, we all understand what goes on. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4334.3s)]
*  We don't want somebody running in with a bomb belt. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4337.22s)]
*  Like you know, there's violent retribution. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4338.700000000001s)]
*  I would respect that but they won't say that. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4341.3s)]
*  No. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4343.14s)]
*  They act like you're crazy for questioning. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4344.14s)]
*  Why are you? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4345.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4346.14s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4347.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4348.14s)]
*  We're in a weird stage. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4350.18s)]
*  We're in a weird stage. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4351.18s)]
*  We have all the information but it's still, it's still got guardrails on it. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4352.22s)]
*  I feel better about myself though the older I get, the more like, yeah, I years ago said [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4356.42s)]
*  it and knew it was getting worse and worse and like I was never stupid enough to think [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4362.820000000001s)]
*  it didn't exist so I kind of like, yeah, well if nothing else it validates what I kind of [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4366.820000000001s)]
*  thought. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4370.5s)]
*  You know, I mean like I feel like I wasn't a fucking idiot. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4371.5s)]
*  I'm not taken off guard by it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4374.14s)]
*  You knew it was coming. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4375.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, not necessarily to this level but you know, when you saw this happening and then [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4376.9800000000005s)]
*  that happening and then little weird things like Donald Sterling, that one always bothered [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4382.1s)]
*  me. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4386.06s)]
*  His private communications being used against him and it's like, does anybody? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4387.54s)]
*  Which one was that? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4391.700000000001s)]
*  He was the owner of the Golden State Warriors? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4392.700000000001s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4394.5s)]
*  Oh, this was the guy that had the girlfriend. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4395.5s)]
*  Vista Viano. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4396.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4397.5s)]
*  The Clippers. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4398.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4399.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry, the Clippers, yes. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4400.5s)]
*  He was the guy that had the girlfriend who was his little side piece. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4401.5s)]
*  Vista Viano, yeah. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4403.860000000001s)]
*  And the girls, the girlfriend recorded him saying a bunch of things about black people. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4404.860000000001s)]
*  And it was almost like he was like, blah, blah. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4409.42s)]
*  It wasn't like, I don't think he was a hateful guy but he was just like an old guy. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4412.1s)]
*  Like you know what I mean, don't hang out with blacks. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4415.62s)]
*  Well he was saying don't do it publicly, right? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4417.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4419.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it embarrasses me, something like that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4420.9800000000005s)]
*  His friends are probably calling him. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4423.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4424.34s)]
*  But he was, you know, he's talking to his side piece and she's recording him. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4425.34s)]
*  The whole thing was gross. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4428.06s)]
*  The invasion of, even if he's a piece of shit, I don't care about him. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4429.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4432.66s)]
*  But it's the idea that people are comfortable, like nobody sticks up for privacy. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4433.66s)]
*  Everyone complains about it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4437.9s)]
*  We went to GovRuby and it's like, hey motherfuckers, where were you when this guy or stupid Hunter [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4439.259999999999s)]
*  Biden's big dick is all over the internet? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4443.5s)]
*  Where were you complaining about it? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4445.46s)]
*  You just judged him on it. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4447.259999999999s)]
*  So I wish people would stop doing that. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4448.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4451.38s)]
*  The Hunter Biden stuff, the fun stuff was like him smoking crack and hookers and foot [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4452.38s)]
*  jobs. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4457.099999999999s)]
*  This is just fun. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4458.099999999999s)]
*  Did he get foot jobs? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4459.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he did a lot of stuff. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4460.099999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of wild stuff going on in there. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4461.099999999999s)]
*  He's a wild boy. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4462.5s)]
*  But I guess, you know, you're smoking crack. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4463.5s)]
*  Sure. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4465.219999999999s)]
*  You know. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4466.219999999999s)]
*  You got no guard rooms. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4467.26s)]
*  You're off the fucking reservation. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4468.26s)]
*  He's a naughty boy. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4469.820000000001s)]
*  But then the other stuff that was in there was really interesting. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4471.1s)]
*  The emails, about 10% to the big guy and all that stuff. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4474.14s)]
*  And this brutal, rampant, obvious corruption that they just looked the other way because [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4477.9800000000005s)]
*  it's a Democrat. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4483.900000000001s)]
*  And it's just really strange. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4484.900000000001s)]
*  If Trump Jr. did anything that Hunter did, they would kill him. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4487.18s)]
*  Like they would, it would be at the front page. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4492.14s)]
*  It's all they would talk about. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4494.18s)]
*  They certainly wouldn't have hit it from Twitter. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4495.46s)]
*  They wouldn't have. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4497.46s)]
*  Which was really crazy. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4498.46s)]
*  It was a New York Post story. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4499.46s)]
*  And then FBI got involved. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4501.42s)]
*  And the Twitter files, like, you know, when Schellenberger and Taibbi and all those guys [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4504.18s)]
*  went over the Twitter files. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4508.9s)]
*  It's so damning. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4511.62s)]
*  It's so crazy that that's not so illegal that there's like massive trials on television [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4513.62s)]
*  and people are prosecuted for it. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4520.18s)]
*  I guess with private companies or even though the media operates. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4522.26s)]
*  But it's the government. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4526.18s)]
*  The government is what I'm concerned with because it's absolutely election interference. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4527.46s)]
*  100%. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4531.22s)]
*  100%. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4532.22s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that were on the fence. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4533.22s)]
*  You know, they didn't know whether they're going to vote for Trump or whether they're [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4535.860000000001s)]
*  going to vote for Biden. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4539.5s)]
*  They didn't know what they're going to do. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4540.820000000001s)]
*  And then they saw that and they were like, fuck this. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4542.580000000001s)]
*  And guys like Jack from Twitter have come out and said like, yeah, we shouldn't have [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4545.34s)]
*  censored that story. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4551.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4552.62s)]
*  But it's like too late now. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4553.62s)]
*  It's like you did it. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4554.62s)]
*  People were telling you when you did it. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4555.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4556.62s)]
*  You shouldn't do it. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4557.62s)]
*  Zuckerberg talked about it on this podcast. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4558.62s)]
*  He talked about the FBI getting involved on the podcast, censoring COVID information, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4559.62s)]
*  censoring the laptop information, this weird feeling that he got from the government all [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4564.66s)]
*  of a sudden telling them what they and some of the stuff that they were telling them they [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4569.740000000001s)]
*  had to take down was actually true, factual information. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4573.22s)]
*  And they were like, oh, boy. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4577.3s)]
*  And so they diminished its reach and they did a lot of weird shit. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4578.94s)]
*  And the penalty for not taking it down would have been like, were they threatening them [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4582.7s)]
*  with like section 230 is a big one that all the big companies are scared of. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4586.259999999999s)]
*  Like if they change that because they said that I think the Internet freedom comes from [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4590.58s)]
*  section 230 where a company can't be held legally liable for what's posted on their [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4594.86s)]
*  site, which is how like you can post anything about people and the sites themselves can't [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4600.179999999999s)]
*  get sued because they're like, yeah, we're just like a phone company. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4604.66s)]
*  It's a public square. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4606.9s)]
*  Public square. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4607.9s)]
*  Although it's not anymore. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4608.9s)]
*  It's much more ideologically based and it's much more of a publisher, in my opinion, than [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4610.0599999999995s)]
*  a public square. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4613.86s)]
*  But maybe they threaten you with that. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4615.139999999999s)]
*  Or maybe that's where they start to go. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4616.7s)]
*  Like we'll see to it that 230. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4618.179999999999s)]
*  I'm guessing. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4619.82s)]
*  But what else could they threaten them with? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4620.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4622.7s)]
*  I mean, just the fear of being on the wrong side of the government. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4624.74s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing, because then they could go after you. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4628.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, for someone like Zuckerberg, who had already sat in front of those congressional [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4631.94s)]
*  hearings and they had already asked him about a bunch of different things that the company [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4636.82s)]
*  had done. And you remember those weird those weird hearings that he had to sit through [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4642.0599999999995s)]
*  where he sip water. Very strange. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4648.219999999999s)]
*  People said he's a fucking robot. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4649.98s)]
*  He's probably so nervous. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4652.46s)]
*  Of course. Yes, Senator. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4654.139999999999s)]
*  No, Senator. Thank you for asking, Senator. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4655.7s)]
*  Like all those weird moments like you got to be terrified of those people because they [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4658.0199999999995s)]
*  could change laws or they could just decide to prosecute you for things. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4661.98s)]
*  I mean, look what's happening to the guy, Durav from Telegram. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4665.38s)]
*  I don't know that story. You don't know the story. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4669.42s)]
*  No, he is essentially he's under house arrest in France. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4670.74s)]
*  He has not been tried with anything. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4677.78s)]
*  He has not been charged with anything. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4679.86s)]
*  But what they're saying is essentially they want to backdoor to Telegram. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4681.74s)]
*  Telegram is an encrypted app. Right. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4686.42s)]
*  And a lot of people use it for illegal things, just like a lot of people use Twitter for [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4688.38s)]
*  sure. A lot of people use DMS for illegal things. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4692.9s)]
*  I'm sure these signal for illegal things and WhatsApp for illegal things. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4696.42s)]
*  And they wanted to Telegram was especially popular amongst criminals. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4700.54s)]
*  And they wanted to be able to get in there. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4705.82s)]
*  But then the question is, like, well, what do you determine as a criminal? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4707.86s)]
*  Is it a political dissident? Like, is it you know, what does it mean? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4710.379999999999s)]
*  Are you looking for underage people being photographed? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4714.139999999999s)]
*  Or are you looking at just people who like they can always expand what they consider [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4718.54s)]
*  to be illegal? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4722.66s)]
*  I mean, they took back page down so they can get certain company. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4724.74s)]
*  Like, if you don't do what they want you to do, there is a way for them to get you by [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4728.74s)]
*  saying you're too complicit in certain activities. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4731.78s)]
*  So you want to Silk Road. That's that's what happened with that. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4734.78s)]
*  Ross Albrecht. Yeah. And now he's luckily Trump freed him. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4737.139999999999s)]
*  Did he did he pardon him? Yes. Oh, he did. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4741.5s)]
*  Pardon him. Yeah. Yeah. We tried to get him on, but he's just not ready to talk, which is [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4743.46s)]
*  totally understandable. Yeah. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4747.0199999999995s)]
*  If you ever do, if you want to talk, I'd be happy to hear your story. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4748.58s)]
*  Well, because you're probably afraid that they're going to come with something else. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4751.66s)]
*  Like, it's almost like you don't want to put it in their face. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4754.42s)]
*  You know, now I'm out. Fuck those people. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4756.9800000000005s)]
*  What they did to me was wrong. Oh, new charges. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4758.74s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. That's why whenever somebody's exonerated after 30 years of being in [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4761.1s)]
*  jail, they're like, I'm not even angry. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4764.3s)]
*  I just want because you're afraid you can say the wrong thing. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4765.9800000000005s)]
*  And then we go, all right, we're going to come back. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4767.74s)]
*  Well, that was the really scary thing about the Trump stuff. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4769.7s)]
*  Like when they were trying to get him for 34 felony counts, none of those were a [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4772.54s)]
*  felony. All of them were past the statute of limitations. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4777.38s)]
*  It was just bookkeeping errors or bookkeeping. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4780.06s)]
*  You know, they wrote down the wrong things and they tried to hide the fact that he [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4783.900000000001s)]
*  was making hush money payments. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4788.5s)]
*  But the reality of that legal system being used against you, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4790.5s)]
*  lawfare being, you know, the target you like the real estate one, when they they [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4796.02s)]
*  tried to say that he overvalued Mar-a-Lago and it was really only worth 18 million. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4801.06s)]
*  And so they charged him like hundreds of millions of dollars, which is fucking [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4806.06s)]
*  insane because Mar-a-Lago is an enormous piece of property that is on the most [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4810.1s)]
*  expensive place in the country. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4817.3s)]
*  Like that area he's got, I think he's got, is it more than 20 acres there? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4819.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a huge piece of property there. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4824.580000000001s)]
*  And the next door neighbor had a place that was like five acres and it sold for 50 [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4826.9400000000005s)]
*  million dollars. Just the property. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4831.26s)]
*  Yeah. So they fucked them. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4833.1s)]
*  They fucked them. And it's obvious that they were fucking them. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4834.74s)]
*  They were they were doing it because they were trying to make him a felon when he [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4838.099999999999s)]
*  was running for president. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4841.5s)]
*  Yeah. Letitia James went after him really badly in New York. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4842.46s)]
*  And turns out she had done a little bank, a little bank stuff going on. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4845.34s)]
*  Yeah. He did some mortgage questions. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4848.74s)]
*  Yeah. Some naughty things. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4851.099999999999s)]
*  But he's a whether people like him or not. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4854.139999999999s)]
*  I don't always agree with him at all, but he's an amazing person. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4855.98s)]
*  Like to have withstood that the pressure of that. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4859.62s)]
*  Again, just as a to to continue with with the pressure that they were putting on [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4863.259999999999s)]
*  him and the way they were coming after him and to still run again. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4868.82s)]
*  I mean, it's the fucking craziest thing you're ever going to see in your life. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4871.5s)]
*  And they shot him and they shot him and they were the guy was going to do it again. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4873.82s)]
*  I would try to add another kind of fucking. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4878.419999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that guy with the hole in the in the fence where his golf course was [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4880.78s)]
*  kooky. It's kooky. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4885.419999999999s)]
*  But it's like and somebody pointed out to me, it's like, I mean, I'm surprised he [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4887.139999999999s)]
*  doesn't expect this. It's like he went after them. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4890.259999999999s)]
*  Like he he went after the CIA and the FBI. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4892.62s)]
*  And so they're going to make it their life's work to come after you. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4894.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, it's also crazy when it gets real transparent like that, though. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4898.54s)]
*  You know, but when someone like Zuckerberg or any of these other people that run a [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4902.9s)]
*  foul of the federal government or the intelligence agencies, when they see stuff [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4906.7s)]
*  like that, I understand why they comply. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4910.1s)]
*  Yeah, they're probably fucking terrified. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4912.58s)]
*  It is a little very scary when when you're on there like you never want them to dig [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4914.54s)]
*  in and be focused on on you. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4919.22s)]
*  Eye of Sauron. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4921.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, we're coming for you. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4922.860000000001s)]
*  And because, again, they don't pay they don't pay legal fees. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4924.46s)]
*  They can do it all day. They can do it through the next administration. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4926.5s)]
*  Because Letitia J. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4930.74s)]
*  She went after what I didn't like about her was a lot. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4931.54s)]
*  But I didn't like the fact that they went after Cuomo for his book money. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4935.38s)]
*  Like they went after Andrew Cuomo for his book money. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4939.46s)]
*  I think they wanted to get back. Yeah. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4942.22s)]
*  For what reason? I don't know what her reasoning was. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4944.1s)]
*  I mean, obviously, she just wanted to stick it to him and fuck him. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4946.62s)]
*  But I think it was that he it was seen as some form of a government payment or [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4949.98s)]
*  I don't remember the technicality, but I remember being very annoyed [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4955.099999999999s)]
*  that she was trying to go after I think was a five million dollar advance. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4958.38s)]
*  Lawfare is fucking terrifying. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4961.0199999999995s)]
*  It's terrifying when they do that to people, when everybody could see it. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4962.66s)]
*  But yes, that's the real problem with the Trump one. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4965.62s)]
*  And my problem wasn't my real problem was like, don't these people understand? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4968.26s)]
*  Doesn't the general public with their lack of outrage because, you know, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4974.22s)]
*  he's on the right and they're on the left. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4978.22s)]
*  Don't those people understand that now they've set a precedent and then they [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4980.54s)]
*  could use that on you now? Yeah. Or anybody else? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4984.02s)]
*  And if a Republican president gets in like there's in now. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4986.740000000001s)]
*  It could be easily used on his opponents because they've set a precedent. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4991.02s)]
*  That's scary shit, man. It's really scary. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4995.62s)]
*  And nobody's again, it's like whether it's with Donald Sterling and privacy, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=4998.06s)]
*  nobody sticks up for each other on principle. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5001.62s)]
*  And the conservatives don't do it like the for that. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5004.34s)]
*  They've got like the free speech thing in their corner now much more than [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5006.58s)]
*  progressives do. But it's like, I don't hear them sticking up for progressives [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5009.58s)]
*  who are annoying. It's like you have to stick up for people you don't like. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5013.1s)]
*  Yes. And that you think are shit. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5017.06s)]
*  It's not just you're not a big free speech warrior if you only fucking raise [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5019.0199999999995s)]
*  a flag for people who agree with you. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5023.0199999999995s)]
*  And I find them falling into that trap. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5024.74s)]
*  And it's like, don't fall into that fucking trap. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5026.78s)]
*  Stick up for progressives who suck and who are saying stupid things, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5029.46s)]
*  defend their right to say it without getting in trouble. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5032.7s)]
*  Don't look at them getting fired as a good case of your own medicine. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5035.099999999999s)]
*  Like we get it. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5038.78s)]
*  But then that's how they justify you getting fired. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5039.98s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5041.9s)]
*  So it drives me crazy that people don't defend other people's right to privacy [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5042.74s)]
*  or right to say what they want. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5046.66s)]
*  And everyone in the country thinks they're a free speech absolutist, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5048.379999999999s)]
*  but they're not. They're not. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5051.7s)]
*  Yeah. Elon's as close as I've seen. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5052.94s)]
*  Like he doesn't seem to be shutting anybody up, like regardless of what they say [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5055.139999999999s)]
*  on his platform. People are talking shit about him every day. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5058.74s)]
*  I saw one person was was alluding to [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5061.66s)]
*  bad things happening to him, you know, like wanting that. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5065.54s)]
*  Or I wouldn't say encouraging it, but close to encouraging it. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5068.94s)]
*  And I'm like, if he's leaving that up, nobody has any room to complain. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5071.86s)]
*  Yeah. Like if he leaves up horrible shit about himself and. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5074.98s)]
*  And but he also left up the Kanye song, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5077.82s)]
*  the Hitler song. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5080.9s)]
*  Oh, yes. Is that where he blew his cousin or is that a different one? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5081.94s)]
*  That's a different one. Oh, wow. All the hits. Yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5084.54s)]
*  That means the song is Heil Hitler. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5088.139999999999s)]
*  He's singing Heil Hitler like in a catchy song. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5091.42s)]
*  It's like, wow, I, I. This is crazy. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5094.38s)]
*  It is crazy. And I don't know Kanye West at all. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5096.98s)]
*  I've never particularly loved him. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5099.219999999999s)]
*  I find a lot of it is just like he'll just say the most troll. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5101.219999999999s)]
*  Like something tells me he's going to come back down to earth one day and go, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5105.139999999999s)]
*  look, I was off my medication. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5107.82s)]
*  I didn't mean any of that shit that I said. I feel bad about it. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5109.82s)]
*  I think he's going to stay off his medication. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5113.0599999999995s)]
*  I think when he puts on his medication, he can't be creative. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5115.099999999999s)]
*  I think part of his thing, whatever his the way his mind works. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5117.86s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I mean, it's this mania. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5123.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, I understand that in a way because I've always like, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5126.74s)]
*  you know, you go through your pressure, whatever. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5131.139999999999s)]
*  I'm like, do I want to go on something? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5132.46s)]
*  But I've always been scared that it would fuck up my probably creativity. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5133.7s)]
*  Yeah, it probably will. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5137.94s)]
*  I mean, I think I mean, I don't know what's going on in Kanye's mind [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5139.34s)]
*  or anybody's mind other than my own. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5143.66s)]
*  But I would imagine that, you mean, a guy like Kanye who's so prolific. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5145.46s)]
*  I mean, he's put out so many albums and he's a complete workaholic [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5149.54s)]
*  and just has like when you talk to him, like Adam on the podcast. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5154.06s)]
*  And it's almost like when you're talking, he's upset. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5158.14s)]
*  Like he doesn't want he wants to talk. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5161.1s)]
*  He wants just constantly talk. Yeah. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5163.02s)]
*  Like his brain's like a tornado, just wow. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5164.78s)]
*  It's all just going all these different thoughts. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5167.34s)]
*  And that's also why he can make so many great songs. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5169.02s)]
*  It's like it's all just pouring out of him. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5172.3s)]
*  But, you know, it also gets out of hand. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5174.7s)]
*  And then, you know, you wind up in the situation where he's in now. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5177.62s)]
*  It also he's the only person he went into. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5181.0199999999995s)]
*  Him and Trump were he was in Trump's office one time. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5183.26s)]
*  And he's the only person I've ever seen Trump just kind of sit there and go, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5185.94s)]
*  all right, well, whenever he's finished, I'll jump in. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5188.9s)]
*  I've never seen anyone do that to Trump. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5191.179999999999s)]
*  Well, Trump was happy that any celebrity was on his side, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5192.94s)]
*  because at that point, he was Hitler. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5196.099999999999s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people that were calling him Hitler. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5197.98s)]
*  And to have a guy like Kanye West, who is such a contrarian, also [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5199.82s)]
*  there was the thing because Obama said he was a jackass. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5204.86s)]
*  Yes. And so he's like, oh, really? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5207.9s)]
*  Well, fuck you. That's right. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5209.7s)]
*  It was about the Taylor Swift thing. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5211.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5213.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's a jackass. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5215.179999999999s)]
*  Well, he wasn't even that harsh of an incident. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5216.7s)]
*  He said it privately. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5218.54s)]
*  And I think somebody heard it or it was picked up on a mic. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5219.38s)]
*  I don't think he said it to be public. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5222.0199999999995s)]
*  I thought I thought he said it privately. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5223.78s)]
*  And then somebody got the audio or whatever. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5226.82s)]
*  It was really the Taylor Swift thing. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5228.86s)]
*  I believe it was. Yeah. Oh, here it is. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5230.42s)]
*  Here. Yeah, it wasn't like perfectly nice person. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5233.42s)]
*  She's getting her award. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5238.42s)]
*  What's he doing? Why would he do that? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5239.82s)]
*  He's a jackass. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5241.38s)]
*  No, no, this all this stuff. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5244.58s)]
*  Cut this out. Look, I'm assuming all this stuff. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5248.26s)]
*  Where's the pool? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5250.9s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5253.34s)]
*  Cut the presence of slack. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5255.82s)]
*  See, it wasn't even that. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5257.74s)]
*  And he wanted that cut out. Yeah, that was private talk. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5258.66s)]
*  Yeah. And it wasn't even said with real malice, real rancor. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5261.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was just like he's a jackal. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5265.38s)]
*  You know, laugh. Yeah. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5267.06s)]
*  I guess that would annoy me if I was him. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5268.3s)]
*  I mean, if I was him. Yeah. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5269.780000000001s)]
*  If it was me, I'd be like, yeah, he's right. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5271.38s)]
*  I guess so. Yeah. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5273.46s)]
*  I feel like I was being a jackass. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5274.62s)]

*  No, I guess. Does it bother you? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5289.7s)]
*  Has it ever bothered you? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5291.74s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5292.94s)]
*  Why would it bother you? What are you going to do? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5294.54s)]
*  You can change their mind. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5295.86s)]
*  You know, you can't. And a lot of it is disingenuous. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5297.66s)]
*  A lot of it, they don't know you. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5300.139999999999s)]
*  They don't listen to what you say. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5301.5s)]
*  You know, if they far right, whenever they say far right, far right podcast. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5303.139999999999s)]
*  OK. Yeah. I've had comics say that. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5307.3s)]
*  Like they just don't know. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5309.86s)]
*  And I'm like, you don't really you really never paid attention. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5310.98s)]
*  I mean, he's stuck up for gay marriage. He loves Bernie. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5314.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, it's crazy when you hear. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5316.139999999999s)]
*  I was very jealous that you and I talked to Hinchcliffe about this [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5318.9s)]
*  when you interviewed Magnus. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5321.94s)]
*  Magnus Carlson. Yeah. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5324.06s)]
*  There's very few people I really want to meet that I haven't met. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5325.3s)]
*  But he's somebody just seemed like bang the chessboard. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5328.66s)]
*  That was a big news in chess. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5330.86s)]
*  Yeah, because he lost. He made a fumble. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5332.42s)]
*  He fucked up. He was ahead of the game. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5334.34s)]
*  He was winning. Yeah. Made a blunder. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5336.5s)]
*  And it was. And but here's the genius of the people. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5338.18s)]
*  Like they actually call it like a sport. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5341.18s)]
*  And the people watching it knew he fucked up, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5344.3s)]
*  which means they're all geniuses. Right. Right. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5347.139999999999s)]
*  Magnus blundered. Magnus blundered. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5348.98s)]
*  They couldn't believe he had made that. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5351.9s)]
*  It was I think it was a rook move. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5353.5s)]
*  But he's somebody I would like to I don't know what I talked to him about. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5354.9s)]
*  He's fascinating. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5358.379999999999s)]
*  Fascinating. Any high achiever or really high level person like that [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5359.66s)]
*  world champion and something that's insanely difficult. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5364.339999999999s)]
*  They're fascinating people. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5367.379999999999s)]
*  I feel that way about MMA fighters. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5368.82s)]
*  Yeah. Any kind of pro athlete, anybody who's like Aaron Rogers, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5371.219999999999s)]
*  like any any high level performer, those are very, very unusual people. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5374.66s)]
*  Do you give them slack like and I mean, just in your brain as a person, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5379.38s)]
*  like if they're a little whatever, they're rude, they're rude. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5383.46s)]
*  But if somebody is a little quirky or weird, if you're that good at something, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5386.62s)]
*  that might just be the price you pay. Oh, for sure. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5390.58s)]
*  Like Bobby Fischer, I love he's one of my favorite people ever, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5392.9s)]
*  even though he completely went berserk. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5395.5s)]
*  But I just I have such an affection for Bobby Fischer. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5397.94s)]
*  And I'm like, well, it's just that he's such a genius that sometimes it just [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5400.18s)]
*  there's a price to pay from you. It gets away from 100 percent. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5404.06s)]
*  I think it absolutely does and can. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5406.82s)]
*  And I think that when you you're dealing with a high level [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5408.98s)]
*  performer in any discipline, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5411.82s)]
*  whatever drives them to be that much better than anybody else [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5415.06s)]
*  probably makes them insane. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5419.62s)]
*  I mean, I just don't think I don't think real true excellence [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5421.42s)]
*  comes without a price. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5426.78s)]
*  I don't I don't think there's any way to get there without just not being balanced [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5428.46s)]
*  in a bunch of other areas of your life, because you're focusing [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5432.94s)]
*  almost all of your attention on one very specific thing, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5436.259999999999s)]
*  whether it's moving chess pieces around or throwing a football, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5439.54s)]
*  whatever the fuck it is like, you're there's no way you can be balanced [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5442.7s)]
*  in every aspect of your life if you want to be five percent better [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5447.0199999999995s)]
*  than anybody who's ever done it. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5451.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it is weird to like, because to be better than everybody at something. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5452.82s)]
*  Yeah. It's I mean, whether like if you ever talk to somebody at a party, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5456.66s)]
*  just what our life is doing, stand up and they're talking about their [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5460.0199999999995s)]
*  job and a lot of times I'm like, oh, shut the fuck. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5462.7s)]
*  I don't care. Give a shit. I know. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5464.78s)]
*  So to be that on such a level better than everyone on earth at something [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5468.0599999999995s)]
*  has got to it's got to be hard not to live in that place. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5471.62s)]
*  Yeah. Where you can't relate. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5474.22s)]
*  Very few things are interesting. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5476.0599999999995s)]
*  Very few things are moving. Right. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5479.0199999999995s)]
*  Like Buzz Aldrin snapped at me when we interviewed him. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5481.66s)]
*  He's a bit of a cranky guy. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5484.66s)]
*  Let's not dilly dally. I've got to get to CNN. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5486.58s)]
*  Fuck you. He said yes. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5489.099999999999s)]
*  I asked I asked him a question, a good question about his book on Mars. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5490.94s)]
*  I asked him about space travel and I said about what type of psychological [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5494.7s)]
*  testing would you maybe need to go on a three year space trip? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5499.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And good question. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5502.099999999999s)]
*  Thank you. I felt it was to buzz did not. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5503.66s)]
*  He snapped at me. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5506.379999999999s)]
*  So but I bet again, like Regan had a bit about him walking on the moon. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5508.299999999999s)]
*  And it's like when you've gone there, it's almost like anything else. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5511.7s)]
*  And I took it, by the way, because it was buzz. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5515.74s)]
*  I wasn't going to yell at him. It's fucking Buzz Aldrin. Whatever. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5517.54s)]
*  I'm an annoying, blinking idiot asking a question [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5520.3s)]
*  that I think sounds smart. And he just shot me up. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5522.78s)]
*  But like, how do you find other people interesting when you're that guy? Right. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5525.14s)]
*  When you've done that? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5528.900000000001s)]
*  Maybe my question was just banal and stupid. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5529.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people like that that are the best at the whatever [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5532.54s)]
*  the fuck they do that they can't relate to anybody else [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5536.14s)]
*  other than other people that do their thing. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5538.54s)]
*  And they're usually very competitive with those people. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5540.42s)]
*  So they've alienated them from their friend group as well, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5542.7s)]
*  which is really kind of crazy. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5545.860000000001s)]
*  Well, the worst is people who think they're that guy and who are [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5547.22s)]
*  mediocre, just the average comics. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5550.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's the war. The comics are the worst with that. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5553.02s)]
*  The narcissist comics that believe they're better than everybody else [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5555.66s)]
*  when they're just mediocre is crazy. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5559.02s)]
*  And then they just shit on all the other comics. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5561.1s)]
*  It's like, do you ever watch your own act? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5563.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, do you don't hate your act? Like, that's crazy. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5565.900000000001s)]
*  And you think you're doing Shakespeare and every comic, like [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5569.3s)]
*  we all have a narcissistic quality. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5572.62s)]
*  Like you need that to be in front of people. Look at me. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5574.74s)]
*  That's a narcissistic quality. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5577.34s)]
*  But there's a difference between that and being like a legit narcissist. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5579.18s)]
*  And the way comics are fucking very petty about guys, like they attack Matt [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5582.9400000000005s)]
*  Reif, like he's harmless. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5586.780000000001s)]
*  He's just out there doing his act in front of fucking 20,000 people. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5588.18s)]
*  They hate him because he's successful. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5590.740000000001s)]
*  Yes. But if he was nobody, they wouldn't hate him. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5592.58s)]
*  That's all it is, man. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5595.1s)]
*  There's so many. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5596.5s)]
*  You very rarely see these comics attacking someone who's not doing as well as them. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5597.700000000001s)]
*  It's always a guy who is doing better, who they feel I'm entitled. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5602.860000000001s)]
*  They deserve it. Yeah. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5606.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, my comedy is so much more cerebral, so much more interesting. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5607.98s)]
*  Like, oh, is it really? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5612.62s)]
*  That's one thing I'll say for myself. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5614.42s)]
*  And I have a lot of faults, but I've always put the blame squarely [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5616.0599999999995s)]
*  where it belongs on me. Yes. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5619.54s)]
*  I never think it's the world. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5621.86s)]
*  Loves you. It's I mean, that's a very good quality to have, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5623.259999999999s)]
*  you know, like maybe self deprecating to a fault. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5627.139999999999s)]
*  Sure. You're a little bit self deprecating to a fault. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5630.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, I don't care. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5631.9s)]
*  I don't know how many times I've had to tell you, no, Jim, you're fucking great. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5632.86s)]
*  Stop. You know, like you and I've had a lot of those conversations. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5636.1s)]
*  Yeah. And but I don't do it for. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5639.22s)]
*  I don't. It's better than me saying, Jim, you're not great. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5641.02s)]
*  Yeah, Jim, you're OK. Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5643.42s)]
*  Leave everybody else alone and look at yourself. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5646.02s)]
*  But I don't I don't do that because I want people to compliment me either. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5647.660000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm never out there going, gee, guys, am I fat? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5650.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5653.46s)]
*  But it's the guys who think like I wouldn't watch it. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5656.46s)]
*  I don't know, Matt. I just I went and watched some of his clips. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5658.820000000001s)]
*  I'm like, he's funny. He's just doing crowd work. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5661.18s)]
*  What's the problem? And he's good at it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5662.820000000001s)]
*  He's good at it. It's the reason why the arena is full. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5664.3s)]
*  First of all, very handsome, good looking guy. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5666.58s)]
*  Yeah. Cute, adorable, lovable, really nice guy in real life. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5668.900000000001s)]
*  I knew him before he was ever famous. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5672.58s)]
*  I met him when he was 20 years old. He was coming around the store. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5674.58s)]
*  He was a nice fucking guy. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5677.18s)]
*  I've been friends with him for a long time. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5678.34s)]
*  I don't understand that hate. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5680.22s)]
*  But, you know, I was coming from a different position. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5681.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, I was coming from a position where I was already famous [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5685.1s)]
*  and I wasn't looking to be more. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5687.820000000001s)]
*  I wasn't. You know, there's some people that like always feel like they haven't [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5690.66s)]
*  gotten enough, they haven't gotten enough credit, haven't got enough respect. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5694.1s)]
*  You know, the other people are stealing from that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5697.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's a famine mentality. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5700.58s)]
*  It's a terrible mentality to carry around with you because you never heal from it. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5702.54s)]
*  If you go through life with this famine mindset [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5706.860000000001s)]
*  and everybody else is doing better than you, like you, you have the worst attitude [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5710.26s)]
*  ever for getting good at things because you're always going to be [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5714.54s)]
*  focusing too much of your attention on other people. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5717.54s)]
*  Yes. You're really sabotaging yourself. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5720.26s)]
*  Believe it or not, what they're getting, what they're doing, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5722.1s)]
*  it's the feeling of entitlement. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5724.900000000001s)]
*  Like if I was if I was bitter about every person that used to open for me, that passed me. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5726.14s)]
*  I mean, I'd be on a comedy club roof with an AR 15. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5731.42s)]
*  I just I couldn't handle it. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5733.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have to learn to live with it and go like, yeah, you know what? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5735.26s)]
*  I recognized people that were funny, like I like funny people. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5739.3s)]
*  And I was right about certain people, like they're really good comics. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5743.02s)]
*  So, yeah, it's that sense of entitlement that guys get that drives me fucking crazy. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5746.14s)]
*  But I see them attacking certain people doing well. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5750.099999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't they always did it to Carrot Top, even though he's actually funny. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5752.58s)]
*  He's a funny comic. It's a funny show. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5755.22s)]
*  It's got a great show in Vegas. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5757.099999999999s)]
*  It's fucking great. And he's a really nice guy. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5758.66s)]
*  Yeah, he's a great guy. A mean guy. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5761.139999999999s)]
*  It doesn't deserve anyone's hate. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5762.74s)]
*  He's a sweetheart. Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5764.98s)]
*  And then when I had him on the podcast, he was so happy and so thankful [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5766.26s)]
*  that like someone wasn't shitting on him and they said like, dude, I got great crowds now. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5769.34s)]
*  My crowds are packed. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5772.7s)]
*  Like, it's a great show. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5774.42s)]
*  If you're in Vegas, go check them out. Yeah, it's fun. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5775.5s)]
*  And he's a really nice guy. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5778.14s)]
*  And I watched him like on Kill Tony. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5779.660000000001s)]
*  There's a clip of him and they pulling up these things and like a game house. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5782.820000000001s)]
*  It was a disco ball over a mouse trap. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5786.38s)]
*  And it was so stupid. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5788.06s)]
*  But it's it's really as funny as silly. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5789.38s)]
*  Comedians think all props are bad or all. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5792.62s)]
*  And me and Colin talked about that one time and he goes, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5795.58s)]
*  why should the hacks on McDonald's? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5797.42s)]
*  Like meaning like if you have something that's original and funny to say about a subject, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5799.42s)]
*  who cares if hacks have touched it? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5802.9400000000005s)]
*  If your thought is original. Oh, shit. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5804.22s)]
*  Fuck them. Exactly. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5805.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's this weird thing where comics think they sound smarter if they go after certain things. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5807.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's stupid. It's dumb. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5812.46s)]
*  It's a dumb perspective. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5814.98s)]
*  It should be here's the world through my eyes. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5816.5s)]
*  And everything is in the world. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5818.46s)]
*  Traffic is in the world. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5820.0599999999995s)]
*  If you have a traffic joke and it's actually legitimate, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5821.58s)]
*  like maybe you have a perspective on traffic that I've never heard before. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5824.94s)]
*  Maybe your airline travel bit will be the airline travel. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5827.94s)]
*  I hope so. I really love it. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5831.259999999999s)]
*  Because, you know, there's that's the problem with comics, too, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5833.0199999999995s)]
*  is that when you're on the road too much, your experiences are very limited [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5835.3s)]
*  because all you're doing is performing in front of people, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5839.22s)]
*  hanging out in the green room, going to dinner, flying in an airplane, staying in a hotel. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5841.780000000001s)]
*  So how many comics have jokes about hotel rooms and, you know, they knock on the door, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5846.06s)]
*  even when the do not disturb is on, you're jerking off. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5851.1s)]
*  Like, how many guys have done those jokes? Yes. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5853.54s)]
*  But it's just because you have a very limited experience to draw from. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5856.02s)]
*  I actually I started taking days off. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5859.74s)]
*  And my wife and I will go on vacation somewhere, we'll do because it becomes where you're feeding on yourself. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5863.34s)]
*  Like you're only doing A, B, C, D, A, B, C and there's no life. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5868.22s)]
*  Right. And I'm like, what am I going to fucking talk about? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5872.5s)]
*  We get it. You were at Newark Airport. It sucks. Yeah. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5874.1s)]
*  So I just wanted to do more life things. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5876.42s)]
*  A, because it's fun to do. But B, it's like just I allowed myself to. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5879.46s)]
*  Because I'm like, you can at least talk about it on stage. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5883.18s)]
*  It's not you can't just talk about being a comic or you're right. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5885.22s)]
*  I'm almost too much talk about myself. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5889.78s)]
*  I want to start talking about other things. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5891.66s)]
*  I just feel like the only thing I'm really qualified to discuss in my own life. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5893.54s)]
*  But I kind of want to talk about other shit, too, because life is kind of stable now. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5896.34s)]
*  And it's I don't know what to do with that. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5900.58s)]
*  I don't know how to handle, you know what I mean? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5902.82s)]
*  Like not being out and being crazy and fucking riding around for four hours a night with a piss cup in my car. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5904.94s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's an ugly fucking ugly scene show. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5910.82s)]
*  So I did when I was kicked off the I would ride around and just fucking just ride around for four hours a night. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5914.66s)]
*  I couldn't listen to any comedy. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5921.54s)]
*  I couldn't because I was so in such a fucking depression. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5922.9800000000005s)]
*  I would put on sports radio 660 Joe Beningo overnight. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5925.46s)]
*  I know you know who he is. No, he was a guy on 660 to 40 on the fan and he was a jet fan and he was a fucking maniac. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5929.34s)]
*  But I would listen to him complain about the jets and or Art Bell. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5936.02s)]
*  I fell in love with Art Bell's right there. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5939.58s)]
*  Ah, I didn't even notice that. Yeah, he's on the wall now. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5941.820000000001s)]
*  That's why I heard about Michio Kaku was from him. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5945.34s)]
*  And I tell you, he lived in my building in New York. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5949.14s)]
*  Yeah, he did tell me that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5951.06s)]
*  So I would listen to Art Bell and I would listen to Joe Beningo and just look at hookers all night and piss in a cup. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5952.42s)]
*  And I would fucking ride around. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5958.34s)]
*  And it was just my my way of and go to bed, wake up maybe eight hours later and go do Tough Crowd when I was on. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5959.740000000001s)]
*  It was a very crazy fucking time. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5967.18s)]
*  Yeah. When ONA got pulled, that was that was an interesting moment of censorship. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5969.26s)]
*  Right. Like that homeless guy came on and said terrible things about Condoleezza. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5974.740000000001s)]
*  And the Queen of No, that's a different than we got fired was for Sex for Sam. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5979.5s)]
*  That was 2002. That was when someone had sex in a church. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5983.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You got points. Right. That's right. That's right. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5987.0599999999995s)]
*  But the company had signed off on the bit like I got why they were mad, but they had signed off as a sponsored bit. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5991.179999999999s)]
*  The company knew what was going on. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5997.38s)]
*  So ONA could have survived that if the company didn't throw them out of the panic. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=5999.38s)]
*  And in fact, it's so much it's so funny. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6003.46s)]
*  Like regular radio is what saved the career because when XM suspended the show for a month, we were on K-Rock at that time. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6005.62s)]
*  Right. And they kept us on for the month. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6012.86s)]
*  So then eventually we came back to satellite a month later. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6015.38s)]
*  But I think they would have fired us. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6017.86s)]
*  I remember those days. Yeah. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6018.74s)]
*  Yeah. It's I'm not doing radio now. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6019.94s)]
*  It's the first time in 20 years. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6021.66s)]
*  It's very strange. Wow. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6022.58s)]
*  To to not have to be up. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6024.3s)]
*  I get up at like nine now and just go to the gym. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6028.0599999999995s)]
*  So I have some kind of schedule. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6030.54s)]
*  But it's very weird after 20 years to be gone from that day on radio forever. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6032.26s)]
*  It's been more than 20 years, hasn't it? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6036.780000000001s)]
*  Well, it was 20 on this run and like. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6039.02s)]
*  But when did the ONA start? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6041.06s)]
*  ONA, I did like 2001, 2002. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6043.3s)]
*  OK, we got fired, came back on October of 04 and my contract expired the end of December of 24. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6047.1s)]
*  So it was about 22 years total. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6056.7s)]
*  Every comic owes ONA a debt of gratitude. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6059.860000000001s)]
*  All of us do. Without them, I don't think there would be podcasts. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6062.740000000001s)]
*  I think that was the real podcast, because that was the first time we realized [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6067.02s)]
*  because ONA did the show with no structure, whereas like I did Howard a bunch of times. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6071.62s)]
*  But when you did Howard, you were a guest. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6075.740000000001s)]
*  They wanted stuff that you were going to talk about. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6077.660000000001s)]
*  They had questions for you. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6079.58s)]
*  They had setups. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6081.02s)]
*  You know, they were ready. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6082.26s)]
*  And then a couple of times I did Howard where you would write jokes for him. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6083.26s)]
*  So you would sit there and there was an overhead projector. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6086.3s)]
*  It was the Jackie chair when Jackie left. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6088.78s)]
*  Right. So they brought a bunch of us in and then Artie wound up doing it all the time. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6090.62s)]
*  I couldn't do it. I just like it was too early in the morning. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6095.3s)]
*  Yes. Like I didn't want to live in New York, but I did it a bunch of times. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6098.38s)]
*  But it was structured, you know, and Howard was always in control of it. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6101.94s)]
*  And he's actually running the keys. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6105.099999999999s)]
*  Yes. He's running the board, the soundboard. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6106.82s)]
*  And, you know, it was very structured show. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6109.62s)]
*  And, you know, that's how we did it forever. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6111.34s)]
*  I get it. But the way ONA did it was so different. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6113.3s)]
*  There was no structure. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6116.66s)]
*  You'd go in there, you'd sit and just have fun. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6117.86s)]
*  Yeah. And it was be Patrice and you and me and fucking, you know, everybody would [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6120.46s)]
*  call me Bobby Voss and Bobby and all these different people come in and burr. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6125.62s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, and it was some of the wildest moments ever, like the baby bird. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6129.78s)]
*  That's I'll never see anything crazier than that in my life. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6135.179999999999s)]
*  Never. Yeah. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6139.46s)]
*  Yeah. He died recently. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6141.74s)]
*  Huh? Pat from Monocchi. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6142.98s)]
*  Pat from Monocchi. Pat Philbin, I think his name was. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6144.0599999999995s)]
*  Rest in peace, Pat from Monocchi. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6145.78s)]
*  That one thing that you did that one day was one of the most shocking things I've ever [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6148.0199999999995s)]
*  seen in my fucking life. Yeah. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6152.58s)]
*  It was Ari was there with me. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6154.0599999999995s)]
*  Burr was there. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6156.42s)]
*  And I remember it was my idea. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6158.179999999999s)]
*  I think it was right because, you know, I was doing Fear Factor at the time. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6160.94s)]
*  I was used to people doing horrible shit. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6164.179999999999s)]
*  And I was like, how about you lean your head over the garbage can and he throws up in [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6166.66s)]
*  your mouth and fucking Pat Duffy. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6170.78s)]
*  He was such a psycho. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6174.82s)]
*  He was like, OK, he would do anything. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6176.66s)]
*  He brushed his teeth with cat shit. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6178.86s)]
*  I thought it was dog shit, but you might be right. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6180.74s)]
*  But I'm going to Pat Duffy was a fucking fucking psycho. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6182.58s)]
*  He was like a Marine. If interns had that, he was a seal. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6185.62s)]
*  He was a fearless, fearless. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6188.74s)]
*  He was funny. He didn't give a fuck. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6190.42s)]
*  Yeah. He was great. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6191.9s)]
*  It was great. He was the best like radio employee of all time. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6193.0599999999995s)]
*  He really was. And that moment was the fucking craziest thing I'd ever seen in my life. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6196.259999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe it was happening. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6201.099999999999s)]
*  And the amount of vomit that was coming out of Pat's mouth when he was thrown into Pat [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6202.94s)]
*  Duffy's face and Pat was lying there with his mouth open, letting I mean, people at [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6208.0599999999995s)]
*  home listening to this. Come on. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6213.139999999999s)]
*  There's cell phone footage of this. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6214.94s)]
*  Yes. From like a 2002 cell. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6216.66s)]
*  There's a seven. Yeah. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6219.62s)]
*  Was it 2007? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6220.98s)]
*  Yeah. And it could bring K-Rock. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6221.98s)]
*  That's the K-Rock studio right there. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6223.219999999999s)]
*  He throws up in his mouth. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6224.62s)]
*  His mouth wide open. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6226.219999999999s)]
*  It was so disgusting. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6227.54s)]
*  And it kept coming. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6228.82s)]
*  Yeah. Because Pat drank like some fucking. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6229.94s)]
*  Seventy something things of eggnog. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6232.94s)]
*  It's like two gallons of eggnog. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6234.3s)]
*  It was fucking insane. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6236.0199999999995s)]
*  Any I'd die. Oh, there it goes. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6236.94s)]
*  There it goes. And it would just keep coming. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6239.0199999999995s)]
*  Like you like, no, it's over. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6241.34s)]
*  And if you hear us in the studio, we're all screaming. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6242.94s)]
*  He just keeps throwing up. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6249.62s)]
*  You think it's over? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6251.14s)]
*  You think it's over? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6252.58s)]
*  No. He's got more. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6253.78s)]
*  And at the end, I mean, it's cartoonish. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6255.78s)]
*  It's like that scene in Stand By Me with the blueberry eating contest. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6259.06s)]
*  Yes. Or in Monty Python. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6263.14s)]
*  It keeps going. It keeps going. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6265.26s)]
*  It doesn't end. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6266.740000000001s)]
*  He thinks it's over. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6267.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's fucking absolutely completely insane. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6270.18s)]
*  Do you ever see the meaning of life, Monty Python? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6273.14s)]
*  When the guy, a wafer thin mint monsieur, and he starts vomiting. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6274.860000000001s)]
*  Get me a bucket. I'm going to throw up. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6279.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's what he reminds me of, because he's not moving. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6281.22s)]
*  He's standing there and his mouth opens and the vomit just shoot. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6283.860000000001s)]
*  Pretty jacked up. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6287.38s)]
*  Usually you retch and you move, but he just opened his mouth [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6288.3s)]
*  and it was like a button got pushed. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6292.22s)]
*  It's the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6295.14s)]
*  And if it wasn't there, it is. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6297.46s)]
*  It's just shooting. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6299.5s)]
*  It's just like, but it's not that's not even as extreme. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6300.820000000001s)]
*  No. Look how fat that guy is. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6303.34s)]
*  He was just great. Insane. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6304.740000000001s)]
*  A wafer thin mint. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6306.3s)]
*  Then, you know, that show having that kind of a format [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6308.22s)]
*  let us all realize how fun it is to just get comics together and just talk shit. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6312.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and then when Anthony started doing live from the compound, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6316.74s)]
*  when he did his own show, that was and then, of course, Tom Green's show, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6320.82s)]
*  because Tom Green had his own show in his living room. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6324.74s)]
*  And I was a guest on that, too. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6326.74s)]
*  And I was like, that really lit the light bulb in my head. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6327.98s)]
*  Yeah. But when Anthony started doing his own show from his basement, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6330.5s)]
*  I was like, why don't I do something like that? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6333.46s)]
*  You know, I could see and he had a professional setup. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6335.38s)]
*  He had he had fucking beer kegs and he had a beer on tap. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6337.9s)]
*  And he was doing karaoke with a machine with a machine gun. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6342.34s)]
*  I mean, just a psychopath singing, you light up my life with a fucking AR 15. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6345.299999999999s)]
*  But he was having a good time. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6350.5s)]
*  And I remember the radio station was trying to get him to stop doing it. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6352.219999999999s)]
*  XM or Sirius, whoever it was, was trying to get him to stop doing it. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6356.459999999999s)]
*  And he was like, well, why? It's not radio. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6359.66s)]
*  Right. If anything, he's getting more people to watch the radio show. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6361.379999999999s)]
*  He would do it on weekends. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6365.139999999999s)]
*  It didn't interfere with the show. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6366.099999999999s)]
*  It was like he would just go and fuck around. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6367.459999999999s)]
*  And that was back when we were on Pal Talk, too. Remember? Oh, God. Yeah. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6369.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The video would be on Pal Talk because most people would only be watching [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6373.54s)]
*  or listening on radio. Right. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6377.94s)]
*  But then they would broadcast live on Pal Talk because it was like so unheard of. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6379.74s)]
*  Like nobody was doing that. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6383.54s)]
*  That was how the Anthony Wiener dick photo got out. Really? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6384.86s)]
*  That was from Opie and Anthony. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6388.42s)]
*  That was we had Vincent D'Onofrio in studio and we had Andrew Breitbart [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6389.74s)]
*  and excited met Breitbart doing a red eye on Fox. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6394.98s)]
*  So they both came in and we were talking and the Pal Talk window was open. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6398.1s)]
*  And apparently I did like Andrew had the picture of Anthony Wiener's dick. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6402.179999999999s)]
*  So he showed us in studio. We just looked at it on the phone. I didn't. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6406.62s)]
*  But apparently Anthony held it up to the Pal Talk window and showed them. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6410.5s)]
*  And somebody grabbed it. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6414.78s)]
*  Oh, wow. And that was how that photo got out. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6415.86s)]
*  Wow. Serious XM and sticky situation. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6420.5s)]
*  I want an investigation from serious into what the hell happened there. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6424.46s)]
*  Breitbart says after he shows an X-rated picture to shock jocks, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6428.139999999999s)]
*  Opie and Anthony, who then share it on Twitter. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6431.42s)]
*  Maybe one of the guys tweeted it too. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6433.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it was one of the Breitbart mad at me. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6435.18s)]
*  And he's like, I was friends with Jim Norton and he told us to [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6438.1s)]
*  Elliot Spitzer on his show and he goes and he betrayed me. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6440.34s)]
*  But I really didn't. It wasn't me. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6442.38s)]
*  I was doing Tom Papa's fucking podcast. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6443.860000000001s)]
*  So he thought you did it. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6446.42s)]
*  He thought I set him up, but I really didn't know. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6447.820000000001s)]
*  And I saw him years later in L.A. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6450.66s)]
*  and we explained to him and he was very cool. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6452.34s)]
*  I was happy because right before he died. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6454.34s)]
*  So I always liked him. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6455.58s)]
*  I was happy that we at least I get to tell him that, dude, it wasn't me at all. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6456.900000000001s)]
*  Did they whack him? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6459.74s)]
*  Did they whack Andrew Breitbart? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6461.26s)]
*  No, because they would have crashed the site. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6462.86s)]
*  I mean, he was doing coke, right? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6464.3s)]
*  Wasn't an overdose or something? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6465.62s)]
*  I think he had a heart attack. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6466.74s)]
*  Oh, it was a heart attack. I thought it was. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6467.82s)]
*  You know, I'm just starting rumors. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6469.26s)]
*  He was doing coke right. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6470.3s)]
*  I don't remember me. Maybe he was doing coke. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6471.54s)]
*  But I think it was a heart attack. Oh, it might have been. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6473.74s)]
*  I think there was a lot of suspicion that he might have got whacked. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6475.5s)]
*  Really? Because, yeah, he was one of those guys that was, you know, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6477.94s)]
*  exposing a lot of shit. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6481.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but they didn't they didn't crash the site. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6483.58s)]
*  Did the site change after he was gone? Wearing headphones. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6485.82s)]
*  God damn it. It's just so natural. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6489.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's put them on. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6490.62s)]
*  No wonder I was enjoying myself so much. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6491.62s)]
*  When Liberace winks at me. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6493.62s)]
*  Liberace got you to wear headphones. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6495.660000000001s)]
*  He sure did. I just noticed that you were wearing them. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6497.06s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't notice either. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6498.9800000000005s)]
*  But when Liberace winks, you have to hear it in both ears. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6500.3s)]
*  Yeah, there was some there was some speculation that he got whacked. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6506.3s)]
*  But I don't know if anybody dies or speculation that got whacked. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6508.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't I didn't know that. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6511.740000000001s)]
*  But I felt bad about that. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6514.62s)]
*  Was that collapsed on the street near his home? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6515.94s)]
*  Collapse on the street near his home? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6518.66s)]
*  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6520.099999999999s)]
*  Focal coronary [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6523.54s)]
*  arthrosclerosis died from congested congestive heart failure, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6525.179999999999s)]
*  which had been diagnosed the year before. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6531.58s)]
*  Oh, so you had a heart. OK. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6533.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, when you're running a site like that, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6535.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, imagine the stress. It's constant. Yeah. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6538.339999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, you're also like your your business is exposing [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6541.179999999999s)]
*  people politically and opening up yourself to potential assassination. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6544.98s)]
*  Well, who do you think put up the opiate Anthony homeless Charlie audio? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6549.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, he did. It was Andrew. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6552.299999999999s)]
*  I was before I knew him. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6553.5s)]
*  But that's what it went up on Breitbart. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6554.66s)]
*  And the headline was Will this crash? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6557.0199999999995s)]
*  Will this stop the merger between Sirius and XM? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6561.54s)]
*  So that was why they reacted because they were afraid. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6565.0199999999995s)]
*  I think people in regular radio wanted to stop that merger. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6567.78s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6570.5s)]
*  So they radio was terrified of Sirius XM. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6571.62s)]
*  They were terrified of it. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6574.74s)]
*  And I think so. I think they pushed that story, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6575.74s)]
*  hoping that it would fucking tank the merger, which of course it did not. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6578.26s)]
*  You remember those days when you first went over there? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6581.82s)]
*  It was so crazy because we could talk like we could talk in the green room. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6583.78s)]
*  Yeah. We could swear. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6587.34s)]
*  We call someone a cunt. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6589.099999999999s)]
*  You can say anything you want. It was crazy. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6590.179999999999s)]
*  They never I'll take one of it seriously, even though I didn't like the way [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6592.7s)]
*  the contract way my time there ended. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6595.54s)]
*  I wish that was handled a little bit better. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6597.74s)]
*  But I guess everybody who leaves a gig wishes things were handled differently. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6599.66s)]
*  They never once fucked with me about content. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6603.06s)]
*  I'll say that for them. They never came to me and goes, hey, man, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6606.06s)]
*  that thing you talked about, could you not? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6608.66s)]
*  Could you back off? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6610.38s)]
*  Even long into where everybody was getting canceled and in trouble, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6611.58s)]
*  Sirius never came and asked me not to say something. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6614.7s)]
*  Jim McClure, who ran the channel, never broke my balls about jokes [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6619.86s)]
*  we did or a stance we would take. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6622.900000000001s)]
*  Like they kind of let that go. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6625.18s)]
*  Well, they had a crazy situation where they you knew that one person [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6627.34s)]
*  was getting insane amounts of money. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6632.1s)]
*  Yes. Howard Stern and everybody else was getting very little. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6633.900000000001s)]
*  Was real weird. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6637.42s)]
*  It was because it was very open that Howard was getting all that money, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6638.660000000001s)]
*  which obviously he was the reason why I went over there in the first place. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6642.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he said it was it was serious. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6646.22s)]
*  And we were at XM and he was serious. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6648.620000000001s)]
*  And that was the giant get was Howard going over. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6650.14s)]
*  Also, there's also the thing that if he leaves, the stock collapses, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6652.14s)]
*  especially now. Yeah. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6657.34s)]
*  You know, I mean, if you don't have Howard Stern anymore, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6658.900000000001s)]
*  what do you got? What do you have that's not available for free? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6661.62s)]
*  Yeah, I saw my serious talk. So whatever happens, I did. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6664.42s)]
*  I was happy it spiked up to like seven and I fucking dumped. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6667.46s)]
*  Were you allowed to sell while you were working there? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6670.18s)]
*  Did you have to wait till you weren't working there? [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6672.0599999999995s)]
*  Nobody can. Nobody asked. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6674.0199999999995s)]
*  They didn't give you stock. You bought it. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6675.22s)]
*  I bought it. I bought it years before when I thought they're going to go bankrupt. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6677.5s)]
*  We bought a little bit. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6682.42s)]
*  But I was guess when I talked about the losses, I was getting sued. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6683.34s)]
*  So I didn't buy as much because paying for fucking lawyers. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6685.22s)]
*  But yeah, they tried to cut me like an unreasonable amount. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6688.22s)]
*  And so we were still negotiating. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6690.62s)]
*  And then they just go, oh, yeah, we're not going to renew. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6692.0199999999995s)]
*  They waited till Christmas break and they were not going to renew. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6694.0199999999995s)]
*  So I was like, all right. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6695.98s)]
*  I guess I get why they did that. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6697.3s)]
*  But but it's got to be weird when you're over there [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6698.78s)]
*  and you know that Stern is getting hundreds of millions of dollars [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6701.0199999999995s)]
*  and everybody else is like, you know, they're just pinching pennies with people. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6703.98s)]
*  I never minded that and really didn't care because [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6707.78s)]
*  I only cared about what I was getting. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6711.82s)]
*  And when I saw what they gave certain podcasters that went over there, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6713.58s)]
*  I'm like, OK, they do have the money. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6717.0599999999995s)]
*  So choosing not to give it to me. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6719.42s)]
*  Yeah, I have to just accept that. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6721.700000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, I mean, like I never knew what Opie and Anthony made. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6723.620000000001s)]
*  I still to this day don't know what their salary was. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6726.46s)]
*  I never asked. That's great. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6728.9800000000005s)]
*  Be grudge those guys. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6730.820000000001s)]
*  I never gave a fuck like, you know, they were the brand Opie Anthony. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6731.9800000000005s)]
*  It was like they took me in. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6735.660000000001s)]
*  So I never care what they got. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6737.06s)]
*  I never felt entitled to their money. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6738.3s)]
*  And I never asked what they made. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6740.54s)]
*  Even when me and Opie did a show, I never said, what you making? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6741.740000000001s)]
*  Like they gave me a raise, but I didn't. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6743.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't look at money like that. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6746.34s)]
*  Like I have to know what you're making, because it's like, yeah, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6747.82s)]
*  that's not good. That's a healthy way to look at it. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6750.62s)]
*  Yeah. So whatever Howard made, I'm sure some of it was inflated. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6752.9s)]
*  But like, oh, you made a lot of fucking he did. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6756.139999999999s)]
*  He made a lot of fucking money. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6758.82s)]
*  But but again, if he's not there, how are you selling it? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6759.94s)]
*  If he's not there, what do you what are you selling [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6764.66s)]
*  that's not available for free everywhere? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6767.099999999999s)]
*  That's why I was like bummed about the way it happened. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6769.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like, because we did a talk show. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6771.34s)]
*  Maybe they were just like, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6772.9s)]
*  yeah, we can put more money into the rest of the channel. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6773.66s)]
*  If Jim whatever, I'm glad I'm doing a podcast like [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6775.54s)]
*  I haven't noticed any change in my life, which is great [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6778.0199999999995s)]
*  because I'm on the road more making, you know, I'm making money on the road. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6781.0599999999995s)]
*  But it's weird not having it. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6783.7s)]
*  It's weird. It's weird not knowing that it's there. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6785.62s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6789.139999999999s)]
*  Like it hasn't affected anything. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6790.0199999999995s)]
*  But the knowledge that that income was going to be there is gone. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6792.82s)]
*  So it's kind of a weird, naked feeling. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6796.46s)]
*  Does it make you more motivated to do stuff, though, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6798.66s)]
*  to like to get your own thing going on in the I'm on the road more now? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6801.86s)]
*  Like I'm doing extra roadwork. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6805.98s)]
*  And the special was one of those things where I wanted to do one anyway. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6807.62s)]
*  But it like I shot it in November. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6811.259999999999s)]
*  And before we even came back from break, I had my channel set up. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6813.5s)]
*  I had already started doing episodes. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6817.379999999999s)]
*  I was like, fuck this. I'm not sitting and waiting. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6820.179999999999s)]
*  It's not going to take me a year. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6822.219999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to get up. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6823.94s)]
*  And if it takes me a year to get moving, fine. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6824.82s)]
*  But I'm going to start now. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6827.82s)]
*  What is Sam doing these days? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6828.82s)]
*  He's doing a show. They gave him the show. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6830.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, so he's still showing. They got rid of you. Yes. Whoa. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6831.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, I kind of saw that coming. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6835.099999999999s)]
*  I used to. Yeah. I mean, I almost. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6837.0199999999995s)]
*  They had cut me the year before a little bit. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6841.3s)]
*  But again, I'm not unreasonable. I'm not a fucking idiot. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6843.42s)]
*  People take cuts. Oh, they cut your money. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6845.46s)]
*  Yes, by 10 percent. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6847.74s)]
*  But I'm like, you know what? It's still good money. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6849.139999999999s)]
*  My wife had just come to the States. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6851.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I want to make sure I have money for lawyers. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6852.5s)]
*  And then I told my manager they're going to cut me by this much guaranteed. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6854.9s)]
*  And they almost to the dollar offered me what I predicted. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6858.9s)]
*  So we pushed back and tried to negotiate [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6862.700000000001s)]
*  and they were acting like they were negotiating. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6864.700000000001s)]
*  And then the day the day of Christmas break, like we were off the air for two weeks. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6866.26s)]
*  I got the call like, yeah, we're not going to. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6870.820000000001s)]
*  So they were just kind of, I think, keeping it going until that. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6873.1s)]
*  But I don't I don't have any. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6876.02s)]
*  I truly don't like they bought me two apartments. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6877.5s)]
*  I had a great life there. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6880.06s)]
*  I fucking I broadcasted for 20 years. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6881.3s)]
*  Like it's time to move on anyway. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6883.38s)]
*  Yeah. And I was telling you a long time ago [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6885.46s)]
*  that you could be doing better on the Internet anyway by your own. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6887.46s)]
*  I think I remember I remember you talking to me. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6890.5s)]
*  I mean, 2017 around even before then about podcast. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6892.66s)]
*  I wasn't allowed to podcast because of my [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6895.86s)]
*  my contract. They wouldn't allow it. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6899.379999999999s)]
*  And I think that was one of the sticking points with this one. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6901.179999999999s)]
*  I was like, I have to be able to do my own podcast, especially if I'm taking a cut. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6903.379999999999s)]
*  And I'll just eat shit for a while until it gets where I want it to go. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6908.58s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be able to be your own boss in this day and age. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6911.62s)]
*  It's just it's not it's. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6914.74s)]
*  And also the as big as serious XM was, it's just not that anymore. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6916.42s)]
*  You know, it's just not what it used to be. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6922.66s)]
*  Like if if I didn't have a podcast and during the Opie and Anthony days, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6924.78s)]
*  what it was in his height, if they offered me a show, I'd be like, Whoa, yeah, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6929.58s)]
*  that would have made sense. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6933.26s)]
*  But now I'd be like, what am I? What? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6934.58s)]
*  Unless I wanted to do kind of what Howard's done, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6937.42s)]
*  just make a ton of money and kind of like slip away, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6940.46s)]
*  which is really what I kind of tried to do with with Spotify. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6942.9800000000005s)]
*  I was hoping that Spotify was going to make me like 10 percent less famous. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6946.099999999999s)]
*  That was like the idea. Really? Yeah. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6949.38s)]
*  I was like, give me money. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6950.98s)]
*  Give me smart. Be any more famous. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6952.299999999999s)]
*  I don't need that. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6954.58s)]
*  And we just give me the money. But you know, if. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6955.74s)]
*  But nowadays it's like there's just not enough people listening. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6959.74s)]
*  And I know they own Pandora now, too. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6962.5s)]
*  So they've made a bunch of deals with podcasters [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6964.74s)]
*  because I think they're going to try to get people to listen to Pandora [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6966.74s)]
*  and do it that way. But your Stitcher, I think they do to Stitcher. Yeah. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6969.62s)]
*  We used to be on Stitcher, too. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6973.46s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6974.98s)]
*  It's like the Internet is just too. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6975.86s)]
*  There's so many more people that are listening to all these other platforms. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6978.94s)]
*  Spotify, YouTube is just it's just too enormous. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6982.7s)]
*  It's too big to right. Ignore. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6986.62s)]
*  It is. It is. And it's like, I think that they kind of they handle podcasting [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6989.0599999999995s)]
*  in a way that terrestrial radio handled satellite, which was, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6993.58s)]
*  you know, it's not a big deal and then get involved with it [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=6999.179999999999s)]
*  or somehow embrace it. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7001.78s)]
*  But a little bit later in the in the game too late. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7002.98s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, they have some big podcasts. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7005.66s)]
*  I mean, like, again, I don't they have Call Her Daddy. They do. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7007.62s)]
*  And when I realized the money they gave her again, I don't begrudge her at all. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7010.54s)]
*  Like whatever you make, you make and it's got nothing to do with my salary. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7014.179999999999s)]
*  But I realize they do have the money. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7017.099999999999s)]
*  So if they're choosing not to, I have to just fucking accept that. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7019.0599999999995s)]
*  But you got to wonder if that's a good idea for her. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7021.54s)]
*  But she's still on Spotify, though. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7024.66s)]
*  I don't know. Is she? I don't know. Yeah, isn't she? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7027.179999999999s)]
*  She is right. Yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7029.3s)]
*  I think she's still everywhere else, too. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7030.9s)]
*  Yeah. Which is makes it a good idea. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7032.98s)]
*  The thing is, if they limit your distribution, that's what makes it a bad idea. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7035.86s)]
*  Like one of the new things that we did with this new deal with Spotify [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7039.54s)]
*  and they were actually into it was put it everywhere. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7043.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No, not just be on Spotify, but also go back on YouTube, back on Apple. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7046.099999999999s)]
*  Right. Back everywhere, which was made me very happy. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7050.74s)]
*  Like it should be everywhere. Yes. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7053.339999999999s)]
*  You know, because you want people to just to stumble on it or to go. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7055.099999999999s)]
*  I heard this thing about about this thing today. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7057.82s)]
*  I want to go look at it right now. Right. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7059.46s)]
*  They don't want to sign up for something. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7060.78s)]
*  Enter the fucking email. Exactly. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7061.98s)]
*  Give your credit card. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7063.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of silly. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7065.38s)]
*  And some people just get accustomed to using certain platforms. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7066.74s)]
*  Like for me forever, all I listen to is Apple podcasts. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7069.98s)]
*  You know, the podcast app on Apple. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7073.62s)]
*  It's simple. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7075.82s)]
*  Like download whatever the fucking shows I wanted to listen to. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7076.9s)]
*  And I would get it that way. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7080.179999999999s)]
*  I don't want to have to change. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7081.66s)]
*  I want to have to look around. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7083.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, it's just one of those things. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7084.42s)]
*  People get accustomed to getting things in a certain way. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7086.38s)]
*  It's right. It's there. Yeah. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7088.86s)]
*  It's great to see to like like I don't know. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7091.1s)]
*  I'm sure he does get the credit. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7093.86s)]
*  But like Dane deserves a lot of credit because of the social media. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7094.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7099.26s)]
*  And I think Dane history has kind of forgotten about what he's like. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7100.0199999999995s)]
*  He did a lot to change the way we promote 100 percent. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7102.78s)]
*  And then Schultz, that fucking thing of just turn your phone this way now. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7106.22s)]
*  Like, holy shit. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7110.66s)]
*  Like it revolutionized the way comedians put out clips. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7111.78s)]
*  And it's like, I mean, what he did was do he he [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7115.78s)]
*  capitalized on covid in the best possible way. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7119.14s)]
*  He came up with a different style. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7122.34s)]
*  He's so smart. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7124.820000000001s)]
*  He thought of a different style of comp, because there was a lot of people [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7126.02s)]
*  during covid that were doing like late night talk show monologues [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7129.660000000001s)]
*  on the Internet and they were terrible, terrible because there was no audience. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7133.860000000001s)]
*  No audience. But what Schultz did was he made up for the fact [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7136.740000000001s)]
*  there wasn't any audience with visuals and rapid fire punchlines. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7140.780000000001s)]
*  That's right. And he did it differently than he does his stand up. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7144.62s)]
*  Like his stand up, he'll say something really funny and let it sit. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7148.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's even funnier. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7151.74s)]
*  Like it builds, you know, and he'll look at you like what? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7153.219999999999s)]
*  You know, it'll hold the laugh. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7157.299999999999s)]
*  Yes. Whereas in this Netflix or in the, you know, it was on Netflix as well. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7158.82s)]
*  But when he was doing the sideways thing, it was just rapid fire. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7163.46s)]
*  And he's more than a this than a that, that and this. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7166.94s)]
*  And the photograph of the thing and you'd watch it. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7169.86s)]
*  Oh, hilarious. Different than stand up. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7171.58s)]
*  Yes. And everybody was sharing it. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7173.46s)]
*  It was a genius approach to a genre instead of trying to apply [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7174.9s)]
*  stand up style comedy and monologues to, you know, your Instagram. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7180.379999999999s)]
*  He did a whole new thing. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7186.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And his stand up is funny. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7187.9s)]
*  He did something on on jokes that only work in Hawaii. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7189.42s)]
*  And it's in an arena and he's fucking murdering the way you murder in a club. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7192.62s)]
*  But it's like they're all new jokes just for a while. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7197.099999999999s)]
*  And it was like, it's really fun. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7199.0599999999995s)]
*  And everywhere he goes. I know he did that in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7200.82s)]
*  Yeah. And Dubai. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7204.54s)]
*  He had jokes only about Dubai, about, you know, about shitting on hookers. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7205.38s)]
*  It was like, oh, that's so awesome. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7209.66s)]
*  It's my life. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7211.86s)]
*  But I was happy to see somebody doing something really [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7215.14s)]
*  creative as opposed to blinking their way to Chip Chippers on a fucking TV show. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7217.9s)]
*  We do have to decide. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7222.3s)]
*  Don't shit on chip. I love ship. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7223.54s)]
*  I love chip, too. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7225.0199999999995s)]
*  I love the fact that that's your your closet character. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7226.42s)]
*  When you put the wig on the glasses, you understand it's the bane of my exit. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7228.98s)]
*  I can't do anything without being called a sock, cuckoo and fucking peck. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7232.78s)]
*  In the live chat today, it's all chip. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7237.66s)]
*  Hey, when it's chip coming back, chip is but it's all people love and hate chip. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7239.54s)]
*  I love chip. I love chip. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7243.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a stamp. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7245.5s)]
*  It's such a fucking weird thing. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7247.34s)]
*  It is. It really is. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7248.94s)]
*  I might do it again. I miss doing it like when Anthony would come on. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7250.259999999999s)]
*  It was like the best. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7253.74s)]
*  We did a few live, did three live shows with it, and it was fucking amazing. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7254.78s)]
*  There were theater shows and the crowds loved it. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7257.66s)]
*  It's sold better than I do, which is absolutely humiliating. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7260.46s)]
*  I still think it's faster as chip than Jim Norton. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7263.54s)]
*  Jim Norton, there's still a giant curtain. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7267.1s)]
*  Chip fucking sold out. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7268.54s)]
*  But I do miss doing it. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7270.3s)]
*  But I don't miss getting guests like I fucking now. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7271.34s)]
*  I have one podcast to do. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7273.78s)]
*  I love doing it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7275.26s)]
*  But I still hate saying, hey, could you feel like I hate. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7276.18s)]
*  Did you do it all yourself? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7279.22s)]
*  Is that what you did? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7280.7s)]
*  Pretty much. Reach out to people. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7282.14s)]
*  Yeah, I had my co-host, my my co-host. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7283.9800000000005s)]
*  I was using most recently Zia, and she was great. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7287.34s)]
*  And she would do like a lot of the behind the scenes work for me. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7289.58s)]
*  And she would, you know, help reach out to people and coordinate. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7292.0199999999995s)]
*  But I ultimately had to ask. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7295.18s)]
*  It was like one of those things I wanted a comedian on. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7296.74s)]
*  And one time Nick DiPaolo came on and he was sitting across. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7298.9s)]
*  And this was what Chip would give us all sailor hats. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7302.34s)]
*  And we're all wearing sailor hats. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7305.26s)]
*  And I remember how you go call him Chip. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7306.5s)]
*  I have to. I can't say me. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7308.18s)]
*  I can't I can't face it. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7309.94s)]
*  It's like Ted Bundy would talk about himself in the third person. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7314.14s)]
*  Why? Because he's not proud of it. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7316.22s)]
*  So I would we had on these sailor hats. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7317.82s)]
*  I remember Nick was talking to me and we were having fun. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7320.139999999999s)]
*  But it was the way he was like looking like he was looking at Jim [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7322.34s)]
*  as he was talking and he didn't say he was played along. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7326.46s)]
*  But I was like, oh, oh, that's like, yeah, yeah. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7329.34s)]
*  Fucking I just have a Nick stare at me. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7334.139999999999s)]
*  And I knew he was seeing his friend Jim with a wig on a wig and glasses. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7336.299999999999s)]
*  But I do miss it made me laugh to do it. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7341.099999999999s)]
*  But people would just be too annoying about like, oh, get this, get that. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7345.58s)]
*  They would complain. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7349.18s)]
*  I'm saying, oh, I made zero money doing it. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7349.94s)]
*  And here's why I didn't make it on YouTube. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7352.3s)]
*  I didn't realize that I shouldn't have had the word fuck in the theme song. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7354.34s)]
*  I'm Jamie Jaster from Fucking Hate Breed sang the theme song. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7358.22s)]
*  And it was chip has a fucking but like literally that [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7362.1s)]
*  automatically fucks you for monetization. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7365.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. And I had no idea. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7367.0199999999995s)]
*  So all of my episodes had fuck in the first five seconds. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7368.5s)]
*  I never made any money doing a few hundred bucks on a read here and there. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7371.82s)]
*  But it was it was a labor of love. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7375.98s)]
*  It was one of those things that you can bring it back with a new theme song. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7377.5s)]
*  I could. I did change it at one point. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7380.34s)]
*  I changed it. I took fucking out. Change it. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7382.22s)]
*  People love chip. But gosh darn, it was like some obvious. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7384.86s)]
*  Oh, that's even better. Some awful edit that went in. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7387.66s)]
*  But it's like, when am I going to do it? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7391.1s)]
*  Where am I going to do once mine gets up and like mine's been up for a few months. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7392.38s)]
*  I love doing it. We do callers, which I like the live interactions. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7395.42s)]
*  Like when you do radio, it's hard to not feel like anybody is listening. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7399.34s)]
*  Right. In the moment. Right. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7402.54s)]
*  And it takes you in weird directions. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7405.14s)]
*  Like people will call up with legit everyone. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7406.5s)]
*  Like some comics like, ah, but then as soon as somebody goes, [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7408.9800000000005s)]
*  what do you think about this? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7411.46s)]
*  And they're talking about wanting to commit suicide or they're talking about fucking. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7412.42s)]
*  It becomes interesting because people like everyone wants to give advice. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7415.5s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. Yeah. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7418.42s)]
*  So I like that. I like knowing that something alive will take you [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7419.660000000001s)]
*  into a different direction than we would have gone in. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7422.58s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7425.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to that. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7426.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely something to that. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7428.34s)]
*  But there's that, you know, there's also something. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7430.5s)]
*  It's like it becomes very chaotic [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7432.5s)]
*  because people are calling it just to fuck with you. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7434.5s)]
*  And I've surprisingly had very little of that. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7436.42s)]
*  I mean, again, I'm always with coming from ONA, like [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7439.54s)]
*  nothing is too much at this point because you become so used to. Right. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7442.98s)]
*  Craziness and people and death threats and the fucking. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7447.26s)]
*  I still use a fake name at the cellar because I would get death threats. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7450.22s)]
*  Like there was a couple of them that actually concerned me [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7453.22s)]
*  because people using their real names. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7455.94s)]
*  I mean, if a guy is threatening to kill you with his real name attached to it, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7457.38s)]
*  like he's fucking he's a problem. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7460.46s)]
*  What was it over? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7462.1s)]
*  Well, there was one time Anthony had said something and the guy thought I said it. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7463.26s)]
*  And the guy said something about I'm going to fucking kill you. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7469.34s)]
*  I don't remember what it was, but it was it was the tone. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7471.54s)]
*  He said it. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7473.740000000001s)]
*  I'm like, that feels different than anything anyone's ever said to me. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7474.900000000001s)]
*  Plus, again, last time we talked about the fucking lawyer [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7478.22s)]
*  who hadn't committed a murder at that point, but I still knew he was crazy. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7481.5s)]
*  And I would get I have a hate mail fucking file. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7484.38s)]
*  And I used to argue with them back and forth like a dummy. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7486.780000000001s)]
*  But people would tell me, watch your back. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7490.900000000001s)]
*  I know where you live. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7492.42s)]
*  I'm going to shoot you. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7493.5s)]
*  And then I would see a real name sign to it. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7494.62s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, that guy's mentally ill. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7496.9400000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of those out there. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7499.54s)]
*  Fuck yeah, there are a lot. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7500.660000000001s)]
*  So I started doing that at the comedy cellar. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7501.780000000001s)]
*  I would always use names from the JFK assassination. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7503.9400000000005s)]
*  Like David Ferry was appearing. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7506.900000000001s)]
*  It was never Oswald or Kennedy. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7509.780000000001s)]
*  I wasn't that on the nose, but it was him. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7511.14s)]
*  It was, you know, Clay Shaw. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7512.38s)]
*  It was just all these weird people from the fucking from the Kennedy assassination. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7514.3s)]
*  Atlee Wong used to have to do that at the Comedy Store. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7518.78s)]
*  She was famous, right? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7521.78s)]
*  Was she a stalker? [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7522.5s)]
*  She'd get stalkers. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7523.34s)]
*  There was this one crazy guy that kept showing up. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7524.74s)]
*  But, you know, I guess stalkers for a woman are even more creepy. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7527.82s)]
*  Much more terrifying for a woman. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7531.9s)]
*  And it's like, there's got to be a way like in Black Mirror. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7533.82s)]
*  There's one thing you they had a thing where you could block people from seeing you. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7535.7s)]
*  And again, it's a futuristic thing. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7539.54s)]
*  But the the the penalty for stalking should be so fucking severe [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7541.34s)]
*  because the way they allow someone to ruin someone else's life. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7546.7s)]
*  It's crazy that they haven't figured out something where when you're convicted [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7550.66s)]
*  of stalking, you should be forced to have something in your phone [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7553.98s)]
*  or some type of a monitor bracelet that alerts you the person. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7557.94s)]
*  It drives me crazy. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7561.42s)]
*  There's nothing I hate more than some fucking creep stalker. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7562.38s)]
*  But I guess I've dealt with it. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7565.099999999999s)]
*  So, again, it's very creepy for women, way more creepy for women, you know, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7565.94s)]
*  and they get a lot more of them. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7570.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, a lot of guys get obsessed. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7571.98s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't get no, I'm not interesting to stalk because I fuck you. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7574.26s)]
*  You stalk me to show up and have nice tits. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7579.9800000000005s)]
*  You got me. But I did fuck one stalker, which was great. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7583.02s)]
*  Turned out to be. Oh, no. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7586.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was a bad move. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7587.58s)]
*  And I was bad and bad. I couldn't keep it up. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7590.06s)]
*  I was just it was it was during the lawsuit. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7592.26s)]
*  It was a really bad time for me. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7595.02s)]
*  And I kind of felt badly. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7596.820000000001s)]
*  She thought I didn't like her. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7598.1s)]
*  But I was just. But anyway, for two years, it was phone stalking. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7598.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was not scary like it would be for a woman. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7603.06s)]
*  Just annoying. But it becomes a part of your life. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7607.1s)]
*  Like you become like this with the old iPhones. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7609.86s)]
*  So I would always get these. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7612.22s)]
*  I would leave L.A. on a red eye and I would land in my. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7613.06s)]
*  My iPhone would be filled with voice messages about, you know, a gym and just, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7615.9s)]
*  you know, what a piece of shit I was. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7620.9400000000005s)]
*  A bad guy. So like she used to think I was talking to her on the radio like, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7622.7s)]
*  oh, she was schizophrenic. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7627.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7629.22s)]
*  We would talk dirty a lot. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7630.82s)]
*  And I and you know, and credit where it's due. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7631.94s)]
*  Did good dirty. Oh, you have no idea. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7635.82s)]
*  The crazy ones are the best. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7638.0199999999995s)]
*  Fuck. They anticipate exactly what you need right before you get there. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7639.34s)]
*  Oh, psychotic and erotic. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7643.98s)]
*  Yeah, real close. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7646.179999999999s)]
*  It really is. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7647.38s)]
*  Because it's something about the inhibitions [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7648.62s)]
*  being lowered and, you know, the cuck talk. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7651.58s)]
*  I always like that. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7653.9s)]
*  Not as much now because, again, I'm married, but I always enjoyed good cuck talk. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7654.74s)]
*  Would always make me very happy. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7658.219999999999s)]
*  And I get why guys would like that, but it would make me fucking crazy. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7659.74s)]
*  It's so weird what people like, like the shitting on the chest thing. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7663.0599999999995s)]
*  That's like influencers get paid to go to Dubai. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7666.82s)]
*  A lot of money. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7671.66s)]
*  And those guys are shit on them. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7672.94s)]
*  Wait, they should on the influencer, the influence just on them. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7674.78s)]
*  They should on the influencer. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7677.299999999999s)]
*  Really? I can see that. Yeah. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7679.259999999999s)]
*  Like hot girls, hot girls go over there and they can make half a million dollars [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7681.299999999999s)]
*  and a guy shit on for a weekend. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7685.98s)]
*  That's so that's crazy. Yeah. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7688.219999999999s)]
*  Like just I guess that if you don't have more than that. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7690.54s)]
*  I mean, if you're thinking about people that have insane amounts of money, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7692.7s)]
*  you know, you're dealing with like oil money. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7696.179999999999s)]
*  These guys like, you know, we talk about the richest people in the world. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7699.219999999999s)]
*  Yes. Elon Musk is the richest man in the world. Yes. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7702.66s)]
*  Well, he's the richest public man in the world. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7704.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying he's not insanely rich. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7706.62s)]
*  He's worth two hundred something billion dollars. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7708.299999999999s)]
*  But that's nothing compared to these royal families. Right. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7710.86s)]
*  These oil families, they probably have trillions. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7714.9s)]
*  They probably have trillions of dollars, but it's not public. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7718.62s)]
*  They don't have to disclose how much money they have. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7720.7s)]
*  Whereas in America, like wealthy people that are like on the on the legit [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7724.0599999999995s)]
*  and the up and up, you know, everybody knows what your net worth is. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7728.78s)]
*  Everybody knows how much you have. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7732.9s)]
*  But to pay somebody. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7734.7s)]
*  See, I thought you meant to get shit on to shit on an influencer. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7735.74s)]
*  I've seen a few tick tocks where I'm like, I'd give her a thousand [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7738.5s)]
*  if she let me take a dump on her. She was annoying. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7741.139999999999s)]
*  She was annoying. I think that's what they do. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7743.46s)]
*  That's great. I mean, this is people have talked about it openly. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7745.9800000000005s)]
*  Girls have talked on some of those weird podcasts. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7748.820000000001s)]
*  Girls have talked about how they go over there and they'll they make hundreds [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7751.1s)]
*  of thousands of dollars. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7754.46s)]
*  And, you know, it's only like 20 minutes of their time. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7755.54s)]
*  They just lay there. Some guy shits on them. Everybody cheers. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7757.900000000001s)]
*  That's all. There's a group of people watching. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7761.18s)]
*  A bunch of guys. Your boys are there and you shit on her. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7763.02s)]
*  An influencer because you she probably said something you didn't like. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7765.18s)]
*  Or you just want to shit on a hot girl's tits. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7768.06s)]
*  I mean, that would do nothing for me. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7771.06s)]
*  And I'm a pervert. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7773.22s)]
*  I think it's like a humiliation thing. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7774.14s)]
*  They want to humiliate people and they want to know that they have so much money [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7776.18s)]
*  that they can get you to submit to this willingly. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7779.9400000000005s)]
*  Dude, I've seen the humiliation look every time I fuck someone. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7783.18s)]
*  I know that look is it is a fucking weird desire to want to shit on somebody. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7787.860000000001s)]
*  It is because it's so not sexual. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7793.06s)]
*  Like it's weirdly punishing or like, yeah, like. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7795.46s)]
*  And again, being dirty is I'm not saying having the fetish is wrong. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7798.9s)]
*  Kind of pissed off. Like, whatever. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7802.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, a lot. I've done a lot of trying to. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7803.86s)]
*  And I don't even know what I liked about it. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7806.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know what I liked about it was because it's naughty. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7807.62s)]
*  It was intimate and it was private and not private, intimate and naughty. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7811.66s)]
*  Yeah. And I think, well, that's you're getting pissed on. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7816.299999999999s)]
*  Whereas like if you're having someone lay there while you shit on them, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7819.78s)]
*  that is like just an ultimate expression of the the power of money. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7824.700000000001s)]
*  I suppose it is. I just don't understand the desire. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7829.9400000000005s)]
*  This like there's so many things I would love to do. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7833.1s)]
*  People would let me do them for money, but not shit on them. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7834.9800000000005s)]
*  Like that would just be so like my shits are horrendous. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7837.62s)]
*  Like I'd be embarrassed. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7840.9400000000005s)]
*  And I know. And you want to make sure you can shit at the proper time [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7842.26s)]
*  because you can't really time your shits. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7845.42s)]
*  No. But again, if you have enough money to bring her over and shit on her, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7847.1s)]
*  you have enough money to keep her on hold. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7849.18s)]
*  Yeah. She's not going to take a busy. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7850.820000000001s)]
*  I'm drinking coffee. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7852.34s)]
*  I'm having a cold, bro. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7854.42s)]
*  I'm smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, brewing up a good one for you. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7855.740000000001s)]
*  I have not heard that. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7859.14s)]
*  I know that people get sent over there and they fuck. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7859.860000000001s)]
*  I actually want to go to Dubai. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7862.58s)]
*  Like it's the one of the few places. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7864.1s)]
*  Have you been to the Burj? [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7866.34s)]
*  No, I've been to that, but I've been to Dubai. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7867.46s)]
*  I was in Dubai once because they had the weigh ins there for the UFC. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7870.02s)]
*  And it's like everywhere you look, it's like Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Lamborghini. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7873.860000000001s)]
*  Like the amount of money there was preposterous. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7877.26s)]
*  And this was quite a long time ago. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7879.9800000000005s)]
*  This is like 2007, I believe. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7881.5s)]
*  That's probably before the bridge was built. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7884.3s)]
*  Was it was the first? [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7886.34s)]
*  I don't think it was. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7887.34s)]
*  No, I don't think it was there. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7888.58s)]
*  So what I had seen is just like what was there then. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7889.9s)]
*  And just the obscene amount of wealth. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7892.78s)]
*  I mean, it's really shocking. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7896.82s)]
*  Yeah, I want to go just to go out because I'm afraid of heights. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7898.58s)]
*  So I want to go into that that that that observation deck on top. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7901.34s)]
*  The one that Tom Cruise floors is it? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7905.42s)]
*  I want to say it's like 120 or something. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7908.06s)]
*  It's crazy. It's 3000 feet. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7910.54s)]
*  The the towers, I think, is the tallest structure in the world. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7913.18s)]
*  And there's a few people who have sat in that. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7916.740000000001s)]
*  Like there's usually a picture of Tom Cruise who is batshit crazy. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7919.38s)]
*  Like he actually jumped out the window of that thing for real. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7923.02s)]
*  You see footage of him training for that mission impossible. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7925.860000000001s)]
*  He jumped out the window, jumped out the window, strapped in. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7928.06s)]
*  And I've seen footage of him like taken by people on the observation [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7931.58s)]
*  deck of Tom Cruise hanging out on the outside of the Burge tower. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7934.860000000001s)]
*  And there's a picture of him sitting on the very, very top. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7939.78s)]
*  It's 3000 feet. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7942.14s)]
*  And his feet are just hanging off in a helicopter. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7943.26s)]
*  They circle. He was the first guy to do it. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7946.38s)]
*  Arnest or anything. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7948.1s)]
*  He's probably harnessed on his back somehow. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7949.3s)]
*  What is this for a mission? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7952.22s)]
*  Impossible one of the mission impossibles. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7953.18s)]
*  But yeah, that's my god. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7954.46s)]
*  But he actually is in space. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7955.78s)]
*  Oh, my God. Look how tall that is. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7958.22s)]
*  He's running. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7960.34s)]
*  He's a fucking maniac. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7962.78s)]
*  He is the fact that he's still doing these stunts and he's 62 years old. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7964.18s)]
*  Do you see what he did the last mission impossible? [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7967.42s)]
*  He jumped in a flaming parachute, ripped the parachute off [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7969.46s)]
*  and then opened up the second parachute. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7973.66s)]
*  Oh, and, you know, I mean, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7975.74s)]
*  there's no backup parachute for the second parachute. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7978.9800000000005s)]
*  He's doing this for a movie. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7981.9400000000005s)]
*  If I met I've never met Tom Cruise. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7983.74s)]
*  If I ever met him, all I want to ask him is, how do you get insurance companies [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7985.5s)]
*  to agree to let you do this? Right. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7988.780000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine he was running down the face of the town. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7992.02s)]
*  And some of it was shot in CJR, but that's legit. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7995.9800000000005s)]
*  Like that was real. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7998.1s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. Look at this. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=7999.3s)]
*  So he's he jumps out in a flaming parachute. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8000.780000000001s)]
*  And this is all planned out. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8005.38s)]
*  I mean, they doused the parachute with gasoline, jumps. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8007.860000000001s)]
*  They light it on fire. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8011.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. It's 16 times. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8013.740000000001s)]
*  16 times. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8015.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8018.700000000001s)]
*  So he has to cut it loose and then he has to open up his secondary parachute. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8019.900000000001s)]
*  Is there you wonder, is there a kill switch that it's like [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8024.54s)]
*  if you push a clamp and you can't get the clamp? [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8027.419999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's fucked. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8029.54s)]
*  Like if he can't cut loose, he's fucked. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8030.74s)]
*  And if his second parachute doesn't work, he's double fucked. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8033.94s)]
*  I heard him say sort of he figures out something crazy hasn't done [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8037.9s)]
*  and then just goes through all the processes of like, how do you learn how to do this? [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8041.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he learned how to fly helicopters for one of the stunts. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8044.139999999999s)]
*  Like one of the stunts where they're they're bombing through the canyons. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8046.74s)]
*  Yeah, he was actually flying the helicopter. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8049.94s)]
*  He wanted to make it really obvious that it was him. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8051.9s)]
*  Yes. Flying that helicopter. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8054.339999999999s)]
*  And the side of the I've seen him talk about like being on the side of the plane [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8055.98s)]
*  that took off when he was hanging off the plane. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8059.379999999999s)]
*  But you wonder like, what what is it in you that like what kind of a rush [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8062.099999999999s)]
*  when you're not working, what do you do to think about like fucking cowboy [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8065.94s)]
*  surrounding will fly a plane and then cut the engine in fall [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8068.98s)]
*  because he needs that these fucking crazy needs dopamine. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8071.74s)]
*  What do you do to match this in real life? [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8074.459999999999s)]
*  The new one, the new plane thing. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8077.259999999999s)]
*  He's done a couple of different plane ones. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8078.86s)]
*  This is just one of them. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8081.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you see the string there. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8083.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But they edit it all. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8084.419999999999s)]
*  In the movie, right? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8086.139999999999s)]
*  What if the string breaks? Yeah. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8087.299999999999s)]
*  What if the string breaks? That's right. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8088.66s)]
*  You can only have so much faith, right? [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8090.0199999999995s)]
*  Also, if he gets hit by a bird right here and gets KO'd. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8091.94s)]
*  Or falls back and bangs his head on the side of the. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8094.98s)]
*  This is a thing that's only for these Mission Impossible movies. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8096.86s)]
*  But by the way, he's been doing these Mission Impossible movies forever. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8099.9s)]
*  I was listening to an EPMD song the other day and in the things [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8103.9s)]
*  like Mission Impossible, not Tom Cruise. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8107.66s)]
*  Like there was joking around about Tom Cruise being in Mission [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8110.5s)]
*  Impossible in an EPMD song from like what year was that? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8114.78s)]
*  Oh, you know, I was in the rappers. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8118.9s)]
*  Ninety seven. Do I not know that was his first Mission Impossible movie. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8121.82s)]
*  I mean, that's when the lyric came out. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8126.46s)]
*  The song's called The Joint. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8127.66s)]
*  That's the word it's in, I guess. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8128.62s)]
*  Well, what year was the first Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movie? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8130.5s)]
*  Maybe even 96, 95 if they were writing about. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8134.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's wild. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8136.38s)]
*  That is wild. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8139.62s)]
*  So he's been basically doing Mission Impossible for 30 years. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8141.78s)]
*  He's 62 now. Yeah. Crazy. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8144.7s)]
*  But he doesn't do that in the other movies he does. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8147.66s)]
*  Some of them. Does he does he do crazy stunts in all of his movies? [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8150.3s)]
*  What about that? I mean, the one that lived, I repeat. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8153.0599999999995s)]
*  That's oh, yeah. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8155.5s)]
*  Was he doing stunts in those? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8156.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't know exactly how many of them he did, but he did the Jack. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8158.42s)]
*  Richard, too. I was trying to think of two. Yeah. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8162.46s)]
*  And he also broke his ankle. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8164.22s)]
*  He was jumping from one building to another and destroyed his ankle. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8165.78s)]
*  He destroyed. But he actually fucking limped and tried to finish the shot. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8168.94s)]
*  Like what a pro shot. Yeah. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8171.78s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8173.46s)]
*  You can see his ankle collapse when he hits the wall. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8174.3s)]
*  Yeah, he's a fucking nut man. Like a real nut. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8176.82s)]
*  It's like when you look, but you watch old Buster Keaton footage. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8179.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The crazy shit that he would do, the train or the building. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8181.54s)]
*  How many Mission Impossible movies are there? [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8185.26s)]
*  I think there's 11. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8187.42s)]
*  Is there 11? I thought it was like seven or eight. Seven. Yeah. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8190.1s)]
*  Seven. Yeah. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8193.1s)]
*  So it all started in 96. Is that what you said? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8194.46s)]
*  Jesus Christ, that guy's been in some fucking banger movie. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8199.18s)]
*  Scientology works for some people. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8202.06s)]
*  It's it's it's interesting that he wants to do all of his own stuff. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8203.619999999999s)]
*  The firm I just rewatched is fine. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8208.019999999999s)]
*  I hated the music in the firm so much it took me out of it. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8209.539999999999s)]
*  But that's a pretty that's a great film. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8212.18s)]
*  Gene Hackman was great. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8214.14s)]
*  What a shame he died. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8216.74s)]
*  Man, he's one guy I never met that I wanted to meet. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8217.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would have liked to have met him, too. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8219.939999999999s)]
*  I see. Fuck it. He died bad, though. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8221.779999999999s)]
*  He did. But he died kind of the way you want to die just alone and home. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8223.9s)]
*  And was died. His wife died first, they think. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8226.859999999999s)]
*  Yes, he had dementia, I think. Yeah. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8230.26s)]
*  So I don't even know if he knew she was dead. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8232.86s)]
*  They say he might have just been wandering. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8234.380000000001s)]
*  Maybe he just wandered around hungry. Oh, boy. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8235.54s)]
*  I know. Doesn't matter who you are. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8239.1s)]
*  Yeah. When when your body stops working, it doesn't matter [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8241.1s)]
*  how many fucking people love you. It's over. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8244.54s)]
*  Brando was like that. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8247.34s)]
*  Like I love because he was just so difficult. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8248.380000000001s)]
*  But you got to love a guy who's so good at something that people tolerated. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8251.98s)]
*  He was such a nut. He bought an island and moved there. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8255.14s)]
*  Just would never acknowledge being a good actor. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8257.580000000002s)]
*  Like I was interviewed with Connie Chung and she said, You're a great actor. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8260.18s)]
*  And his dog is there because he's a better actor. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8263.94s)]
*  He acts like he loves me because he wants food. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8265.820000000002s)]
*  I'm like, what a great fucking what a great what a good. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8267.660000000002s)]
*  But he meant it like you knew he wasn't like some fucking douchey poser. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8272.220000000001s)]
*  Like he was really this guy. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8275.62s)]
*  Well, that's why he was so good. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8277.26s)]
*  But he was also good before anybody was good. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8278.820000000002s)]
*  He was the first actor that was like acting like a real person. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8281.02s)]
*  Yes. In movies. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8284.26s)]
*  Whereas like every other actor was like, hey, stay away from my girl. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8285.74s)]
*  See, I can't watch old stuff. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8289.38s)]
*  And look, I'll acknowledge I stink. I know I stink. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8291.34s)]
*  So I can't judge other people's. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8294.02s)]
*  I'm not going to judge James Cagney or fucking. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8295.46s)]
*  Right. Cagney is a good example. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8297.18s)]
*  But you watch them and you're like they were so like Victor Mature. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8299.02s)]
*  Now, Tommy, why don't you cut it out, Tommy? Yeah. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8303.66s)]
*  And then you see Brando. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8306.699999999999s)]
*  I can't watch the old stuff. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8307.94s)]
*  It's just theater acting or something. Right. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8309.66s)]
*  Well, he was the first guy that figured out how to be real in a film. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8312.42s)]
*  And James Dean did it as well. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8317.42s)]
*  And then a bunch of other people. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8319.380000000001s)]
*  And now, you know, there's a lot of people that do it, but [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8320.7s)]
*  nobody had figured it out. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8323.58s)]
*  But again, it goes back to that thing where this was a completely new medium. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8324.58s)]
*  Right. Right. It didn't really exist before him. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8328.460000000001s)]
*  You know, he was like one of the very first [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8331.380000000001s)]
*  movie stars that figured out how to do it correctly. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8334.18s)]
*  But there were a lot of wasn't a long history of movie stars. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8336.26s)]
*  It was a fairly new thing. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8340.02s)]
*  Yes. And I've seen footage of his his screen test for Streetcar Named Desire. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8342.380000000001s)]
*  And like, you know, Stanley walks into the kitchen and he's just talking. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8347.1s)]
*  He's talking to Stella. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8350.18s)]
*  Oh, it might be Stella. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8351.18s)]
*  And he's just moving and grabbing stuff and you watching him. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8352.380000000001s)]
*  And you're like, I would never have the confidence [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8354.74s)]
*  in it to just touch and I want to see that behave. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8356.98s)]
*  Can you find that screen test from Streetcar Named Desire? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8360.9s)]
*  Is that it right there? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8364.7s)]
*  Hey, let's listen. Oh, yeah. Headphones. Yes. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8365.86s)]
*  And this is even different than what I was. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8370.02s)]
*  They don't want to think it was in the kitchen. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8383.380000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's part of the same one. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8388.300000000001s)]
*  Here is just put a cigarette out in a fucking bottle. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8390.26s)]
*  Now hold on. Go back to that. Yeah. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8392.300000000001s)]
*  Action. What? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8395.220000000001s)]
*  The plaster crack. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8397.900000000001s)]
*  All right, you have to cut out the cat in there. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8399.54s)]
*  You can't hear. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8402.42s)]
*  Well, you can hear me. I told you to hush up. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8403.54s)]
*  Cut it printed. That's all. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8409.58s)]
*  I want. Oh, so this is actually real footage, though. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8411.34s)]
*  Yeah, and this is different than the one, but it's interesting to see. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8414.86s)]
*  These are outtakes. Yeah. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8417.300000000001s)]
*  Oh, I. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8419.62s)]
*  You can hear the camera. Yeah. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8427.86s)]
*  But even the way she's looking at him looks old school [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8446.26s)]
*  compared to what he's doing. Right. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8448.58s)]
*  She's looking at him in a very strange way that doesn't feel like. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8452.060000000001s)]
*  Right. Doesn't feel real. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8456.02s)]
*  It feels like she knows she's in a movie. Yeah. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8457.980000000001s)]
*  Good looking guy back. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8460.82s)]
*  Oh, it was a fucking put a pussy machine. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8462.060000000001s)]
*  He fucked them all, too. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8464.66s)]
*  And then he just he didn't like the fact that he's good looking. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8465.74s)]
*  So he became a blimp. Just ate ice cream. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8468.18s)]
*  I do not love that guy. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8470.42s)]
*  He got so big during Apocalypse Now that they had a film in the shadows. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8472.220000000001s)]
*  And he wouldn't acknowledge that because they were trying to make it [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8476.140000000001s)]
*  like Kurtz had gotten fat and like was living the life of. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8478.1s)]
*  And he wouldn't do it. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8481.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Just sat there in the shadows. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8482.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. What a fucking nut. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8484.26s)]
*  But, you know, again, it's just there wasn't a lot of people like that. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8486.34s)]
*  He would mean, how do you not go crazy? [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8490.9s)]
*  He's the only guy and I can't watch Shakespeare. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8495.18s)]
*  I mean, I know he was the great. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8497.460000000001s)]
*  I just can't watch him. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8498.74s)]
*  And I watched him doing I think he played Mark Anthony or Julius Caesar. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8499.82s)]
*  And watching him do Shakespeare, it like you felt like he's really saying [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8504.14s)]
*  he's like, you know, I mean, it always feels so British, you know, [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8507.74s)]
*  what's hard for Wendell Blake? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8510.9s)]
*  It just doesn't feel connected to the person. Right. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8512.26s)]
*  And I watched him. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8514.5s)]
*  I'm like, this is like a real guy actually saying this. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8515.259999999998s)]
*  So he's the only person I've ever been to watch do Shakespeare. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8517.859999999999s)]
*  It is an art. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8520.38s)]
*  There's a real art to acting. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8521.419999999998s)]
*  It's just done badly so often that we hate most actors. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8523.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And it's hard to do. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8526.58s)]
*  And I again, I there's very few things I give my credit self credit for, [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8527.9s)]
*  but I do get myself credit for recognizing my limitations in that area. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8531.46s)]
*  It's been easy to recognize and people pointed it out. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8535.939999999999s)]
*  But I understand it. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8538.099999999999s)]
*  It's also not an area that you really concentrated on, [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8539.06s)]
*  nor were you drawn to it. You know, right. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8541.38s)]
*  So when you're doing it, you're like, how am I doing this? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8544.06s)]
*  It's like if you get Tom Hanks to do stand up [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8546.26s)]
*  and when he did punch line, it was fucking terrible. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8549.26s)]
*  It was why? Because he wasn't really doing stand up. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8551.38s)]
*  You know, he's an actor. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8554.5s)]
*  But if you wanted to be an actor, if that was your thing, [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8556.019999999999s)]
*  you'd probably be great at it. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8559.019999999999s)]
*  Do you know who I saw that was shooting some of the Will Arnett [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8560.18s)]
*  name Bradley Cooper just directed a movie at the Comedy Cellar. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8564.019999999999s)]
*  Is that him? Yeah. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8566.98s)]
*  Shakespeare 29 years old here. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8567.779999999999s)]
*  Twenty nine. Twenty nine and fifty three. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8569.699999999999s)]
*  The noble Brutus has told you Caesar was ambitious. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8572.66s)]
*  If it was so, it was a grievous fault [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8576.98s)]
*  and grievously have Caesar answered it. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8580.26s)]
*  Here on the leave of Brutus and the rest, Brutus is an honorable man. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8583.98s)]
*  So are they all honorable men. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8588.619999999999s)]
*  Come, I to speak in Caesar's funeral. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8591.66s)]
*  He was my friend, faithful and just to me. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8595.46s)]
*  But Brutus says he was ambitious. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8599.38s)]
*  And Brutus is an honorable man. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8602.22s)]
*  He has brought many captives on the road, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8606.06s)]
*  whose ransoms did the general coffers filled to distance either seem ambitious. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8608.1s)]
*  When did the poor have cried Caesar had wept? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8614.14s)]
*  Ambition should be made of Stannis stuff. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8617.86s)]
*  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8621.98s)]
*  And Brutus is an honorable man. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8625.18s)]
*  You all did see that on the loop of Cali, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8626.94s)]
*  Rice presented him a kingly crown, which he did. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8628.94s)]
*  Rice refused. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8632.34s)]
*  Was this ambition? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8634.54s)]
*  Yet Brutus said he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8637.74s)]
*  I still don't know what the fuck he's talking about. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8641.94s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know either, but I believe him. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8643.54s)]
*  It's powerful. Yeah, he's locked in. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8644.74s)]
*  He's locked in, man. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8646.54s)]
*  And he's really he understands what he's saying. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8647.74s)]
*  Yeah. He understands the words. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8650.34s)]
*  He's right. I've done living the words. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8652.140000000001s)]
*  Yes. In his head. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8653.94s)]
*  He believes it when he's saying it. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8655.14s)]
*  And that's that's like the Daniel Day-Lewis thing. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8656.34s)]
*  Yes. When he's playing that crazy guy and there will be blood. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8658.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, he believes it. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8660.939999999999s)]
*  I drank your milk. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8662.74s)]
*  It's real. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8665.539999999999s)]
*  Well, when he's in, he's locked in. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8666.539999999999s)]
*  Craziest part of that movie is when he's sitting there with the kid [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8668.14s)]
*  and he's petting the boy's head at one point, it's supposed to be his son. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8670.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm like, as an actor to touch a kid, like even though you're acting, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8675.14s)]
*  he was petting this boy like the way you would pet a kid. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8679.34s)]
*  Petting this boy like the way you would pet your son. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8682.74s)]
*  Like it was like he's so comfortable and so in this that you really believe this is his son. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8685.74s)]
*  It was like, oh, that was that stuck out for me. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8691.34s)]
*  Like the level of comfort you need on a set to do that. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8692.94s)]
*  I've been on a set with a kid there. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8696.539999999999s)]
*  Everybody's like, make sure you don't curse. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8697.94s)]
*  And this guy didn't give a fuck. He just picks the kid up and starts petting his head. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8699.94s)]
*  Boy, he's got to be that guy. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8702.94s)]
*  And, you know, he would be he's a method guy. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8704.74s)]
*  So to be that guy for months. Have you met him? [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8706.74s)]
*  No, no, I haven't either. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8708.94s)]
*  Gary Oldman, I like a lot, which is not exactly a stretch. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8710.34s)]
*  Gary Oldman, I think, is one of the most versatile. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8713.14s)]
*  Have you seen Slow Horses? No. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8717.34s)]
*  It's an Apple show. It's really good. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8719.54s)]
*  What is a spy show? He plays a spy. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8721.74s)]
*  Oldman or Daniel Dillis? Oldman. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8724.34s)]
*  It's a new show. Oh, no. It's really good. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8726.74s)]
*  I haven't watched anything on Apple. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8728.74s)]
*  Like I tried to watch the morning show, but I didn't love it. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8730.14s)]
*  Do you see Severance? Severance is great. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8733.74s)]
*  Season one. I loved. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8736.14s)]
*  Yeah, season two got a little weird. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8738.54s)]
*  It got it almost got a little weird, like the way Lost did, [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8739.94s)]
*  where they were doing things to serve the kind of show that they were. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8743.140000000001s)]
*  Right. But I didn't. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8746.140000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what does this mean? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8747.34s)]
*  Like this is just crazy and weird, but they're just doing it like to be. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8748.54s)]
*  Again, I watch it and I probably will watch season three. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8753.140000000001s)]
*  But season one, I liked more. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8757.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, season one was better. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8758.54s)]
*  I think there's some shows like that where the concept is so out there. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8759.94s)]
*  It really has like a finite amount of time where you're allowed to like maintain that. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8764.140000000001s)]
*  Yes. And then it just becomes we have to get to season again. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8768.54s)]
*  Like Lost. Yeah. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8772.54s)]
*  Lost is the best example because first season it was fucking great. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8773.740000000002s)]
*  It was. And the back storytelling. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8776.740000000002s)]
*  I look at the writing in that. And again, it was TV. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8778.740000000002s)]

*  Is he a purple belt or is he a blue belt? [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8839.34s)]

*  And by the way, he wore a mask up until the time he's about to compete. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8887.54s)]
*  So they don't know they're going to compete with Zuckerberg [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8891.54s)]
*  until he's in there with them, which is really a mindfuck. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8893.34s)]

*  My right one was a cadaver. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8952.84s)]

*  And I told him, I'm like, dude, get the cadaver. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8957.34s)]
*  Trust me. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8958.94s)]

*  He wanted up doing that. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8961.94s)]
*  It's a long rehab with the patellar tendon. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8962.94s)]
*  But the fact that he blew his knee apart [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=8966.34s)]

*  It can actually make inflammation. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9048.54s)]
*  Like my friend Cam Haynes, [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9050.04s)]
*  he was taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen every day. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9051.740000000002s)]
*  And I talked to him about it. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9055.14s)]
*  I go, what? You're doing what? [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9056.539999999999s)]
*  And then I sent him some stuff that Ron DePatrick had put out about it. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9058.14s)]
*  I'm like, dude, get off of that. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9061.539999999999s)]
*  He got off of it. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9063.64s)]
*  All his pain went away. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9064.539999999999s)]
*  The inflammation was being caused by the fact that he was taking so much ibuprofen. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9066.039999999999s)]
*  It was ruining his gut biome. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9071.24s)]
*  So it was creating inflammation. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9073.14s)]
*  So to combat that inflammation, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9074.84s)]
*  he was taking ibuprofen. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9076.64s)]
*  And he thought the only way he was going to be able to run the miles that he was running [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9078.039999999999s)]
*  was to constantly chew on ibuprofen. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9080.74s)]
*  So he got off of it entirely. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9082.64s)]
*  All the pain went away. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9084.14s)]
*  Totally counterintuitive. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9085.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9086.74s)]
*  I've only been on these. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9087.34s)]
*  He said one week is all. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9088.34s)]
*  He goes, I don't want you to take them for a week. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9089.34s)]
*  What is it? What are you doing? [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9090.939999999999s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9091.34s)]
*  But he goes, I just want to see if it... [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9092.34s)]
*  He's trying to see like how severe the injuries. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9093.539999999999s)]
*  I want to see if this does help at all. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9095.439999999999s)]
*  But he goes, take them for... [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9097.34s)]
*  He gave them to me for a month because don't take them for more than a week. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9098.039999999999s)]
*  So I like the fact that he's showing restraint. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9100.34s)]
*  He's like... [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9102.539999999999s)]
*  Well, the thing is doctors have a limited amount of tools. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9102.74s)]
*  If you want to prescribe medication to somebody, [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9106.34s)]
*  you know, whatever the... [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9110.64s)]
*  You know, whatever the common practice is, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9112.94s)]
*  is what that doctor has to adhere to. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9116.24s)]
*  They can't step out of line. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9118.24s)]
*  And the reality is a lot of that stuff has side effects. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9120.34s)]
*  But there's natural ways that you could deal with inflammation [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9124.04s)]
*  like curcumin, turmeric. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9126.74s)]
*  There's a lot of different, you know, that stuff. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9128.74s)]
*  That helps a lot. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9130.84s)]
*  That's legit. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9132.04s)]
*  And it's not bad for you. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9132.84s)]
*  But a lot of inflammation comes from diet. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9134.640000000001s)]
*  A lot of it. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9138.140000000001s)]
*  A big factor. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9138.84s)]
*  Like I remember I talked to this lady who is a physical therapist [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9139.84s)]
*  and I had a neck issue and she was like, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9142.84s)]
*  you'd kind of be amazed if you cut out all the inflammatory foods [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9145.24s)]
*  in your diet, how much it would affect it. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9148.64s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9150.14s)]
*  She's like, yeah, I mean, you probably do have a neck injury, [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9151.14s)]
*  but I guarantee it's exacerbated by the foods you're eating. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9153.74s)]
*  She said, cut out bread, cut out sugar and see if it has an effect. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9156.84s)]
*  You know, I've tried to because I've fattened up and I know it. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9160.84s)]
*  Like I put weight on and again, for me, it was a dopamine thing. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9163.14s)]
*  I'm not doing the things I used to do. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9166.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9168.14s)]
*  So you need something to do that's just like, give me a sandwich. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9168.44s)]
*  Something. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9171.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9172.24s)]
*  I know what I'm going to do on the road. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9172.64s)]
*  I'll have a pretzel. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9173.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9174.84s)]
*  That's what my bane of my existence is, a fucking pretzel. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9175.439999999999s)]
*  Like it really is. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9177.439999999999s)]
*  It's not like I'm eating pizza. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9178.039999999999s)]
*  I'm not eating cake. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9179.039999999999s)]
*  All that shit is terrible. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9180.039999999999s)]
*  Sourdough pretzels. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9182.439999999999s)]
*  All that shit. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9183.64s)]
*  So our bread is fucked and our bread is so fucked. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9184.84s)]
*  If you go and I'm sure you've been overseas, you go eat bread in Italy. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9188.74s)]
*  You don't feel bad at all. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9192.74s)]
*  No, you know, it's not as bad. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9193.74s)]
*  We're fucking poisoned. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9195.14s)]
*  Also, I'll play this thing because Brian Simpson sent me this and it's very good. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9196.34s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9201.140000000001s)]
*  Here, let me see. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9202.240000000002s)]
*  Show you right here. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9203.140000000001s)]
*  But it's all about bread. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9204.84s)]
*  Brian Simpson sent me this and he's like, I think I'm done with bread. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9205.94s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, like this is kind of crazy. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9208.84s)]
*  Do I need my glasses? [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9213.34s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9214.44s)]
*  I'll put it up on the screen. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9215.04s)]
*  I'm going to find it though because he sent it to me. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9216.240000000002s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9218.240000000002s)]
*  Copy. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9220.44s)]
*  Send it to Jamie. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9221.240000000002s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9228.140000000001s)]
*  It won't matter if this World War 3, but if there's not World War 3, probably stay away [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9231.240000000002s)]
*  from bread. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9235.94s)]
*  American bread. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9236.740000000002s)]
*  You mean eat sourdough bread. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9237.640000000001s)]
*  Sourdough bread is fucking great for you. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9238.94s)]
*  But play this from the beginning so we could. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9240.34s)]
*  This guy's going to explain what's wrong with American bread. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9243.44s)]
*  And to me why I can eat bread in Spain and in Greece, Italy. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9246.44s)]
*  No problem. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9253.84s)]
*  Why I was gluten free in 15 years. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9255.24s)]
*  I've been gluten free in America. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9258.039999999999s)]
*  Can't eat it. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9264.74s)]
*  That's because in America, what we call bread can't even be considered food in parts of [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9265.44s)]
*  Europe. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9269.64s)]
*  See here in America, it's not so much the gluten as what we've done to the grain. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9270.34s)]
*  About 200 years ago, we started stripping the bran and germ or the fiber and nutrients [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9273.64s)]
*  to make flour shelf stable, also nutritionally dead. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9277.64s)]
*  Because the nutrients were gone, we enriched it with folic acid, which a large majority [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9280.539999999999s)]
*  of the population can't even metabolize. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9284.64s)]
*  Therefore, many people experience fatigue, anxiety, hyperactivity and inflammation. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9285.94s)]
*  But then the bread wasn't white enough. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9290.14s)]
*  So they bleached it with chlorine gas and the bread didn't rise enough. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9291.34s)]
*  So they added a carcinogen called potassium bromate, which has been in several countries [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9293.74s)]
*  like Europe, the UK and even China. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9297.44s)]
*  Then we wanted to ramp up production. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9299.74s)]
*  So we started using glyphosate to dry out the wheat before harvest causing endocrine [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9301.14s)]
*  disruption and damaging your gut. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9304.64s)]
*  So now you're bloated brain fog, tired and blame gluten. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9306.34s)]
*  But gluten is just the scapegoat. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9308.94s)]
*  The real issue is ultra processed, chemically altered, bleached, bromated, fake vitamin [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9310.84s)]
*  filled wheat soaked in glyphosate. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9314.24s)]
*  This isn't bread. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9316.24s)]

*  He's just not annoying. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9352.54s)]
*  He's not annoying. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9353.54s)]
*  Yeah, he's just giving it to you. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9354.54s)]
*  Perfect delivery. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9356.04s)]
*  But that should be something that everybody should see when I know that when I cut that [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9357.04s)]
*  stuff out of my diet, it makes a giant difference. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9360.640000000001s)]
*  Also I should say Joe DeRosa, who has this amazing sub shop in New York and he's going [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9363.640000000001s)]
*  to open up one out here in Austin. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9368.720000000001s)]
*  Joey Roses, fantastic sub shop. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9371.34s)]
*  Their wheat is all from Italy. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9374.18s)]
*  It's all like natural wheat. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9377.640000000001s)]
*  And so their bread doesn't fuck with you and they make it fresh every day and they throw [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9380.34s)]
*  it out at the end of the day. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9385.34s)]
*  You never have day old bread. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9386.86s)]
*  It's always fresh and they bake it there. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9388.380000000001s)]
*  So it's like when he's getting bread for his sandwiches, it's the kind of bread that you [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9390.9s)]
*  get in Europe. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9394.9s)]
*  Do you know, I think I have to think you're right because there was one time we had DeRosa [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9395.9s)]
*  on the show. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9399.52s)]
*  It was the morning show and he didn't bring us any sandwiches. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9400.52s)]
*  I'm like, where's the fucking sandwiches, Joe? [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9402.4s)]
*  How about a sandwich? [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9404.439999999999s)]
*  He couldn't. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9405.439999999999s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9406.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9407.439999999999s)]
*  And I was like, fuck him because then he did chip and he brought in sandwiches, but we [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9408.439999999999s)]
*  taped in the afternoon. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9410.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9411.16s)]
*  And I'm like, he was telling the truth. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9412.16s)]
*  DeRosa was telling the truth about his bread. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9413.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9415.199999999999s)]
*  When they had a pop up out here at South by Southwest and he brought over sandwiches, they [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9416.199999999999s)]
*  were fantastic. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9420.68s)]
*  They are very good. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9421.68s)]
*  Unbelievably good. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9422.68s)]
*  That is my number one. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9423.68s)]
*  If I have a vice, it is Italian food. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9425.84s)]
*  My big vice is Italian sandwiches, Italian subs, pasta, lasagna. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9428.66s)]
*  That stuff gets me. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9435.3s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9436.3s)]
*  But you have to get it from a place that's using heirloom wheat. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9437.539999999999s)]
*  And you can find places. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9442.26s)]
*  There's a lot of great restaurants in New York, there's great restaurants in LA that [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9443.26s)]
*  use heirloom wheat and you'll eat their pasta and you don't feel bad. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9446.779999999999s)]
*  Most of the bread that you're getting in America is like what that guy described. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9450.86s)]
*  That's why you feel like shit when you eat it. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9455.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9456.98s)]
*  Most of the time, especially like just always tired. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9458.64s)]
*  I finally got, whatever, it's the apnea. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9461.76s)]
*  It's a fucking, you know, an old man complaining. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9463.76s)]
*  I just can't breathe when I sleep. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9465.56s)]
*  It sucks. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9467.92s)]
*  Have you tried a carnivore diet? [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9468.92s)]
*  You ever try that? [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9470.119999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9471.4s)]
*  And I know that my fear of eating too much meat is probably unfounded. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9472.4s)]
*  But no, I've done Whole30, which actually I shed weight. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9478.76s)]
*  What's your fear? [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9481.64s)]
*  What's the fear of eating too much meat? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9482.64s)]
*  Does cancer feed on meat? [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9485.119999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9486.84s)]
*  No, cancer feeds on sugar. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9488.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9490.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9491.18s)]
*  That's the really, the number one thing that cancer oncologists will tell you, if they're [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9492.18s)]
*  trying to adjust your diet, some don't and it's very infuriating. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9496.98s)]
*  I've had family members that have cancer and their doctor tells them you're going to go [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9500.3s)]
*  through chemotherapy, eat whatever you want. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9503.54s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, don't eat whatever you want. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9505.3s)]
*  Part of what is wrong with you is your diet. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9507.86s)]
*  It's a giant part of your overall metabolic health. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9511.460000000001s)]
*  A lot of oncologists now will try to get people on a ketogenic diet because it gets your body [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9515.2s)]
*  to burn fat instead of burning sugar and then it starves the cancer. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9519.84s)]
*  They're also, they'll try to get you to do some fasting, like intermittent fasting, like [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9524.800000000001s)]
*  have a window feeding where you fast for 16 hours and then eat for eight or you can only [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9532.02s)]
*  eat during eight. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9538.24s)]
*  The keto diet, I never did it, but this is what a delusional idiot I am. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9539.24s)]
*  When I was in Montreal during the pandemic, I joined Costco and I would go and eat keto [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9543.42s)]
*  chocolates and I somehow convinced myself that I was like, oh, it's keto, but I wasn't [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9548.1s)]
*  doing the rest of the fucking diet. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9552.26s)]
*  But they have some actually good shit you can eat if you're on the keto diet. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9553.539999999999s)]
*  I guess you're doing it right. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9556.58s)]
*  But I would go there and buy all these delicious keto chocolate clusters. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9557.9s)]
*  So yeah, that one, I heard it gives you bad breath keto. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9562.1s)]
*  That was what I've heard. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9564.94s)]
*  Again, I just, I don't remember where I heard it, but they were like, there's something [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9565.94s)]
*  about ketosis, fucks your breath up. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9568.98s)]
*  I bet it does. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9570.98s)]
*  Yeah, I bet it does. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9571.98s)]
*  But just brush your fucking teeth and have a mint. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9573.56s)]
*  Well, is it coming from the gut though? [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9576.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it probably is. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9577.64s)]
*  It's probably ketones. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9578.64s)]
*  Ketones smell terrible. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9579.64s)]
*  Have you ever taken exogenous ketones? [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9580.64s)]
*  I've never even, I've heard of ketones. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9583.64s)]
*  What's an exogenous ketone? [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9585.32s)]
*  You can take exogenous ketones. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9586.64s)]
*  It's ketones that you drink and it puts your body into an instant state of ketosis where [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9588.08s)]
*  your body instantly starts to burn fat and actually is really good mentally. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9592.24s)]
*  I take exogenous ketones sometimes when I have to perform or I have to do something. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9596.88s)]
*  I've taken them before UFCs too. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9601.82s)]
*  UFCs are like the big mind fuck for me because it's six hours of thinking and I have to think [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9603.38s)]
*  about previous fights. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9609.539999999999s)]
*  I have to like predict techniques. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9611.22s)]
*  I have to see what's going on. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9613.66s)]
*  And then when it goes to the ground, it's kind of like my job is to explain particular [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9615.34s)]
*  submissions when it goes to the ground, especially in the early days before I did it with DC [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9619.859999999999s)]
*  because I was the only, like when it was me and Goldberg, Goldberg's not really a martial [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9624.34s)]
*  artist. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9628.46s)]
*  So it was just me. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9629.46s)]
*  So I would have to go like explain why someone's in trouble and what's going to happen to someone [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9630.46s)]
*  who doesn't understand like a triangle or something like that when someone goes to the [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9635.08s)]
*  ground. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9639.8s)]
*  And you need brain fuel. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9640.8s)]
*  And so ketones help a lot. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9642.64s)]
*  Another thing is like I eat these gum. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9645.039999999999s)]
*  These are gummies now, alpha brain gummies, but I always take some type of nootropic neuro [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9646.779999999999s)]
*  gum or this neuro gum has mints too. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9651.96s)]
*  I'll take these mints. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9655.039999999999s)]
*  Like if you see me at the UFC, I'll have those. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9656.039999999999s)]
*  I take these little nicotine pouches. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9658.24s)]
*  What are they called? [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9661.3s)]
*  Anything pins? [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9663.539999999999s)]
*  What are they called? [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9664.539999999999s)]
*  There's a word for those little nicotine pouches. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9666.58s)]
*  Zin, that's what I'm thinking of. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9668.58s)]
*  These are different. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9670.82s)]
*  These are from a company called Lucy. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9671.82s)]
*  These are called breakers. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9673.36s)]
*  Are those, do those have THC in them? [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9674.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, it's just nicotine. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9676.58s)]
*  This is all just nicotine. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9677.58s)]
*  I mean those, the gummies. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9678.58s)]
*  No, no, no, the gummies are just nootropics. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9679.58s)]
*  Nootropics are like theanine. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9684.26s)]
*  There's like a little bit of caffeine in these. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9686.6s)]
*  And they, like one of the things we did with Onnit, we made this thing called alpha brain, [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9688.6s)]
*  which was, there's a bunch of different nootropics out there and a bunch of like acetylcholine, [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9696.28s)]
*  a bunch of different things that have shown to have an effect on your memory. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9703.6s)]
*  And so we put together a group of these that would all work synergistically. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9707.16s)]
*  And then we did two double-blind placebo-controlled trials at Boston Center for Memory. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9712.88s)]
*  And it showed efficacy. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9718.519999999999s)]
*  It showed that it helped increase verbal memory, which is like your ability to form sentences [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9720.099999999999s)]
*  and recall the correct words to use, reaction time, alpha state. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9725.42s)]
*  So it's like, it does work. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9730.939999999999s)]
*  And it's not just Onnit because I'm connected to it. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9732.46s)]
*  Like I have no connection at all to neuro gum or neuro mints. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9734.699999999999s)]
*  But it works and I tell people about it. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9739.06s)]
*  There's another company called True Brain that's really good. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9740.92s)]
*  There's another company called Neuro One that was the first one that I ever tried. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9743.76s)]
*  That's Bill Romanowski, the football player. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9748.48s)]
*  He developed that because he was having memory problems after getting fucking hit in the [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9750.52s)]
*  head for all those years playing football. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9753.66s)]
*  Didn't I, as far as I've ever gone, what was that pill you were taking? [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9756.24s)]
*  It's not echinacea. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9759.039999999999s)]
*  There was one pill you were taking that was supposed to be good for memory. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9760.039999999999s)]
*  It was like one of those things you get on the fucking shelf on the vitamin store. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9762.52s)]
*  And I don't remember what it was, but I used to take that, but I didn't see any. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9766.32s)]
*  No, me. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9771.18s)]
*  I see it's a collective you. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9772.18s)]
*  It's people would take. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9773.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9774.18s)]
*  But there's a bunch of those things. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9775.18s)]
*  They're real. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9776.42s)]
*  Like Neutropix, it's a real thing. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9777.42s)]
*  A lot of people call it snake oil and I understand. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9779.34s)]
*  I understand that you'd be very suspicious. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9781.86s)]
*  But there's the reality. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9784.34s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why, you know, like I have a connection obviously to Onnit. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9785.86s)]
*  We founded the company together. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9789.62s)]
*  But I don't have any connection to Neuro Brain or Neuro One. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9790.9s)]
*  Take them. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9794.54s)]
*  They work. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9795.54s)]
*  There's real, legitimate solutions that help your brain function. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9796.54s)]
*  And they don't seem to carry any side effects. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9799.48s)]
*  Some people, they take high doses of some of them, get headaches. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9802.08s)]
*  I think that's probably just like some people react very badly to caffeine. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9807.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9811.439999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like everybody has their own different biological stuff. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9812.439999999999s)]
*  But try it. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9815.32s)]
*  And the gum is a great one. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9816.859999999999s)]
*  Neuro gum is great because it's a delicious gum. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9818.359999999999s)]
*  It tastes good. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9821.08s)]
*  And it really works, man. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9822.24s)]
*  I take it all the time. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9823.519999999999s)]
*  It helps your brain. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9824.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9825.519999999999s)]
*  I take it before I go on stage. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9826.519999999999s)]
*  I chew neuro gum before I go on stage. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9827.519999999999s)]
*  That's very legit. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9829.38s)]
*  Do you know what I wanted to take? [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9830.38s)]
*  Jamie's got a big bag of it right there. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9831.38s)]
*  And again, we're not connected to them. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9833.1s)]
*  This is just stuff that works. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9834.86s)]
*  I wanted to take because flying became such a, again, a fear for me again. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9837.82s)]
*  In this phase of my life, I don't fucking need that. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9842.66s)]
*  So I talked to Whitney and she talked about beta blockers. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9844.74s)]
*  I didn't take them. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9847.1s)]
*  But do they help at all to like, but I have a low heartbeat anyway, so I don't know if [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9848.34s)]
*  it's going to fuck me up to take a beta blocker. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9853.26s)]
*  But beta blockers stop you from getting anxious. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9855.460000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9858.24s)]
*  They stop adrenaline. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9859.24s)]
*  They still have a lot of people, they get busted using them and like archery competitions, [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9860.24s)]
*  they ban them. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9865.199999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9866.199999999999s)]
*  Because you know, like you're like in the Olympics and you're just trying to hit that [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9867.199999999999s)]
*  bullseye every time. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9869.24s)]
*  Like any kind of nerves or jitters is going to fuck with you. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9870.56s)]
*  But you know, the problem is it's going to be something that you get addicted to or you [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9874.56s)]
*  maybe not even physically addicted, but you, you know, you become dependent. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9881.279999999999s)]
*  That's what I don't want. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9885.48s)]
*  They said they weren't, but I for flying, it's something I like. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9886.9s)]
*  I literally have to fight to do. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9889.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9891.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm getting a little bit better, but I look like anxiety. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9892.14s)]
*  Dude, I'm a fucking I'm a grownup. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9894.58s)]
*  I have to sit by the window and look at the wing and I'm really hateable on a plane fucking [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9896.66s)]
*  six in the morning, but it's trying to sleep and I get my fucking fat face pressed up against [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9900.859999999999s)]
*  the window staring at him. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9904.34s)]
*  So I'm trying to get out of there. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9908.5s)]
*  Well, there's there are things, you know, it's another thing that's really good for [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9910.42s)]
*  your cognitive function that a lot of people aren't aware of is creatine and creatine is [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9913.52s)]
*  really good, particularly if you are sleep deprived. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9918.28s)]
*  Like there's a study that they did that showed that if you take, I think it's 20 milligrams [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9922.56s)]
*  of creatine, it has a really positive effect on your ability to maintain normal cognitive [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9927.04s)]
*  function while you're sleep deprived. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9935.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9936.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9937.96s)]
*  I've heard of it. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9938.96s)]
*  It's also very good for women. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9939.96s)]
*  It's a very good supplement for women to take for some strange reason. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9940.96s)]
*  But it's you know, it's a muscle building supplement. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9945.66s)]
*  It's like really good for helping you gain muscle mass and strength. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9948.46s)]
*  If you were weight training, that was what it was initially used for. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9954.46s)]
*  But now they're realizing there's a lot of cognitive benefits as well. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9957.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't take any of that stuff. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9960.699999999999s)]
*  I probably should. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9962.099999999999s)]
*  I take creatine every day. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9963.099999999999s)]
*  I take nothing other than just like my little thing for my heart. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9964.099999999999s)]
*  You don't take vitamins? [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9967.5s)]
*  No. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9969.06s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9970.16s)]
*  I know I probably should. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9971.16s)]
*  I take everything. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9972.16s)]
*  I take B. I do take B and I take one other one. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9973.16s)]
*  You should take D for sure. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9975.359999999999s)]
*  You live in New York City. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9976.9s)]
*  You know, you're probably not getting enough sun. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9978.48s)]
*  No, definitely. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9980.16s)]
*  Yeah, D is huge because D is a hormone. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9981.16s)]
*  D is actually a hormone and it's a hormone that your body produces when you get into [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9983.519999999999s)]
*  the sun. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9988.64s)]
*  The best way to get vitamin D for sure is to be in the sun. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9989.64s)]
*  But if you're not in the sun enough, one of my friends who's a doctor was in New York [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9992.779999999999s)]
*  City when he was doing his residency and he said they would do tests on people in New [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=9997.68s)]
*  York City and they found that they had undetectable levels of vitamin D in the winter. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10002.6s)]
*  And he was like, you know, this has a huge effect on your immune system. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10007.36s)]
*  This is the reason why people get like everyone's, oh, it's flu season. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10011.119999999999s)]
*  No, it's lack of vitamin D season is what it is. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10014.76s)]
*  The flu doesn't thrive in the winter. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10018.08s)]
*  The flu exists in the winter because people have a low immune system in the winter and [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10020.48s)]
*  then they start catching it and giving it to other people. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10023.8s)]
*  But it's really a function of your immune system not working properly. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10026.12s)]
*  So you need D and you should take D with K2, vitamin K2 and magnesium. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10029.060000000001s)]
*  They all work synergistically together. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10036.62s)]
*  I'll remember it like, Harlan, I will text you and ask you the same question. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10038.380000000001s)]

*  I had a conversation with some Klan. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10294.14s)]
*  When you were a kid? [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10296.14s)]
*  I was 14 years old, 15 years old. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10297.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10299.14s)]
*  I remember calling for information. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10300.14s)]
*  Good for him for doing that. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10301.14s)]
*  Yeah, for getting out. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10304.14s)]
*  Getting out and talking to you about that on the phone. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10306.38s)]
*  He didn't have to talk to you about that. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10309.14s)]
*  He could have just hung up. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10310.539999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised because many people did. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10311.539999999999s)]
*  I'll fix the world on the phone. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10315.279999999999s)]
*  Thank God I did that fucking Twitter. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10316.279999999999s)]
*  Do you know who Daryl Davis is? [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10318.279999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10319.279999999999s)]
*  Daryl Davis is a guy who's been on the podcast a couple times. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10320.279999999999s)]
*  And he's a blues musician. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10322.279999999999s)]
*  Is he black? [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10324.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10325.279999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10326.279999999999s)]
*  And he's the guy that would convert the Klan members. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10327.279999999999s)]
*  I know who he is. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10329.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10330.279999999999s)]
*  And he gets their costumes. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10331.279999999999s)]
*  They give him their wizard costumes at the end. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10332.279999999999s)]
*  He's just, because he's probably a guy who's not, [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10334.279999999999s)]
*  and I have seen stuff by him, he probably is just a good guy. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10336.279999999999s)]
*  And it's hard to dismiss him because he's not force feeding you. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10340.279999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10344.28s)]
*  It's hard to dismiss anybody when you're just, [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10345.28s)]
*  no one wants to be messaged at. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10348.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10350.26s)]
*  In stand up I can't even do it. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10351.26s)]
*  My job is not to convert people. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10353.26s)]
*  I want you to know what my life is. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10355.26s)]
*  I hope you have some respect for it. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10357.26s)]
*  I'm just living the way I want to live. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10359.26s)]
*  And I'm not out to tell other people they have to feel this way. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10361.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10364.26s)]
*  Because no one wants to be messaged at. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10365.26s)]
*  Nobody. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10367.26s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10368.26s)]
*  It's not effective. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10369.26s)]
*  If it was effective I'd probably do it. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10370.26s)]
*  What's effective is what Daryl does. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10372.26s)]
*  I'm like, this is a good man. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10373.26s)]
*  I must be wrong if I think that all black people are evil. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10374.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10377.26s)]
*  Those guys become a good friend. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10378.26s)]
*  You have them over for dinner. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10380.26s)]
*  And then the guy's like, I'm telling you right now I'm getting out of the clan because of you. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10381.26s)]
*  And he did it to like 200 different people on a one on one basis. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10384.26s)]
*  Where he gets to know them. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10388.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10389.26s)]
*  And getting beyond, it's like we talked about before, [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10390.26s)]
*  like anytime somebody is an asshole publicly, [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10392.26s)]
*  but when you meet them and you realize, oh there's a person here. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10394.26s)]
*  It's the way people are supposed to communicate. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10397.26s)]
*  And this is what I think is so terrible about social media. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10399.26s)]
*  Too many people are just become so accustomed to barking at people. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10402.26s)]
*  Just barking out into the abyss. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10405.26s)]
*  Yeah. I have to stop myself from doing it. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10407.26s)]
*  There's been times people have tweeted something and I want to make like a cunty remark. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10409.26s)]
*  And I'm like, shut up dummy. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10412.26s)]
*  They're not talking to you. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10413.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10414.26s)]
*  Mind your fucking business. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10415.26s)]
*  I really do say that to myself. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10416.26s)]
*  Mind your business you fucking hen. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10417.26s)]
*  When I see people do it, I think that guy's mentally ill. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10419.26s)]
*  Like you're engaging with these people. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10422.26s)]
*  You're yelling at these people on Twitter. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10424.26s)]
*  You're mentally ill. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10425.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10426.26s)]
*  Like I don't care what other people, [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10427.26s)]
*  like I care people think about me in the sense that I want them to think I'm funny. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10428.26s)]
*  And I want them to love. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10430.26s)]
*  Of course we all want to be liked. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10431.26s)]
*  But I don't care what people's opinions on the Middle East are. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10432.26s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10435.26s)]
*  They're not going to change their opinions. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10436.26s)]
*  And I don't need them to agree with mine. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10437.26s)]
*  Like I have enough confidence in my own brain that I am not always right. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10439.26s)]
*  But I'm always comfortable in my opinions. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10442.26s)]
*  And I'm not afraid of somebody. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10444.26s)]
*  I'm okay being wrong too. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10446.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10448.26s)]
*  Like I don't need the power of agreement from somebody. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10449.26s)]
*  It's just. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10452.26s)]
*  Good for you. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10453.26s)]
*  But it's only because I've tried it in my life and it hasn't worked. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10454.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10456.26s)]
*  It doesn't make you happy when you get it. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10457.26s)]
*  No. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10458.26s)]
*  It only makes you angry. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10459.26s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10460.26s)]
*  It's a terrible way to communicate. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10461.26s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10463.26s)]
*  Jimmy I love you to death. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10464.26s)]
*  I love you too Joe. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10465.26s)]
*  Thank you buddy. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10466.26s)]
*  It's always great to see you. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10467.26s)]
*  Yes sir. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10468.26s)]
*  And can I. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10469.26s)]
*  Tell everybody. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10470.26s)]
*  Yes. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10471.26s)]
*  The special is called Unconceivable. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10472.26s)]
*  I kept forgetting the name and it's not a misspelled. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10473.26s)]
*  Unconceivable is actually a word in English language and it does kind of fit. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10476.26s)]
*  And the podcast is Jim Norton Can't Save You. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10479.26s)]
*  Both are on at Jim Norton Comedy at YouTube. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10482.26s)]
*  And I'm really happy with the special. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10484.26s)]
*  Nice. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10486.26s)]
*  I would say that anyway. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10487.26s)]
*  I'm not going to come up here and shit on my own special. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10488.26s)]
*  I'm not that self destructive. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10489.26s)]
*  But I actually really was happy with this one. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10490.26s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10493.26s)]
*  So I hope you like it. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10494.26s)]
*  Alright. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10495.26s)]
*  Thanks pal. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10496.26s)]
*  Bye everybody. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10497.26s)]
*  Bye. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrt8odCj5s&t=10498.26s)]
