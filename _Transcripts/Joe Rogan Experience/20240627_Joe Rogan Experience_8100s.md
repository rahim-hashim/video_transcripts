*  17 years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  And then what was the first thing you did? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=207.36s)]
*  Well, I relapsed twice. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=211.28s)]
*  So after the 17 years, my dad died and he died. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=212.4s)]
*  And then my mom goes, selfie. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=217.28s)]
*  So I took a selfie with my mom and the family and my dad was dead. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=219.44s)]
*  And I decided that was so weird that I took a gummy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=223.84s)]
*  I brought one just in case. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=227.28s)]
*  How many milligrams? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=228.88s)]
*  At the time, it was like 10 milligrams. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=230.0s)]
*  But then I had other stuff in my mom's house. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=232.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=235.12s)]
*  And I took the rest and then I relapsed for like four months. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=235.84s)]
*  Then I got sober again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=239.84s)]
*  And then when things got crazy in my life, I did it again. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=241.68s)]
*  What did you go with again? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=248.32s)]
*  Did you go with just weed? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=249.28s)]
*  Weed and drinking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=250.96s)]
*  And it's fine at first. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=252.24s)]
*  I remember like taking edible, going to Hawaii because I was shooting [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=255.28s)]
*  Magnum P.I. or something. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=259.2s)]
*  And it's fun for like a couple of months, but then I just I overdo it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=260.4s)]
*  And it's like 24 hours a day and I'm drinking 24 hours a day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  And then like people are like Andrew Santino was concerned. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Like one time he knocked on my hotel room and I walked out and I had poo all over my body. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=272.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=277.12s)]
*  And I was in a blackout drunk and he goes, you had poo all over your body. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=277.44s)]
*  That's a good friend. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=281.44s)]

*  Right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=485.84s)]
*  Do you believe that it was like manmade? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=486.08s)]
*  Well, it was definitely manmade. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=488.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=490.72s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't say definitely because I'm not really an expert. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=491.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=493.68s)]
*  But every expert that I have talked to that examined the virus itself, the cleavage sites, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=494.08s)]
*  the way it skipped all like animal forms, like you can't find that virus out in the wild. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=501.36s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it made a leap to person. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  It apparently has all of the earmarks of being engineered. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=511.84000000000003s)]

*  This is not like science fiction. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=518.72s)]
*  So when we say that, it's not like we're just making up some story about some lab where [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=520.48s)]

*  whether or not they were doing gainer function research, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=547.44s)]

*  They funded it through another organization. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=552.0s)]
*  They fund another organization, another organization funds the Wuhan lab. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=553.68s)]
*  And there's a bunch of labs. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=557.1999999999999s)]

*  We went down to one in Galveston, Texas. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=565.6s)]
*  And I don't know if they're doing gainer function research there, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=567.84s)]
*  but I know they have some of the most deadly viruses and diseases known to man, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=570.16s)]
*  all with these crazy ventilation tubes and everyone's walking around, these hazmat. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=574.64s)]
*  Suits and shit. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=579.44s)]
*  They let Duncan and I there. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=580.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, we hadn't slept. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=582.24s)]
*  So Duncan and I, this is when we were doing Joe Rogan questions everything for sci-fi. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=585.12s)]
*  Duncan and I, we flew together. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  So we had to fly together to go to Texas and both of us got barbecued. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=592.48s)]
*  I mean, we took like 500 milligram edibles and totally missed our flight. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=598.24s)]
*  In the airport, we were just talking for like hours. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, oh my God, what time is it? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=605.84s)]
*  Like that bad. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=607.12s)]
*  And they're like, this flight's gone. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=608.72s)]
*  The flight's gone. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=610.08s)]
*  Like, oh no. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=610.88s)]
*  So the next flight we had to take place was like five in the morning. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=612.32s)]
*  And it got us there right before we were supposed to film. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  So we literally stayed up all night, flew it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=617.44s)]
*  I think we got a hotel for one hour. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=620.64s)]
*  I think we actually got a hotel for one hour. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=622.72s)]
*  And then we flew, woke up in the morning and just got up, got in the car rather. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=625.28s)]
*  It just went straight to this lab. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=630.72s)]
*  So we're delirious. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=632.0s)]
*  We're still probably high. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=633.28s)]
*  And we're in this crazy bio lab where they have Ebola. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=635.28s)]
*  They have everything. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  You name it, they've got it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=642.64s)]
*  Everything that kills everybody. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=643.92s)]
*  And it's all like these big, thick plexiglass walls. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=645.52s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, it's freaking me out. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=648.88s)]
*  And me and Duncan were both like, oh my God, dude. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=652.24s)]
*  Are you in a suit too? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=654.08s)]
*  Are you in a suit? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=654.8s)]
*  No. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=655.76s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=656.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=656.96s)]
*  We only went into like the administrative offices. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=657.68s)]
*  They did not let us onto the floor. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=660.88s)]
*  We didn't go anywhere near any diseases. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=662.56s)]
*  They just let us through the, but the doctor scared the fuck out of me [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=664.72s)]
*  because what he was saying to me is he, cause our, our spec, our piece was all on bio weapons. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=668.96s)]
*  And one of the things that I interviewed this guy who was formerly from the Soviet Union, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  I believe it was the Soviet, it might've been Ukraine. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=682.4s)]
*  I think it was Soviet Union. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=684.96s)]
*  And when he left, he was saying that they had one point in time had literal vats of anthrax. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=686.4s)]
*  Just like, like a giant fucking swimming pool filled with anthrax. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=694.48s)]
*  He said they had so much of it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=701.12s)]
*  They had so they're like bio weapons were a big part of the strategy. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=702.64s)]
*  Like if everything goes fucked, if we just decided to start killing each other, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  we decided to start nuking each other. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=711.28s)]
*  That was one of the things that we're going to do. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=712.88s)]
*  Did they use anthrax and knob? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=714.24s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=716.64s)]
*  What's agent orange? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=717.76s)]
*  The same thing? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=718.64s)]
*  No, no, agent orange is a default defoliation. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=719.28s)]
*  Oh. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=722.88s)]
*  Agent orange, they would spray on the plants so they could find the people in the jungle. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  Is it orange? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=729.36s)]
*  Like if I saw it? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=730.24s)]
*  Right. That's a good question. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  Buy orange. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=732.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=732.96s)]
*  Why not yellow? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=733.28s)]
*  I don't know what it looks like. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=734.0s)]
*  There was another word for it, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=734.72s)]
*  What was the other word for agent orange? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=736.4s)]
*  There's like a technical term. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=739.28s)]
*  Because if they use it in Vietnam, they should just call it agent yellow. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=740.8s)]
*  Cut that out. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=748.8s)]
*  Cut that out. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=749.6s)]
*  I've always said that Asian people take jokes better than anybody. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=751.28s)]
*  You know why? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=754.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=754.64s)]
*  All emojis are yellow. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  No one complains. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=756.24s)]
*  It's true. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  They don't complain. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=760.32s)]
*  Yellow thumbs up, yellow smiley face guy, yellow girl. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  Everyone's yellow. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=764.48s)]
*  No one complains. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=765.12s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=766.08s)]
*  People get mad at me because I allow comics to do Asian accents in front of me. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=766.4s)]
*  And I laugh at it because I think it's funny. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=772.4s)]
*  But then people think that I'm like an Uncle Chang. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=774.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=778.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=778.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=779.04s)]
*  And they say they go. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=779.6s)]
*  First of all, those people are all your friends. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  And friends mock each other all the time. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=784.96s)]
*  My friends mock me for being short. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=785.44s)]
*  They mock me for being bald. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=787.12s)]
*  They mock me for being old. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=788.48s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=790.24s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=791.12s)]
*  If they mock me from being... [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=791.76s)]
*  See, the thing is mocking me for being Italian, it doesn't work. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=792.88s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=796.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=796.72s)]
*  It's not a bad one. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=797.2s)]
*  That's why you can call Italians guineas. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=798.32s)]
*  And nobody gives a shit. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=800.48s)]
*  They'll call each other guineas. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=801.6s)]
*  You can call them guineas. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=802.72s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=803.6s)]
*  Because people don't really hate Italians. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=804.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=806.32s)]
*  They find them annoying. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=806.64s)]
*  A little. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  Gold chain ones. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=809.9200000000001s)]
*  The fucking gubbable. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  Those guys. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=811.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=811.76s)]
*  Some of them are a little... [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  But that's also part of the flavor of that culture. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=813.6s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  But Asian hate is a different kind of hate. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  Because Asian hate, legitimately, people will walk up to Asian people and punch them after COVID. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=821.84s)]
*  I've seen this shit. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=827.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=828.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=829.84s)]
*  Wild, yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=831.76s)]
*  Just, I mean, that's just strict racist hate walking right up to someone [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=832.48s)]
*  and punching them just because... [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=837.36s)]
*  Like an old man. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=838.48s)]
*  Old men, old ladies. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=839.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=840.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=841.84s)]
*  And they don't even know what kind of Asian it is. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=843.2s)]
*  It could be someone from the Philippines. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=845.2s)]
*  It could be someone from China. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=846.72s)]
*  They have no fucking idea. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=847.76s)]
*  They're just hitting people. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=848.96s)]
*  It was fucking terrible, yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=849.92s)]
*  Terrifying. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=850.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=851.52s)]
*  That shit's real. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=851.76s)]

*  so they must have dicks, right? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1527.44s)]
*  They all had loin cloths. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1528.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1530.0s)]

*  Every other day. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1559.0400000000002s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1560.16s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1560.88s)]

*  Good move. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1576.88s)]
*  In the dark. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1577.44s)]
*  Oh, and act it out. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1578.0s)]
*  Falling around. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1578.96s)]

*  Right. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1582.16s)]

*  You want to be deceptive. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1589.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  I guess that's not a terrible thing to deceive people about, whether or not you cum. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1591.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but I feel bad. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1596.72s)]
*  All guilty of it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1598.0s)]

*  It has nothing to do with them. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1601.04s)]
*  I get it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1602.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1602.8s)]

*  It bothered me because I love you and you're such a nice guy and you get weirded out by [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1628.8s)]
*  so many different things. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1632.56s)]

*  We've had moments where I even recall that you probably don't even remember. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1663.52s)]
*  Like one time you and I were at the comedy store. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1667.36s)]
*  We're in the patio and Eddie Griffin bumped us. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1670.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1672.96s)]
*  And we were talking shit. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1673.6799999999998s)]
*  So this must be early days. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1674.8799999999999s)]
*  Early days. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1676.0s)]
*  Back in the 90s. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1676.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1677.76s)]
*  90s. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1677.9199999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1678.48s)]
*  And then I remember there was a black guy near us listening and he told Eddie Griffin [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1679.36s)]
*  that we were talking shit about him and he confronted us. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1685.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1688.56s)]

*  And we were like, fuck off, you know what I mean? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1690.08s)]
*  But it was like, because you know what? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1691.4399999999998s)]
*  He used to do hours. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1692.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1694.0s)]
*  Well, he would do three hours. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1694.1599999999999s)]
*  He would go on at nine o'clock and your spot would be at 915 and he would do three hours. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1695.28s)]
*  It was him. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1700.1599999999999s)]
*  Dice would do it sometimes. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1701.76s)]
*  Mencia would do it all the time. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1703.84s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1705.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1706.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it was the thing is it was the kind of the culture of the comedy store in Eddie's defense [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1706.7199999999998s)]
*  is that if you reach a certain level of fame and at the time Eddie was definitely more famous than us [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1712.08s)]
*  and he was when I still to this day maintained that Eddie Griffin set on Def Jam was one of the [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1717.92s)]

*  It was one of the best sets I've ever seen. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1728.32s)]
*  He had shorts on. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1731.28s)]
*  You remember? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1733.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1734.0s)]
*  And he has so much energy, man. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1734.32s)]
*  I remember I pretty sure I was in New York at the time when I watched it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1737.2s)]
*  I was like, God damn, this fucking dude is talented. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1740.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not questioning his skill set. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1743.52s)]
*  But it's the culture thing. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1744.88s)]
*  This is what I was going to say. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1746.08s)]
*  There was a thing at the store when you reach a certain level of prominence, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1746.96s)]
*  you were allowed to just do whatever the fuck you wanted and people would show up. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1752.0s)]
*  And apparently, Kandace used to do that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1755.6000000000001s)]
*  A lot of guys used to do that. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1757.28s)]
*  But do hours? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1758.8s)]
*  I get it, man. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1760.0s)]
*  I don't agree with it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1760.8s)]
*  You wouldn't do it? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1762.16s)]
*  No, but there's certain guys did. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1762.88s)]
*  Certain guys that are really good did. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1765.52s)]
*  Chappelle did it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1766.96s)]
*  There's a bunch of guys who did it. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1768.08s)]
*  It was a thing that you were allowed to do there. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1769.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1772.32s)]
*  And it was like, I think we probably all should have talked about it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1773.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1777.28s)]
*  And said, hey, this is kind of crazy. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1777.76s)]
*  I still, to this day, went to Emily and I go, give me a list right now [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  of the people that are allowed to bump me. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1785.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1787.6s)]
*  She goes, I'll get back to you. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1788.8799999999999s)]
*  Nobody should be allowed to bump you. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1790.24s)]
*  If someone wants to do a set, if a famous person is in town, they should ask you if it's OK. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1791.76s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1797.6s)]
*  I never bump anybody. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1798.56s)]
*  But it still happens. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1801.04s)]
*  But also, it's a thing that was the Comedy Store's mark that you had made to a certain level. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1801.6799999999998s)]
*  If you could show up, and some guys would try to get it, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1810.24s)]
*  they would try to bump people. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  And you're nobody. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1813.84s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  Some people are crazy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1815.52s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1816.56s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1817.12s)]
*  Delusional. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1817.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're like a YouTube person or someone who's on some show. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1818.56s)]
*  Literally. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1821.76s)]
*  Someone who's on some show that you've never heard of that was on the WB or something. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1822.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1826.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1827.28s)]
*  There's a few guys that wanted to try that juice before because it was that thing. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1828.72s)]
*  When someone would show up, whoever it was, Chris Rock would show up. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1833.76s)]
*  He would just go on stage. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1836.8799999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1838.6399999999999s)]
*  Chris Rock goes on stage when he gets there. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1839.28s)]
*  But he's on the list. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1840.08s)]
*  I have a list. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1841.4399999999998s)]
*  Of people that are allowed to bump. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1842.8s)]
*  You're on the list. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1843.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't do it, but you're on it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1845.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't do it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1847.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1848.0s)]
*  Chris Rock's on the list. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1848.48s)]
*  Chappelle's on the list. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1849.84s)]
*  Bill Burr's on the list. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1850.8799999999999s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1851.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1852.24s)]
*  But then there are people that aren't. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1852.8799999999999s)]
*  And they do it, and it drives me fucking crazy. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1855.6s)]
*  Well, it's a weird thing. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1857.76s)]
*  It's like you're trying to appease the talent. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1858.8s)]
*  You never know who's really going to make it big, and you don't want to piss them off now. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1860.96s)]
*  I'm so glad I don't have to deal with that. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1867.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1869.04s)]
*  I always told people, be nice to comedy club owners because you don't want to be one. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1870.08s)]
*  That was my advice always to comics. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1873.52s)]
*  Because they always get mad at comedy club owners. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1875.12s)]
*  I go, listen, man, you do not want to be one of these people, and we fucking need them. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1876.72s)]
*  This is a crazy job. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1880.64s)]
*  You're dealing with maniacs. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1881.6s)]
*  It may or may not take their flight. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1882.56s)]
*  Might show up drunk. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1884.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1885.36s)]
*  Might get arrested Friday night after the first show. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1886.08s)]
*  Imagine you're feeding your family based on these fucking maniacs that come in every week. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1890.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1894.96s)]
*  These people are regular people. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1895.6s)]
*  I would go to comedy clubs, and I would look them up and see the calendar. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1897.1999999999998s)]
*  It would always say Pablo Francisco with a question mark. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1901.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1903.84s)]
*  Pablo was a rock star. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1904.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1905.4399999999998s)]
*  So it's like, I get it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1905.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Pablo's fucking insanely talented. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1907.4399999999998s)]
*  He's so talented. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1909.84s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1910.72s)]
*  Pablo goes to the basement. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1911.28s)]
*  He gets in there. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1912.96s)]
*  He goes and looks around those dark corners, son. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1914.24s)]
*  He goes out there. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1917.52s)]
*  He goes into the tunnel. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1918.88s)]
*  And I just feel so sad about it, but he could have been the biggest thing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1920.24s)]
*  He should have been. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1925.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1926.0s)]
*  He should have been. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1926.32s)]
*  That's how talented. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1926.96s)]
*  He should have been huge. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1927.52s)]
*  In the 90s? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1928.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1928.96s)]
*  Crusher. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1929.92s)]
*  Destroyer. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1930.96s)]
*  And so fun to be around. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1931.68s)]
*  Like the sweetheart of a guy. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1933.28s)]
*  Nobody hated Pablo. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1935.84s)]
*  Sweetheart of a guy. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1937.68s)]
*  Sweetheart. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1938.48s)]
*  Every time people were around him, you wanted to hug him. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1939.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1941.36s)]
*  But he had that skill set on stage that was like a combination between impressions and act outs. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1942.0s)]
*  And he had everything. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1946.96s)]
*  And funny jokes. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1948.4s)]
*  Yeah, funny jokes. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1949.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1950.0s)]
*  He had all of it together. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1950.32s)]
*  And just so likable. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1951.84s)]
*  Such a great guy. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1953.28s)]
*  Such a nice guy. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1954.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1954.8s)]
*  But yeah, I see that still to this day. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1955.68s)]
*  Do do do do. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1957.92s)]
*  Do do do do. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1958.88s)]
*  Do do do do. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1960.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1961.12s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1961.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1962.48s)]
*  I was really lucky that the thing that I was into was weed. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1962.88s)]
*  And that the thing I was into made me terrified. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1966.08s)]
*  It gave me, it made me paranoid. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1969.04s)]
*  It was the opposite of giving me courage. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  It gave me no courage. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1973.84s)]
*  Marijuana was a courage killer. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1976.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  Like it made me feel like courage was foolish. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1979.04s)]
*  You're so vulnerable. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1980.9599999999998s)]
*  Life is vulnerable. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1982.08s)]
*  And it made me appreciate people more. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1983.76s)]
*  Like legitimately. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=1986.32s)]

*  Only two teardrops. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2205.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2206.08s)]
*  That's only two people he killed. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2206.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2207.7599999999998s)]

*  And you went over and I said, Bobby, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2210.48s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2213.8399999999997s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2215.44s)]
*  I go, did you take a look at that guy's eyes? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2216.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2218.24s)]
*  I go, Bobby, these are like dangerous, real people. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2218.64s)]
*  And you're like, oh, shut the fuck up. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2223.2s)]
*  They ain't going to do shit. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2223.8399999999997s)]
*  If I'm... [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2224.56s)]
*  Okay, I'm out of here. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2225.12s)]
*  So I said, I'm leaving. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2226.24s)]
*  You can either come with me or not. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2227.2s)]
*  And I got up and left. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2228.88s)]
*  I saw where this was going. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2230.24s)]
*  They were getting up, Bobby. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2231.12s)]
*  They were moving around. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2232.16s)]
*  They were thinking about coming over to you. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2232.96s)]
*  And I got us right out the door. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2234.56s)]
*  And you barely got in my car. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2236.88s)]
*  You barely got in my car in time. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2238.48s)]
*  You were dilly dallying and someone had to yell at you. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2239.92s)]
*  And then we got you in the car and we took off. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2242.4s)]
*  I go, hey, Bobby, you were going to get us shot. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2244.08s)]
*  Like for real. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2247.2s)]
*  You saved my life. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2247.68s)]
*  I don't know if I saved your life, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2249.04s)]
*  but I definitely saved you an ass-kicking. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2249.92s)]
*  But also, if she's working there, she's on the clock. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2251.52s)]
*  No, just hear me out. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2255.84s)]
*  No, you're... [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2257.36s)]
*  If I'm at McDonald's, right, and some woman... [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2257.84s)]
*  Technically correct. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2259.36s)]
*  I'm technically correct. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2260.56s)]
*  Technically you're correct. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2261.92s)]
*  Ethically correct. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2262.88s)]
*  But she was over there talking to her gang member boyfriend [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  and you went over asking for a lap dance [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2266.48s)]
*  and you just stormed your way into their conversation. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2268.4s)]
*  You were going to die. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2272.56s)]
*  Can I just say something? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2273.36s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2274.1600000000003s)]
*  I want to say something, OK? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2275.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2276.1600000000003s)]
*  At the time, I found this out later, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2276.96s)]
*  I thought the teardrops meant he was emotional or something. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2278.8s)]
*  I didn't know about death. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2281.2000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2282.56s)]
*  Even if he didn't have teardrops on his face, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2283.84s)]
*  look in that guy's eyes, like the whole group of them. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2286.6400000000003s)]
*  They were serious people. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2289.76s)]
*  I don't want to make assumptions about people. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2290.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you have any self-preservation instincts whatsoever? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2294.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2297.76s)]
*  Did you have any self-preservation instincts? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  We recommend danger. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2299.92s)]
*  We don't know danger that way. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2300.96s)]
*  We had no homeless. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2302.7200000000003s)]
*  We had surfers. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2303.76s)]
*  You should be just inherently like a child [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2304.56s)]
*  sees a dog's teeth and is scared of them. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2307.04s)]
*  You should see that guy growling and go, OK, this is real. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2309.44s)]
*  Joe, I'm 52 now. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2313.92s)]
*  I've never had anything happen to me. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel like my instincts are on point. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2316.8799999999997s)]
*  You're also very likable. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2320.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm likable. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2321.52s)]
*  People decide not to kill you. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2322.0s)]
*  I smile. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2322.7999999999997s)]
*  What the fuck, dog? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2324.3199999999997s)]
*  I go, yeah. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2325.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2326.16s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2327.4399999999996s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2328.24s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2328.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2329.12s)]
*  But that was our introduction. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2329.8399999999997s)]
*  That's how we became friends. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2331.6s)]
*  OK. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2332.64s)]
*  It didn't even fuck up our relationship. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2336.64s)]
*  It didn't fucking don't. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2338.72s)]
*  We stayed friends. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2339.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2340.0s)]
*  And I came to LA, and then I think that grew. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2340.3999999999996s)]
*  What year did you come to LA? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2343.3599999999997s)]
*  97 or 98, like in that time period. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2344.8s)]
*  Boy, it was a weird time at the store, that was, huh? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2347.36s)]
*  The dark ages. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2349.52s)]
*  But it was really good for us. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2351.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2352.8s)]
*  You would go on stage in the OR, and it'd be half full. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2353.1200000000003s)]
*  And it was like a real good place to fuck around and practice. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2355.92s)]
*  Oh, so the people that did it really did it, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2359.6800000000003s)]
*  because there was no light at the end of the tunnel? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2363.04s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2365.52s)]
*  I think the store goes through eras, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2366.32s)]
*  and it had gone through the Kinnison era. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2368.1600000000003s)]
*  And when Kinnison died, I think there was a big drop off. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2370.0s)]
*  It was terrible times. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2372.7200000000003s)]
*  And on a Saturday night in the OR, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  they couldn't start the show without four people [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2376.48s)]
*  living in the audience, and there would be sometimes no show. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2378.24s)]
*  On a Saturday fucking night. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2382.56s)]
*  It was crazy, dude. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  But then it came back. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2384.24s)]
*  It came back when the internet came around. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2385.2799999999997s)]
*  It came back in like in the early 2000s. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2386.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2389.12s)]
*  Yeah, it came back. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2389.6s)]
*  And I reaped the reward. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2390.64s)]
*  I'm so glad it didn't quit. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2392.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so glad you didn't quit, too. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2394.24s)]
*  Yeah, I saw, dude, I saw some crazy... [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2395.7599999999998s)]
*  I saw one time at two in the morning, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2398.3999999999996s)]
*  I was working the door there. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2400.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2401.8399999999997s)]
*  And I saw people in purple robes [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2402.64s)]
*  go up into the belly room. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2405.6s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2406.8799999999997s)]
*  With candles. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2407.52s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2408.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2409.12s)]
*  So now you can sneak up to the belly room [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2409.68s)]
*  through the green room with those offices and stuff, right? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2411.92s)]
*  Were they supposed to be up there? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2414.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2415.68s)]

*  They formed a circle, and they had candles up. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2423.12s)]
*  What? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2425.8399999999997s)]
*  They ate a baby. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2426.3399999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no baby eating. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2426.48s)]
*  I don't have to report that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2428.48s)]
*  And they were doing seances. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2430.8799999999997s)]
*  The Comedy Store, if any place is haunted, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2433.3599999999997s)]
*  the Comedy Store is haunted. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2435.12s)]

*  Oh. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  And when I went back downstairs, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2442.08s)]
*  the people that went with the robes, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2445.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2463.84s)]
*  Why do we have to wear the robes? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2464.1600000000003s)]
*  Because it'd be fun. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2465.04s)]
*  And then you get in the candles. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2466.08s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2467.44s)]
*  It sounds like something me and Duncan would do. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2468.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2469.84s)]
*  Nice robes probably too. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2470.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2471.2000000000003s)]

*  Lily Tomlin. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2472.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2473.28s)]
*  She's not going to wear some bullshit robe. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2473.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2475.6s)]
*  But- [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2476.4s)]
*  Have some respect. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2476.64s)]
*  Speaking of Duncan, when I got sober, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2477.76s)]
*  when I had that 17 years chunk, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2480.64s)]
*  and anyone out there listening, right, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2482.7200000000003s)]
*  I needed to get all my drugs out of my house. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2485.52s)]
*  So he was the only one I wanted. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2487.84s)]
*  I think he's the only one that could do it. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2489.36s)]
*  So when I called him, he came into my house in five minutes. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2491.6000000000004s)]
*  He cleaned out my apartment in like 20 minutes, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2494.6400000000003s)]
*  and then he made me a fish dinner. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2497.04s)]
*  And then he took all my drugs and went away. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2499.76s)]
*  But I want to- Duncan, if you're listening, thank you for that. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2501.36s)]
*  Duncan's the man. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2503.36s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2504.96s)]
*  We lived together once for a while. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2505.28s)]
*  Where? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2507.28s)]
*  In my house. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2507.84s)]
*  For over six months in California. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2508.7200000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2510.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2511.2000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2511.76s)]
*  He got kicked out of his apartment. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2512.32s)]
*  Or the house. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2514.5600000000004s)]
*  He was dating this lady, and she got tired of him [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2515.52s)]
*  playing video games all day. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2518.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2521.52s)]
*  And he calls me and he goes, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2521.84s)]
*  dude, I don't know what to do. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2523.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm in a hotel. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2524.48s)]
*  She kicked me out. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2525.6000000000004s)]
*  I go, come live with me. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2526.48s)]
*  I got this big ass house. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  So Duncan lived with me for like six months. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2530.32s)]
*  And I had a sensory deprivation tank in the basement. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2532.48s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2535.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2536.4s)]
*  I could go out there. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2536.6400000000003s)]
*  Duncan would go down the basement and trip balls [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  and sort his life out. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2539.76s)]
*  Was he messy? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2541.44s)]
*  No. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2542.96s)]
*  No, Duncan was a great roommate. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2543.6800000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2545.36s)]
*  He was awesome. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2545.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2546.48s)]
*  Did you have to kick him out or no? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2546.7200000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2548.0800000000004s)]
*  No, no. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2548.8s)]
*  He eventually got back on his feet again. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2549.28s)]
*  And we had a great time. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2551.6800000000003s)]
*  He had stayed there for years. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2554.88s)]
*  We had a wonderful time. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2556.5600000000004s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2557.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2558.7200000000003s)]
*  It was like Duncan's one of my best friends. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2559.28s)]
*  So having one of my best friends in my house, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2560.88s)]
*  and the house is big, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2563.0400000000004s)]
*  so it's not like we were on top of each other. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  I could be way the fuck. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2566.4s)]
*  The phone didn't even work in the whole house. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2567.36s)]
*  I'd have to transfer phones to go to other parts of the house. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2571.92s)]
*  It's a big ass house. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2572.4s)]
*  So if Duncan's over in that side, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2573.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm over in this side, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2575.1200000000003s)]
*  we're not even in each other's hair. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2576.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2578.1600000000003s)]
*  Didn't even bother each other. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2578.48s)]
*  So it was really cool, man. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2579.76s)]
*  It was cool having meals with him, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2581.04s)]
*  hanging out with him. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2582.96s)]
*  So for like six months, we were roommates. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2584.16s)]
*  And to think that he was not even a stand-up at one point, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2586.4s)]
*  he was a talent coordinator. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2588.8s)]
*  Well, he was a stand-up. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2590.32s)]
*  He was trying to do stand-up when he was the talent coordinator. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2591.28s)]
*  We became friends because I would call up and give my veils, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2593.52s)]
*  and then we would have crazy conversations. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2597.04s)]
*  He's like, did you see this thing with Ram Dass? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2599.6s)]
*  And he was like... [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2602.0s)]
*  And we would talk about UFOs, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2604.72s)]
*  Bigfoot and shit. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2607.36s)]
*  That's why when the Joe Rogan Questions Everything show, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2608.6400000000003s)]
*  that's why I did it with him. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2611.04s)]
*  I'm like, oh, he's the perfect guy to do this with. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2611.92s)]
*  And Ari, too. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2613.92s)]
*  Ari did some of the episodes as well. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2614.5600000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2616.0s)]
*  But Duncan was always trying to do stand-up. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2616.5600000000004s)]
*  He was just unorthodox in this approach. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2620.5600000000004s)]
*  But then he got good. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2625.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, he's amazing. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2626.0800000000004s)]
*  Like the fucking doll. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2626.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2627.76s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2628.2400000000002s)]
*  Little Hobo is one of the best sets, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  one of the best bits I've ever seen. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2630.6400000000003s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2632.5600000000004s)]

*  The structure is still there. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2869.44s)]

*  It only happened in this last year. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2887.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2888.6400000000003s)]

*  They're in a cult. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  Mark Andreessen, who's a brilliant venture capitalist guy, explained it to me in very [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2903.1200000000003s)]
*  clear terms, like what the definition of a cult is, how you can get excommunicated, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2909.1200000000003s)]
*  how you get shamed for having differing opinions, the group think, the whole. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2913.1200000000003s)]

*  And he's right. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2918.8s)]
*  He's 100% right. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2919.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2920.5600000000004s)]
*  It's just hard to say because then people in the cult will attack you, but they're not [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2921.12s)]
*  attacking you for a reasonable, it's not logical. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2926.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2930.64s)]
*  The way they're attacking you. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2930.7999999999997s)]
*  They're attacking like someone attacks religious beliefs. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2931.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2934.4s)]
*  And some of these religious beliefs, it gets into these weird gray areas, like trans people [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2934.88s)]
*  in women's bathrooms, like says who, says who. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2940.24s)]

*  They don't want to pull his dick out in front of kids because those are real. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2949.04s)]
*  We spa. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2952.48s)]

*  Look, those guys are real. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2958.7200000000003s)]
*  It doesn't mean trans people aren't real also, but those guys are fucking real. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2960.48s)]
*  And to even say that those guys are real, you get excommunicated. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2964.48s)]
*  You get treated like you're a Nazi. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2968.0s)]
*  I never even cared about it. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2971.12s)]
*  Didn't care at all. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2972.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2973.76s)]
*  I mean, whatever you are, I don't give a shit. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2974.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2976.48s)]
*  But it's like, I can't do it anymore. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2977.36s)]
*  I think it's engineered. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2980.08s)]
*  I really do. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2981.6s)]
*  By who? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2982.08s)]
*  By China and by Russia. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2982.56s)]
*  Oh no, Chinese. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2985.2000000000003s)]
*  I think what they're doing by manipulating social media, manipulating algorithms, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2985.6s)]
*  I think some of it is natural. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2992.32s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2993.76s)]
*  I think some of it would have happened either way. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2994.7200000000003s)]
*  It happened during the 70s with the hippie movement. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2997.04s)]
*  There's always like, there's always these people that are, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=2999.6s)]
*  they want to live completely outside of the norm of conformity of society. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3003.52s)]
*  And there's always people like that. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3008.8s)]
*  But what's going on now is very different and it's accentuated by social media. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3010.8s)]
*  And I think it's accentuated by algorithms naturally [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3015.2s)]
*  because people are inclined to go towards things that upset them. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3018.4s)]
*  But also it's done purposely. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3021.04s)]
*  And I think it's done if you have enough stuff about like whatever the thing is, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3024.32s)]
*  whether it's Black Lives Matter or whether it's Ukraine [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3030.0s)]
*  or whether it's free Palestine from the river to the sea. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3033.12s)]
*  If you have enough of that online, it moves the needle. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3036.32s)]
*  And the way I described it the other day, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3040.4s)]
*  it's like if two ships are going a certain direction. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3041.6s)]
*  This is a ship where people logically work through things. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3044.72s)]
*  And this is a ship that's adjusted by the algorithm, affected by the algorithm. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3047.36s)]
*  It just moves that much. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3050.96s)]
*  Over time, this is what we're seeing. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3052.64s)]
*  So over time, you and I, who used to be on the left, are now like, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3054.96s)]
*  where's the left? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3059.04s)]
*  Where are you guys? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3060.0s)]
*  You guys are so far away. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3060.88s)]
*  I can't even see you. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3063.04s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3064.8s)]
*  You're fucking chopping dicks off and giving little kids hormone blockers. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3065.68s)]
*  You have no idea what the long-term consequences are. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3070.7200000000003s)]
*  You're ignoring the health risks. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3072.8s)]
*  You won't even talk about the health risks. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3074.4s)]
*  You use things like gender-affirming care. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3076.4s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3080.7200000000003s)]
*  What are you saying when you're talking about children? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3082.48s)]
*  Why are you just accepting this? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3084.64s)]
*  It's a noble thing to blurt out. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3086.8799999999997s)]
*  So everybody goes, you're on the right team. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3089.44s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3091.52s)]
*  It's not like, oh my god, what are we doing to kids? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3092.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not like, oh my god, what are we doing to San Francisco? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3094.8799999999997s)]

*  It's like, oh my god, why are we defunding the fucking police? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3100.3999999999996s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3103.04s)]
*  You can't say any of those things. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3104.64s)]
*  You get nervous? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3108.08s)]

*  Texas, 99% of the people agree with me. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3113.3599999999997s)]
*  Even the left-leaning people here are way more reasonable. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3116.08s)]
*  Even last night, there's a joke that I tell that if I say it in a liberal city, it dies. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3119.44s)]
*  It's a joke about Down syndrome people making love, and they make up their own moves. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3126.3199999999997s)]
*  They know traditional moves. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3134.24s)]
*  I did it last night. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3136.0s)]
*  It crushed both shelves. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3136.88s)]
*  I felt like, oh, this is what I've been, I think, maybe looking for. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3138.48s)]
*  That club is specifically designed and nurtured just for what's funny. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3143.92s)]
*  That's it. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3149.52s)]
*  There is no message here. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3150.48s)]
*  Unless you have a message and it's funny and it's in there, you want to do it, that's fine. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3152.4s)]
*  What's valued is comedy. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3156.96s)]
*  Just like if you go to a music show, you don't want those in between the music speeches about [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3158.88s)]
*  climate change. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3164.08s)]

*  Shut the fuck up and play the song. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3167.76s)]
*  Entertain me. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3169.76s)]
*  We want to develop stand-up comedy, real stand-up comedy, because I think it's a worthy art form. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3171.04s)]
*  I think it's very valuable to people in terms of enjoyment and in terms of mental health [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3177.52s)]
*  and in terms of society. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3182.64s)]
*  It's an important part of society. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3185.36s)]
*  The Lakota had a person in their tribe that was called the Hayoka. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3186.88s)]
*  Hayoka was the sacred clown. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3191.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the person that made fun of everything. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3194.08s)]
*  Because if you couldn't make fun of something, it was bullshit. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3196.64s)]
*  If there's one guy, you can't make fun of him. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3200.0s)]
*  Well, that's probably bullshit. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3201.76s)]
*  He probably has an inappropriate amount or an inappropriate amount of power, a disproportionate [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3202.96s)]
*  amount of influence. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3208.72s)]
*  There's probably some ego going on here too, if you can't make fun of something. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3209.52s)]
*  Because if you can make fun of something and it's not funny, then you're not funny. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3213.52s)]
*  But if you can make fun of something and it's funny and people laugh and someone gets mad, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3217.2s)]
*  they're the problem. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3220.88s)]
*  I want to say something I never said this before. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3223.76s)]
*  I would have said no. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3225.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3226.7999999999997s)]
*  Just for my personal life, some of the bullying that I received was necessary for me to get [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3228.3999999999996s)]
*  to where I am now. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3234.72s)]
*  Well, you don't want it. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3236.24s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3237.2s)]
*  No, I didn't ever want it. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3237.7599999999998s)]
*  But I wouldn't go back in my past and change anything. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3239.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3242.72s)]
*  I wouldn't either. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3243.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3243.7599999999998s)]
*  Because I feel like everything... [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3244.24s)]
*  My dad was fucking violent as fuck dude. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3245.7599999999998s)]
*  Like he would knock my mom's tooth out. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3249.3599999999997s)]
*  She has that missing tooth right here. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3250.8799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
*  And we witnessed all this trauma. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3253.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3255.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3255.4399999999996s)]
*  And he was like, dude, it was like... [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3256.16s)]
*  It was fucking terrible. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3259.2s)]
*  I had done EMDR on just him. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  Trauma therapy. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3263.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3264.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's like... [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3264.8799999999997s)]
*  And then I was a little guy in an American high school and people would bully me. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3265.52s)]
*  I lived in Minnesota. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3270.96s)]
*  They thought I was an Eskimo. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3271.7599999999998s)]
*  They threw ice chunks at my head. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3272.96s)]
*  Crows would... [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3274.72s)]
*  Anyway, my point is that all those little things and even in comedy, it was hard being me, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3275.6s)]
*  this little guy, you know what I mean? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3281.6s)]
*  Doing it. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3283.04s)]
*  People... [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3283.44s)]
*  Comics would... [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3283.7599999999998s)]
*  Black comics would sometimes come up to me. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3284.48s)]
*  Asians aren't funny. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3286.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3288.08s)]
*  Well, there was always that knock on Asians. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3289.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3291.44s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3291.7599999999998s)]
*  Henry Cho was the first guy that went mainstream. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3292.64s)]
*  I love him. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3295.44s)]

*  Wasn't he? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3298.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3299.2799999999997s)]
*  Ronnie Chang's fucking hilarious. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  I love Ronnie. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3301.6s)]

*  So funny. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3302.96s)]
*  He's so funny. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3303.6s)]
*  He's got so much attitude on stage. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3304.48s)]
*  Johnny Yoon was before him. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3306.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3307.92s)]
*  Johnny Yoon. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3308.48s)]

*  Yeah, he's very funny. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3310.0s)]
*  But there was a knock, you know? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3311.68s)]
*  But dude, nobody thought that when they saw you on stage. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3314.4s)]
*  You're a really funny guy. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3318.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3324.0800000000004s)]
*  And I also want to tell you the reason why [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3324.5600000000004s)]
*  I didn't want to do this now is because I'm doing a special [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3326.8s)]
*  and I want to promote it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3331.44s)]
*  And I thought maybe I could only do it once every five years, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3332.8s)]
*  but then your people said that I could do it when I... [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3335.5200000000004s)]
*  You could do this anytime you want. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3337.84s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3339.1200000000003s)]

*  I get it now. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3351.92s)]
*  I know now how it works. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3352.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3354.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3354.4s)]
*  But yeah, I was like, I have to do one. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3355.36s)]
*  I have to do a special. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3358.72s)]
*  And the reason... [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3360.72s)]
*  You really should because it'll also force you to write more [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3361.2s)]
*  and fuck around more. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3363.52s)]
*  But you need a place to do that and that's why you should move here. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3364.8s)]
*  Well, that's why I'm going to... [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3367.44s)]
*  There's so much stage time here, dude. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3368.16s)]
*  That's why in March I talked to Adam. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3369.52s)]
*  I'm going to do shows here in the little room to do a Bobby Lee new joke night. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3371.4399999999996s)]
*  Let's go, Bobby Lee. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3375.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3376.96s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3377.2799999999997s)]
*  And then me and Adam are going to do a Star Trek podcast. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3377.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3380.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3381.4399999999996s)]
*  And at that point, you're going to watch The Inner Light. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3381.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a big ask. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3384.8799999999997s)]
*  A lot of ask. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3386.08s)]
*  It's 40 minutes. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3386.8799999999997s)]
*  You really think that's the best science fiction ever? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3388.56s)]
*  Better than Alien, the first Alien movie? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3390.64s)]
*  It's a corny weaver. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3392.56s)]
*  But you have to think, though, that it... [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3393.7599999999998s)]
*  Because obviously the budget is an alien budget, right? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3396.08s)]
*  So it's cheesy television, right? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3399.28s)]
*  But the concept was mind blowing at the time. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3401.52s)]
*  When I saw that in my early 20s, it blew my fucking mind. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3405.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3410.0800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3410.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3411.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's like, I don't want to give it away now. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3411.6000000000004s)]

*  What are you talking about? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3642.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3642.9599999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3643.2799999999997s)]
*  And why is it moving so slow? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3644.16s)]
*  All the above. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3645.68s)]
*  It should have been. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3646.72s)]
*  Well she's got babies in her belly. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3647.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3648.64s)]
*  You ever see a praying mantis kill a hummingbird? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3649.2s)]
*  I don't watch stuff like that. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3653.2s)]
*  Man. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3654.3199999999997s)]
*  You should watch that because the praying mantis is like the [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3654.56s)]
*  human or the Earth-like equivalent of what one of those alien things are. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3658.08s)]
*  The alien thing's an enormous praying mantis. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3662.4s)]
*  Probably even more violent and more deadly. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3665.2s)]
*  And I just don't buy Sigourney Weaver with a stupid fucking robot crane suit on kicking its ass. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3668.48s)]
*  Does it make me a pussy when I watch Planet Earth and I see a lion chase a gazelle or whatever [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3674.56s)]
*  and I fast forward? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3679.6s)]
*  No. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3681.52s)]
*  You just don't want to see the suffering. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3681.92s)]
*  I don't want to see it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3683.6s)]
*  But does that make me weak though? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3684.48s)]
*  No. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3685.7599999999998s)]
*  No, it's not weak. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3686.4s)]
*  You just don't want to experience it. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3687.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3688.64s)]
*  I don't want to experience it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3688.88s)]
*  You know what it is. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3689.92s)]
*  You've seen it before. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3690.56s)]
*  I've seen it happen. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3691.2000000000003s)]
*  You don't have to see a lion eating a fucking gazelle guts first over and over and over again. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3691.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3698.4s)]
*  Or hyenas. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3698.7200000000003s)]
*  The hyenas ones are the wild dog ones. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3699.84s)]
*  Those are the ruthless ones. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3702.0s)]
*  Yeah, those are crazy. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3702.96s)]
*  Because they're pulling the guts out while the thing's trying to stand up. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3703.44s)]
*  It's good. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3705.92s)]
*  It's good. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3706.2400000000002s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3707.52s)]
*  At least the lions kill you first. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3708.8s)]
*  Lion, the cats always kill you. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3710.8s)]
*  They don't just eat you. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3712.48s)]
*  Cats grab you by the neck and they fucking kill you. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3714.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3716.64s)]
*  But dogs, wild dogs and hyenas and bears, they just start eating you. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3716.96s)]
*  And then the alligator, you have to do a twirl with them. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3722.16s)]
*  Yeah, you might not. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3724.16s)]
*  You do a little dance. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3724.8s)]
*  You might not die for an hour. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3725.44s)]
*  You might be alive. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3726.88s)]
*  With an alligator? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3727.2s)]
*  With a lot of different creatures. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3728.08s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3730.48s)]
*  It depends on what... [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3730.96s)]
*  Well, alligators will take you underwater. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3731.6s)]
*  They'll drown you because they want to stuff you under a log so you can rot. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3733.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3737.04s)]
*  So you're easier to consume. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3737.12s)]
*  What animal could I think I could survive, you think? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3739.36s)]
*  A mouse, maybe a mouse. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3741.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3744.08s)]
*  No. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3745.76s)]
*  A really angry mouse. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3746.32s)]
*  You'd probably run into a wall. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3747.6s)]
*  Well, with a bear, maybe. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3750.0s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3753.12s)]
*  A bear. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3753.84s)]
*  Yeah, but I would just not freeze. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3754.64s)]
*  I don't think that works. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3756.32s)]
*  Freezing doesn't work? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3757.12s)]
*  Depends on why they're there. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3758.32s)]
*  All right. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3759.84s)]
*  If they're there to eat you, no, that's not going to work. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3760.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3762.24s)]
*  If they're there to scare you away from their children, maybe, maybe it'll work. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3762.56s)]
*  But do you know what to do? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3766.4s)]
*  No, there's no what to do. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3767.76s)]
*  There's not a lot to do. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3769.68s)]
*  Because when you go to Hawaii, you swim with the shark, they give you rules. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3771.04s)]
*  Don't splash. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3774.64s)]
*  You hear about that kid that was just in the shark tank, was in the Bahamas a bit. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3775.36s)]
*  They had some shark tank experience and some kid got bit by a shark. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3779.44s)]
*  Some kid, I think, from Maryland. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3784.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3785.68s)]
*  Yeah, don't fuck around, man. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3786.4s)]
*  They don't know that it's a shark tank. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3788.0s)]
*  They just, they're sharks. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3789.76s)]
*  They're sharks. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3791.12s)]
*  And a bear is like, to think you know what to do, maybe, maybe if you spray it with pepper spray, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3792.56s)]
*  it'll run away. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3800.24s)]
*  Maybe, maybe it won't. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3800.8s)]
*  Maybe if you shoot it, you'll stop it in its tracks. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3802.48s)]
*  Or maybe you only have like a nine millimeter and you could pump it full of four, five, six holes. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3804.88s)]
*  And it still tears you apart. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3808.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3811.04s)]
*  Yeah, you, you, if you're going to shoot it with a gun, you want a large caliber rifle. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3811.76s)]
*  You want like a 300 Win Mag. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3816.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3818.64s)]
*  You want something big, something boom, boom. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3818.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3822.4s)]
*  Put large holes in that gigantic monster predator. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3823.04s)]
*  What about sword? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3827.44s)]
*  No. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3828.16s)]
*  No, you're fucked. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3828.64s)]
*  I got fucked. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3829.28s)]
*  It's gonna knock you. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3829.76s)]
*  All right, all right, all right. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3830.32s)]
*  Go, go, go, go, go. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3831.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3832.08s)]
*  One swing. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3832.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3833.6800000000003s)]
*  You won't even, you'll fucking bounce it off its nose and just. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3834.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3838.08s)]
*  You'll miss. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3838.6400000000003s)]
*  You'll panic. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3839.36s)]
*  It's just hard. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  The speed that it moves at will astound all your senses. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3841.2000000000003s)]
*  You'll, you'll panic because you'll realize you don't have the reaction time. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3844.88s)]
*  You don't have the physical movement time capable of dealing with how fast it's coming at you. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3848.1600000000003s)]
*  Your body doesn't work good enough to do that. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3853.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, I would go, I would run toward it and just get it over with. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3855.28s)]
*  That might work. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3858.7200000000003s)]
*  I'll just run and I'll just jump right into the head maybe. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3859.76s)]
*  It depends on where it bites you. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3862.2400000000002s)]
*  The thing about those things is they don't necessarily kill. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3863.84s)]
*  They just hold down and eat. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3866.48s)]
*  They just hold you down. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3869.0400000000004s)]
*  All right, okay. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3869.84s)]
*  You know, grizzly man, that documentary. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3871.44s)]

*  Wow. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3873.84s)]
*  That video where the lens cap was on but they have an audio of him dying. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3874.4s)]
*  It's like. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3878.48s)]
*  It's so horrifying. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3878.96s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3879.76s)]
*  It's like five minutes long. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3880.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3882.5600000000004s)]

*  It's so long. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3888.5600000000004s)]
*  Before you're dead. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3889.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3890.08s)]
*  You got to think of how long it is. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3890.96s)]
*  Something just weighs a thousand pounds putting its paw on your chest and just pulling your guts out. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3892.4s)]
*  Screaming. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3898.96s)]
*  I bombed for five minutes and it seems like 20 minutes. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3900.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3902.96s)]
*  Imagine getting an eating. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3903.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3904.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3904.7999999999997s)]
*  Forever. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3905.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3905.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3906.0s)]
*  Do you bomb anymore? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3906.88s)]
*  I'll bomb, a juggle bomb. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3908.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3910.48s)]
*  We also do bottom of the barrel. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3911.2s)]
*  You know, bottom of the barrel is like one of those shows where the audience has suggestions [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3912.64s)]
*  and you reach in the barrel and pull out the suggestions. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3916.0s)]
*  And then you just riff. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3918.56s)]
*  I bombed on those shows. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3920.56s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3921.92s)]
*  Sometimes there's no suggestion. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3923.52s)]
*  Sometimes it's like green sneakers. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3925.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3927.36s)]
*  So hard. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3928.32s)]
*  The fuck am I going to do with this? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3928.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3930.08s)]
*  Because sometimes people are trying to trip you up. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3930.48s)]
*  Sometimes people have good suggestions. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3932.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3934.0s)]
*  Some of them are actually like almost in the form of jokes. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3934.24s)]
*  Like some of them are really funny. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3936.48s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3937.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3938.56s)]
*  So you just randomly pull out a topic. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3938.8s)]
*  And the audience fills it out? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3941.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3942.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3943.44s)]
*  And it's like sometimes it's an amazing premise factory because sometimes, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3943.76s)]
*  because you're on the spot like that, every now and then an idea will pop into your head. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3947.2s)]
*  You're like, oh shit, that's a bit. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3951.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3953.2s)]
*  And then that bit you get home and you listen to it and you write it down. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3953.52s)]
*  Like there's three or four bits that I've gotten that are actual bits now because of that show. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3957.52s)]
*  I want to admit to something to you right now. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3962.72s)]
*  If I may. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3965.92s)]
*  I do. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3967.6s)]
*  I want to admit something to you right now if I may. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3968.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3970.56s)]
*  The reason why I haven't done a special is because of the fear of doing new shit. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3971.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3977.44s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3978.08s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3980.08s)]
*  It's shameful. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3981.12s)]
*  Yeah, but this idea that you have of a Bobby Lee new joke night. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3982.72s)]
*  I'm forcing myself to do it. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3986.08s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3987.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3987.7599999999998s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3988.08s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3988.8s)]
*  Because when you guys left the store, and I don't want to make fun of it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3989.44s)]
*  I love all the comics, dude, but it's like sometimes when the headliners, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3994.56s)]
*  like the guys with names leave town for the weekends, you look some of the lineups there. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=3998.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4003.12s)]
*  And so when I'm, they're not as strong. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4003.7599999999998s)]
*  So when I'm in town, I'm in the main room, I have the prime spot, it's packed. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4006.08s)]
*  I have this fucking pressure to crush. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4010.3999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4015.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, because I just know that they're there to see me and I want to give them a good show. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4017.2s)]
*  Well, you could do sets other places too, you know, do sets other places, go to the ha ha, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4020.9599999999996s)]
*  fuck around with the ice house, go to Flappers, go fuck around in other spots. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4025.12s)]
*  Flappers? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4029.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4030.48s)]
*  I know you're saying that, but it's like, go up there. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4031.52s)]
*  It's a crowd. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4034.4s)]
*  Burr fucks around there. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4037.52s)]
*  Oh, well, yeah. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4038.96s)]
*  Burr likes to do that. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4039.68s)]
*  He likes to go to the ice house, he'll fuck around there. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4040.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4042.64s)]
*  You got to kind of fuck around. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4043.12s)]
*  You got to like come up with ideas and sit down. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4044.64s)]
*  Like last night, I told myself I'm going to go to bed early. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4048.08s)]
*  I was in front of the computer at 10 o'clock and I was like, I'll stop at 12 and I'll go to bed. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4052.8799999999997s)]
*  But then I got an idea. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4058.56s)]
*  I got an idea and I wrote it out till like 3 30 in the morning. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4060.16s)]
*  I was just writing. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4062.7999999999997s)]
*  And when I do that, I'm like, okay, that was productive. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4064.24s)]
*  Even though I'm tired and I woke up late today, even though I'm tired, I'm like, but that was [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4067.04s)]
*  productive. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4071.3599999999997s)]
*  And if I can force myself to do that three, four times a week. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4072.56s)]
*  And sometimes, dude, I'll just sit in front of that fucking computer and it's just nonsense. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4075.6s)]
*  It's just nonsense. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4079.7599999999998s)]
*  It's nothing. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4081.04s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4081.68s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4082.56s)]
*  So yeah, nothing to this. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4083.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm trying to work it out. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4084.64s)]
*  You know, I'll fucking take a little of that, go over it again. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4086.24s)]
*  Sometimes nothing. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4090.56s)]
*  Sometimes I got nothing. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4091.44s)]
*  But when you write something, though, and you look at it, right? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4092.48s)]
*  Do you go, okay, this is like a 60%. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4095.2s)]
*  Like, do you do that? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4098.24s)]
*  Totally depends. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4099.12s)]
*  It depends. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4100.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's like 100%. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4100.64s)]
*  Some bits, like as I write them, that's exactly how I perform them. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4102.96s)]
*  It's not normal, but it happens. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4106.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4109.68s)]
*  And then some bits are just seeds. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4110.0s)]
*  It's just a seed. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4111.92s)]
*  And I got to throw that bitch on stage and see where it goes. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4112.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4115.36s)]
*  And sometimes it doesn't go anywhere. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4115.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4117.68s)]
*  Sometimes I think it's like Ron White was telling the story the other day about this [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4117.84s)]
*  joke that he had that he thought was really funny. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4120.8s)]
*  And he had planned. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4123.12s)]
*  I had a plan in my mind when it was going to be applause break. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4123.92s)]
*  He goes, he got fucking nothing. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4127.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4128.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4129.2s)]
*  It happens. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4129.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4130.32s)]
*  It does. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4130.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4131.04s)]
*  But that's the beauty of creation because every now and then I have this new bit that's [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4131.44s)]
*  killing. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4136.32s)]
*  And it's so exciting to get to it because this bit is alive. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4137.2s)]
*  It's like it was just born. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4142.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4143.76s)]
*  It's just flexing. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4144.24s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4146.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4147.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4147.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4147.599999999999s)]
*  It's fun, but also it's hard. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4148.16s)]
*  But you got to pay devotion to the muse to sit down and try to let the ideas come to you. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4150.72s)]
*  If you don't have a moment where you're just sitting down and just letting the ideas come [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4159.92s)]
*  to you, you're going to miss those ideas. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4163.599999999999s)]
*  And some people say, oh, I only write on stage. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4165.52s)]
*  I only write with my friends. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4167.6s)]
*  That's great. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4168.88s)]
*  You should do that too. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4169.52s)]
*  But there's nothing wrong with sitting. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4170.88s)]
*  It's not going to hurt you to sit in front of a computer and go over your ideas. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4173.120000000001s)]
*  And every now and then, maybe every two times or five times, every 10 times you sit in front [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4176.56s)]
*  of that computer or that notebook, something pops up that wouldn't have popped up without it. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4182.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4188.400000000001s)]
*  And you got to suffer through the ones that suck, the drudge of not being able to [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4189.040000000001s)]
*  come up with anything. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4195.36s)]
*  My problem is I have these second addictions I have, like video games. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4197.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4202.16s)]
*  In your front of the computer, you start playing video games. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4202.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4204.719999999999s)]
*  And I'll just start playing Starfield or something. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4204.96s)]
*  Of course. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4206.96s)]
*  16 hours later, I'm on a planet and I'm making an outpost. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4207.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4210.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4211.28s)]
*  And I feel guilt. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4211.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4212.96s)]
*  Or I'll play Stardew Valley. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4213.12s)]
*  I'll create a farm. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4214.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4215.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4216.0s)]
*  And it's a haunting thing. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4216.24s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4217.92s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4219.04s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4219.92s)]
*  You're wasting your time. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4220.719999999999s)]
*  I'm wasting my time. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4221.44s)]
*  I know this. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4222.16s)]
*  But for the same reason, I can convince myself. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4223.2s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4225.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4226.48s)]
*  If you do the work first, like say if you sit down, you say, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4226.8s)]
*  I can only play computer games if I write a thousand words. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4230.5599999999995s)]
*  So when you get to a thousand on a word document, you look at the bottom, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  it'll tell you how many words you've written and then you can stop. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4239.76s)]
*  That's what I want to do. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4243.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4244.0s)]
*  Just earn it. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4244.4s)]
*  Earn it. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4245.36s)]
*  That way you'll actually enjoy it. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4245.92s)]
*  That way when you're playing the games, there won't be in your head, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4247.599999999999s)]
*  oh my God, I should be writing. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4249.84s)]
*  That's what I got. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4251.04s)]
*  I should be doing something else. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4251.5199999999995s)]
*  By the way, it doesn't have to be you write something funny. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4253.44s)]
*  You could just write something about something and then try to extract funny things out of it. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4257.12s)]
*  You could just write a story about how violent your dad was. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4263.76s)]
*  That what you just told me, which is horrific, right? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4267.36s)]
*  If you wrote that out, I guarantee you there's going to be a seed of something in there. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4270.32s)]
*  Something. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4277.2s)]
*  It might not even be about your dad being violent. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4277.84s)]
*  It'd be maybe it'd be about how you react to violence. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4280.32s)]
*  Maybe how you react to angry people. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4283.28s)]
*  I just want everybody to be nice. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4286.64s)]
*  You could find a premise in there. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4287.92s)]
*  So just write an essay. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4291.12s)]
*  Just write an essay and write an essay with no expectation of whether or not it's going to be funny. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4292.56s)]
*  Yeah, I used to do morning pages. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4297.44s)]
*  You ever do that? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4299.84s)]
*  No, just get up in the morning and write. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4300.88s)]
*  Write when you wake up. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4302.32s)]
*  Apparently when you just start writing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4303.28s)]
*  That's supposed to be the best time to write. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4305.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4306.56s)]
*  Well, you don't have those filters and stuff like this sucks. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4307.28s)]
*  Just freely write it. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4310.32s)]
*  And then just pages of it. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4312.0s)]
*  Maybe a couple. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4313.44s)]
*  And then later you look at it. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4314.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'll start doing that again. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4317.2s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4318.16s)]
*  That's how most writers do. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4318.719999999999s)]
*  When they write, they write in the morning and then they go for a walk. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4320.16s)]
*  A lot of them do and they listen to some of their notes and they'll go over the idea that they wrote down and they'll take voice notes while they're walking. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4323.2s)]
*  There's something about walking they say because it's like a very mild, erotic exercise. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4331.5199999999995s)]
*  So it stimulates your circulation. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4336.0s)]
*  It gets everything flowing. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4337.839999999999s)]
*  You actually think a little bit better when you're walking. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4339.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4341.599999999999s)]
*  It's real. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4342.08s)]
*  You're not tired. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4343.28s)]
*  It's a mild thing. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4344.4s)]
*  So you're just out there walking and your heart is pumping and you're not sitting there sedentary. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4345.44s)]
*  Just trying to think you're actually walking around. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4350.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4353.28s)]
*  I'll try hiking then. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4353.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4354.799999999999s)]
*  Hiking is good. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4355.2s)]
*  Hiking is good. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4356.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4356.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4357.36s)]
*  Hike after you then you really have earned your video games. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4357.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4361.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4361.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4362.4s)]
*  And hike and think about what you write. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4362.639999999999s)]
*  And then when you play, you'll be playing for fun. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4364.5599999999995s)]
*  You'll be enjoying this day. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4367.2s)]
*  Fourth. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4368.5599999999995s)]
*  From this day forth, I'm going to wake up. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4370.0s)]
*  I'm making an announcement. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4372.24s)]
*  I'm going to wake up. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4373.44s)]
*  I'm going to write for an hour. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4374.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4376.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4376.72s)]
*  Hike and then I'm going to play video games. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4377.44s)]
*  I'm going to see you four months from now. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4379.84s)]
*  You're going to be cracked out with a Klingon knife. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4381.04s)]
*  You went off the rails. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4386.64s)]
*  It was too much pressure. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4387.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4388.88s)]
*  I was getting up every morning. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4389.2s)]
*  I was writing and I was hiking. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4390.24s)]
*  It was just too much. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4391.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4392.24s)]
*  No, my fish died. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4393.12s)]
*  I have to do it because now it's incredible. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4394.48s)]
*  When I do shows with Segura or me and Andrew, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4397.5199999999995s)]
*  because I'm on a podcast called Bad Friends. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4400.8s)]
*  It's a funny podcast. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4403.5199999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4404.4s)]
*  You guys are good together. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4404.88s)]
*  I want to talk to you about an episode that I saw. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4405.6s)]
*  But you having to go to Israel, was that on that or was that somewhere else? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4407.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was that. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4411.6s)]
*  What was that like? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4412.88s)]
*  Tell me what happened. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4414.96s)]
*  Do you not want to talk about it? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4416.72s)]
*  I can do it. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4417.6s)]
*  Because I'm not saying anything that's wrong. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4418.88s)]
*  It's just something that happened. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4421.36s)]
*  So I get a call from Steve Byrne. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4423.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4424.8s)]
*  And Steve goes, you want to go to Israel? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4425.76s)]
*  How long ago is this? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4428.0s)]
*  14 years ago, maybe. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4432.08s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4433.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4434.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4435.04s)]
*  12, 14, I don't know. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4435.599999999999s)]
*  And I go, why? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4436.96s)]
*  I don't want to do a show there. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4437.92s)]
*  And he goes, no, you know, I got a call and they're flying out a bunch of comedians and actors. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4439.2s)]
*  And it's a free trip. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4445.76s)]
*  And I go, why? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4448.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4450.08s)]
*  They just want to show us the country and their culture. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4450.4s)]
*  And you get nice hotels, free meals, and you get a tour of like- [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4453.76s)]
*  Are you not performing? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4459.2s)]
*  No. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4460.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4460.64s)]
*  So I went there with Jamie Chung, Brian Greenberg, they're actors, and Steve Lopez went out, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4461.44s)]
*  George Lopez. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4467.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4468.8s)]
*  And we went out there. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4469.44s)]
*  And then when we got there, they were like, welcome. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4470.64s)]
*  We're like, thanks. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4473.76s)]
*  And they're like, but every day you have to tweet how great Israel is. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4474.8s)]
*  Every day? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4479.44s)]
*  Yeah, like put out a tweet. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4480.32s)]
*  They told you you have to, and they didn't say anything about that before you left? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4481.6s)]
*  I don't remember them saying it before. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4485.6s)]
*  But they might've? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4487.92s)]
*  They could've. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4489.04s)]
*  Maybe they said it to Steve and Steve conveniently left it out. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4490.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4493.360000000001s)]
*  But I do know that I feel like if they did say it, that I would have questioned it. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4493.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4499.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4500.56s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4500.96s)]
*  If you're aware. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4501.68s)]
*  So this is the early days of Twitter, right? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4502.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4505.120000000001s)]
*  When was Twitter's only like 12 years old? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4505.4400000000005s)]
*  It was 10 years ago then, I don't know. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4508.64s)]
*  How old is Twitter? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4509.92s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4511.84s)]
*  2006. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4512.4800000000005s)]
*  Israel unfiltered. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4513.360000000001s)]
*  So 2006. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4515.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4516.400000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4516.96s)]
*  So 2006, when was that? [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4517.68s)]
*  Look at your face. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4518.8s)]
*  I like, I have to tweet? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4521.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4523.4400000000005s)]
*  But here's what happened. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4524.160000000001s)]
*  As soon as I tweeted the first thing, I already knew like, oh my God, I think I'm in trouble. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4526.0s)]
*  Why? What'd you say? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4532.08s)]
*  I just said Israel's great. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4533.04s)]
*  They're beautiful people. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4534.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4535.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4536.88s)]
*  And then like it was just like, and they flew us out here for free. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4537.280000000001s)]
*  And then you would just get a thousand like, you know what I mean? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4541.6s)]
*  We're like, you know, Palestinian, you know? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4545.76s)]
*  Oh. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4547.52s)]
*  And going, you mother, you know, and just it was like negative, negative, negative. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4548.4800000000005s)]
*  And there was these gigantic wars that would go on in the comment section. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4552.400000000001s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4555.92s)]
*  It just got really uncomfortable. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4556.400000000001s)]
*  And then I just remember, you know. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4557.92s)]
*  Yeah, there I am. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4560.320000000001s)]
*  Look at you. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4560.88s)]
*  Nice hat. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4561.92s)]
*  You should wear that all the time. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4563.84s)]
*  I look cute with that. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4565.200000000001s)]
*  Is that the famous wall? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4566.160000000001s)]
*  That's the wall, yeah. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4567.280000000001s)]
*  What did it feel like to be around that wall? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4568.400000000001s)]
*  The wall's old as fuck. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4570.320000000001s)]
*  How old's that wall? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4572.32s)]
*  I put a note in it. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4573.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4574.639999999999s)]
*  You can write little letters. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4575.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4577.2s)]
*  Letters to Jesus? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4577.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4578.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4578.5599999999995s)]
*  And I just, you put it in there. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4578.96s)]
*  I think mine was like, let me get more pussy or whatever. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4580.719999999999s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4582.4s)]
*  But like that wall, how old was that wall? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4583.12s)]
*  19 BC. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4586.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4588.32s)]
*  But then toward the end, I was just like, I got to get the fuck out of here. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4589.28s)]
*  I think I was like. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4592.0s)]
*  How many tweets did you make and did you keep going after they were attacking you? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4593.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4599.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4600.08s)]
*  You have to. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4600.72s)]
*  Otherwise, you don't get your hotel. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4601.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4602.72s)]
*  It was like a free thing. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4603.2s)]
*  And I didn't know the significance of it until later almost. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4604.88s)]
*  The significance, but the impact of it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4609.4400000000005s)]
*  Because obviously, I have my opinions about it that I'm keeping to myself. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4612.96s)]
*  But it's not fully aligned with what people think that I should be. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4619.68s)]
*  You have to be careful because I live in LA. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4627.52s)]
*  Oh, I hear you. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4630.16s)]
*  Look, it's a complicated issue. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4631.2s)]
*  It's so complicated. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4632.639999999999s)]
*  And it's terrifying. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4633.5199999999995s)]
*  When you look at the video of when they do an overhead of what Gaza used to look like [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4635.04s)]
*  and what it looks like now. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4639.36s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4644.32s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4645.679999999999s)]
*  So yes, it's going to take over a year to clean up just the rubble. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4646.639999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4650.4s)]
*  But it's like 25,000 now. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4651.2s)]
*  At least. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4653.44s)]
*  At least. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4654.0s)]
*  They don't know how many people are dead. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4654.5599999999995s)]
*  They have no idea. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4656.32s)]
*  And half the population is women and children. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4657.6s)]
*  And the trauma and the fucking famine. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4661.2s)]
*  I just can't even comprehend it really. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4667.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4670.08s)]
*  And the Israelis tell you that it's necessary. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4670.4s)]
*  And that they have to get rid of Hamas. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4673.2s)]
*  And this is the way to do it. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4675.36s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4677.6s)]
*  I believe that maybe that should be. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4680.16s)]
*  But I think the approach could be different. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4682.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4684.96s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4685.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4686.16s)]
*  I don't have any expertise in war. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4686.5599999999995s)]
*  Neither. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4689.44s)]
*  But I'm horrified that they can just shoot missiles into buildings. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4689.68s)]
*  And they tell people to get out. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4695.2s)]
*  But then they bomb the areas where they're going to. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4696.32s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is nuts, man. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4698.96s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4700.8s)]
*  And it's so dangerous. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4701.5199999999995s)]
*  It's so dangerous. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4703.68s)]
*  These free Palestine marches that are happening all over the world. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4704.8s)]
*  Those are all organized too, by the way. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4708.96s)]
*  Oh. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4710.96s)]
*  When you get on social media and you see the free Palestine people and the pro-Israel people, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4712.16s)]
*  what percentage of those people are bots? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4717.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4719.68s)]
*  It's not zero. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4720.08s)]
*  It's not zero. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4721.2s)]
*  There's a lot of what's getting stirred up. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4722.24s)]
*  A lot of the hateful things that are being said. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4724.16s)]
*  A lot of the crazy things that are being said. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4725.84s)]
*  I guarantee you a lot of that's being instigated by foreign countries. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4727.84s)]
*  And that's what's scary about social media and the influence it has on people. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4731.76s)]
*  And the way they feel about a particular issue. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4735.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's on top of the horrific nature of the issue itself. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4738.0s)]
*  Both of October 7th, which is undeniably horrific. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4741.4400000000005s)]
*  Horrific. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4744.32s)]
*  And then this. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4744.88s)]
*  And then on top of that, you have this open anti-Semitism that we never saw before. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4745.84s)]
*  Where it's just open everywhere. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4751.76s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4754.88s)]
*  It's fucking terrible. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4756.72s)]
*  It's so scary, man. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4757.6s)]
*  But it's also an issue that will never be resolved. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4759.2s)]
*  But it's not just that it'll never be resolved. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4762.88s)]
*  I never thought it was going to be an issue where the presidents of major universities [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4764.8s)]
*  were standing in front of Congress and they were justifying people saying death to the Jews, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4769.28s)]
*  that it wasn't harassment unless it was actionable. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4773.84s)]
*  I don't think that's insane. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4777.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4777.92s)]
*  What? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4778.320000000001s)]
*  When the congresswoman was trying to get them to expand on that, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4779.92s)]
*  do you mean actual genocide, then it's harassment when they commit actual genocide? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4783.04s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4787.68s)]
*  But it's the same thing we were talking about. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4789.28s)]
*  It's the cult. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4791.04s)]
*  They're in that leftist cult. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4792.400000000001s)]
*  And it's not reasonable. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4794.88s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4796.0s)]
*  It's all crazy. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4797.04s)]
*  Oh, and when they were like Osama Bin Laden could have been Ryan or whatever, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4798.16s)]
*  do you remember that fucking trend? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4802.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4803.84s)]
*  Fucking insane. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4804.64s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4807.04s)]
*  And these are people that weren't there. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4807.92s)]
*  I was there. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4810.24s)]
*  That's a TikTok thing too, by the way. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4810.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4812.08s)]
*  Osama Bin Laden. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4812.56s)]
*  In 2000, right? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4813.4400000000005s)]
*  2001, I was on MADtv. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4816.0s)]
*  9-11 happened. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4819.04s)]
*  I went to work the next day. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4820.0s)]
*  Andrew Daley, one of the actors, his cousin was on one of the flights. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4821.84s)]
*  And I could feel the pain. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4825.76s)]
*  And we were inundated with the fucking footage. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4829.28s)]
*  And just in the moment, it was fucking horrifying. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4833.04s)]
*  It changed America. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4836.56s)]
*  100%. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4838.64s)]
*  100%. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4839.28s)]
*  And now people that weren't even around then, kids, which is fine. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4840.0s)]
*  But now they have these grand ideas about it's insane. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4845.28s)]
*  Well, it's also where did Osama Bin Laden come from? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4849.2s)]
*  Well, he came from the CIA funding them, the Mujahideen, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4853.68s)]
*  to fight against the Soviet Union. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4858.0s)]
*  They were trained. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4860.320000000001s)]
*  They were trained by Americans. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4861.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4862.64s)]
*  Look, there's a certain reality to American imperialism. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4863.200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't do anybody any good to deny it. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4866.320000000001s)]
*  We have military bases everywhere. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4868.240000000001s)]
*  If you were a foreign country, in a nationalistic foreign country, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4871.84s)]
*  of course you'd hate America. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4874.56s)]
*  Of course you'd hate what we do. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4876.16s)]
*  I mean, look at what's going on right now with this Ukraine-Russia thing. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4877.68s)]
*  Look at how much money is being funneled through that. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4881.6s)]
*  Insane amounts of money. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4885.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4886.72s)]
*  And most of it's like embezzled, right? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4887.280000000001s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4889.120000000001s)]
*  But again, it's not zero. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4890.240000000001s)]
*  It's not zero percent. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4892.08s)]
*  It's getting embezzled. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4893.200000000001s)]
*  And the fact that all of a sudden no one wanted to admit [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4894.64s)]
*  that Ukraine had always been a very corrupt country. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4896.72s)]
*  There's a crazy Twitter exchange between Candace Owens and the New York Times, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4900.0s)]
*  where Candace Owens was talking about how corrupt Ukraine is. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4904.160000000001s)]
*  And then the New York Times says to her, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4908.56s)]
*  what evidence do you have that Ukraine is corrupt? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4911.68s)]
*  She goes, oh, you mean the links from your fucking newspaper? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4913.76s)]
*  And just from 2016 and before that, there's all these fucking stories [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4916.88s)]
*  about how corrupt Ukraine is. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4921.52s)]
*  In the New York Times, they didn't even bother looking it up [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4922.72s)]
*  because when you're in the cult, the cult says you support Ukraine. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4925.6s)]
*  Do you want Ukraine to win or do you want Russia to win? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4930.240000000001s)]

*  How much do you know about NATO? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4939.04s)]
*  About how much they're moving arms closer to the Soviet Union, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4941.04s)]
*  about how Ukraine joining NATO was always a red flag. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4943.68s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4946.72s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know nothing. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4948.48s)]
*  Most people that are talking about it don't know either. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4949.68s)]
*  That was the red line that you could not cross. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4951.84s)]
*  Ukraine joining Russia or joining NATO rather. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4954.08s)]
*  The whole thing is fucking terrifying [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4957.44s)]
*  because we're dealing with nuclear superpowers. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4959.36s)]
*  When Xi Jinping tells Biden that Taiwan will join China again, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4962.56s)]
*  that means they're going to take Taiwan. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4968.48s)]
*  What are we going to do if they take Taiwan? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4969.84s)]
*  Then Biden says we're not going to do anything. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=4972.64s)]

*  and I remember seeing that going, I gotta get the fuck out of here. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5051.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5053.84s)]
*  This ain't gonna get better. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5054.16s)]
*  Was it that or COVID that made me do it? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5055.5199999999995s)]
*  Both those things. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5057.44s)]
*  And the money, probably like taxes. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5058.08s)]
*  No, that was not even a consideration. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5059.76s)]
*  It was nice, but it was the freedom. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5061.76s)]
*  It was these fucking dipshits like the mayor of Los Angeles [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5063.76s)]
*  telling everybody what businesses they can and can't have open, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5067.76s)]
*  what's essential and non-essential, like says who. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5071.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5074.4s)]
*  And after a while when a bunch of people had had COVID [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5074.88s)]
*  and then gotten over it and they were fine, I was like, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5077.5199999999995s)]
*  but wait a minute, how scary is this? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5080.24s)]
*  And why are we closing everything down? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5082.88s)]
*  Why aren't we giving people choice? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5084.32s)]
*  And then when it never opened. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5085.92s)]
*  I bought into it. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5086.96s)]
*  Of course you did. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5088.16s)]
*  I didn't even leave the house for two fucking years. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5088.56s)]
*  I didn't even go to the grocery store and I had to spray everything down. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5091.28s)]
*  Doritos, spraying it with, it was insane. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5096.08s)]
*  Well, my whole family got it early on before there was anything, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5098.96s)]
*  before there was a vaccine, before there was anything. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5102.0s)]
*  And I didn't get it. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5104.08s)]
*  And I didn't do anything different. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5105.44s)]
*  I hugged my kids, I fucked my wife, I hung out with them. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5106.56s)]
*  I just took care of myself. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5110.16s)]
*  You've had a COVID though, right? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5112.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I got it eventually. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5113.76s)]
*  Yeah, I got it too. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5114.8s)]
*  I got it when the Delta variant was around. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5115.44s)]
*  I got it when I was doing arenas in Florida. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5118.08s)]
*  And I got it because I was hanging out with my friend John Shulman. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5120.639999999999s)]
*  My friend John Shulman is a buddy of mine who makes pool cues. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5123.759999999999s)]
*  And he lives right there and I got to see him after the show [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5127.44s)]
*  and we played pool till like 3.30 in the morning and I was exhausted. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5130.4s)]
*  I had like fucking five margaritas and then I got sick. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5133.599999999999s)]
*  But even then it wasn't that bad. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5137.12s)]
*  But my point is like my whole family got it and I didn't get it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5138.639999999999s)]
*  They weren't vaccinated? [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5142.48s)]
*  No, no, there was no vaccine back then. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5143.599999999999s)]
*  And I didn't do anything different, man. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5145.92s)]
*  I remember I worked out two days where I was tired [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5149.2s)]
*  and I realized I was fighting something off. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5153.04s)]
*  There was two days where I was in the gym. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5154.96s)]
*  I was like, you know what? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5156.8s)]
*  I'm just going to go through the motions here. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5157.68s)]
*  I'm just going to lift light weights and just like let my body break a little bit of a sweat, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5159.28s)]
*  but no exertion. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5163.92s)]
*  Just get some circulation going. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5165.04s)]
*  So I did like some kettlebell exercises, like 35 pounds. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5166.64s)]
*  Nothing strenuous, just nice and light and just get the body moving. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5170.24s)]
*  And then the next day I went back in the gym. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5174.64s)]
*  I feel the same, same thing. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5176.240000000001s)]
*  Today, same thing. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5178.64s)]
*  Did some pushups, did some chin ups, nothing crazy like reps of five chin ups, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5179.4400000000005s)]
*  not just a little bit of exercise, nothing strenuous. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5184.160000000001s)]
*  And then the next day I felt great. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5187.52s)]
*  The next day I had a full regular workout. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5189.84s)]
*  So whatever it was, I fought it off. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5191.6s)]
*  And so then I was like, well, what is at play here? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5194.0s)]
*  Can your immune system stop this or is it something that you 100% get? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5198.64s)]
*  No, it seems very infectious, but it also seems like if you have a healthy immune system, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5202.48s)]
*  this isn't a death sentence. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5206.16s)]
*  This isn't Ebola. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5207.679999999999s)]
*  This isn't. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5208.719999999999s)]
*  So what the fuck is going on? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5210.0s)]
*  And then the vaccine came out and I signed up to get vaccinated. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5211.5199999999995s)]
*  The UFC had this whole allotment of vaccines, but I was there on a Friday for the UFC. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5215.12s)]
*  And they said, you have to go to the clinic. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5221.2s)]
*  And I said, I can't. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5222.719999999999s)]
*  I don't have the time. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5223.5199999999995s)]
*  They said, can you come back Monday? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5225.12s)]
*  I said, no, but I'll be back in two weeks. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5226.24s)]
*  So I was going to get vaccinated in two weeks. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5228.08s)]
*  And in the two weeks, they pulled it. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5230.24s)]
*  They pulled the Johnson and Johnson blood clots and two people I knew got strokes. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5231.76s)]
*  Two people. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5236.08s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5236.72s)]
*  Two people. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5237.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5237.92s)]
*  Within the 10 days of taking that vaccine, two people I knew had strokes. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5238.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5242.8s)]
*  Like healthy people, like weird blood clots. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5243.360000000001s)]
*  People were getting blood clots. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5246.400000000001s)]
*  It is true that if you were older, though, like 70 and you had some sort of like, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5248.88s)]
*  you know, I mean, comorbidity, what's the word comorbidity? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5253.92s)]
*  Comorbidity, right? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5256.8s)]
*  That they could die, right? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5257.84s)]
*  I mean, that's a true thing, right? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5259.2s)]
*  Like a Herman Cain, he died. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5261.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5262.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5263.28s)]
*  Like they die of the flu, too. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5263.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a bad cold. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5265.04s)]
*  It's not dismissing what it is. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5266.16s)]
*  But it's dismissing this control that all of a sudden the medical industrial complex [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5268.72s)]
*  and the government has over you and your job and your choices in your life. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5273.2s)]
*  For something that now they admit they could have never contained, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5278.08s)]
*  that it was never going to stop transmission, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5281.76s)]
*  that it was never going to stop infection. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5283.36s)]
*  It was all just lies. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5284.8s)]
*  They lied about the efficacy. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5286.4s)]
*  They lied about the protection and parts. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5288.32s)]
*  They put it out on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5291.04s)]
*  The virus stops with you. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5293.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't get it. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5295.2s)]
*  It's not true. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5296.48s)]
*  It was not true. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5297.2s)]
*  There was no evidence that it did that. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5297.839999999999s)]
*  Not only was there no evidence, they never even tested it for transmission. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5300.08s)]
*  They just tested it to try to see if it makes antibodies. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5304.24s)]
*  But what scared me was when Michael Yeoh, you know Michael Yeoh? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5306.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5308.879999999999s)]
*  When he was in the ICU because of COVID. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5309.28s)]
*  In my mind, I don't know why, because I know that Michael Yeoh is athletic. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5313.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5316.799999999999s)]
*  I thought to myself, oh, if he's in the ICU, I would have died. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5317.5199999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, his mom got it and she was fine. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5321.759999999999s)]
*  It's Michael Yeoh. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5325.04s)]
*  He's weak. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5325.919999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is, man. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5326.799999999999s)]
*  It could have caught him absolutely exhausted. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5328.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe, yeah. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5331.28s)]
*  That's what I've heard of people getting it really bad. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5331.839999999999s)]
*  It catches them and they go on a bender. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5333.679999999999s)]
*  And that's what happened with me. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5335.679999999999s)]
*  I was drinking until 3.30 in the morning. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5336.799999999999s)]
*  Drinking, first of all, is absolutely terrible for your body [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5340.48s)]
*  and terrible for your immune system. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5345.04s)]
*  I was drinking these five super sweet, super potent margaritas. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5348.0s)]
*  We were hammered. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5352.16s)]
*  And then actually, I came from a show too. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5354.16s)]
*  So I did a show that night. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5356.56s)]
*  I probably had a couple of drinks at the show. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5357.6s)]
*  So it's like you're not in a good place to fight off anything like that. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5359.76s)]
*  You're exhausted and drunk. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5363.92s)]
*  And then I've been sick that way many times. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5365.92s)]
*  The times in my past when I've caught a cold or caught the flu, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5368.88s)]
*  it's almost always when I'm run down. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5372.24s)]
*  Almost always. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5374.72s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5375.76s)]
*  Maybe Michael Yeoh was really run down when he got it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5376.320000000001s)]
*  I know a guy who got COVID really bad because him and his buddies were drinking. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5378.72s)]
*  They were drinking and they were partying. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5382.4800000000005s)]
*  And he was really fucked up. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5384.08s)]
*  And then the next day, COVID hit him bad. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5386.0s)]
*  But he was weak. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5387.84s)]
*  His body was weakened by a bender. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5389.92s)]
*  They were drunk all night. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5393.12s)]
*  And then in the morning, he started feeling like shit. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5394.4800000000005s)]
*  And then it caught him bad. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5396.56s)]
*  Yeah, but what I got, I was really bad. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5398.56s)]
*  But I lived through it. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5400.24s)]
*  It was fine. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5402.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5403.2s)]
*  There's a lot of different things that were at play there. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5403.68s)]
*  First of all, there was just general metabolic health that was completely ignored. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5405.84s)]
*  People told you all you have to do is get vaccinated. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5410.0s)]
*  That's horse shit. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5412.320000000001s)]
*  Your immune system is complex and it relies on a bunch of different things to keep it effective. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5414.320000000001s)]
*  It relies on good nutrition. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5419.92s)]
*  It relies on sleep. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5421.4400000000005s)]
*  It relies on low stress. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5422.64s)]
*  It relies on vitamins and nutrients, healthy diet, exercise. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5424.240000000001s)]
*  All those things were huge factors. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5428.8s)]
*  And they ignored every single one of them. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5431.2s)]
*  When you look at the number of people that died of COVID, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5433.76s)]
*  something like 90 plus percent had four plus comorbidities. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5436.88s)]
*  Four plus. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5441.84s)]
*  Cancer, diabetes, heart attack, risk. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5443.12s)]
*  Fill in the blank. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5446.16s)]
*  Four comorbidities. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5447.2s)]
*  Ninety plus percent of them. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5449.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5450.72s)]
*  It's not that it's not bad. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5451.2s)]
*  Of course it's bad. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5452.72s)]
*  But you know what's worse? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5454.0s)]
*  You motherfuckers telling everybody what they have to do and not have to do. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5455.599999999999s)]
*  You motherfuckers telling people they could shut their businesses down [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5459.6s)]
*  and they have to take this experimental medication regardless of whether or not [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5462.72s)]
*  they have natural immunity. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5466.32s)]
*  Dude, it was Gestapo shit. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5468.16s)]
*  I'm with you, but I'm with you. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5469.76s)]
*  It was fucking mind control. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5471.12s)]
*  It was totalitarian, authoritarian tactics. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5474.24s)]
*  They were limiting people's livelihood, limiting people's ability to travel, shaming people. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5478.4s)]
*  The fucking government released during Omicron, which is nothing but a cold. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5484.24s)]
*  They released this thing for the people who've been vaccinated. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5488.8s)]
*  You did your job for those unvaccinated. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5491.4400000000005s)]
*  You experience a winter. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5494.08s)]
*  What is it? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5496.16s)]
*  Severe illness and death. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5496.72s)]
*  You're looking towards a winter of severe illness and death. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5498.96s)]

*  Can I ask you why are they so reluctant to not give us a different option there? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5522.0s)]
*  Because it's control. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5527.28s)]
*  Whenever there's anything that happens in the world, whether it's 9-11 and through 9-11, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5529.5199999999995s)]
*  they passed the Patriot Act. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5533.28s)]

*  The government had full reign to listen to all your phone calls, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5541.04s)]
*  listen to read all your emails, and they're doing it right now. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5545.36s)]
*  The NSA is doing it right now. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5548.879999999999s)]
*  They can listen to any time you make a phone call to someone. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5550.639999999999s)]

*  Yeah, but when we complain like Biden's a little too old, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5554.5599999999995s)]
*  maybe can we find a different option? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5557.44s)]
*  They're just not even open to the idea of it. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5558.799999999999s)]

*  He's not in control right now. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5563.28s)]

*  why would they want to swap out a new person? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5567.44s)]
*  Deep state. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5570.16s)]
*  For real. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5571.44s)]

*  Listen, you could put whatever words you want, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5572.879999999999s)]
*  but if you don't think that these corporations that donate insane amounts of money to political [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5576.08s)]
*  campaigns have an influence on what happens in the world, you're naive. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5581.28s)]

*  Now, if you've got a guy who basically has no mind and he is your figurehead, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5586.48s)]
*  if you can keep him alive for four years, you just run it the way you're running it right now. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5592.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5596.48s)]
*  All you have to do is get that other guy arrested a ton of times. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5597.12s)]
*  Just keep arresting them, keep trumping up new charges. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5599.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5604.5599999999995s)]

*  they're going to listen. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5616.639999999999s)]
*  And then if you have mail-in ballots and if you have a voter machine shenanigans, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5618.0s)]
*  if you can fucking sway things one way or another, then you stay in power. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5622.4s)]
*  Do you? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5627.5199999999995s)]
*  You stay in power. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5628.0s)]
*  So you believe the same person stays as the figurehead and the same people run it now. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5628.72s)]
*  Do you believe the election was stolen then? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5633.44s)]
*  No. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5635.44s)]

*  Sure. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5641.599999999999s)]

*  I don't know what the number is. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5644.32s)]
*  I know Trump apparently released a whole bunch of documents showing irregularities, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5645.44s)]
*  showing that the mail-in ballots were incorrect. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5651.12s)]
*  The mail-in ballots is something Putin talked about recently. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5653.599999999999s)]

*  Sort of. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5681.28s)]
*  Took a long time. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5681.76s)]
*  The Al Gore, George Bush won. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5683.44s)]
*  How long did that go on before he conceded? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5685.92s)]
*  I want to say it was a few months. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5687.92s)]
*  I don't think it was as simple as just conceding. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5690.4s)]
*  I think the Al Gore, George Bush one, went on for quite a while, if I remember correctly. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5693.6s)]
*  Because I remember being confused. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5699.12s)]
*  Like, wow, this never happened before. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5700.400000000001s)]
*  A month or so. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5701.52s)]
*  A month. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5702.24s)]
*  A month or so, okay. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5702.64s)]
*  So... [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5703.4400000000005s)]
*  It's the 13th. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5703.68s)]
*  So think of that. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5704.72s)]
*  Think of like a whole month where they're trying to decide if it's true. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5705.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5709.12s)]
*  It's fucking weird. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5710.0s)]
*  And there was a documentary that HBO did back when Bush was president during these times. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5711.04s)]
*  Well, this was when it was okay to deny the election because it was a Republican that was in office. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5715.68s)]
*  And there was a documentary called Hacking Democracy. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5721.36s)]
*  And in that documentary, they were using... [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5724.32s)]
*  I think they were using Diebold machines. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5726.48s)]
*  And Diebold, they also make a lot of ATM machines. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5728.4s)]
*  They make various machines. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5731.04s)]
*  But what they had found in this documentary was that there was the ability to have a third party input. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5732.24s)]
*  So first party input is you, you're the voter. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5739.28s)]
*  Second party is me, I collect the vote. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5741.44s)]
*  Third party input was also there. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5743.2s)]
*  And so they used that on the documentary to change the vote. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5745.679999999999s)]
*  So they used it to change the numbers. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5751.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5753.12s)]
*  And they showed that they can do it. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5754.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5755.28s)]
*  I'll send you something, Jamie. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5756.0s)]
*  I don't know if this is true, but someone said that someone had just done this recently. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5757.12s)]
*  Here, I'll send you this because this is just something that someone tweeted. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5764.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's true, but I wanted to send it to Jamie so Jamie could research it. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5769.44s)]
*  But what this says is that in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, computer scientist and engineering professor J. Alex Halderman was able to hack a Dominion voting tabulator in front of US District Judge Amy Totenberg using only a pen to change the vote totals. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5773.84s)]
*  That happened this time? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5794.56s)]
*  Supposedly. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5796.320000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5797.68s)]
*  Now this is a tweet from just a couple of days ago. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5798.160000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5801.6s)]
*  That was a tweet from, actually a tweet from, when was it? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5802.0s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know if that's true, but that's crazy if it is. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5807.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5812.32s)]
*  This is actually from two days ago. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5812.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5815.12s)]
*  This person tweeted this. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5815.52s)]
*  Now we'll look, see if that's horseshit, and see what, but here's the thing. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5817.04s)]
*  When you have computers, if you have a phone, like with Pegasus, Pegasus was the first one that, by the way, the Israelis created Pegasus. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5821.76s)]
*  And Pegasus was a software that, that's what they used to get Jeff Bezos when they got his dick pics and all that shit. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5830.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, good ones, good ones. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5836.88s)]
*  Good ones. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5838.240000000001s)]
*  It's kind of solid. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5838.72s)]
*  When they did that with him, what they did was someone sent him a link in WhatsApp. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5840.56s)]
*  I think it was the head of Saudi Arabia, sent him, allegedly, sent him a link in WhatsApp. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5845.92s)]
*  He clicked the link and then Pegasus was downloaded on his phone. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5850.88s)]
*  Now you don't even have to click a link anymore. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5854.240000000001s)]
*  Now they can get Pegasus on your phone. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5857.36s)]
*  All they need is your phone number. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5859.44s)]
*  I could have Pegasus now? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5861.36s)]
*  They probably do. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5862.719999999999s)]
*  You probably do. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5863.44s)]
*  You have it? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5864.24s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5864.96s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5865.599999999999s)]
*  How do we detect it? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5866.719999999999s)]
*  Is there an app? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5867.599999999999s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5868.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5869.04s)]
*  I think, according to Gavin De Becker, who's a securities expert, these things are constantly evolving and they get better all the time. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5870.08s)]
*  They don't tell you when they're better. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5877.5199999999995s)]
*  They just have better technology. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5880.08s)]
*  But he's aware of Pegasus too. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5882.16s)]
*  And he said with Pegasus too, all they need is your phone number. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5884.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5886.96s)]
*  But Joe, can I ask you something? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5888.08s)]
*  Can you just shut it off and not... [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5895.12s)]
*  I mean, there's so many people in this country just walk around and they just don't... [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5897.759999999999s)]
*  All these things that we're talking about right now, they don't think about it. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5902.32s)]
*  They just live their lives. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5904.639999999999s)]
*  Don't you think that that's a happier life for now? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5906.08s)]
*  Depends on whether or not your voice actually matters. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5910.639999999999s)]
*  So if you can change the way people think and you can change the way people look at things, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5915.84s)]
*  and then those people vote in such mass numbers that you can't make stealing the vote possible. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5920.32s)]
*  Because enough people realize it's horse shit to the point where the overwhelming majority... [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5928.08s)]
*  You would have to have fraud that's so apparent that no one would buy into it. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5932.32s)]
*  It'd be a national scandal. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5936.8s)]
*  We need whistleblowers. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5939.44s)]
*  We have them. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5941.04s)]
*  We put them in jail. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5941.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5942.8s)]
*  Look at Edward Snowden. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5943.76s)]
*  He has to live in Russia now. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5944.8s)]
*  Look at Julian Assange. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5946.4800000000005s)]
*  He's fucked. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5947.6s)]
*  They've been prosecuting that guy forever. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5948.96s)]
*  And if you ask what the crime is, it's nothing. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5950.88s)]
*  He's a journalist. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5954.08s)]
*  I just feel so stressed out right now. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5955.12s)]
*  Why? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5958.0s)]
*  Because that's the reality that we live in. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5959.6s)]
*  It's stressing me out. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5960.88s)]
*  That's the reality that we live in. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5962.320000000001s)]
*  We live in a very dangerous, complicated world. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5964.0s)]
*  Halderbyn, a University of Michigan computer scientist, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5966.4800000000005s)]
*  changed results of a hypothetical referendum on Sunday alcohol sales. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5968.96s)]
*  He flipped the winner in a theoretical election between President George Washington [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5973.04s)]
*  and Benedict Arnold, the Revolutionary War general who defected to the British. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5977.12s)]
*  He rigged the machine to print out as many ballots as he wanted. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5980.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5984.0s)]
*  All he needed was a pen to reach a button inside the touchscreen, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5985.84s)]
*  a fake $10 voter card that he had programmed, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5989.92s)]
*  or a $100 USB device that he plugged into a cord connected to a printer, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5992.64s)]
*  rewriting the touchscreen's code. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=5997.76s)]
*  Halderbyn delivered his presentation during an election security trial evaluating whether [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6000.88s)]
*  Georgia's voting system is vulnerable to manipulation or programming errors. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6005.84s)]
*  All in-person voters in Georgia make their choices on touchscreens that print out paper ballots. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6009.84s)]
*  I believe Georgia was supposed to update their machines. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6015.36s)]
*  And then there was a talk of when they were going to do it. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6020.16s)]
*  And I think it's also taken into consideration other than just corruption. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6023.12s)]
*  It might also be a budget issue. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6027.36s)]
*  Well, the headline says election officials say these vulnerabilities are merely speculative. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6029.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, merely speculative. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6034.96s)]
*  It's safe and effective. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6036.16s)]
*  Our election is safe and effective. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6037.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6039.280000000001s)]
*  These people dropping dead, 40% increase in all cause mortalities. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6039.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6044.320000000001s)]
*  Ages 18 to 34, it's nothing to concern yourself with. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6044.72s)]
*  That's normal. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6047.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6048.8s)]
*  But it's merely speculative. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6049.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6051.12s)]
*  These people all have your best interest in mind. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6051.92s)]
*  Is that a cigar? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6054.8s)]
*  These are little baby cigars. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6055.76s)]
*  Can I have one? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6056.64s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6057.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6057.52s)]
*  You're okay with nicotine cigars? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6058.34s)]
*  I'm not going to inhale it. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6060.1s)]
*  You want a real cigar? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6060.900000000001s)]
*  A big one? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6061.620000000001s)]
*  No, the little ones. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6062.18s)]
*  You want like a real cigar? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6063.3s)]
*  I like them. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6064.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, why don't you have one of these? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6066.5s)]
*  Is Cuban? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6067.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6068.02s)]
*  No, these are from Nicaragua. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6068.34s)]
*  These are JRE cigars. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6070.42s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6071.540000000001s)]
*  They're actually really good. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6071.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6073.06s)]
*  Here, I'll open it for you. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6073.700000000001s)]
*  This is what I think, man. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6075.540000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6076.660000000001s)]
*  I think evil's real. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6077.06s)]
*  And I think evil exists in many forms and exists in callous disregard for loss of life for profit. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6079.3s)]
*  That's evil, right? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6085.620000000001s)]
*  And that's a real thing. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6086.9s)]
*  Like you could say evil is the devil. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6088.259999999999s)]
*  Here's a little lighter here, buddy. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6090.0199999999995s)]
*  You could say evil is Satan and evil is demons and evil is, you know, exorcisms and shit. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6093.54s)]
*  But also, evil is profit over human life, which is real. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6101.299999999999s)]
*  Evil is cobalt mines in the Congo. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6106.339999999999s)]
*  When you watch pregnant women mining for cobalt, getting toxic fumes in their lungs, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6109.46s)]
*  some of them have babies on their back. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6114.740000000001s)]
*  That's evil. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6116.26s)]
*  That's evil. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6117.14s)]
*  They're living in dirt floors with no sanitation. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6117.700000000001s)]
*  It's horrific conditions. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6121.14s)]
*  And that is in everybody's cell phone. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6122.740000000001s)]
*  And everyone's cell phone is the labor of essentially people so poor, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6125.780000000001s)]
*  they don't have to choose whether they're slaves or not. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6130.9800000000005s)]
*  They just have, there's no other option for them to work. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6133.22s)]
*  But there's a powerlessness that one feels like, what is little Bobby Lee going to do [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6136.02s)]
*  about any of this? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6142.66s)]
*  So it's like a lot of times I'm just like, you know, everything that you said, I'm with you. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6143.38s)]
*  But I'm just saying that like, it stresses me out. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6147.38s)]
*  It should. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6149.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And I walk and I want to walk around a little bit more free and, you know. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6150.66s)]
*  You deserve that. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6155.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6156.18s)]
*  You're a comedian, man. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6156.5s)]
*  You provide laughter and you help people. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6157.78s)]
*  And if it's fucking you up, knowing about all this shit that's happening in the world, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6160.9800000000005s)]
*  that can get in the way of your job. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6165.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6167.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6168.74s)]
*  It's not an obligation to pay attention to everything. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6170.74s)]
*  But it is something that I think would help people break out of the cult. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6173.860000000001s)]
*  Because that cult, it's like, you think you're a good person if you buy hook, line, and sinker, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6178.5s)]
*  everything that the left says. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6183.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6184.740000000001s)]
*  These are the same people that want war. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6186.5s)]
*  These are the same people that are encouraging censorship. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6189.22s)]
*  These are the same people that are trying to silence dissent. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6191.860000000001s)]
*  That's all totalitarian shit. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6196.5s)]
*  And just because it's done for trans kids or for Black Lives Matter or for any [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6198.42s)]
*  social cause that you think is undeniably worthy, it's still the same thing at the end of the day. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6202.82s)]
*  The Patriot Act still controlled people in a way that was never allowed before. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6210.0199999999995s)]
*  And it did it under the guise that we have to stop a terrorist attack. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6215.7s)]
*  So even if they don't do evil shit to make these things happen, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6218.74s)]
*  once these things happen, they take advantage by doing evil shit. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6222.9s)]
*  And they enact control over the people that they never had before. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6226.9s)]
*  And that's what they did during COVID. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6230.66s)]
*  And the redistribution of wealth was insane. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6232.98s)]
*  Redistribution of wealth to big corporations and companies. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6236.42s)]
*  Gates profited bad. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6238.58s)]
*  Oh my god, so many people. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6239.62s)]
*  The billions of dollars was moved. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6241.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow, it just stresses me out. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6244.82s)]
*  You want to talk about the movie? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6246.099999999999s)]
*  Can we talk about the movie I'm promoting? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6250.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6252.98s)]
*  What's your movie, Bobby? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6254.42s)]
*  I'm barely in it. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6257.38s)]
*  And they're making me, you know what I mean? [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6260.42s)]
*  But they're making you do promo and you're barely in it? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6262.26s)]
*  Well, I have four scenes. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6264.26s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6265.22s)]
*  It's called Drugstore June. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6265.94s)]
*  What's it about? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6268.34s)]
*  It's about a girl, Esther. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6270.26s)]
*  And she works at a pharmacy. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6273.94s)]
*  I play the main pharmacist. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6276.74s)]
*  And it's basically she plays sort of like a Gen Z girl that's kind of out of touch. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6278.98s)]
*  It's kind of like a Juno, but more modern. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6283.06s)]
*  And what I like about a show is this, okay? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6285.94s)]
*  It's just that, you know, I... [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6288.26s)]
*  Can I talk about Hollywood real quick? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6291.780000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6293.14s)]
*  They're still gatekeepers, right? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6295.780000000001s)]
*  And for me, it's like, I think I'm perceived as dangerous. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6298.02s)]
*  I don't know why, because I'm on a podcast. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6302.820000000001s)]
*  I say shit, right? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6304.66s)]
*  And it's like, I'm always the fourth option. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6306.5s)]
*  It goes Ronnie, Jimmy, Ken Jeong, right? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6309.46s)]
*  And I like acting, right? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6312.26s)]
*  So it's like, I think this is cool because it's like, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6313.62s)]
*  everyone that's involved in it are dear friends of mine. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6316.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6319.06s)]
*  Pretty much everyone in the movie are people like Miss Pat and people that I know. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6319.7s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6322.82s)]
*  And it's cool to like have... [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6323.46s)]
*  Look at you. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6324.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6325.22s)]
*  Let's watch the trailer. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6326.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6327.46s)]
*  If you were gonna give me a consultation for plastic surgery... [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6329.3s)]
*  It's not what I do here. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6333.14s)]
*  But just if you were, what do you think you would do to my face? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6334.34s)]
*  I'd probably start with your mouth. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6338.42s)]
*  A lip filler? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6340.1s)]
*  No, I would sew that sucker shut. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6340.98s)]
*  I'm a loser. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6345.54s)]
*  Your Facebook group is right. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6354.98s)]
*  I have no life. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6356.5s)]
*  What did you ever see in this psycho? [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6357.94s)]
*  One, two... [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6362.1s)]
*  Oh, I messed it up. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6363.46s)]
*  I need a coffee break. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6364.66s)]
*  You haven't even clocked in yet. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6365.7s)]
*  I haven't been getting paid for any of this. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6367.14s)]
*  Give me a double macchiato. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6369.78s)]
*  I brought you some hot chocolate. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6373.14s)]
*  I'm connecting my stream. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6375.54s)]

*  Goodbye, June Squad. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6377.3s)]

*  Ew! [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6383.46s)]
*  I heard the pharmacy got robbed. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6386.26s)]
*  Miss Pat. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6387.86s)]

*  And I remember a wardrobe lady looked at me. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6677.22s)]
*  She goes, I'm so sorry. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6678.9800000000005s)]

*  He grabbed my face aggressively. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6687.22s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6689.14s)]
*  Why? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6690.1s)]
*  What did you do to him? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6690.66s)]
*  Did you grab his balls? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6691.54s)]
*  Did you wake up with him sucking on his balls? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6693.22s)]
*  I don't do that. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6695.3s)]
*  I do that for comics. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6696.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6697.62s)]
*  I don't do it when I'm like, no, I did this. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6698.1s)]
*  So I booked this commercial with Eric Stone street. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6700.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6703.46s)]

*  Okay. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6705.38s)]
*  He plays the fat gay guy. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6706.26s)]
*  Sure. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6707.46s)]
*  So we played tower boys with Kim Cattrall. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6708.58s)]
*  So it was a, I forgot it was a Pepsi commercial, I think. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6712.820000000001s)]
*  And she was in this bathtub and I had never acted before. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6715.62s)]
*  You know, Joe, like I'm a stand. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6718.5s)]
*  I come from the same place you come, which is open mics. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6719.9400000000005s)]
*  And I didn't. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6723.9400000000005s)]
*  I didn't learn how to act. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6725.7s)]
*  I don't know the fuck that. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6728.1s)]
*  I don't know what a jib camera is or a mark or any of that shit. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6729.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6732.42s)]
*  So I had this scene where I had to bring these. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6732.9s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6734.58s)]
*  I had to bring these towels into a, you know, you're like stacked. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6735.86s)]
*  It's that with the Joe. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6738.82s)]
*  And he would go, your face needs to be in the light. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6740.42s)]
*  And I go, oh, I don't know. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6744.42s)]
*  So I try to tilt every tape. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6746.9800000000005s)]
*  The light, the light. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6749.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6752.74s)]
*  And then like by the eighth one, he came from behind the thing [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6753.3s)]
*  and he grabbed my face like this. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6756.1s)]
*  He goes here, here. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6757.78s)]
*  And like tears. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6760.1s)]
*  Well, no, don't feel bad for me. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6762.42s)]
*  I'm a survivor. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6764.66s)]
*  That's your Holocaust. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6767.06s)]
*  That was your movie. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6769.38s)]
*  And Michael Bay tells you to put your face towards the light. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6770.9800000000005s)]
*  But in the nineties, I experienced that shit. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6773.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6775.860000000001s)]
*  Well, that seems like you really weren't putting your face towards the light. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6776.5s)]
*  And he was freaking out because they could only do that take so many times. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6779.3s)]
*  I'm kind of on team Bay. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6782.580000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6784.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6785.3s)]
*  He just turned your face. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6785.46s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6786.42s)]

*  Right. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6846.5s)]
*  And I'll do it. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6847.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6848.1s)]
*  So it's not like that crazy bullshit where I need. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6848.42s)]
*  Back then I needed it. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6851.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6852.18s)]
*  When someone would say something horrible to you, you just have to swallow it. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6852.82s)]
*  You would absorb it. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6854.98s)]
*  But there's also no recourse back then. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6856.18s)]
*  I mean, that's how you get to like a Harvey Weinstein. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6858.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6861.7s)]
*  A guy who has just ultimate control, can do whatever the fuck he wants. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6862.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6866.74s)]
*  And does. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6867.22s)]
*  Ruins people's lives and careers if they don't accept his advances. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6868.02s)]
*  That's where I mean, that whole business has always been about powerful people [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6872.900000000001s)]
*  abusing the people that they that had to listen to them from casting directors all the way up to [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6877.3s)]
*  producers. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6884.580000000001s)]
*  It was different then. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6884.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6885.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6886.18s)]
*  Look, Tarantino was in here and he's talking about this old school director who had his [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6887.14s)]
*  office had a bedroom where you take the starlets, all the starlets had to fuck them. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6891.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6897.46s)]
*  In a bedroom in his fucking office. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6898.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6900.18s)]
*  So everyone just assumed if a casting, you know, thing was going on, a girl came into his office, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6900.58s)]
*  he fucked her. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6905.86s)]
*  And 20 years ago, I would have done it, I think. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6906.66s)]
*  You think so? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6908.34s)]
*  I think that if I think that it was a huge director. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6909.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6915.86s)]
*  You wouldn't have fucked him? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6916.099999999999s)]
*  No, I would suck his dick. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6917.139999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6918.18s)]
*  Really? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6918.5s)]
*  I think I wouldn't say I wouldn't tell you. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6919.54s)]
*  Well, there's definitely. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6921.7s)]
*  I would just cry. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6922.9s)]
*  You could have filled some offers if that was out there. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6923.62s)]
*  What? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6926.099999999999s)]
*  You could have gotten some offers if that was out there. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6926.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6929.3s)]
*  Maybe you weren't like open enough with your desire to make it. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6929.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6933.46s)]
*  I just think that back then I was like so like I had no money. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6934.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6937.94s)]
*  And then in my mind I'll be like, oh, this is the way it's supposed to happen. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6938.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6942.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6942.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6942.74s)]
*  So I mean, imagine if you're an actress, right? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6943.0599999999995s)]
*  And you come out to Hollywood from fucking Kansas. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6945.22s)]
*  You're 20 years old and you are all of a sudden in this producer's office and he's 50 and he's [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6948.099999999999s)]
*  been banging stars for 20 fucking years and you don't know how it all works and he explains [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6955.3s)]
*  to you, listen, honey, this is how it works in this business. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6961.54s)]
*  You're like, well, I mean, okay, do you want to be an actress? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6964.1s)]
*  And you're kind of mentally ill anyway. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6967.22s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6968.9800000000005s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, I do so much. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6969.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6971.62s)]
*  No one has to know about this. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6972.02s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6973.22s)]
*  You won't tell anybody. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6973.54s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6974.34s)]
*  It's fucking terrible. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6974.820000000001s)]
*  And that's probably what they did forever. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6976.18s)]
*  It's so fucking terrible. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6978.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6980.1s)]
*  And I mean, I mean, I know, you know, we have problems with the word woke, but, you know, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6980.58s)]
*  I think in many ways, Hollywood wokeness is also good. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6984.34s)]
*  Yeah, that way. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6990.58s)]
*  I think now in a stopping the abuse way. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6991.3s)]
*  But the problem is there's like in Hollywood, particularly, there was an overcorrection [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6993.7s)]
*  and crazy people like Amber Heard got involved. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6997.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=6999.860000000001s)]
*  Manipulating the truth to sort of gain sympathy. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7000.42s)]
*  You've got a lot of those cases too. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7003.54s)]
*  The Chris Hardwick case. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7006.02s)]
*  There's a lot of those where the reality is so different than the truth. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7007.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7011.3s)]
*  And everybody just assumes that the woman's not insane and that she's telling the truth. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7011.62s)]
*  But you're going to have to have a few of those if you're going to have to have real change, [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7017.3s)]
*  like a real correction of actual abuse. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7021.86s)]
*  You're going to, it's just like, if you're going to like accept trans people, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7024.82s)]
*  you're going to have a bunch of instances of perverts pretending to be trans. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7028.58s)]
*  If you're going to say, hey, we have to stop abuse, you're going to get fake abuse. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7032.66s)]
*  You're going to get people to come out and say they're abused. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7036.18s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7037.86s)]
*  And that's the way Hollywood is like. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7039.0599999999995s)]
*  It's the way humans are. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7041.46s)]
*  It's the way humans are. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7042.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7043.46s)]
*  But in the sense of like a show like Beef getting green lit, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7043.78s)]
*  with some mostly all Korean or Asian cast, I think in that way it's good. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7047.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7052.1s)]
*  But there is an overcorrection in terms of like. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7052.74s)]
*  It's good because that show is good. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7054.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7057.06s)]
*  That's why it's good. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7057.62s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7058.42s)]
*  It's good when the show's good. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7058.9800000000005s)]
*  But even if the show was good back then, 20 years ago, they would never have even. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7060.02s)]
*  That's true. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7062.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7063.54s)]
*  They would never wrote it. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7063.7s)]
*  Better about acceptance. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7064.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7065.7s)]
*  But it's still, I think art has to be particularly stand up is the best example I can speak about [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7066.42s)]
*  that. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7072.9s)]
*  It has to be a meritocracy. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7073.14s)]
*  It has to be what is actually funny. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7074.82s)]
*  At the mothership, we have a fucking very clear mandate. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7076.9800000000005s)]
*  No one gives a fuck if you are gay, if you are straight, if you are trans, if you are black, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7080.1s)]
*  if you are Asian, if you're white, they don't give a fuck. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7085.06s)]
*  Are you funny? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7088.18s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7089.22s)]
*  Are you funny? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7090.02s)]
*  And that's our goal. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7090.66s)]
*  The goal is and that's what comedy used to be. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7091.78s)]
*  I had this conversation with Ali Wong once and she was like, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7094.42s)]
*  do you think comedy is a meritocracy? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7096.58s)]
*  I was like, ultimately it has to be because at the end of the day, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7097.86s)]
*  what's funny is what people are going to come see again. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7102.74s)]
*  You could pander and you can get away, you can kind of like be half assed and be treated [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7106.179999999999s)]
*  like you're better than you are. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7110.58s)]
*  You see that all the time when they make those lists of the best stand up specials of the year [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7111.86s)]
*  and some of them like, what the fuck are you saying? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7115.86s)]
*  You're so crazy if you think this is good. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7120.9s)]
*  They're only saying it because it's the right demographic. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7123.7s)]
*  You can say that if they're talking about the right points, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7127.38s)]
*  even if the stand up is clunky and awful and unoriginal and just garbage, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7130.42s)]
*  they'll tell you it's amazing. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7135.62s)]
*  I don't want to kiss your ass. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7138.02s)]
*  May I for a second though? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7139.06s)]
*  Just accept it. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7141.7s)]
*  I feel like, here we go. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7144.42s)]
*  I love it. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7150.82s)]
*  I love it. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7151.38s)]
*  Just hear me out. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7152.900000000001s)]
*  I just feel like in a way, you carved the way for me specifically [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7154.58s)]
*  because before I did Tiger Valley and Bad Friends, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7162.58s)]
*  Joe, I'll be honest with you. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7167.38s)]
*  I would do half rooms. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7168.74s)]
*  Even though the eight years of Mad TV and all the things I had done, [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7171.22s)]
*  and I couldn't get an audience. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7175.38s)]
*  Right? [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7177.46s)]
*  And now, it's just like, it's night and day. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7178.259999999999s)]
*  The path that you laid down, and even back then, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7183.54s)]
*  when we used to do it at the Ice House, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7186.66s)]
*  and it used to pop in back in the day, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7188.34s)]
*  it's sort of like, I think it just subconsciously absorbed it [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7191.139999999999s)]
*  and it became a path for me and it changed my life. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7195.62s)]
*  That's beautiful to hear. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7199.46s)]
*  What? [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7200.42s)]
*  That's beautiful to hear. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7200.82s)]
*  And when I go on the road now, it's like I get people that are really... [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7201.7s)]
*  They're fans. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7205.219999999999s)]
*  They know me. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7205.7s)]
*  They love me and I love them as well, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7207.62s)]
*  it's a different fucking deal. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7209.86s)]
*  You are a creature of the internet. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7211.299999999999s)]
*  I am. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7213.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you should be. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7213.7s)]
*  And the internet changed the game. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7214.82s)]
*  The internet also made it, instead of a famine thing, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7216.099999999999s)]
*  people had an abundance mentality. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7219.7s)]
*  Because when we first started in the 90s, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7222.259999999999s)]
*  there was only a few shows you could get on. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7224.74s)]
*  You got on Mad TV, I got on News Radio, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7226.9s)]
*  there's only a few shows. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7229.139999999999s)]
*  And you were really lucky if you were on a show. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7230.42s)]
*  I remember we would talk about it all the time, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7232.42s)]
*  like, oh my God, I'm so lucky. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7233.94s)]
*  Miracle. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7235.299999999999s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7236.34s)]
*  We're on TV, oh my God, we're so lucky. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7237.22s)]
*  But there was other people that didn't get your spot, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7239.46s)]
*  and they hated it, and they were mad at you. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7242.9s)]
*  Like, if you cast for Mad TV and other comics at the club, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7246.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, I know you experienced that. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7249.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7251.0599999999995s)]
*  And they were fucking jealous and bitter, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7251.46s)]
*  and they would talk shit about you. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7253.46s)]
*  He fucking sucks on that show, he doesn't do anything. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7255.3s)]
*  And they're just angry that it didn't happen to them, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7257.38s)]
*  because it could have happened to them. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7259.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7260.74s)]
*  Now, instead of that, now we're valuable to each other, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7261.96s)]
*  because now we're a community of podcasters and comedians. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7265.96s)]
*  And instead of us being, like, in competition with each other, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7269.5599999999995s)]
*  we all feed off of each other, and we all support each other. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7272.84s)]
*  It's a much better environment for stand-up, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7276.28s)]
*  it's a much better environment for comedy clubs. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7278.599999999999s)]
*  It's like everything's better now. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7281.96s)]
*  It's also the connection with East Coast, too. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7283.96s)]
*  It's like before, I felt like there was like a rivalry almost, right? [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7286.12s)]
*  And now it's like, when I go to New York, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7289.88s)]
*  as soon as I land, I don't even call, [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7292.6s)]
*  the seller will call me and go, what spots do you want? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7296.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7298.76s)]
*  And then all the comments will come by, let's pod. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7299.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7302.2s)]
*  It's like a family. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7302.6s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7303.4800000000005s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7303.8s)]
*  Yeah, that happened during the podcast revolution. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7304.52s)]
*  That's what changed everything. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7307.400000000001s)]
*  You think it's going down now? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7308.6s)]
*  Going down? [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7310.28s)]
*  The podcast revolution. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7311.08s)]
*  Yeah, are we still on? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7312.04s)]
*  It's happening. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7312.52s)]
*  I know. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7313.16s)]
*  Are we on downswing or upswing? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7313.96s)]
*  No, it's not on downswing at all. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7315.16s)]
*  If you pay attention to the numbers, [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7317.56s)]
*  more people are listening now than ever. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7318.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7320.36s)]
*  All the podcasts. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7320.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7321.8s)]
*  It's awesome. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7322.2s)]
*  And it's awesome because you get to see people for who they really are. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7323.16s)]
*  No bullshit, no filter, no nonsense. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7327.16s)]
*  You can't nonsense people for three hours. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7329.96s)]
*  At a certain point in time, your fucking demons will show their ugly face. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7333.08s)]
*  It's really who you are. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7338.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7339.72s)]
*  It also shapes who you are because you get to kind of like experience feedback [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7339.96s)]
*  and examine how you think about things and why you say the things you say [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7343.96s)]
*  and how much of the in the early days, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7348.04s)]
*  like how much of what we used to say was just for shock value. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7349.719999999999s)]
*  Like you would go on a morning radio show. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7351.96s)]
*  I do. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7354.12s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7354.679999999999s)]
*  We would try to say as shocking things as we could because that was the way to get attention, [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7355.4s)]
*  especially like Opie and Anthony. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7359.24s)]
*  I know. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7360.5199999999995s)]
*  I know. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7361.799999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7362.28s)]
*  We don't have to talk about it. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7362.5199999999995s)]
*  I know. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7363.24s)]
*  We don't. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7363.719999999999s)]
*  It's no, I could vaguely go around it. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7364.04s)]
*  I'm just like at the time. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7366.599999999999s)]
*  We all did it. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7368.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7369.32s)]
*  I was a survivor. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7369.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7370.92s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is the culture. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7371.48s)]
*  Yeah, this is the culture. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7373.32s)]
*  And also I'm like an LA comic. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7374.12s)]
*  I'm an open with beasts, Patrice Norton, all those guys were fucking beasts. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7375.8s)]
*  And it's like, you know, and then, you know, at the time, you know, and then later. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7382.2s)]
*  And then now, you know, but it's like. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7386.76s)]
*  But now it's a much more honest thing. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7389.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7391.16s)]
*  Because now you do your own thing, right? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7391.400000000001s)]
*  And if people want to see Bobby, they know how to find Bobby and they go. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7394.12s)]
*  They seek you out. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7397.8s)]
*  So it's not like some random person's tuning in. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7398.92s)]
*  Like, who's this guy? [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7401.56s)]
*  And then you have to say something crazy to get attention. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7402.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7404.6s)]
*  Now it's just you could be yourself. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7405.16s)]
*  You know, that's the difference. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7407.24s)]
*  Like, if you got a million views on Tiger Belly, that's a million people that really [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7408.12s)]
*  want to watch your show. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7412.36s)]
*  That's not random. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7413.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7414.92s)]
*  You know, if you get a million people that are on like some Comedy Central show, a million [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7415.16s)]
*  people watching that, they're flipping channels. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7418.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7420.76s)]
*  They like how many of them are looking forward to it? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7420.92s)]
*  How many of them just stumbled upon it? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7423.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7425.16s)]
*  It's probably quite a bit. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7425.48s)]
*  Most shows don't have like loyal, dedicated viewers. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7427.32s)]
*  Unless they like streaming shows. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7431.8s)]

*  And please, consider moving here, man. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7788.04s)]
*  It's a thing. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7791.24s)]
*  Like I said, Theo's considerate, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7791.8s)]
*  Paul is considerate. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7793.32s)]
*  We have some tour. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7794.28s)]
*  Paulie Shore is a different human being now. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7795.16s)]
*  I know. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7797.16s)]
*  Paulie Shore is so loose and so friendly and so silly on stage. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7797.48s)]
*  Oh, I love him. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7800.68s)]
*  And he's killing. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7801.240000000001s)]
*  I love him. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7802.6s)]
*  He went up in the little boy, the little room, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7803.240000000001s)]
*  and I hadn't seen him in years. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7805.8s)]
*  And I go, dude, that was so funny. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7807.0s)]
*  You were so loose. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7808.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7809.88s)]
*  And he's like, at the comic store, I was always tense. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7810.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7812.6s)]
*  It's like, it's hard for me to be free. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7812.92s)]
*  He's a different person. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7814.52s)]
*  Also, I wouldn't be in this business without him and that family. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7816.6s)]
*  Her. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7820.76s)]
*  I mean, that's why she's here. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7821.160000000001s)]
*  She said two things to me as a young comic. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7822.360000000001s)]
*  It's a sin to support mediocrity. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7826.280000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7829.4s)]
*  I still don't know what it means, but I still have it in my heart. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7830.2s)]
*  But then one day I was at Bully's restaurant in La Jolla with her. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7834.36s)]
*  I was when Freddie Soto used to drive her down, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7838.679999999999s)]
*  he would go, come eat with us. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7841.5599999999995s)]
*  I miss Freddie so much. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7843.639999999999s)]
*  I do, too. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7844.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7845.32s)]
*  And so one day we were sitting there at Bully's restaurant in La Jolla, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7846.12s)]
*  and she goes, do you know what makes a star? [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7848.839999999999s)]
*  I go, what? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7851.96s)]
*  She goes, 50% of the people have to love you, [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7852.5199999999995s)]
*  but it's OK with that other half hates you. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7855.32s)]
*  It's all in the same. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7857.72s)]
*  And it's like when I read bad comments now on, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7860.360000000001s)]
*  because I get some because I've risen, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7863.08s)]
*  I just take that into the thing that it's like it's attention. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7866.280000000001s)]
*  It's not personal. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7870.76s)]
*  You know what I would tell you to do? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7871.88s)]
*  Don't read them. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7873.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7874.4400000000005s)]
*  Don't read it. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7875.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7875.88s)]
*  So you don't read? [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7876.68s)]
*  No, no. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7877.56s)]
*  I don't read articles about me. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7878.76s)]
*  I don't read shit. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7880.04s)]
*  But if you read it, would it hurt your feelings? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7880.76s)]
*  It could. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7882.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it could. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7883.320000000001s)]
*  OK. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7883.96s)]
*  It could bother you. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7884.280000000001s)]
*  All right. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7885.16s)]
*  You're a human being. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7885.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7886.6s)]
*  Someone says something, especially if it's not true, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7887.16s)]
*  and it's influencing people in a fucked up way, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7889.24s)]
*  or it paints the least charitable version of you. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7891.88s)]
*  People also don't realize that I'm a sensitive guy. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7894.44s)]
*  We're all sensitive. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7896.68s)]
*  We're sensitive, too. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7897.4s)]
*  That's why they're lashing out. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7898.28s)]
*  The reason why they're writing mean shit [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7899.72s)]
*  is because they know what hurts them. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7901.8s)]
*  A kind person, a happy person, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7904.36s)]
*  wouldn't be writing shitty things about you. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7906.599999999999s)]
*  They're doing it because they're, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7909.08s)]
*  it's that old expression, hurt people hurt people. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7910.28s)]
*  But when they make shit up, dude, the other day I read, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7912.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7915.24s)]
*  I read this. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7916.2s)]
*  This is what I read. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7916.68s)]
*  I heard Bobby Lee abuses his animals. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7917.88s)]
*  OK. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7921.24s)]
*  Like, why are the? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7921.72s)]
*  Because they want to hurt your feelings. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7922.599999999999s)]
*  They want you to get angry. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7924.44s)]
*  I get my cats no boo. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7925.4s)]
*  I believe you. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7926.92s)]
*  Shishini, dude. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7928.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7929.0s)]
*  I get them the best. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7929.88s)]
*  I go, what's the most expensive shit? [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7930.84s)]
*  The healthiest shit. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7932.5199999999995s)]
*  But should they have all those oils and stuff on them? [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7933.32s)]
*  It's not an everyday event. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7935.32s)]
*  You know, every other month. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7937.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7938.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7939.0s)]
*  Like, gooners boo. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7939.48s)]
*  Isn't it weird that cats hate water, but they love fish? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7940.36s)]
*  It's kind of crazy, right? [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7944.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7945.16s)]
*  They love fish. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7946.120000000001s)]
*  They love fish. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7946.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7947.400000000001s)]
*  They don't want you on nowhere near that fucking water. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7947.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7949.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7950.68s)]
*  Anyway, I don't abuse my animals. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7951.56s)]
*  I love animals more. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7953.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7954.120000000001s)]
*  But it's like insane. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7954.52s)]
*  Of course you don't. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7955.8s)]
*  Of course you don't. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7956.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7957.0s)]
*  So I don't read it. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7957.320000000001s)]
*  And just don't read it because even if you read a hundred things [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7958.200000000001s)]
*  that are awesome, one that sucks is going to stick in your head. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7962.120000000001s)]
*  Because that's how a human mind is designed. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7966.04s)]
*  It's designed to find danger in conflict and look out for it. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7968.6s)]
*  Because it could hurt you. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7972.200000000001s)]
*  And so when you see that one thing, that's the thing you're going to concentrate on. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7973.96s)]
*  It's the one person that hates you. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7976.84s)]
*  Why do they hate me? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7978.2s)]
*  Oh my god, what if they're near me? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7979.24s)]
*  That feeling of hate is the same feeling that you would get if there's someone that's dangerous. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7980.679999999999s)]
*  It's from another tribe that's looking at you over the hill. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7985.4s)]
*  And you think they might want to kill you. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7988.44s)]
*  Like, oh fuck. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7989.719999999999s)]
*  And you have to think about them. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7990.84s)]
*  You don't think about your friends that love you. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7991.96s)]
*  You think about the danger. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7993.96s)]
*  And that's natural. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7995.48s)]
*  It's a natural inclination of the human mind. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7996.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7999.08s)]
*  So you do that with social media too. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=7999.48s)]
*  You don't seek out the danger then? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8001.24s)]
*  No. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8002.52s)]
*  Don't do it. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8002.84s)]
*  And don't spread it either. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8003.400000000001s)]
*  The people that spread it, you don't realize what you're doing. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8004.6s)]
*  But you're also affecting yourself. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8008.120000000001s)]
*  Because you know that what you're doing. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8010.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, this is like the person going after some legitimate Nazi or something. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8011.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8015.88s)]
*  Most of the time when people are attacking, they're attacking someone to try to hurt them [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8016.52s)]
*  because they know that they can be hurt too. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8021.240000000001s)]
*  And it's like a lot of the people that are doing this shit on social media all day long, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8023.88s)]
*  we know them. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8028.040000000001s)]
*  They're mentally ill people. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8029.0s)]

*  They're full of shit. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8040.28s)]
*  They're on medication and in therapy. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8042.2s)]
*  And they're just lashing out at other people's behavior. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8044.36s)]
*  And it's like they don't realize that to be a good person also means to be nice to everybody. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8047.5599999999995s)]
*  It doesn't just because someone has a differing view on something. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8054.2s)]

*  But people do that because they're terrified of that happening to them. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8060.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8063.8s)]
*  And I also don't like when people try to do things like that, I'm not mad at them either. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8064.360000000001s)]
*  I don't have like thoughts of revenge or anything. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8068.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rvwbzZdJ8&t=8071.56s)]
