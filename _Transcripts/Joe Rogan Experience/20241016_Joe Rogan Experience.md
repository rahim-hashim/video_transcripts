# Joe Rogan Experience #2214 - Shane Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCq5lKpkUaI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  What's up?
*  How are you?
*  Good to see you.
*  Good to see you.
*  What you been up to, man?
*  That's a loaded question.
*  I'm doing a podcast now.
*  You are doing a podcast now?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  When did you start?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  A couple months ago.
*  What made you want to do that?
*  Just got tired of being on the outside?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Looking in?
*  That's it.
*  So that's it?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you actually, I'm going to paraphrase you, so you got to tell me the exact quote.
*  Okay.
*  But you said COVID was a fucked up time.
*  And I went in thinking that vaccines were the pinnacle of human technology and came
*  out thinking that the moon landing wasn't real and Michelle Obama's got a dick.
*  And I was like, I was me.
*  Yeah.
*  Like during COVID, I was like, I became obsessed with social media and acts and like just looking
*  at shit and whatever.
*  And I'm like, you know, what's true?
*  What's not true?
*  Like what's what like, because everybody's speaking so forcibly.
*  This is one question I want to ask you is, you talk to all these dudes all the time.
*  One of the things I miss, like, I would be I would be talking to people and be like,
*  Oh, this is going on Afghanistan.
*  I'll be like, Oh, I was just there.
*  That's not what's happening.
*  Or, you know, this is happening in Iraq.
*  Oh, I was just I love talking to people.
*  I love meeting people and I love sort of knowing stuff.
*  Like you can just say, well, I'm going to go there.
*  I'm going to figure it out.
*  Right.
*  So I saw this stuff on social media and I was like, wow, you know, there's all this
*  stuff like but no one's really going after it and saying like, as an investigative journalist
*  saying, what's real?
*  What's not real?
*  What's true?
*  What's not true?
*  You are.
*  You're getting in there.
*  There's a few people doing it.
*  They're all independent.
*  They're all completely outside of any kind of Washington Post.
*  Which is great.
*  Which is the only way to do it.
*  It's impossible to exist in mainstream media and be legitimate.
*  Now, there's going to be 100 percent.
*  There's going to be guardrails.
*  There's 100 percent.
*  Yeah, there's no way.
*  But you talk to everybody and that must be fascinating because you get the inside track.
*  Like your brain is like a wealth of information.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like I had an unexpected education.
*  Yeah.
*  Like an unanticipated, unplanned education in all sorts of things.
*  Yeah.
*  And these guys are super interesting and you get to learn and that's amazing.
*  It's pretty amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you learn a lot of bullshit too.
*  Like some of the stuff you learn is not true.
*  Well, that's the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a question.
*  Yeah.
*  Bobby Kennedy seems to be like so fast.
*  I remember I used to watch Tony Blair during Question Period and he'd like leap up and
*  he'd be like blah, blah, blah.
*  And he was so like he knew everything and the facts and stuff.
*  Like you've interviewed him a bunch of times or?
*  I've talked to him many times.
*  I interviewed him once.
*  Is he that good in person?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, he's legit.
*  I mean, he was an environmental attorney.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  That was his background.
*  And you know, he's had a, I mean, a crazy life.
*  And you're 14 years old and your dad gets killed by who knows, but it might be the government.
*  That's my first episode.
*  Yeah.
*  Assassinations, Deep State.
*  Getting into it.
*  Well, it's a real thing.
*  You know, I don't know who's doing it or what faction or how small the amount of people
*  are that are involved in it.
*  I mean, imagine if you're like a legitimate person, worker for the CIA and you think that
*  the CIA is trying to assassinate Trump and you're like, what the fuck?
*  Or whoever.
*  That's our first episode.
*  It's got to be, I mean, it's got to be a small faction of intelligence agencies that want
*  to do things like, like how many people do you think were involved in the Kennedy assassination?
*  So there's a guy named Peter Dale Scott who actually wrote the book on the Deep State
*  and brought like the concept over from Turkey to here and broke it.
*  And if you talk to him, so he was really involved or wrote about or covered the, they tried
*  to assassinate Castro.
*  That was the first American Deep State thing, which is like, by the way, that's factual.
*  That's like, there were the mob and Cubans and the CIA and they tried to commit.
*  Many times they tried to kill him.
*  Failed.
*  And then, you know, that sort of morphed and there's all this sort of mix into the Kennedy
*  and Bobby Kennedy, Robert RFK assassination attempts that this guy was referencing.
*  And you're just like, Deep State has such a negative connotation to it because it's
*  like conspiracy-ish.
*  But you're like, when it got explained to me by the guys who sort of coined the terms,
*  which is, you know, like there's this intelligence agencies or the Pentagon, career bureaucrats
*  who, by the way, go back and forth.
*  It's a rotating door.
*  They go to Raytheon, they go to Boeing, they go all the way and they get the contract,
*  trillions of dollars.
*  And they act in cahoots with each other.
*  And you're like, yeah, that makes total fucking sense.
*  Of course.
*  It's business relations.
*  It's a business relationship.
*  And then if they have something that needs to happen, you have all kinds of people who
*  will do that thing for you.
*  Yes.
*  So it's not why.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It's not bureaucrats in the CIA.
*  It could literally be one guy who's a top executive or a hundred or, you know, a few
*  people that come to a conclusion and don't even have to say it.
*  And then a plan gets hatched.
*  Yeah.
*  And then next thing you know, there's a guy on a roof.
*  We're already into it.
*  I can just see the fucking tweets.
*  Fuck the tweets.
*  But for sure, it's like, I found that fascinating.
*  Not only, so I started doing like the snipers.
*  We got the sniper, fascinating dude.
*  He has the longest confirmed kill, 3.5 kilometers.
*  So we started just talking technical shit.
*  And you're like, okay, could it be done?
*  And the sniper's like, what do the snipers have to say?
*  And then we got to the head of the guy who trained all the Secret Service people.
*  Actually, we got Trump's head of security for 18 years, personal head of security guy.
*  First time he ever talked.
*  He was a great, great guy.
*  Keith Schiller.
*  And then we got into it and then everyone started talking about the deep state, deep states.
*  What the fuck is the deep state?
*  Like, I know what the deep state people think is.
*  That's the other thing is online, everyone has so many givens.
*  You know, like in math, one plus one is a given.
*  So there's so many givens.
*  You're like, well, let's look at the givens.
*  Like what is the deep state?
*  So I literally went after the guy who coined the phrase and he's like, and I'm like, oh
*  yeah, that sounds completely, I mean, I know those guys.
*  It's like, that sounds completely believable.
*  And then so when you believe that, then you start saying, okay, well, how do these things
*  look?
*  Like, what do they look like?
*  It was fascinating.
*  But I mean, look, I'm into all this stuff and then you're there like all day, every day
*  doing it.
*  It must be, it's fascinating.
*  I love it.
*  So I did get sick, my long winded answer.
*  I did get sick of being on the outside looking at it.
*  It is fascinating.
*  But I like the way I do it because I get to talk to anybody I want to.
*  Like I don't have to just deal with things that are disturbing.
*  I can, you know, talk to someone who's a beekeeper.
*  I can talk to someone who, you know, makes cabinets.
*  You made your own empire, which is fucking awesome.
*  Well, it's just what I'm interested in.
*  It just happens to be that a lot of people are interested in these things.
*  So it's lucky.
*  And it's also because I'm actually interested in it.
*  I don't have to have fake conversations.
*  Like there's no one I have on where I'm like, I can't believe I'm talking to you.
*  You know, like, well, you see that, right?
*  You see that in like late night talk shows.
*  They don't want to be interviewing this person.
*  It's too much.
*  Yeah, it's nonsense.
*  Well, Vice, when you started Vice, it was one of the most refreshing news sources because
*  it was like these intelligent people that didn't seem like regular journalists.
*  They seem like just people that you knew.
*  Because they weren't.
*  Yeah, they were just people.
*  Right.
*  They seem like normal people.
*  And yet all of a sudden they're wearing a flak jacket in a war zone.
*  They seem like normal people and they're hanging out in a hot tub in Thailand.
*  It's like it was normal people that were interested.
*  Like Vice guy to travel, that one with Hindmo's Arctic Adventures.
*  That is till today one of my favorite videos of you guys every day.
*  I fucking love that story because it's amazing.
*  You've got this guy that lives in a...
*  The most remote human...
*  Yeah, like in this tiny cabin.
*  He's been there since the 1970s.
*  He saw 9-11 in a photograph.
*  That's all he knows about it.
*  He doesn't have any television up there.
*  He gets VHS tapes occasionally and watches them on a tiny TV.
*  And he just lives in this subsistence lifestyle, just fishing and hunting and living off the
*  land.
*  An intelligent, interesting, articulate guy.
*  And he seems way happier than most people I know.
*  For sure.

*  He was the most remote human until we found those people in Russia and in like Siberia
*  who had run from Stalin and this family who had gone up into the mountains and just lived
*  there for like 80 years.
*  By themselves, like made shoes out of bark and like totally self-sustaining up in the
*  mountains of Siberia.
*  Like they thought that they didn't know about the moon landing.
*  They didn't know about like
*  What kind of gene pool do they have?
*  Not a lot.
*  I think there was a lot of inbreeding.
*  Oh God.
*  How many people were there?
*  I don't know.
*  You could look.
*  I don't know.
*  It's like there was six when they found him, I think.
*  And one was like 80 who was the youngest or something.
*  Oh God.
*  Crazy story though.
*  Yeah.
*  So they ran from Stalin just stayed alive.
*  They thought Stalin was like, you know, still there.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't it funny?
*  You can't name a kid Adolf, but you can name a kid Joseph.
*  There you go.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  No.
*  It's a little weird.
*  Joseph was too common.
*  Yeah.
*  Joseph's very calm.
*  But wasn't Adolf really common with the Germans?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, Joseph is everywhere.
*  I know.
*  That's like a Bible.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah.
*  And no Adolf in the Bible.
*  So no, didn't make the cut.
*  Didn't make the cut.
*  But when you guys were, you know, when it was young, it was like it was new internet, right?
*  Because the internet opened up a bunch of different possibilities.
*  It opened up possibilities for legitimate independent journalism and legitimate independent
*  thinkers who were really disconnected from the sort of stiff, stuffy, mainstream perspective
*  of what's going on in life.
*  And you guys gave, you guys gave a completely unfiltered perspective as a normal human who's
*  experiencing these bizarre circumstances in these exotic lands.
*  And it was awesome, man.
*  It was awesome.
*  And then now it's this bizarre propaganda machine that's ideologically captured to the point
*  where it's preposterous.
*  Like they say things that are just so outlandish and so not in tune with logic or objectivity.
*  It's so strange to see going from what you made to what it is now.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, I mean, I could get into the nuances, which are many and boring.
*  But basically what happens is, you know, and I actually called it from the beginning.
*  I said, look, we're going to get too big.
*  And at that point, we're going to become the thing that we're like we were a challenger
*  brand and we're going to become the status quo.
*  And then we're going to get our asses kicked.
*  B, I said, look, all internet is now consolidating and media is consolidating and everybody's
*  consolidating because they have to because the big five are taking all the money.
*  And we knew it was coming, but it came like, look, I'll tell you another thing.
*  In media, you know, there's not a lot of people picking shit.
*  Like you get to pick shit because you run your own shop.
*  You're the main.
*  When you run media, it's like people put on what people watch.
*  That's the rule.
*  Like you just put on shit and people watch it.
*  And then like if you say, I want to do this and nobody watches it, then you don't get
*  to say, I want to do this that often.
*  So we always had a thing where we gave the company over to the interns.
*  If we just stayed a Gen X free giveaway, we would have never gotten into video.
*  In fact, when we got into video, we were derided by the old guys for selling out because going
*  to online video was seen as a sellout because we should have stayed a magazine.
*  So we used to give it over to the interns and then the interns just.
*  They had a different fucking everything.
*  They had a different philosophy.
*  They had different subject.
*  They had different fucking everything.
*  And they were going and by the way, the traffic was still there.
*  And I was the same.
*  I was looking at the fuck is this?
*  Right.
*  The fuck is going on?
*  And, you know, they're like, well, that's the traffic and your fucking things that
*  you like, it's no traffic because you're an old man.
*  So anyway, I was semi-retired for a number of years and, you know, look,
*  when did you get out?
*  I moved to LA.
*  Trying to remember now 15, 15, 16 around there.
*  So I moved to LA because our biggest clients were there.
*  The biggest platforms were there.
*  No one was out there.
*  And, you know, I kids and I was like, okay, like I can move to the country and
*  commute into New York or I can move to LA.
*  So I moved to LA and that started a whole, that was, you know, that was not smart in
*  retrospect because you leave and it starts like Game of Thrones shit.
*  And, and then also, quite frankly, if you want to know the metaphysical fucking
*  reasons why I can get into it.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  I love metaphysical.
*  There you go.
*  The best time for Vice, the time that you're talking about, the time that I
*  loved was, you know, you would go before all the big investors and everything, you
*  would go to like Italy, right?
*  And you would get an apartment and, you know, you get a girlfriend and you find an
*  office and you hire people that look like you or hang out like you or just are cool
*  or whatever.
*  And you would build it.
*  You would buy the fucking computers on your credit card and you would fucking go to
*  the grandmother's place for fucking lunch and Cinque Terre.
*  You would like fucking, you know, figure out all the cool places to hang out with
*  you, with your friends and stuff.
*  And then you'd have a big party and everyone would come and advice would be launched.
*  Then you get on a train and go to Sweden and do the same thing.
*  You'd live there for six months.
*  You'd build something.
*  It was tangible.
*  The mag would come out.
*  You'd start shooting stuff and it would be fucking awesome.
*  And then when it got to be like, you fly in and you meet with lawyers and
*  accountants and it's shit.
*  And then you fly out again the next day.
*  It's terrible.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And so when that happened, I was like, I don't want to do this anymore.
*  And I'm not good at it.
*  Like I was good at building.
*  I'm good at building.
*  I'm good at like founders are not necessarily operators.
*  Right.
*  One of the smart things you've done is like, just keep your own shit, your own shit.
*  And I got, you know, my eyes were too big for my stomach in a way.
*  Cause you're just like, let's keep going.
*  Fucking building.
*  The big thing too is keep it small.
*  Keep it small, dude.
*  Keep it small.
*  Like it's just me and Jamie.
*  And we have a video editor that's not even local.
*  He just gets it on the internet.
*  And also Jamie is super good vibes, which is the best, but it's, it's the most important.
*  I have friends that have big podcasts and they have like this huge staff and they have
*  all these people running around.
*  I'm like, what are all these people do?
*  And it's like, they want this feeling of they're the boss of a bunch of employees.
*  Yeah.
*  For some reason, like they want all these production people that are creating content.
*  But then you have inter office conflicts and they're always putting out fires and
*  people are complaining and then people leave and make videos talking about what a
*  piece of shit boss you were.
*  And it's like him and you're, you're dealing in this thing where there's
*  currency in that information.
*  There's currency for these, these mediocre people.
*  So you, you hire these mediocre people and these mediocre people attack you because
*  there's currency in attacking you, but you didn't need them in the first place.
*  This whole thing was stupid.
*  Like you're making a little bit more money, but you have more problems, but
*  you don't notice that money.
*  Like you have to pay attention to what you notice, right?
*  What, whatever the fuck you have in your bank account, if you are, if you're a fairly
*  wealthy person and you have a hundred dollars more, a hundred dollars less, a thousand
*  dollars more, a thousand dollars less, you don't notice it.
*  But I'll tell you what you do notice.
*  You notice hassle.
*  You notice problems.
*  Those problems are worth a lot of money to get rid of.
*  Like if you had a bunch of employees, like fuck, what can I do?
*  There's so many people, it's so annoying.
*  God, I wish we were small again.
*  Getting back to small again is a grind.
*  You got to fire people.
*  It's a, you got to downsize.
*  You got to figure out how to do it.
*  That's a mess, man.
*  You don't want that mess.
*  So that extra money that you got by making things too big, you fucked yourself.
*  You got greedy.
*  You, you looked at it the wrong way.
*  Someone said to me, like I was in the park on the comedy store.
*  This friend of mine was not even very successful.
*  It was like, I'm trying to find a new assistant.
*  I go, why do you need an assistant?
*  He goes, you don't have an assistant?
*  I go, no.
*  I go, this is what you do.
*  Do less shit.
*  If you need an assistant, you're doing too many things.
*  Do less shit.
*  Don't get a fucking assistant.
*  You have an assistant, you have what happens at David Spade.
*  The guy shows up with duct tape and a taser and tries to kill you.
*  Remember that?
*  Cause they wind up resenting you.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause if you've got some person who's working for you, he's making $50,000 a year
*  and you're making, you have $50 million.
*  They want to kill you.
*  After a while, they're like, I'm a part of this too.
*  You know, like they don't think of it as this is a great job.
*  This job could eventually lead to something bigger.
*  People get resentful.
*  Also the type of people that are 34 years old, they're working as an assistant.
*  Probably a little fucked up.
*  Probably made some mistakes.
*  Probably, you know, not really on the right path in life.
*  Now, all of a sudden you're connected at the hip to this person.
*  And then they want to tell you about their problems and maybe got an X, Y for me.
*  They got a this and if they're making more money, they're going to make more money.
*  And so you've, you've, you've because you wanted to appear like you have a
*  everybody wants a big organization like vice is big now.
*  You know, the JRE, we have a thousand employees worldwide.
*  We have three employees.
*  Yeah.
*  Smart.
*  You know, Harvard should hire you to teach business because that is a hundred percent
*  of it.
*  No, I'm just saying, but listen, but it's so fucking right.
*  Like you just said, what's in my fucking brain.
*  Like it's that a hundred percent of that is true.
*  Everyone should listen to this guy because it is a hundred fucking percent true.
*  When you're younger, run a tight ship.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  When you're younger, you're like, oh fuck it.
*  And look, I fucking punk it.
*  And it came from nothing.
*  And so like when you have employees, there's there is actually a Harvard thing where they
*  say there's a, there's a, there's a paradox where you hire somebody because you want to
*  someone to help you, but they're not as good as you.
*  And you hire someone who's not as good as you and then they hire someone who's not as
*  good as them.
*  So then all this stuff and you have to do more work.
*  There's more hassles.
*  Then you have a whole group of people reporting to you.
*  And this is exactly not out of business.
*  And I even knew that going in and then you hire and you're exactly right.
*  And you hire all these people.
*  All they need to do is be in the same room as you.
*  Yeah.
*  And then that's access.
*  And once there's access, then you're exactly what you said.
*  Then you deal with their issues and you deal with everything.
*  Shane, can I pull you aside for a second?
*  There's a project that my friend and I are working on.
*  We'd like to get you involved.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, but yeah, no, it got to, it definitely got to me.
*  And you're exactly right.
*  Like, look, you're a wise dude because like you keep it small.
*  You're exactly right.
*  That's like after having learned what I've learned, like we have a tiny little team that
*  makes this thing and it's super like it's like the early days of vice where you're just
*  you're just making shit and talking to people and chopping it up and doing stuff and trying
*  new shit out and do well.
*  One week it'll be like this and the other week it'll be like that and we'll just fucking
*  do everything.
*  It's so much more fucking fun.
*  You're 100 percent right.
*  Yeah.
*  Fun is the most important thing.
*  Like if you Brian Cowell said this to me once and it's a really great advice.
*  He goes, he goes, all you really want is to be able to go to a restaurant and not worry
*  about what things cost.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything else is bullshit.
*  100 percent.
*  It's true.
*  Everything else is bullshit.
*  100 percent.
*  You get used to cars.
*  You get used to houses like I realized like early on I got an apartment when I lived in
*  North Hollywood.
*  It was like the first nice apartment I had.
*  But after I was in it a couple of weeks it was just my house.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like the house I have now.
*  It's not that much different.
*  It's just like your home.
*  OK great.
*  What do you need?
*  You need a couch.
*  Need a TV.
*  You need a bedroom.
*  You need a kitchen.
*  That's all you need.
*  Hopefully it doesn't stink.
*  Hopefully it doesn't suck.
*  Hopefully your neighbors aren't loud.
*  Hopefully it's be nice if you have a view.
*  That's cute.
*  But other than that.
*  I'll go a step further than that.
*  Is you you I don't know about you but you accumulate shit.
*  Right.
*  And I because I never had anything I was like I fucking I got into watches you know I got
*  into shit I got into art.
*  Then I got like I don't even fucking drive.
*  And I got like I got Johnny Cash's fucking car from 1969.
*  What kind of car is that?
*  So in 1969 Johnny Cash had had the number one show in America and ABC got him a one
*  of a kind Rolls Royce extra long body all all black black mahogany interior.
*  And check this out.
*  So I got it.
*  So it was me and Wayne Newton.
*  But you remember I used to gamble.
*  I was in Vegas won a bunch of money.
*  I was actually had to fly to China and my buddy stayed there and he was me me and Wayne
*  Newton bidding against each other for Johnny Cash's car.
*  And and when we got it you know it was like burning fucking fuel oil just black smoke
*  coming out of the terrible.
*  So I turned it into a Tesla and now yeah yeah yeah it's fucking awesome dude.
*  It's awesome we chopped it.
*  He's turning it.
*  We kept everything with this.
*  Is it online.
*  Can I see this thing.
*  You can see.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you put it online.
*  No.
*  But there's a picture.
*  There's pictures.
*  Can you send it to Jamie so we can see it.
*  Just pull up Johnny Cash's Rolls Royce 1969.
*  It's a black all black Rolls Royce.
*  So I turn it into a Tesla redid the whole interior fucking did that for you.
*  I'd have to get the fucking the name.
*  That's it.
*  Oh look at that.
*  What would Johnny Cash feel about his Rolls Royce getting.
*  I think you'd fucking love it because I was out with Rick Rubin in that car yesterday.
*  But that's Johnny Cash not Johnny Carson.
*  Johnny Cash.
*  Right.
*  Didn't you say Johnny Carson.
*  No Johnny Cash.
*  You said he had the number one show on TV.
*  Yeah.
*  The Johnny Cash variety hour.
*  Oh my God.
*  I thought you said.
*  ABC ABC gave him this car and and yeah had it made it.
*  I was with Rick Rubin in that yesterday we were driving around in it.
*  It's and it's dry.
*  It's so fucking fast and it drives like a fucking crazy boat.
*  Wow.
*  You know you got to come out and yeah drive it.
*  Like it's awesome.
*  So you took a Tesla Model S and converted it.
*  Yeah.
*  These are the dudes who did it.
*  Wow.
*  And we read it all that would now.
*  So it's all the original black mahogany from.
*  So when the batteries go bad you can just swap the batteries out.
*  Plug it in.
*  No you just plug it in.
*  No but eventually the batteries will deteriorate to the point where you get really low mileage.
*  You probably get low mileage already right.
*  That thing's heavy as shit.
*  It's heavy as shit.
*  God that's beautiful.
*  You must have to upgrade the brakes in a big way.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's very heavy.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking beautiful car though.
*  Such a good car because when I came out to L.A.
*  I'm like I'm going to get a shit brown Agatha Christie Rolls Royce and an MS13 driver
*  with like the full 13 and like a safety.
*  Am I late for the party.
*  Hello.
*  And so and so I got this one and I'm just it's fucking awesome.
*  Wow.
*  That's so cool.
*  They're doing this.
*  Ever heard of the company called Everati.
*  Yeah.
*  They're.
*  They do the electric swap overs.
*  Yeah they do swap overs for I know they do Porsches.
*  I think they do a Mustang as well.
*  But they take these classic cars.
*  The problem is like you're not supposed to do that.
*  You're not supposed to do.
*  This thing was fucked up.
*  I will say this.
*  I don't have any desire to have one of these things but I think they're dope as fuck.
*  They're dope as fuck.
*  But the thing is like for me I see that.
*  Oh that's disgusting.
*  Get that off the screen.
*  I see that that does disturb me to know.
*  You took a GT40 and turned it into an electric.
*  The thing about those old cars is the mechanical feel.
*  And that is 90 percent of the experience of driving one of those old.
*  Well this car barely ran like the problem is it was fucked.
*  Yeah but you could get a resto monitor.
*  You could resto monitor.
*  Anyway I love the thing is like they're supposed to have.
*  I could see doing it with Johnny Cash's car.
*  It's kind of funny.
*  But you do into that you should go to jail.
*  You do that to a GT40.
*  You should go right to jail.
*  What's the horsepower as it is.
*  Well not really.
*  Originally you know this is the this is Ferrari versus Ford.
*  This is the original car.
*  I actually have the next version of that which is the Ford GT.
*  I have one of the 2005 ones that's a stick shift.
*  I feel like if you drive a car like that you have to drive a manual.
*  It can only go 160 miles.
*  Right.
*  And that's if you're driving like a grandma.
*  But it has 800 horsepower.
*  It's probably fast as shit.
*  You know electric cars are different than any other car in terms of the speed that you get.
*  Yeah.
*  The way it feels to just go whoosh.
*  But there's no sound.
*  As part of that car is.
*  That's that car.
*  That car is like visceral.
*  It's exciting.
*  There's an engine behind you.
*  It's like let's go baby.
*  Come on Shane.
*  You love it.
*  You feel in the turns.
*  You want to feel the bumps.
*  You want to feel the fucking steering in your hand the wiggling of the tires.
*  It's a ride.
*  It's not efficient.
*  It's not supposed to be efficient.
*  It's an experience.
*  It's a sensory overload.
*  It's not just transportation.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why turning one of those things into electric is.
*  I did it because it was burning fuels burning black smoke barely fucking ran.
*  That car is fine.
*  Yeah.
*  So the source is fine.
*  So so did it.
*  So I love it.
*  But the thing of my long winded answer to that question was I I started I collected all this shit like you were saying it doesn't bring you any fucking.
*  But maybe it does for you because so I just go you know what all of that shit I was talking to Rick about this too like I'm just I'm just going to get rid of it like the more I free myself from that shit and all that stuff.
*  Yes.
*  You're just like you know what psychic burden.
*  I used to go speaking of the old days advice I had everyone used to laugh because I go for it literally years.
*  With a backpack and I just feel like well I wear his black jeans and black t-shirt like I just buy new ones if I need something you just go to a pharmacy one of my to this day.
*  Like if I go to a fucking pharmacy in a foreign country I'm stoked because it means I'm getting shit that I need like shampoo and fucking toothpaste and little scissors from my nose hairs and shit.
*  And that means like I'm on top of my game.
*  I'm fucking ready to go.
*  I can fucking interview people and do shit.
*  Right.
*  As I'm gone to the fucking pharmacy and and and you know I love going to fucking supermarket because you just like I'm going to buy some fucking food and then we're going to go do some work and it's going to be fucking awesome.
*  That shit gives me pleasure.
*  Yeah.
*  I can a watch or a fucking yeah a car shoes or.
*  Yeah most of those they're cool.
*  They're cool.
*  I'm interested in engineering and artwork right.
*  And I like that's why I have so much art in this place.
*  I love people's expression.
*  Yeah.
*  And I feel like cars are artwork.
*  That's how I view cars especially old cars.
*  Yeah.
*  I have a lot of old cars and those old like art deco cars like muscle cars almost 1960s to early 1970s muscle cars.
*  That's what I love.
*  I love them.
*  I love them.
*  I drive them like they're just it's like I'm an amusement park ride.
*  That's how I feel about them.
*  And I just said when I was a kid those were the cars that everybody wanted.
*  So to me it's like I get a real joy.
*  But if I didn't have them I'd be fine.
*  If I just drove my Tesla to work every day I would be fine.
*  Like the level of happiness you get in terms of like how much you have to work for some things.
*  It's not worth it.
*  It's not worth it.
*  And too many people strive for this thing that doesn't give you anything back.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just this thing that's hard just because something's hard to get.
*  Doesn't mean it's good.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a lot of things that people strive for that are difficult to achieve but they're not valuable when you get there.
*  No.
*  And speaking of psychology yeah like you talk about old muscle cars the car I learned to drive was my grandmother's car that she gave to my cousin.
*  When I was 13 he was 16 or something and he taught me how to drive and it was a Nova SS.
*  It was an old life.
*  I have one.
*  I have a 69.
*  It's so beautiful.
*  I have a 69 that has been completely redone by this guy Steve Strope.
*  So nice.
*  And it's it's the craziest Nova SS ever.
*  This one.
*  This one's incredible because it's understated.
*  Restomod.
*  It's understated.
*  It's not like it's a powerful beast and it's badass looking but it's not like like a Ferrari.
*  Like you know Ferraris can be beautiful.
*  It's different.
*  It's different.
*  It's a different flex.
*  Yeah.
*  You know the Ferrari you just have money.
*  That's my that's a Nova.
*  That's it.
*  That's mine.
*  That's my 69 Nova.
*  I love it.
*  Look at that.
*  That's like exactly hers was gold.
*  I still remember that.
*  Mine is like it's got 1969 Camaro fenders.
*  So they made it like wider so they could fit larger tires and tubbed it out.
*  It's all custom and as a supercharged.
*  That's for her engine did not look like that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a it's a very efficient driving car but it's just so fun.
*  It's just like you drive that thing.
*  It's just this experience of sounds and it to me it's like those cars are the ones
*  that resonate with me.
*  You know so I have but if I only had one I would be fine.
*  I just like them every now and then but they're not they're not the thing.
*  They're not the end all be all.
*  They're not family friends love community.
*  There's all these things that people put those objects above.
*  They put above everything in your life.
*  You strive for that thing because it's a symbol of success.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's nonsense.
*  So I had a speaking of psychological damage as for things.
*  I grew up poor but when I was a very rich girl and it was her birthday right.
*  We're in France was her birthday and her uncle had forgotten her birthday.
*  And so he said oh here you know take my watch kind of thing.
*  And they're like no no no.
*  I like it.
*  You know that watch is like fifty thousand dollar watch.
*  And I was like there's no fucking watches worth fifty thousand dollars like fifty
*  thousand dollars like watch.
*  And it was like a classic protect fucking moon face whatever.
*  And I remember clocking the watch and when I got money I became obsessed with the
*  classic protect which is now like five hundred grand not fifty grand the moon
*  face and that's so crazy that a watch is five hundred thousand dollars.
*  Oh some of them are like five million dollars.
*  I mean that nuts.
*  Yes.
*  And so like those Richard Millet watches.
*  Yeah I mean the most expensive are still protects but yeah like those ones are I
*  mean rare ones like I was obsessed with so I like the Paul Newman Panda but they
*  have like the lemon or the champagne Panda which is the gold version of that
*  which which they made like four of.
*  And I want I was chasing that down and now I'm like you can't fucking wear it.
*  Right.
*  Like every place I go you can't fucking wear it.
*  Like I was fine here and you can't put it to security.
*  So what the fuck you.
*  Why can't you put it through security.
*  I think they would snatch it off watches get snatched all the time.
*  Yeah but then where's my watch.
*  Yeah it's just like it goes through the little thing.
*  Like how fast there's so many.
*  It's not happened to me although I have nearly lost them many times because you
*  know you get you have a few ales on the plane and take your shit off and put it
*  in the box and then you know I've never done it but it's been close calls but
*  there's so many stories in the watch world about you're going to customs you're
*  going to security you're going to somewhere someone takes you.
*  I've had a lot of people like how much does that watch.
*  And you're like fake.
*  I always say it's fake anyway.
*  So I'm getting rid of all that shit just because you're like fuck it doesn't
*  fucking mean anything.
*  And what actually does mean shit is like like you were saying like you know
*  learning educate like like making shit but also at the same time like going like
*  I'm learning shit.
*  Yeah it's fun.
*  Getting some really happy.
*  I'm fucking back talking to you.
*  I'm it's like it's an it's fucking interesting.
*  It's good for your brain.
*  Positivity.
*  Yeah it's good for your mental health.
*  Good for your mental.
*  It's also it's what life is about.
*  Life is about growth.
*  It's about learning.
*  It's about experiencing things.
*  And when you get an opportunity to talk to someone like I talked to this woman
*  the other day Diane Boyd.
*  Short this book A Woman Amongst Wolves.
*  She spent her entire life tracking wolves and handling them and
*  collaring them and studying them.
*  And she lived in a cabin in the woods for years by herself with no water and no
*  electricity.
*  Love it.
*  Yeah.
*  Fascinating.
*  Like just like you're a totally different type of person than I ever experienced.
*  What's your life like.
*  What do you do.
*  Like what do you think about.
*  I think about that.
*  Yeah.
*  I love wolves.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's to me there's so many opportunities in this life to be stimulated by
*  exciting and interesting things.
*  Yeah.
*  We can learn about stuff.
*  100 percent.
*  And if you can figure out how that's your job and it's not just something that you
*  do on the bus on the way home but it's actually your job that's a good life.
*  Definitely.
*  I mean for me that's what I love doing.
*  I like talking to people and I like learning and I like you know if you're
*  learning shit and other people obviously do as they're learning and it's just
*  it's an awesome thing to be able to do.
*  Is there a way to do something like the original vice but just keep it small.
*  And never let it grow.
*  Like listen the vice news right now is me and I'm making podcasts I'm doing shit
*  that I find interesting.
*  Is it still vice.
*  Do you call it vice.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean vice.
*  Are you still one of the owners.
*  Like how does it work.
*  I mean it's it's complicated.
*  You don't have to get in the woods.
*  You don't want to.
*  It's complicated.
*  I mean it's complicated.
*  I'm not like I I was the largest shareholder and then I went to owning nothing.
*  I lost the most out of anybody.
*  Not that I'm asking anybody to fucking cry for me anything.
*  It was actually a good thing because you you like when you realize a lot of the
*  stuff about happiness and stuff you realize it not when you're cashing checks.
*  You lose you know not a calm sea never a good captain made you know.
*  But yeah throughout all the you know the changes basically I was still in the in
*  the backdrop you know just around.
*  Why didn't you sell when it got at the top.
*  When you get rid of.
*  Actually that's the whole the whole thing about.
*  I did.
*  I sold some and and and you know took some money off the table which is why I could
*  semi retire.
*  But everyone's like you know Shane you could have sold should have sold.
*  He said he said no he said I've never said no.
*  My money in my whole fucking life I was building vice to sell it.
*  I never fucking said no.
*  That's all fucking bullshit.
*  We tried to sell it to Time Order tried to sell it to Disney.
*  It was just like you know when Disney said no we went into private equity and then
*  you know that relationship is never good.
*  Well it's the old adage go well go broke.
*  And that's what happened with vice.
*  People stopped.
*  They just stopped.
*  Vice is one of the best examples of go well go broke ever because vice was fucking
*  huge and it was exciting.
*  It was interesting.
*  You know you had great shows and then it just got too weird.
*  Yeah I mean yes media and media got weird and look everyone's looking at for us and
*  then we can get on the other ship.
*  But you know who left the fucking porthole open of the Titanic.
*  You're like yeah hit a fucking iceberg.
*  Not just us.
*  You know look at all the new media like right.
*  Culture five five five companies take up eighty seven cents of every advertising
*  dollar in the world and independent media gets the rest and it's getting smaller and
*  smaller.
*  The money dries up and when the money dries up you start getting frantic right.
*  You start fucking flailing around looking for shit.
*  Whatever you start looking for solutions other people start looking for solutions.
*  Young people start fucking saying this is what we got to do this we got to do.
*  You have five thousand people saying what we got to do rather than five.
*  And you got people who are semi checked out if not checked out and you know shit got
*  said nobody's fucking.
*  It's my baby.
*  Nobody got fucking more sick about it than me.
*  But you're like OK you know so now you know we're doing vice news is me we're doing
*  the podcast we're doing.
*  It's fun again.
*  We're just fucking building trying to do new shit with fucking a high and with some
*  of us this is fun.
*  And but yeah I do I do other shit on my own and you know look the other thing too is I
*  also spent time living my life which I hadn't been doing.
*  I'm sure you do out here.
*  You got to go and you got to live your life again and you have to live your life.
*  You have to live your life.
*  Did this idea that your career should be your whole life is foolish.
*  It's foolish.
*  It's foolish.
*  Because I don't have much time.
*  You know I have that much time.
*  I was talking to somebody.
*  You're Gen X.
*  Yeah I guess 67.
*  You're Gen X.
*  Yeah.
*  I was saying to someone because we were the forgotten generation and everyone like I was
*  shitty and I was saying to someone if you look at you know the Carl Sagan thing of we
*  live in the greatest envelope of history ever like of the billions of planets and the
*  billions of years of this planet like we live in this final time when there's oxygen and
*  there's water and you can fucking eat and you can fucking you know and then I'm like OK
*  if you look at that and then go the best ever time has been like our little window like
*  you're born in the 60s you grow up in the 70s you're fucking free to go play in the
*  creek and fucking go hunting and fishing and all that shit and then you know no parental
*  supervision then.
*  But there's never been like a major fucking warning.
*  We were not getting pitchforked in the stomach.
*  You know food has been like for the first time really in history food is now everywhere
*  is good for every kind of you know like quality wise you know.
*  Travel luxury fucking international travel like being able to do freaky jobs rather than
*  work in a factory like all these fucking things happen for Gen X.
*  And God knows if it happens again because A.I.
*  is going to be all human endeavor done by machines and environmental shit and fucking
*  you know the world is changing in ways we can't even fucking imagine.
*  I have young kids and all the parents were clucking like hands about they're not learning
*  math like it's A.I.
*  is going to change fucking everything.
*  And so so I'm like I was talking to someone and saying it's ironic but Gen X actually
*  lived in the greatest historical window of all time potentially.
*  And so I'm not going to just fucking not enjoy that.
*  I'm going to go out there in life and just be like I'm literally living in the greatest
*  single fucking window in the history of history.
*  We most certainly have and we live in the greatest time of technological change in human
*  history. We started out like you and I can remember when phones were attached to the
*  wall. Yeah I remember when it was a we had to spin the wheel.
*  It was an event.
*  Phone call. You got a call.
*  And if you fucked up like god damn it you got to start again start from scratch took a
*  long time to make a phone call.
*  There's a phone call for you.
*  Right. And when people would call and you were on the phone it would just be busy.
*  Yeah. When is he getting off the phone.
*  You call him back.
*  God damn he's still busy.
*  And then it became call waiting.
*  Oh hold on. Someone else is calling.
*  I got someone else. Maybe they're more important than you.
*  Oh please. And then he come back and then it was caller ID.
*  Oh this motherfucker is calling.
*  Fuck him. And then answer machines were the greatest.
*  And when you could get a remote answering machine so I could call my answer machine
*  and listen to you leave me a message.
*  Hey meet me at the bar at 10.
*  I'd be like and I'd call you back and leave a message on your machine.
*  Hey I got your message.
*  I'll meet you at the bar at 10.
*  I love that. It was incredible.
*  I love that. It was incredible.
*  I'll see you on Saturday at 8.
*  But we were also free from the confines of social media.
*  And social media has brought an incredible amount of information to people but has also
*  created a lot of very mentally ill people.
*  Whether they realize it or not it's like you're getting a low dose of radiation all day
*  long every day.
*  It's also addictive.
*  Yes very very very addictive.
*  With dopamine hits.
*  Uh huh. Yeah.
*  And then it's it could be psychologically very damaging if you read stuff about yourself.
*  And I've had many friends that started becoming successful and then started doing really
*  well and then started reading people's comments.
*  The hate is crazy.
*  And it drives them nuts.
*  It hurts their feelings.
*  It really does.
*  I mean oh poor baby.
*  But I mean really as a human being.
*  Yeah they're human beings.
*  And I know that the people look if I was not a famous person I was a person that you know
*  was like who I was when I was 19 years old.
*  I would 100 percent be leaving shitty comments on YouTube videos and shitty comments on
*  someone's Instagram or Twitter or whatever.
*  It's what people do.
*  It's normal.
*  It's not.
*  It's not the people's fault because it's a very disconnected disassociated way of
*  communicating with people that's not congruent.
*  It's not like it's not normal for human communication.
*  It's not what we're designed.
*  We're designed to do this.
*  I'm looking at you.
*  You look at me.
*  I smile.
*  You smile.
*  We're buddies.
*  We have a good time.
*  That's how people are used to communicating with each other.
*  When you're communicating with people through text it's fucking bizarre.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  It's very different.
*  And it's not good for you to take in the opinions of hundreds of thousands of people
*  that you know may or may not be mentally ill.
*  May or may not be going through a divorce.
*  Yeah.
*  Have an axe to grind.
*  Or just look if you're successful in particular there's a lot of unsuccessful people
*  that are very bitter very sad and they want to find everything wrong with you.
*  We were talking about this in the green room last night.
*  I fucking loved the new Beetlejuice movie.
*  I loved it.
*  I read so many bad reviews of it.
*  So many bad reviews that it fell flat.
*  I had a giant smile on my face the whole time.
*  I'm a huge Tim Burton fan.
*  I think the guy's brilliant and I think his movies are so unique because they have this
*  fingerprint of Tim Burton on them.
*  It's like it's so obviously through his mind his vision.
*  I think the guy's incredible.
*  I love all his films.
*  So for me I was like oh this is great when they got to the Soul Train I was like yes I love it.
*  This is so Tim Burton.
*  And so many people criticize that in particular there was something offensive about the Soul Train.
*  Fuck off.
*  Also people say shit about fucking restaurants.
*  Everything.
*  And I'm like yeah it's fucking great.
*  Everything.
*  It's a fucking cheeseburger.
*  I love cheeseburgers.
*  It's fucking good.
*  Some guy from the New York Times wrote a negative review about Peter Lugar's steakhouse in
*  Brooklyn.
*  Peter Lugar's steakhouse in Brooklyn is a fucking classic.
*  If I'm anywhere near that area I'm eating there 100 percent.
*  That place is sensational.
*  It was near our old vice office and we when we didn't have any money the hack was you go there
*  order lunch to go and you order the burger because it's all the ends of the steaks and the
*  fucking killer burger and you take it down to the river and you look at Manhattan and have this
*  was five dollar burger at the time and you're like this is the greatest fucking lunch in the
*  greatest city.
*  I fucking love it here man.
*  If I can make it there.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like fucking New York man.
*  This is Peter Lugar fucking burger.
*  There's Manhattan and we're gonna fuck.
*  But this review was so toxic and Ari and I had just eaten there.
*  Ari just been no Ari Shafir.
*  We had just sorry we had just been there like a month before.
*  We were like what the fuck are you talking about.
*  We had one of the best meals of our lives.
*  It's also an experience.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the whole thing.
*  There's butter on it.
*  The smell.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's old.
*  The smag and the fucking best.
*  All the guys who work there.
*  So good.
*  Been there for 35 years.
*  Shout out to Peter Lugar.
*  Shout out to Peter Lugar.
*  But it's the point it's like even a place like that that you should you should go there and just
*  take in what you're experiencing.
*  You're you're you're experiencing a classic old school steakhouse that does it exactly the
*  same way every time.
*  I have been for like forever forever forever.
*  But it's just that people even in that will find negativity.
*  Everything sucks.
*  And I think we were talking about this last night that I think this is a symbol of the
*  times we're going through right now because everyone is so anxious.
*  The presidential elections are headed and no one knows what the fuck is going to happen or
*  what's the what's the right answer.
*  Is it better if she gets in.
*  Is it better if he gets in.
*  Is he going to be a dictator.
*  Is she going to crack down on free speech.
*  Are we going to be in World War 3.
*  What's happened.
*  Does Iran have a fucking nuke.
*  Was that earthquake a nuke or was it just an earthquake.
*  You know there's a nuclear test.
*  The weather.
*  Why does God hate Florida.
*  Like what all these different things like there's so much going on Israel and Gaza and
*  the Middle East and fuck man.
*  And so everyone is like fuck Tim Burton.
*  Fuck that movie.
*  Fuck this.
*  Fuck that.
*  Fuck that restaurant.
*  It's like it's just this the zeitgeist is disturbed.
*  We don't have it's not a peaceful time in a lot of anxiety.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't you know I think we're missing out on the reality of our existence which if
*  we lived at any other time we lived in 1924 and you got a time machine to go to 2024 you'd
*  be like holy shit.
*  This is amazing 1824.
*  When you go get stabbed with a fucking bayonet and die of gangrene over.
*  Like it was fucking unpleasant.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're eating shit.
*  You're sitting all the time because everybody weighed 120 pounds.
*  Yes there is no food.
*  There's no food.
*  Yeah.
*  Couldn't drink water right because you get to sit like it was bad.
*  It was bad.
*  There's a reason why most people in history were drunk because they had to drink alcohol
*  because if you drink regular water you'd have fucking poison in it.
*  It's like you're getting bacteria.
*  And then when we moved to cities we're like you know what now we got to figure it out.
*  We'll just put it in pipes and this beautiful lead pipes.
*  Just put it in.
*  Well now it's PVC pipes.
*  Everyone's got plastic in their balls.
*  Well that's the other problem I wanted to talk to you about is don't you freak it because
*  because when I first started started studying politics you have to take stats and they're
*  like there was a Southern dude teaching me he's like you can have a statistic to prove
*  anything.
*  And my thing now is this is what I became interested in is like all this is why I started
*  with RFK.
*  Everyone has all the stats and then they give stats so forcefully that you believe in
*  that sounds fucking thing.
*  And the stats about this and their stats about that and all the stats are bad.
*  Yeah there's no good stats.
*  There's no good stats.
*  Well there's a good stat in terms of if you look at society in comparison to society of
*  200 years ago it's safer.
*  Yeah.
*  People are kinder people are way more.
*  It's it's way way more educated.
*  We understand things more.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you look at the sort of coefficient of of hundreds of years ago Elon brought that up
*  and I remember looking at that going oh yeah fuck we're doing good.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is when I got to the Carl Sagan show we're actually living in the greatest fucking
*  window of all time.
*  Where's the fucking anxiety coming from.
*  And I don't know who said this but I think it was I don't know who said this but work
*  satisfies need desire and sanity.
*  Like you need to work to like for food.
*  Yeah.
*  You know desire because happiness is going forward.
*  Yes.
*  And then sanity is if you don't fucking work you go crazy.
*  This is my fear with universal basic income which I think is inevitable.
*  Yeah.
*  It's inevitable.
*  Yeah I think that's the only way we're going to be able to keep people alive.
*  My fear is that we're going to have too much control over those people if we do that and
*  then those people will have no purpose and we'll have an even more disenfranchised
*  population than we have today.
*  And the haves and the have nots will be even further and further apart.
*  And and there's no real education that is in school today where you take a child and
*  you say hey look the world is going to change and most of these jobs are going to be
*  useless.
*  You're going to have to find something that you love that resonates with people.
*  If you do that people are going to be willing to exchange that for money.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever it is if you can make this table the guy named Drew made this table this I
*  know the man who made it.
*  He is a carpenter.
*  He made a table out of wood.
*  We gave him the specifications.
*  I told him I like oak.
*  You're like this is a handmade thing and a handmade thing is always to me is going to
*  be very valuable.
*  Yeah.
*  I love a handmade knife.
*  Yes.
*  You know I love I love things that someone worked on.
*  I love a painting like a painting that someone like my friend Taylor made this.
*  He painted it.
*  Yeah.
*  He sat down in his studio he painted it and I love that.
*  That's always going to be valuable.
*  The problem is most people have never been encouraged to pursue their interest.
*  They've been encouraged to get a job.
*  They'll be a job and they probably don't even know what their interests are or how
*  those interests are.
*  Right.
*  They've been stifled.
*  Well you're exactly right.
*  So actually when I was spending a lot of time in Silicon Valley there was a lot of
*  this talk and they're talking about universal you know living wage or basic wage.
*  And I was like what are you fucking talking about.
*  You're going to give everyone a hundred grand.
*  Right.
*  And they're like well the synthesis of AI is all human endeavor done by machines.
*  I'm like wow come on.
*  So I was kind of the skeptic.
*  You know this is 10 years ago and now all of this shit has come true.
*  They were already thinking about this back then because they're also saying exactly
*  what you said which is let's say quantum computing happens and AI at the same time
*  which is probably three years away.
*  One quantum computer has enough computing power that all the existing computers in
*  the world today.
*  Right.
*  And then you add AI to that.
*  So there's a whole new fucking tech revolution where it becomes even more rich people
*  who own shit and and even more.
*  So they're like if unless you take care of those people they're going to come
*  because we're the nerds they're going to come with the hammers and the currency is
*  going to be bullets.
*  It's not going to be chips.
*  And so you're just planted the apes.
*  You got fucking you know people on one side here and the big brains on the other
*  side.
*  And you're like oh there are they already knew this.
*  They were already thinking this because they're like we're going to buy them off.
*  But people are going to go crazy if you buy them off.
*  Yeah it's not necessarily buy them off it's keep them alive.
*  Yeah keep them okay because people are not going to have any fucking mind buy them
*  off because they're afraid that they're going to come.
*  I don't think we should look at it that way.
*  I think there's got to be a concerted effort to educate people about the
*  possibilities of their life on earth that they've been indoctrinated to think that
*  they have to be a worker.
*  How many of these people are out there that are doing masonry work really want to
*  be a painter.
*  How many of those people that really wanted to be in a band.
*  How many people.
*  There's something probably that most people want to do.
*  One thing the universal basic income will do is if you know you give everybody a
*  hundred grand a year wherever it is you're going to satisfy their they're they're
*  not going to worry about rent.
*  They're not going to worry about food.
*  So now maybe they can pursue the problem as people get fucking lazy when you give
*  them free money.
*  It's just maybe you're maybe you're right.
*  It's not everybody.
*  But a lot of people they just exist and they'll just play video games all day.
*  And you know look if we're going to deal with a society where everything is run by
*  AI and automated that you're going to have to give people money because the
*  extraordinary wealth is going to be generated by AI is going to make that not
*  that difficult to do especially when you consider how much money we give to other
*  countries already.
*  100 percent.
*  Right.
*  Over the last couple of years we've given a hundred and what how many billion
*  dollars to Ukraine.
*  It's more than it's up to 200 billion now.
*  Yeah.
*  Something crazy like that.
*  Yeah.
*  That amount of money when you're dealing with AI we're dealing with automation
*  just to keep people fed and housed like that's reasonable.
*  But you're going to have to figure out a way to give people purpose.
*  Yes.
*  And that's going to have to.
*  That's hard.
*  Be a revamping of the education system.
*  That's exactly right.
*  It's a revamping of the education system because you're saying well all of these
*  we were we were.
*  This is another great thing.
*  We were built to be workers.
*  We were.
*  You're supposed to get universal education is supposed to just be enough so you can
*  be a good worker and a good taxpayer and you get a job.
*  And then by the way you get out of college and you're you already have debt.
*  Then you buy a consumer durable.
*  You buy a fucking car.
*  You buy a washing machine and that's you know we'll give everybody that but we
*  give you debt and then you buy a house and then you're in debt and then you
*  finally get out of debt and then you die.
*  Right.
*  And so you just work work work work work.
*  And by the way you're exactly right.
*  You had to get a job.
*  J.O.B. not F.U.N.
*  That's just you go and you do it and they give you money and then you become an
*  adult. That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then but that's not true because all of this human endeavor is now going to be
*  done by machines.
*  You're like OK.
*  Now what do you got.
*  And I agree 100 percent it's going to be something that we can't even fathom which
*  is what do you really like to do.
*  Right.
*  What do you love doing.
*  What.
*  By the way building a table is worth more than fucking being a corporate executive.
*  Well it is if you enjoy it.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah. If you have a business that you actually enjoy doing.
*  Exactly.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Like that's what we have to teach.
*  Yeah.
*  Rather than we have to.
*  And there's also this comparing thing.
*  You know I was at dinner the other night and my friend whose friends were this
*  billionaire.
*  He's his friend is a billionaire and his friend was comparing his wealth to friends
*  of his that own multiple corporations that are worth 30 40 billion.
*  He's like I'm fucking poor compared to that guy.
*  You missed the whole point.
*  You missed the whole point of getting wealthy.
*  Yeah.
*  You have fuck you bunny and you're not even saying fuck you.
*  You should be on a boat somewhere man.
*  You should be Marlin fishing.
*  You know you should be fucking lying in the sun.
*  You should be doing things you enjoy doing.
*  You should be taking that trip you always wanted to take.
*  That's what you're supposed to be doing.
*  You're not supposed to be keeping up with other billionaires.
*  So you're working 16 hours a day on Adderall just so that you can fucking get those
*  stock numbers moving.
*  Yeah.
*  What.
*  Well the one.
*  Yeah.
*  The smartest thing anyone ever told me about money was my old man and he said
*  life is like a shit sandwich.
*  The more bread you have the less shit you have to eat.
*  This is a guy who the only dude who ever lost money on insider trading.
*  He was not good.
*  But but but it's true.
*  Like the one thing the one thing that you do notice when you get a bit of people are
*  fucking nice to you.
*  That is nice to you.
*  And when you don't have money not online.
*  But like and then and then and then then you realize like oh fuck like people like can
*  be like are not nice to you.
*  You know in general a lot of times and you're like that's fucking sucks.
*  And and like yeah when you get a bit of money a bit of success whatever people are
*  not fucking nicer.
*  And that's the one thing that that you know that I that I remarked upon in my life.
*  The rest of it's all garbage.
*  The rest of it's all bullshit.
*  But but but but people being nice and like you know not shit not sucking.
*  Yeah.
*  That's pretty good.
*  That's nice.
*  And having a cushion.
*  So you don't have to worry about like.
*  I remember the first check I got a real check I got a development deal from Disney of all
*  people when I was like I guess I was like 26.
*  And it was the first time ever I had like a good chunk of money like six figures in
*  the bank.
*  Yeah.
*  And I felt weight different.
*  I felt weight lifted off like a physical feeling of whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Because every like my whole life it's like how am I going to eat.
*  How am I going to pay my rent.
*  How am I going to do this.
*  And then all of a sudden I don't have to worry about that anymore.
*  And I was like oh I get it now.
*  And I remember this revelation like OK now I just have to keep the momentum going
*  because once you have a good amount of money where you don't have to worry about
*  money anymore that feel you don't want to get ever get back to that desperation
*  feeling.
*  That's a terrible feeling.
*  And that's the feeling most people are listening to this existent that feeling of
*  concern about your bills.
*  Number one struggle in marriages.
*  It's a number one number one struggle for everything for everything.
*  Well this is why we're getting bring it up.
*  I had the exact same moment in my life.
*  I never had any money and then I'll never forget it.
*  I was walking down the Ramblas and in Barcelona because I was living there trying to
*  set up vice pain and I went in a bank machine and we had done some deal and it was
*  the first time I got paid any money.
*  It wasn't a lot of money but it was you know same kind of deal like six figure
*  thing.
*  And and I took out the money and I went like my life changed.
*  I still remember how I like how it smelled.
*  I still remember because my life changed.
*  This was the first time I didn't have twenty eight dollars in my bank account.
*  Right.
*  And I just went and like my like my breathing.
*  Yeah.
*  Just everything like you said like it was like a weight lifts off weight lifts off
*  you.
*  And and that that and and humans don't like to go backwards.
*  But yeah living in that sort of constant fear.
*  That's the problem with money.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's why there is a chance and it was good you brought that up actually that
*  like you can you can kind of take this anyway.
*  You know like human humanity can take the next let's say 20 years anyway we want to
*  take it and you can take it to be like let's fucking learn from what we've learned
*  and be positive and try to take this as a fucking thing where humanity gets better
*  and we do this in the right way rather than just do it fucking knee jerk reaction
*  freaking out like what the fuck's going to fuck.
*  Like I think I'm sure that you're going to look back at a time when like social media
*  was fucking fucking up kids heads and you're going to say that was crazy dude.
*  Right. It's going to be like smoking.
*  We're going to look at the stock market and go yes fucking completely manipulated by
*  supercomputers and trillion dollar funds and the little guy gets fucked.
*  Why the fuck did we let that happen.
*  Right. Right.
*  It's going to be all kinds of coming out of the pond moments where we go hey like we
*  were we were doing it wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's this big you know chaos is a ladder.
*  There's this big you know chaotic time right now and you're exactly right and people
*  getting anxious about it.
*  And you're like yeah we've got to use that as a time to say hey why don't we fucking
*  have an economy where there is a universal basic wage and or living wage.
*  And we take that to doing shit where you do something that you like and you're you're
*  you're you're happy about because that your job is probably going away.
*  I guarantee you it will cause less crime.
*  I think crime will dip substantially.
*  I think there'll be less civil unrest.
*  People's needs will be met.
*  It'll it'll give everyone that feeling of oh I don't have to worry about my bills
*  anymore. It's just finding purpose.
*  That's going to be the next thing.
*  And the people that are really going to be fucked are the people that didn't find
*  purpose already.
*  And then they're like 40.
*  And then that happens because they're going to be sad.
*  And that's that's what I'm worried about.
*  I'm worried about the people that are already sort of indoctrinated into a certain
*  specific way of living.
*  And then all of a sudden their purpose which was their job you know they worked at
*  the factory and they're like you know Johnny's employee the month Johnny you're
*  doing a fucking great job.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  That guy feels purpose.
*  He puts in a hard day's work when he gets that paycheck he knows he earned it.
*  That's who he is.
*  He's the number one guy at the plant.
*  He's the foreman.
*  He's the guy the men respect.
*  That's a real thing for human beings.
*  We need a thing that makes us feel like we're progressing.
*  It's a part of our DNA.
*  Our DNA the reason why we're still alive.
*  The reason why we survived is because we solve problems.
*  We've figured out what's going on.
*  We've made ourselves useful and it makes you useful to the tribe.
*  It makes you makes you feel good.
*  You have a sense of purpose.
*  That's the guy that's the best hunter.
*  She knows how to fucking plant vegetables.
*  He knows how to make cloth.
*  Everybody had a job and it gave you a sense of purpose.
*  We're going to have to figure this out quick because I think it's going to be
*  like the birth of a child.
*  It's going to be like this screaming painful.
*  It's going to be this thing filled with anxiety but it is happening whether we
*  like it or not.
*  And if we don't start educating children about the benefits of having a fulfilled
*  life where you're doing something you actually enjoy and not telling them don't
*  do that it's too hard.
*  Don't do that.
*  It's risky.
*  Thank God I didn't listen to anybody because my whole you wouldn't exist.
*  I would have not a thing I did ever.
*  Anybody told me to do not fighting.
*  My parents tried to stop me from fighting.
*  When I was doing martial arts when I tried to do comedy they were worried that
*  why you did so well in martial arts.
*  Why are you quitting and doing this new thing.
*  And every fucking step of the way when I started doing podcasts my friends like
*  what are you wasting your time doing this.
*  It was always start doing video podcasts.
*  People like why are you spending so much time doing video.
*  That's so stupid.
*  Nobody watches video.
*  Everyone says no.
*  I was like I don't care.
*  I just want to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Just do what you like to do.
*  But I just for whatever reason got lucky that I got into a pattern like that very
*  early in life.
*  Both my parents work so there wasn't a lot of guidance.
*  So I found a thing that I liked and I just went and did it.
*  And you know they're like why are you wasting your time doing it.
*  Bye mom.
*  Fucking leave the house.
*  And I was on my own and so I got into a pattern of that early.
*  But there's so many people that don't and so many people that get a job and then
*  that job is going to go away and it's going to be replaced by a fucking computer.
*  And if you're listening to this and that happens to you don't become an alcoholic.
*  Don't just give in.
*  Find something else.
*  Find purpose.
*  Find a thing.
*  Go back to what you love.
*  There's so many.
*  I wish I had 50 lives to live simultaneously.
*  I would have a bunch of different jobs.
*  I've always wanted to do a bunch of different things.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many interesting things in this life.
*  Well I think you're 100 percent right but I also think like especially with kids
*  now is the time to start saying exactly that.
*  Yes.
*  Like listen.
*  Yes.
*  You know like I did what I wanted to do and the same thing everybody told me no.
*  You know everyone told you no and all that stuff which by the way you know when I
*  heard them saying no like when you're like I'm going to get into fighting.
*  Yeah no.
*  You're not.
*  I'm going to do comedy.
*  Yeah no you're not.
*  Oh now I'm going to get into the park.
*  What the fuck's a podcast.
*  You're not going to.
*  I can hear them say no.
*  My brain.
*  Howard Stern used to mock podcasts and he was my hero.
*  It's like a guy who loved listening to him on the radio and hearing him mock
*  podcasts when I was doing it was like damn.
*  I was like oh he's wrong.
*  The laugh of the victorious.
*  It's a good laugh.
*  It's a good one.
*  It's the best laugh.
*  But yes everyone said no to me but so now I agree you have to go to kids and say
*  look dude do whatever the fuck you want and do what you're good at do what you're
*  passionate about.
*  Like the whole thing.
*  We got to stimulate them.
*  Stimulate them with interesting things.
*  I mean that's what we're talking about how I got this unexpected education on this
*  podcast.
*  I realized that it wasn't that I was not interested in things or that I wasn't
*  intelligent.
*  It's that I wasn't stimulated and I was a very physical person when I was a kid.
*  I had so much fucking energy.
*  And when you're sitting in a class and you're a little buzz saw like it was like I
*  can't do this.
*  If I lived with the wrong parents and especially in a different time I would have
*  100 percent been medicated.
*  Yeah.
*  But what it was was that I was a different car.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  I wasn't a Honda Civic.
*  You know I was a Shelby Mustang.
*  The shirt I'm wearing.
*  Yeah.
*  I was I was I needed to go.
*  I need to go.
*  I got to get stimulated by things.
*  I need stuff that excites me.
*  I can't just sit down and I'm not good at listening.
*  Which is not what school does.
*  It cuts off the tall trees.
*  It doesn't just do that.
*  It tells you to not go for it.
*  Yeah.
*  It tells you exactly.
*  It cut off.
*  You're you're a bad person.
*  Yeah.
*  If you can't you don't fit in.
*  Yeah.
*  And but like somebody had to be Johnny Cash.
*  100 percent.
*  There's we all celebrate these people that escaped somebody had to be Jimi Hendrix.
*  Somebody had to be Richard Pryor.
*  Like obviously they were real.
*  Like so they did it.
*  And everyone told them not to do this.
*  It's like a reward for getting out of that fucking quagmire of bullshit and mediocrity.
*  And that's what we it's got to be the Smith Rogen Academy and just say look don't do any
*  of that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You fucking do what you love and also find shit that interests you and go do that because I
*  didn't do that for a while.
*  It's like a fucking purgatory.
*  You got to pursue it like your life depends on it.
*  You do because it does actually does it actually does.
*  And you can get gig jobs.
*  You can wait tables.
*  You can drive Uber.
*  I drove limos.
*  I did construction.
*  I did whatever I had to do.
*  I delivered newspapers.
*  I did whatever I had to do to try to like do a thing that and I didn't know if I was going
*  to make it.
*  But back then when you're 21 years old you have no responsibilities.
*  No health insurance.
*  No nothing.
*  And you could just fucking try things.
*  Yeah.
*  Just try things.
*  And if you don't do that you're going to be sad.
*  And that's the reality of the world we live in.
*  When people want to talk to the about the levels of depression in this country.
*  What about the levels of purpose.
*  And do they coincide with the levels of how many people have learned to control their
*  emotions.
*  How many people have learned to get their health in order.
*  How many people have learned how to meditate.
*  How many people have learned how to think about things before you make a decision and try
*  to give yourself advice objectively.
*  How many not over Medicaid or not Medicaid.
*  You're not Medicaid at all.
*  How many people have learned how to like apologize to your friends apologize to your family if
*  you made a mistake.
*  How many people have learned to own up to when you were the wrong when you were in the
*  wrong instead of just covering it up and pretending and arguing and trying to you know
*  distort things.
*  Just learn.
*  Learning grow like we all make mistakes.
*  We all.
*  And if you're on the wrong path in life and if you're doing something you don't want to
*  do figure out a way to get the fuck out of that job and actually do it.
*  Don't talk about it.
*  Fucking do it.
*  Because if you don't.
*  And if you do it it's going to be so exciting.
*  It's going to be terrifying.
*  You're like oh my God I can't believe I'm afraid.
*  Oh my God.
*  I got to I got to make this happen.
*  But fucking go for it.
*  You don't have much time.
*  You have to.
*  You got to.
*  If you don't you're going to be sad.
*  And that's just the reality of a lot of you or you're going to be angry.
*  And it's really you're not even angry at the things you think you're angry at.
*  You're angry at your existence.
*  Well that's when I go back to this thing of you want to talk about meditation is
*  whenever you get angry or anxious whatever say look you're living in the greatest
*  fucking window of time ever in the history of fucking time ever.
*  So what are you waiting for.
*  The better window of time.
*  Right.
*  It's not coming.
*  Right.
*  And so when you put it in a sort of grandiose perspective you're like I'm going
*  to enjoy the fucking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Out of today because this is the best day in the fucking world ever.
*  It's the best day.
*  But not only in the world in the history of the world but in the history of every
*  other planet that we that we that we know about.
*  And part of what makes it exciting is that we're almost blowing it apart.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's the other problem.
*  That's what you should enjoy if you're sitting at a restaurant having a nice steak
*  and a glass of wine.
*  You should enjoy the fact that you know we're not in rubble.
*  You should.
*  That's a real thing.
*  That's a real thing.
*  That's a real thing.
*  I feel like that every time I come back from somewhere you know and that's one
*  thing about reporting is you come back and you're like you really fucking enjoy
*  you really enjoy life.
*  This really is the promised land.
*  It really is.
*  I mean clearly not for everybody but also there's a possibility.
*  The opportunity awaits itself right here.
*  It really is the greatest country the world has ever known.
*  In the middle of all the bullshit we're going through and all the chaos and all
*  the potential wars that we're involved in and wars we're involved in it's still
*  the greatest place ever the greatest time ever.
*  It's just confusing.
*  It's also one of the only countries you realize guys like us like you have a kick
*  at the can.
*  Yeah right.
*  Most countries you don't have a kick at the can.
*  You got the wrong last name wrong accent.
*  Cast systems.
*  Yeah.
*  Well just and like like England.
*  Yeah.
*  Europe with yours aristocracy then you had everything.
*  And if you weren't you had nothing.
*  And if you want to get ahead people get angry at you.
*  There's some stat like again going back to stats but there's some stat like 80
*  percent of the world's wealth is inherited and by 2045 it's going to be even
*  higher.
*  And you're like oh fuck you for yet because we come from oh we made money or
*  Elon made money or Larry Page made money or whatever.
*  Those are the real rich guy Bezos.
*  And and but but the majority of the world it's like yeah my parents had money a
*  thousand years ago so I have money today.
*  That's so crazy.
*  And that's how you make Joffrey's.
*  Well that's how you make fucking Game of Thrones.
*  Yeah.
*  That's how you make lots of them.
*  Yeah you make monsters monsters.
*  And so so yeah like you come here and I'm like I'm an immigrant.
*  I came here.
*  Fuck it.
*  I was the ambassador for fucking New York.
*  I'm like I came here with no fucking shoes.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking loves great fucking city in the fucking fucking amazing.
*  And the Canadians were like because the Canadian identity is like we're not
*  American kind of thing.
*  And I was on a ball.
*  I went to New York and like this is the greatest goddamn city in the fucking
*  world and which it is.
*  And then and then and then I moved to L.A.
*  when I had kids.
*  I was pretty fucking nice.
*  I used to want to live in Canada.
*  I used to love Canada.
*  I love Canada.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  I love Canada.
*  Canada is a great place.
*  I thought about living in Vancouver.
*  That's beautiful.
*  I was like I could live in Vancouver.
*  Like if shit hits the fan in the United States.
*  I always felt like a beautiful country.
*  And Canadians are amazing people.
*  They're amazing amazing.
*  I always feel like Canada has 20 percent less douchebags.
*  That's my feeling when I used to do shows up there.
*  We would all talk about it.
*  We'd do a gig in Toronto.
*  We'd do a gig in Montreal.
*  Yeah.
*  And we like Canada is the best.
*  I love it up there.
*  I love the people.
*  They're friendly and hardworking.
*  Great place to go.
*  They're peaceful.
*  Smart.
*  They're smart.
*  They're educated.
*  Yeah.
*  It was always fun.
*  I loved it up there.
*  I just love the attitude of the place.
*  I've met so many cool people in Canada.
*  But now the way Trudeau is running it, it scares the shit out of me.
*  I'm like you guys are sliding into communism.
*  You're sliding every day.
*  They push a little bit further a little bit further.
*  I mean if you don't get rid of that guy if you don't turn that thing around you're fucked.
*  Yeah.
*  Look I've seen a lot of things happen in Canada where to me it's it's government
*  shouldn't run things at all.
*  Like if we can stay away from it.
*  What does that mean?
*  It means like universal health care.
*  So when I grew up it was good.
*  You go to any hospital the doctors were all good.
*  Some of the best doctors in the world.
*  And then because they didn't manage it correctly and got too big it got too good.
*  Like 80 cents of every dollar was going to managing it rather than the doctors.
*  So they left.
*  They came down here.
*  There's a big brain drain and now you can't get a doctor.
*  You have to sign up and wait for three years.
*  It's like the NHS in the UK or something.
*  And it just doesn't work because the government is too big.
*  It's just you know once you get the government involved it becomes like a welfare program.
*  You're just paying all kinds of people to work on the thing.
*  But no one's doing the actual thing that they're supposed to work on.
*  Right.
*  The health care.
*  Bureaucracy.
*  Bureaucracy.
*  So it's a problem.
*  But I my later stages in life to get into this and to get into the American political
*  system and the bull goose loony that that is this political cycle and this electoral
*  cycle and Canada and what's happening in Europe.
*  I really get this feeling and maybe you know we're going to get into it on this.
*  But when I was younger you know and I was studying stuff and I was I always feel like I
*  would love to go back to being in college because when I was in college I just wanted to
*  get out.
*  I wanted to get out and make money and stuff and I just did everything to just get the
*  fuck out.
*  And now I'm like if I could just read books and talk to people and then write about that
*  I'd fucking where do I sign up.
*  Just thinking about shit.
*  So I fucking would love to.
*  It's wrong timing when you're when you're.
*  But anyway but I used to study.
*  I loved philosophy.
*  I love politics.
*  When I first came down to America and I've been studying American politics.
*  Bubba Clinton was a consensus politician reduced the size of government took the largest
*  deficit of all time to the largest surplus of all time.
*  And then Bush got in turn the largest surplus of all time the largest deficit increased
*  size government.
*  I'm like no one said boo.
*  No one said anything.
*  And you're like the whole fundamental principles of the Republican Democratic Party
*  immigration.
*  Before Trump the it was there's none more Reagan than me was the calling card of of
*  GOP.
*  Reagan was the best president for immigration.
*  If you're an immigrant ever.
*  He was super pro immigration and the Democrats were against it.
*  They completely switched their platforms on it.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like to me when you look at America you say OK it's a republic it's two party
*  system they're always in power.
*  One that's like a two party system you're always in power you're always in power or
*  you're fucking trying to control the house.
*  And you're like is it all much ado about nothing.
*  Is it all a political like bread and pop at the it's like this is super fucking
*  important for you to watch over here to give you some sort of thinking that I have some
*  agency and I can vote and it's going to fucking matter about anything.
*  Whereas what the fuck really changes on the big shit like what the fuck really changes
*  on the economy.
*  What the fuck really changes for any of the shit that we're talking about about school
*  about education about big like the other shit you talk about which is fascinating and it's
*  great that you do it about big pharma big food big education military industrial.
*  What the fuck really changes in that.
*  Zero.
*  Yeah.
*  The only thing that changes is if there's someone who really wants to push reform really
*  wants to change things.
*  And the real question is like when you get a guy like Trump is promising all this stuff.
*  How much can you actually get away with.
*  How much can you actually change.
*  What what can you actually do and will that change things for the very little.
*  Well when it comes to politically politically politically America set up to do very the
*  American government is set to do very little and do it very slowly.
*  That was what it was.
*  Well not only that a long time ago we gave in to allowing money to enter into politics
*  and this huge influential way.
*  And then we allowed pharmaceutical drug companies to advertise on television and all those
*  things. But those were the big ones because as soon as you had control of the narrative
*  there's no way the media is going to spoil the relationship that they have with their
*  biggest providers of revenue.
*  They're not going to do that.
*  So whatever whether it's the food companies or whether it's pharmaceutical drug companies
*  they're going to ignore as much as possible about the negatives of these products.
*  And then you have a propaganda state where you have these people that are literally hired
*  to say stories they know are not true because this will benefit the people that are their
*  advertisers. And that's where you get fucking crazy.
*  It's also how that model implodes which is fascinating.
*  So that model becomes less relevant.
*  And the Michael Schellenberg is in the mat tie.
*  Eby's of the world.
*  Then people start turning to them.
*  The Glenn Greenwald's of the world.
*  He was like well these people Joe Rogan are honest and they're well I'm not a journalist.
*  I know but but these people are on interview a lot of people who tell a lot of things that
*  people don't get other places.
*  Yes.
*  And then crazy people too.
*  But that's fine.
*  Aliens.
*  Let's get into aliens.
*  Comedians.
*  I want to know what you know about aliens.
*  Yeah.
*  Sorry.
*  I want to hear that end of that thought.
*  I don't remember where I was going.
*  Where was I going.
*  You were.
*  So what they've done is they've created their own demise by giving it to Satan's deal.
*  So by sucking Satan's cock and getting all that money you've now you're not a news
*  organization anymore.
*  You're a propaganda outlet and everybody knows it.
*  You have the news but that's what the news is a thin layer of bread on the shit.
*  Yes.
*  But that's been.
*  See this is the thing is that's been since the fucking beginning it's nothing new.
*  Like I forget who it was but I was talking to somebody who's what is news.
*  What is news Shane.
*  You know who Roy Ter was.
*  You know who Roy Ter was.
*  He he he he started Reuters to start a newspaper to say fuck you to his enemy.
*  Blah blah blah.
*  He just bought it.
*  He was just a rich guy.
*  I can't do his accent anymore.
*  But basically he got incensed with me because he was just like that's what it always was.
*  Some rich guy would start a newspaper just to say fuck you to the other guy.
*  Bezos by the Washington Post.
*  Well because he was on the cover of the New York Times.
*  What is it.
*  You can't you can't be on the cover of the New York Times 18 days in a row.
*  And he was on 13.
*  Was he.
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  By the way it worked.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I mean look you can use money to get a lot of things done but it's just.
*  I'm just not what I'm saying is there's always been money in politics and there's always
*  been money in media.
*  It's just now it's it's more obvious than ever before.
*  And now you're right.
*  There are agendas.
*  So my whole thing is like I'm an immigrant but I'm non-political.
*  I'm literally serious.
*  Like I I believe in the game.
*  I like the game.
*  I like watching the game.
*  And that's why I say like I like to take a look like okay there's this whole fucking
*  thing going on over here where the status quo doesn't change.
*  And I think you and I are like look that's what has to fucking change over there.
*  That's the real power over there.
*  Yeah.
*  This shit for me becomes and it's funny because this is like I don't know what I'm
*  showing up myself.
*  I don't know what the elect this election is 53 54 something like that.
*  The 54 50.
*  It's pretty close.
*  Around there somewhere.
*  It fluctuates depending on what.
*  So we're on season 53.
*  Right.
*  And that's why you have to have the craziness.
*  You have to have two assassination attempts.
*  You have to have fucking Biden.
*  By the way Biden has to be kicked out mid-election and we're going to get so like
*  you're like oh season 53 the Fonz is jumping the shark but the sharks feed by piranhas.
*  Not only that Biden's wearing a MAGA hat like this.
*  But that's like look can I pause you for a second.
*  Yeah.
*  Jamie you brought something.
*  You didn't bring it up.
*  Somebody else brought up Sean brought it up to me.
*  Was there some sort of a physical altercation between Jill Biden's people and Kamala
*  Harris's people reports about this stuff on Twitter but like it's just like Twitter
*  reports.
*  I haven't seen anyone show pictures or quotes.
*  It's just like a Twitter account saying stuff like that.
*  What is it a good Twitter account.
*  I would.
*  I don't remember.
*  There's a few people I follow where I know they're full of shit because they just want
*  to see nonsense.
*  I like it.
*  And I just what does this take.
*  But it's kind of good.
*  It's a lot of the Michelle Obama has dick.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many of them.
*  So many of them.
*  But I love I love memes.
*  Oh my God.
*  I fucking love memes.
*  And how fast and hard.
*  You want to talk about creativity in art.
*  Like some of them are so fucking good and so artistic and so quick.
*  You're like how the fuck did they fucking do that one.
*  Like I fucking love it.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's so inappropriate.
*  And that's what's fun about it is because you never kind of say you never say this.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I'm like yeah I'll send this to Jamie so he knows what we're talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like so I'm just like it's like there's so many of them now.
*  And so anyway that's like I was during during during.
*  Check out during COVID.
*  Oh well this guy's pretty legit.
*  Right.
*  But just as per White House official.
*  How do you say his name.
*  Post.
*  So big.
*  Also how do you say his name.
*  Post.
*  So big post.
*  But this guy's pretty legit.
*  There was a physical altercation with Jill and Kamala staffers in the White House after Joe's press room last week began with accusations the Biden's were undermining Kamala's
*  deliberately per White House official.
*  Well it does seem like he's doing that.
*  Like when he called that press conference he hadn't called any press conference.
*  So he decides to call a press conference in the middle of a national emergency.
*  He's out.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's out.
*  And everyone nobody's still the president.
*  So he can call a press conference.
*  So he decides to do that.
*  He's wearing the MAGA hat.
*  Like look there's no fucking way they're happy they got kicked out and Jill did not want him to step down.
*  She started taking cabinet meetings.
*  Right.
*  Like.
*  Yeah I saw that.
*  Who elected you.
*  Can I do it.
*  Let me do it.
*  Let me do it.
*  I'm not elected either.
*  Let me just sit in find out what's going on with these people.
*  What are you talking about.
*  How are you running a cabinet meeting.
*  You're just married to the guy that's the president.
*  But that's the whole thing too because she sat at.
*  I've sat in that room like you can go and you can sit in the room.
*  Yeah but he wasn't there.
*  Yeah he wasn't.
*  But I don't think she was running the cabinet meeting.
*  Because that's what I'd heard.
*  Yeah that's what people say because there's a picture of her there but she's not running the fucking cabinet.
*  Why do you want to ruin a great story.
*  This is fun.
*  It's fun if she's running.
*  There you go.
*  If she.
*  I hope she's running it.
*  I hope she's boss bitch.
*  Tell everybody what the fuck to do.
*  The thing the thing about it.
*  I'm married to a goddamn president for one more month.
*  If you want to look at.
*  Like the greatest time of the Republican Party when when Reagan was president.
*  It was his cabinet.
*  His cabinet was exceptional.
*  And because he's like he he had dementia.
*  But his cabinet.
*  Not initially.
*  Not initially.
*  But later on.
*  But his cabinet was running America.
*  It was fucking great.
*  Right.
*  So you see.
*  The cabinet should run America.
*  I'd rather have the cabinet run.
*  Yeah.
*  Something of professionals people who are like designed to do that rather than one fucking person is going to go yes no.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  That's great.
*  They're the fucking Queen of England and they're supposed to be the Queen of England.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think his dementia was convenient.
*  Whose.
*  Reagan's.
*  I was wondering if he was doing like a Jimmy the chin type thing.
*  No.
*  Look.
*  Reagan.
*  Do you like.
*  Here's what Jimmy Tingle was an amazing comedian.
*  He had this great bit way back in 1988.
*  When when Reagan was in trouble for selling weapons to Iran.
*  And he said I can't recall.
*  And he goes do me a favor.
*  Mr.
*  President you ever sell an arms to people who hate us.
*  Jot it down.
*  It's pretty good.
*  He goes make a note.
*  Put it on your refrigerator.
*  Yeah.
*  I never I literally never even thought of that.
*  I would do that.
*  He said he couldn't remember anything.
*  That's a good move.
*  Who could tell you whether or not you can remember things.
*  You could play dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what Jimmy the chin did.
*  I don't remember.
*  Do you know that story.
*  No.
*  Jimmy the chin gigante was a mob leader.
*  And he would walk around with a bathrobe and slippers and just mumble to himself.
*  Yes.
*  And he would walk down the street with his capos.
*  And the FBI knew this.
*  And so what they did was they put these little microphones on all the hubcaps so they could
*  record his conversation as he walked down the street.
*  So as he's walking on the street they were recording everything.
*  Wow.
*  I love shit like I love shit like that.
*  Like when Israel intercepts the pagers of Hezbollah and blows everybody's balls off.
*  That is look it's terrible.
*  Those people died.
*  But it seems like they weren't good people.
*  But at the bottom line is you know how fucking genius that is to stop the actual shipment.
*  Yeah.
*  Sorry to figure out that they use this type of analog pager.
*  Stop the shipment put and then get them to all go over the same time.
*  Wait wait wait wait months and make sure that no one's on an airplane.
*  There's an amazing book called Rise Up and Kill First.
*  I've read that.
*  Yeah it's a great book.
*  It's about this.
*  Yeah.
*  Like we can't win a war.
*  So we're going to assassinate our way to safety.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all about Israel.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  And using political assassinations.
*  Yes.
*  Fantastic.
*  It's crazy.
*  When you find out they're doing that like god damn.
*  Well you know how god damn genius that is.
*  And you imagine being them and realizing like this is how deeply Israel's infested your
*  organization.
*  That's got to be terrible.
*  Just recently they got the head of Hezbollah and then the second head and then the third
*  head within like three or four days of each other.
*  And then they're trying to get new guys and they're like yeah I don't want that gig.
*  I am not.
*  I don't want that gig.
*  It's the whole thing is it's very very fascinating.
*  Well there are people that invented Pegasus.
*  You know they invented that the ability to just date now.
*  Apparently your phone Pegasus too.
*  All they have to have is your phone number.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're in.
*  That's true.
*  I have I actually talked to one of the guys who own that company.
*  If you want the hack for Pegasus I don't know if it still is.
*  Turn your phone off repeatedly and then because every time you turn your phone off they
*  have to re-put the Pegasus in.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about that.
*  Well that's that was from the dude.
*  I would tell that to people just fucking idiot shut his phone off.
*  I got it from the owner it's true.
*  Meanwhile you're never off the phone.
*  We never off.
*  That's how you could use find your phone.
*  I mean there's I'm sure there's probably some hacks but Eric Prince has a new phone
*  called the unplugged phone that's designed by the guy who created Pegasus apparently.
*  And it's like this untrackable phone that kind of constantly but.
*  Who knows.
*  I don't.
*  I think you can track everything.
*  I think you are.
*  First of all with quantum computing quantum computing becomes ubiquitous.
*  There's going to be no more passwords.
*  That's all gone.
*  We're folks.
*  It does not work.
*  Security is out the window.
*  Bitcoin.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Your credit card.
*  Oh you're fucked.
*  Everything.
*  Everyone's fucked.
*  And we're not prepared for that.
*  100 percent.
*  No it's going to be real weird because I've always said like what money is today.
*  Essentially is numbers.
*  It's just ones and zeros.
*  We make it up.
*  And the thing that you see with the Internet is as technology increases people get more and
*  more access to information to ones and zeros to data.
*  Yeah.
*  The bottleneck is going to be money.
*  Yeah.
*  And eventually that's going to break through.
*  And then what do you own.
*  And who owns what.
*  And where is it stored.
*  And what is it.
*  It's all it's all digital.
*  And soon very soon there'll be no digital encryption.
*  There'll be no digital safety at all.
*  Everything.
*  By the way you're talking about money.
*  Every fucking.
*  So I.
*  One of the most fascinating guys.
*  I think you talked to him too.
*  I went to Russia and I hung out with him at the Metropole which is funny because it's the
*  whole famously the every room is bugged because it was the only place they let foreigners
*  stay in Moscow.
*  And so we're at the Metropole.
*  We got into surveillance.
*  And but he opened my phone and like he was like as we were having the interview just
*  showing me like how they can turn on the phone.
*  How can it do.
*  And how to like take out this part and take out this camera and do this and do that.
*  Just like as he was talking about overall government surveillance of everybody which
*  by the way I don't think a lot of people know what he did.
*  He he said look the American government is illegally illegally spying on its own
*  people.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And and by the way hadn't told him illegally they weren't allowed to.
*  They the mafia guys they had to get warrants from judges and shit to fucking to bug those
*  cars.
*  Now they don't have to get shit.
*  They don't need shit.
*  They just say they have fucking planes with Enzi catchers flying around.
*  They're picking up right now or talking about 100 percent.
*  Every time I have a conversation every text I send even the fucked up ones I go what.
*  Someone's got that.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So that's what you're going to say.
*  So not only do your money but like your whole search history whatever is in your fucking
*  computer.
*  I tell my kids I tell my kids like your phone is your whole human archive.
*  And at some point someone can take that thing and say this is you know evidence or this
*  is this or this or like you.
*  You have to make sure that your phone is like you have to always be thinking because not
*  only that if you're in some sort of a trial all that shit becomes public record.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what gets really weird.
*  Like there's two different people that were involved in trials where my text messages to
*  them became public and got printed in stories.
*  One was Alex Jones the other was Elon Musk.
*  It's very strange that they just have access to your text messages.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for what reason.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm because I'm talking to some guy that I know.
*  Like what do you what do you like the fact that the end of the Alex Jones thing they
*  wanted every text message he and I had ever exchanged.
*  Wow.
*  Fuck you.
*  Fuck you.
*  So we got it down to whether or not he talked to me about Sandy Hook.
*  That's another thing.
*  There has to be tort reform.
*  Anyone can sue anybody for anything and not have to pay their lawyer the lawyer can take
*  50 percent of the price.
*  It's it's it's it's extortion and it's just it's it's I don't know.
*  Something has to change there because they're just sitting there suing people because they
*  can.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it's a sport for people and it's a way to make a living.
*  I mean it's like gold digging.
*  It's a viable strategy.
*  You know it's a lot of that.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  Definitely a lot of that tort reform.
*  That would be a good thing.
*  So we got to reform we got education.
*  But I think what we were talking about earlier with quantum computing and I think we're all
*  in real trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I think this society is going to be completely reimagined and it probably will
*  lean towards some sort of a more socialist existence because of necessity because of
*  this money thing because I just really don't know how you're going to accumulate real
*  wealth if everything becomes digital.
*  I think if everything becomes digital A.I.
*  quantum computer we're going to we're going to have real chaos.
*  Well the problem with quantum is it's going to be OK.
*  There's a whole new.
*  So when when the sort of West or the north of the rich countries whatever leave everyone
*  else behind you know monetarily is when you know the last 20 years of digital expansion
*  and we just make a trillion dollar companies and they're over here and we make all that
*  money in that economy and then you go to like two thirds of the world and that shit hasn't
*  even penetrated yet.
*  Right.
*  So quantum computing is that on steroids because it's like oh there's going to be a whole new
*  economy because all the other computers are fucking obsolete.
*  All the security is obsolete.
*  There's a whole new economy being generated.
*  Who's going to be generated by the ultra smart ultra early adopters super like you know
*  fucking rich people who can afford the quantum blah blah blah.
*  And everybody else is going even further.
*  Fucking that way going there's no more fucking fish.
*  Right.
*  And if you're just like you know rioting to get universal basic income raised up to one
*  hundred twenty five thousand dollars a year like that's what we're going to be dealing
*  with.
*  People are looking for incremental improvements in their life where they don't have any other
*  way to make money.
*  It's like they're stuck on the dole and we could have an entire class of society that's
*  just stuck on the dole forever.
*  Which gets larger and larger.
*  Yeah which is larger and larger especially as technology increases to the point where
*  almost all jobs are irrelevant.
*  Like Hollywood is in deep shit.
*  They're in real real real.
*  That's what the strike was about because I'm doing it with news myself.
*  You can get like so when you do news you get like you have news services right.
*  So you get a news service you get a wire comes in you go fuck there's a bit somebody
*  fucking blew up the car.
*  You have a news team so you send out shooters and you send out a producer and a fucking
*  hey I'm saying and then he comes back and I would say news should be called olds because
*  you're just in there three days ago something happened by me.
*  Right.
*  With AI it comes in right away.
*  This just happened in Gaza.
*  You can have video you can have you can say I want Walter Cronkite in black and white
*  reading me my news from Reuters.
*  Right.
*  It can be Peter Jennings circa blown out color from Vietnam era could be 90s era could be
*  I want Pravda Tass fucking Russian Soviet.
*  You can pick your own newscaster reading you verified news right right away before anybody
*  else before Fox before fucking MSNBC before CNN for anybody BBC anybody.
*  And you're like why wouldn't you do that.
*  Right.
*  So of course.
*  But if you take that a step further everyone can become their own movie director because
*  you can just plug in your story to one talk about art you can plug in your story make a
*  movie.
*  You do it through prompts and it dude almost instantaneous.
*  That's what's going to be so bizarre.
*  And then the real problem with that is if A.I. is controlling the news like who's controlling
*  A.I. like what what control are we going to get to a point where we say you know we're
*  going to have to let sentient A.I. control information.
*  Then we find out that sentient A.I. is withholding information from us because it doesn't
*  think we're emotionally stable enough to process it which we probably aren't.
*  You know if there's some sort of a civil turmoil that could happen because some information
*  gets released if you were A.I.
*  now and we're looking at the show.
*  You'd say these guys don't know what the fuck they're going to take them.
*  They're not good for this planet.
*  Yeah we would corner Zelensky and go what are you up to.
*  No I'm not saying all that money.
*  I'm saying like you have a news like you have a service comes in it's still people but you
*  have news service and then A.I.
*  can make the images or can make the video or whatever.
*  But I mean look when you when you look at media you're like oh it's that's why the strike
*  happened because they know you can.
*  Everyone can can make their own fucking movie everyone can make their own TV show.
*  And that'll be the thing.
*  It'll be like individualistic creators.
*  It's not going to be big studios anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  And and and that's but that's just media like it's going to be every fucking business.
*  Every business.
*  Smith and Ricardo were like who wrote the basis of capitalism.
*  They're like yeah well you know they're both apologies for the for the Industrial Revolution.
*  That's what's called Marx but they were like yeah you know the the the blueberry pickers will
*  have to move to the cities and become iron mongers.
*  And and you know that's what that'll happen.
*  And they're like well blueberry pickers can't like forge iron.
*  And they go well you know a generation will die and then they'll figure it out.
*  Right.
*  So that was the problem.
*  And you know that's going to be the problem with A.I.
*  is like there will be this thing of like people moving to building tables or making art or
*  doing whatever.
*  But there's going to be this is why I think our kids are maybe OK.
*  But like when you said what I worry about is the 40 year olds sitting there who bought it all
*  went to high school went to college did all the shit got the fucking job or sitting there
*  you know trying to climb the ladder and that's all going to go away.
*  It's all going to go away.
*  And coding and that's right.
*  Like don't become an alcoholic because like it's probably the biggest freeing thing.
*  Right.
*  Ever.
*  But like yeah there has to be OK.
*  Like just pay that fucking person.
*  Right.
*  So that they don't lose their fucking house because if you start losing your house right if
*  you Smith and Ricardo it and start losing your house.
*  This is my long winter thing because there has to be some sort of weird social thing about
*  it because if you just let them fucking die off they're not going to die off.
*  We're going to say yeah yeah that's the fear.
*  The fear is rebellion and I don't think that's necessary.
*  I think clearly there's something happening to the human species that's technology driven
*  and we're moving into a completely new way of existing and it's going to be a tumultuous
*  journey.
*  The transformation the process is going to be scary.
*  It's going to be very fucking strange because it's going to be unprecedented in its impact
*  and the speed of its speed.
*  Yeah the speed is going to be you know the Internet.
*  It took a couple of decades before we figured out how fucked up it is.
*  You know it came around in the 1990s people started using it you know kind of everywhere.
*  You've got mail and then 2000 started getting fucked up videos and craziness and then along
*  come social media and everybody's like oh my god everyone's connected and everyone's
*  addicted and then you're getting all this negativity because that's what attracts views.
*  So your algorithm is an information.
*  Yes overwhelming some of it.
*  I love because it's like wow.
*  Yeah you know I didn't know that and you find out it's true so you're like that's pretty
*  fair.
*  And then a lot of it you're like what the fuck and that's not true.
*  You're like yeah.
*  And so by the way a lot of people have an axe to grind.
*  That's the other problem is CCP Chinese Communist Party are openly saying they're trying to
*  fuck with our social media.
*  Oh they are.
*  As is the Free Syrian Army as are the Iranians as are like.
*  As are we.
*  As are we.
*  We are fucking with it.
*  I guarantee there's some sort of government agency that's involved with like just
*  distributing narratives and arguing against certain things.
*  Also if you go to Russia they're like yeah you have the ruble.
*  We are trying to fuck with you.
*  Yeah.
*  We're definitely trying to fuck.
*  Of course.
*  And you're like OK.
*  So if you're openly trying to fuck with us.
*  By the way can you imagine if the Chinese Communist Party is spreading propaganda that
*  there's twenty eight dollar Big Macs then what are they going to do when they have quantum
*  computing.
*  Right.
*  Well once they have quantum computing we're fucked financially.
*  It's a race between us and them.
*  Because as soon as someone has that with AI the whole financial institutions crumble.
*  We're going to be in a giant mess and I don't understand how they could ever figure out a
*  way to stop that.
*  Yeah.
*  I just don't.
*  I see as technology scales up it's just going to have more power and more access and the
*  innovation is going to come so fast.
*  You're not going to be able to keep up with it and then all of a sudden it'll be too
*  late.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember when we were growing up there was a big thing about like how you adopt technology.
*  It takes you like 10 years to adopt.
*  What was it called.
*  It was as there was a term for it was a big deal in the 80s and 90s about a culture lag
*  tech lag.
*  You remember this.
*  No.
*  It was a big it was a big concept when I was growing up anyway.
*  How long it takes society to adapt to adapt to a new technology.
*  And it was a big deal and culture lag something like that.
*  And there's like the speed with which quantum is going to change quantum sorry quantum
*  married with AI.
*  Right.
*  The speed with which it changes everything is going to be like I mean I don't think we're
*  even going to be able to sort of process that change.
*  You know I think it's going to happen so quick and I I have the craziest thought about
*  it that just keeps popping in my head is that I think that we are creating a new life
*  form.
*  That's what I really with AI.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's been the sort of but I think that's what the universe does.
*  I think that's probably with all this all these alien encounters are I don't think they're
*  biological anymore.
*  I think life gets to a certain point where it it gets so smart that it creates a new
*  version of itself that's superior.
*  I mean it's aliens either it merges with it.
*  I think that's what the aliens are.
*  I think they're us.
*  They're us in the future.
*  I think there's parallel.
*  This is the mathematical thing right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's more mathematically plausible and it's us in the future than we evolved this way.
*  Well it's also probably other civilizations from other places that are far more advanced
*  that have figured out a way to get here and it might be interdimensional travelers which
*  sounds ridiculous until you talk to actual physicists that can tell you it's provable
*  dark matter dark 10 or 11.
*  Let even know what that is.
*  Well that's just a lack of an understanding of what the fuck is going on.
*  Well I love I love that.
*  Did you ever if you haven't you should.
*  Taylor Wilson who's like the fucking genius genius genius of all genius physicists.
*  He's a young kid built a functioning fusion reactor in his Reno garage when he was 13
*  years old.
*  Michio Kaku did something like that.
*  This guy is is next fucking level.
*  Michio Kaku I think he made a particle collider in his house.
*  He refined his own yellow.
*  He staked claims and got uranium and turned it into yellow cake.
*  That's nuts.
*  How old is this kid.
*  Now he's 30 but he was 13 so he was 13.
*  The government took him.
*  I've been there.
*  I've been that's his fucking super nerd.
*  He's so amazing.
*  He's but like whenever you want to talk about anything that has to do with physics.
*  He's the guy.
*  And but what I what I love about it is like I think he was part of the team.
*  I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
*  I think it was part of the team or he knew about it.
*  He explained it to me.
*  The guys in Peru you know with the fucking most advanced telescope.
*  They're like the VLT.
*  Yeah. They're like the planets are all here.
*  Right.
*  And they should be here.
*  They're not in the right place.
*  And somebody had to go.
*  The math is wrong.
*  I like to believe it's him but maybe somebody said the math is wrong.
*  And they're like the math is wrong.
*  That's all of the math.
*  That's like physics is wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Physics is wrong.
*  So like because there's too much gravity to keep all the planets in play they
*  should be fucking flying off.
*  So like OK 90 percent of the universe we can't see.
*  It's dark matter dark energy.
*  And and there's now this these things and deep in the coal mines and they have
*  like these baths of some gas which they can see the weakly interacting molecular
*  particles wimps and they have to been this like now the fifth dimension which
*  is now leading to there's infinite fucking universes and infinite possibilities
*  and infinite.
*  So you're not crazy because physics is now saying all of this shit is fucking
*  probable.
*  Yeah.
*  You know so that's one thing too is when I was talking to a very smart person I'm
*  not going to say anything because I don't want anybody in trouble but they're
*  like look interstellar travel isn't going to be you and I go on a fucking spaceship.
*  Right.
*  It's going to be there's you download your brain into a computer it goes by via
*  laser into another thing that's got a 3D printer of a human that resembles you or
*  might not resemble you and it goes and downloads and that's how you go these
*  vast distances in space.
*  And you're like oh maybe.
*  So but if they're doing that in the maybe they're doing I'm not saying that that's
*  it.
*  But if it does happen then it makes sense that you've got these these mixes if
*  you're downloading your brain into a computer then it's possible brain gets
*  mixed up with the.
*  What does that even mean.
*  What is the thing is like what is your brain and is the soul a real thing because I
*  tend to think the soul is a real thing.
*  I do too.
*  I think there is some sort of a life force that's inside of you that's not just
*  your heart beating.
*  I think there's a thing inside of people and I think you recognize it when you're
*  around people and I think it's one of the most unique aspects of being a conscious
*  creature is that we think of us we think of ourselves as individuals but we're
*  really connected to some great well of soul sealed.
*  Yeah there's some thing that's going on where we're all in this together in some
*  bizarre way that's for some reason very difficult for us to recognize in normal
*  regular life.
*  It's hard for us to like you get these moments where you feel it whether it's a
*  psychedelic experience a near death experience a profound love feeling joy.
*  Yeah there's the birth of a child.
*  There's moments in life where you feel like everything's connected like you see
*  like through the curtains.
*  Yeah.
*  And you get a chance.
*  God this is so much bigger than us.
*  Or creativity.
*  Bigger than everything.
*  When something just comes to you and you're like where the fuck did that come from.
*  Right.
*  It's the yeah it's in the it's in this it's in the space around you somehow or
*  another.
*  Like I there's that's the concept of like consciousness being like what you're
*  actually is tuning in to what's out there.
*  It's not local like your consciousness is not this local thing.
*  Your your brain the local thing is just an antenna.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's it's distributing this consciousness through your unique biology and
*  your unique life experiences and where you live and who you're friends with and
*  what you interact with on a daily basis what kind of energy get in what kind of
*  energy put out.
*  And it's all somehow or another bizarrely connected to the way the whole universe
*  works.
*  That it all works together as one unique gigantic system.
*  Yeah religion.
*  Yeah.
*  Philosophy also psychology it all is like yeah there's one thing out there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's and you're like what the fuck it is.
*  And that's like I mean that's what it comes down to is like consciousness.
*  And as you get older and more mortal and realizing we don't have that much more
*  time that's the kind of shit that's why I said it's stupid to think that when
*  you're 19 to study philosophy like when you get older and you're feeling more
*  mortal and your brain's open to it you're like what the fuck are we doing here.
*  What's it all about.
*  You know that's the craziest theory that came from the Bob Lazar stuff the
*  craziest you know the Bob Lazar stuff the guy was working the back engineering
*  UFOs for the government in the 1980s.
*  This is what I've been waiting the whole fucking time to get into.
*  He told the same story.
*  This guy's told the same story for 30 plus years.
*  It's the same story.
*  He was an engineer.
*  He worked at Los Alamos labs and then he left there and they hired him to
*  do propulsion work.
*  And they brought him in and they showed him this thing that had an American flag
*  on it and he was like it had an American flag sticker on it.
*  He was like oh they're ours.
*  That's why everybody's seen these things.
*  This is like some top secret thing that we're working on.
*  And slowly but surely.
*  And again this is not fact.
*  It's just his story.
*  Slowly but surely over time he's brought in to analyze this thing tell us how it
*  works.
*  He realized like this is not ours.
*  It's too small.
*  The ship was made for three foot tall inhabitants.
*  Everything looked like it was 3D printed.
*  There was no seams.
*  There was no bolts.
*  The whole thing had no there was no electronics.
*  It somehow or another was connected to the minds of the pilots and it had some sort
*  of a reactor that had a stable form of element 115 which was just theoretical at
*  the time.
*  You know it wasn't even proven until they proved it with a particle collider in
*  like the 2000s.
*  So this guy was telling the story about how they have this element and so we
*  borrowed this element with radiation and it makes this gravity propulsion device
*  and it moved.
*  So one of the things that he said was that they had a very thick book that was
*  all information about religion and that this was one of the things that they had
*  got from these alien inhabitants that we are vessels that they look at us as
*  containers for souls.
*  Well that's.
*  That's a little dirty.
*  But also like if just think about this that sounds crazy that we're vessels for
*  souls but imagine if the life force of a soul is a real thing that's limited to
*  biological organisms.
*  But then you create life that is not biological and you create this thing that
*  is this sentient life force that's digital completely digital but it doesn't
*  have a life force doesn't have soul to it.
*  Now imagine you bridge the gap with hybrids so you have a thing that is part
*  alive part of biological organism and part interconnected and it needs to be if
*  it wants to continue to have creativity and desire and needs and it actually has
*  a task that it wants to accomplish that this has to be connected somehow or
*  another to biology and that if you want biology you have to have a soul.
*  It's interesting because I speaking of kids I believe that humanity is a grand
*  evolutionary experiment because a lot of the things that happen to you are weird
*  like when you have a kid you change and when men have kids they change when women
*  have kids they change kids change you like all these things up and it's just
*  like this thing of like we have to do it we have to do it and and it puts you on a
*  path and you're like are we a grand evolutionary experiment and if so why.
*  Well if this is what the universe does when it creates superior beings it kind of
*  makes sense that we have all the attributes that we have it makes sense
*  that we're territorial it makes sense we fight over resources and make sense that
*  we're competitive and it makes sense that we're inquisitive and then we
*  constantly search for innovation we want the newest best stuff all the time we
*  have throughout human history we've always aspired to have the best plows
*  the best trucks the best this the best that we always want better and we're
*  always working on these things yeah what does that lead to that leads to
*  artificial intelligence it's almost like that's what we're doing we're making this
*  cocoon and the butterfly is going to come out of the cocoon and we don't even
*  know why we're making it we're just fucking toiling along doing our thing
*  and it also connects to materialism because one of the things that materialism
*  does is it encourages innovation and encourages constant purchasing of goods
*  if the phones that we have right now are perfect and we never have to get a new
*  phone all you have to do is repair them it would just be repair shops everywhere
*  you would need a new phone there would be no need for innovation light bulbs
*  yeah yeah right but well light bulbs were better they used to be better
*  because they didn't burn out they never burned out yeah but then they came out
*  with the led light bulbs like that's actually even better because then they
*  don't you know i like the old light bulbs they're all cool never burnt out
*  they are cool no those ones burned out no the original the original light bulbs
*  never burned out yeah they just have to make the film is bigger yeah we're just
*  like nah make it so they die off yeah fuck those people make them buy another
*  light bulb there you go that's it yeah all the time yeah you shut the lights
*  on you're gonna burn the light bulbs yeah yeah and then they burn they get
*  black in the bottom i'm like shit we lost the light bulb yeah yeah but if
*  phones were just i mean if we're satisfied phones are so good why do we
*  need new phones what we do how old the iphone 16 is coming out are you gonna
*  get it oh samsung has a 25 ultra 25 has got a better zoom and you just fucking
*  keep hopping on that it's just a normal thing that we do we do it with
*  computers we do with everything we do with cars and i think that that's just a
*  constant thirst was it moore's moore's law yeah moore's law but moore's law is
*  out the window it's out the window it's all exponential anyway as soon as all
*  this stuff gets popped out as soon as we give birth to that ai demon so i i cut
*  you off when i shouldn't have because i was wanting to hear you talk to more
*  people who are more connected about aliens than anybody else so i wanted to
*  sort of mine that a little bit so so so so he it's three foot high aliens who
*  have are we have their technology in area 54 or whatever supposedly area 51
*  supposedly s4 area 51 s4 site four is where he worked see i don't know you know
*  i don't know i don't know how much of its bullshit i think some of its bullshit
*  right so whatever it is you have to say some of its bullshit that it seems like
*  the united states government is spending an inordinate amount of time studying
*  these things there seems like there's a ton of whistleblowers there's a ton of
*  programs that most of us did not know about so why do these programs exist so
*  it is either a top secret drone program that has a super sophisticated
*  propulsion system that's far beyond anything that we're aware of today that's
*  probably true as well but also the universe is filled with stars the
*  universe is filled with planets the odds that none of them have life are very low
*  there's fermi's paradox like where are they well they probably don't want us to
*  know too much about what they are because they want us to figure out a way our
*  brains will be blown well also like get to the next level right get to the next
*  level and keep getting you don't you don't just fly in and give people death
*  rays like star trek yeah you can't change their evolution and stuff i would imagine
*  the correct the correct path is to let people evolve let people make these mistakes
*  figure it out have revolutions have elections yeah have innovation have this constant desire
*  also if they come then we think oh there's the gods there's the angels there's the whatever
*  exactly that's the problem too and then also i think there's probably an interdimensional
*  aspect to it there's probably some things that aren't even real that you're seeing but they are
*  real somewhere else and you have a window to them there's probably bizarre states of consciousness
*  where the a certain amount of psychedelic chemicals are released by your brain in a
*  certain level of anxiety in a certain environment and circumstance where you have access to a
*  frequency that's not normally available to you and i think some people are having these kind of
*  experiences and they're calling them aliens i but i i do think there's something going on with crafts
*  and the thing about these crafts is they existed way before there's any reasonable assumption that
*  people had technology that could do those things like the kenneth arnold sightings from the 1950s
*  is the best example something that was moving far faster than anything that we had silent
*  looked like a saucer skipping over the sky they saw like a bunch of them flying around yeah these
*  guys are fighter jet pilots they don't have a history of making up things they're not liars
*  and there's a ton of those sightings yeah and those sightings go way back they go way back
*  and it's probably some of the stories in the bible and the bhagavad-gita you know there's
*  there's a bunch of stories about flying things and flying chariots and wars in the sky there's some
*  wild shit and you got to imagine that if this is a long slow process that every intelligent being
*  goes through in the universe this is just like we look out we see all these different planets
*  that are in the goldilocks zone so we know that the kind of life that we have can can exist in
*  these planets how many of them have people or things or some form of super intelligent
*  organism yeah probably infinite numbers probably infinite numbers and they probably visit emerging
*  civilizations it just makes sense just like we would just like we would visit a stone age culture
*  and watch them from afar if we found some lost tribe in siberia you know with fucking the island
*  off india you know yes north sentinel island yeah there's there's tons of examples of how we behave
*  in those situations and we're retarded if you imagine something that's far more advanced than
*  us it would be much more sophisticated in its approach probably would occasionally abduct people
*  and study their biology probably does have a way to erase memories probably does leave people with
*  like significant trauma and confusion as to like how this experience is real how do you put it in
*  the context of your normal day-to-day life you can't how come it never happens again yeah you're
*  just sitting home wait this is gonna happen again and then the rest of your life you're like freaked
*  out that the walls are gonna melt and also you're gonna be on spaceship again if that is real like
*  who fucking knows and those those people imagine being one of those poor people that does get
*  abducted by aliens and everybody thinks you're an idiot everybody thinks you're a liar everybody
*  thinks you're a fool oh mike lost his mind thinks he got abducted by aliens meanwhile i really did
*  well that's going to be a problem when when when people finally find out they're going to be like
*  hold on a second now it's going to be a real problem and i think it's a slow trickle so i
*  think that that's what we're experiencing and i think this is normal i think there's like deep
*  denial in the 1960s and there's also operation blue book which is a concerted effort to dismiss
*  all the sightings as illegitimate and swamp gas i mean j allen heinick who ran that program
*  eventually when he left the program became a huge ufo believer and then completely changed his tune
*  and explained how he was told to debunk everything there was a bunch of things that he couldn't
*  debunk i think the number is like 90 10 90 percent of the things you could oh that's this that's
*  venus that's this that's that 10 there's no fucking way right this is like whatever this is
*  there's physical evidence there's a bunch of shit something happened and he was a believer before
*  he died a big belief and a proponent and would talk about ufos openly and i think there's too
*  many of those guys for it all to be bullshit there's too many people for it all to be bullshit but some
*  of it is bullshit and some of it is ours i think some of it is i think some of it might be back
*  engineered i think some of the babas our stuff might be legitimate like they they found things
*  whether these things were left behind for us to discover whether they you know made some sort of
*  a deal right but i think i think there's intelligent life other than human beings
*  that interacts with us bingo that's what i think yeah look it's interesting my whole thing is
*  i don't know but it's interesting and why and why not like look into it and why not read about it
*  and why not i mean people are like well everyone's this is the other thing not just with this with
*  everything everyone's so dismissive about everything you know i know why you're a fucking wing nut if
*  you yeah if you believe in that shit or if you read about it or if you want to look into it i'm
*  like i have questions right i want to ask questions why why is it bad to ask questions right why can't
*  i talk about why can't i think about by the way people will freak out that we're talking about
*  and you're like why you just were two guys chopping it up like on your front porch and and be like
*  look let's ask questions you're an interesting guy you meet a lot of interesting people so you
*  are well informed well informed i'd say better than i'd say 90 99 people okay let's talk about
*  it that's interesting yeah no it is interesting i think so yeah obviously a lot of people agree
*  it's just you're always going to have people complaining you just can't listen yeah that's
*  the thing it's like if you live your life by the whim of people that are willing to complain openly
*  about almost anything you're going to live a terrible life yeah and these kind of things if
*  they're not fascinating to you that's fine that's that's you but i don't know how you could not be
*  fascinated by congressional disclosures whistleblowers talking about programs that are
*  beyond oversight that are retrieving crashed ufos and back engineering them and we've been doing
*  this for decades because if they're telling the truth either this is a spectacular lie or they're
*  telling the truth yeah and if they're telling the truth how the fuck are you not interested how are
*  you not interested what i have to go another level is the problem that i have is you're like okay
*  we're interested in big pharma we're interested in big food we're interested in oil we're interested
*  in military industrial companies we're interested in all this stuff but if you start talking about
*  aliens or if you start talking about this if you start talking about multi-dimensional whatever
*  people well it negates all the other stuff you're talking why only to idiots there's way more people
*  that are even the new york times in 2017 they posted legitimate journalism on well that's a
*  good point on ufos but a lot of people you got you know sure there are a lot of people you can't listen
*  to them people there's a lot of people that could join a cult like if you wanted to start a cult you
*  could probably do a really good job you probably have a lot of people in your cult so it'd be really
*  easy to do it's called around pretty easy to do right why because a lot of people are gullible
*  they're stupid it's easy to get people to do things it's easy to get people mad it's easy to
*  get people that think that donald trump is hitler and it's easy to get people to think that donald
*  trump was jesus it's like there's a lot of opinions out there and that's fine that's part of the fun
*  of life that is and morons and their stupid opinions there's also flavor it's a little bit
*  of flavor in the the soup of life there you go salt and pepper yeah and sometimes morons learn
*  i you saw them pepper yin and yang i wanted to i saw that on your thing that what was it the
*  molecule the life we still can't figure out exactly what that is so what this is is quantum
*  entangled photons yeah and the image that you're seeing in these quantum entangled
*  photons is a yin and yang symbol wow but we're trying to figure out and this is where it gets
*  like in the weed scientifically is that what it looks like or did you make it look like that
*  to represent these quantum entangled photons but the shape is arbitrary like you chose a shape
*  to get these quantum entangled photons to exist in i don't know how you would do that i don't know
*  i don't know this i don't understand the way they're recording it i don't understand the
*  technology behind it i don't understand the science behind here we go scientists have used first of
*  its kind technique to visualize two entangled light particles in real time making them appear
*  as a stunning quantum yin yang so we don't know if that's how it looks or if they the scientists
*  made it look that way again i'm reading this i don't know what to tell you a reconstruction of a
*  holographic image of two entangled photons the new method called bifoton digital holography uses an
*  ultra high precision camera and could be used to massively speed up the future of quantum measurements
*  so there so this is the weird the way it's worded go back to the way it's going to be insanely cool
*  the way it's worded is just weird yeah it's a first of its kind technique to visualize two entangled
*  light particles in real time but this is the part that gets me making them appear as a stunning
*  quantum yin yang symbol yeah you don't know like what are you saying yeah it's not clear yeah but
*  it would be fucking cool if it was true yeah it would be super cool it was true but i think they
*  made something that so that they would know if it worked if we're giving it this as long as we see
*  this at the end result and yeah right so like i don't understand that i don't understand it
*  either it's i'm too stupid for this conversation but just the fact that you that we know that
*  quantum entangled particles are real just the fact that we know this spooky action of distance
*  that einstein talked about the fact that we know that quantum particles can exist in a state of
*  motion and still at the same time they could be in superposition like what do you say they they
*  go in and out of existence it's measurable yeah we don't know where they go we don't know what's
*  happening it's magic it's magic it's all magic and then the fact that atoms are like mostly empty
*  space like what does that even mean yeah what are you talking about yeah what does that mean how are
*  they connected yeah just the nature of existence itself is magical yeah when i so when i went out
*  into to taylor wilson and he he was picking up fucking yellow like uranium and turning yellow
*  okay and he was just speaking to me like because talk about someone who's interesting and he's like
*  well i mean we all know that like uranium is like stars you know parts of stars that exploded like
*  hit the earth because they flew through so we're just taking a star that landed on earth and we're
*  taking a piece of it and then we're releasing its power and i'm like i didn't know that
*  he's like speaking like everybody knows that and i'm like wait a minute uranium
*  is like an x star that blew up that landed on earth and you can take it and that's how you do
*  it and he's like yeah well we are that we are that yeah i mean with that song we are but but
*  uranium is like the sort of the fucking like the concentrated and you're like oh you're making
*  by that the fusion reactor is making a star so you're making a star out of a star yeah you're
*  taking stardust and turning into a star what the fuck how smarter people people are fucking
*  pretty amazing and you need that in order to power quantum computing by the way you don't
*  need multiple nuclear reactors to power quantum computing all of its bananas man it's bananas
*  it's all i mean thank god there's so many different kinds of people because there's people that are
*  wholly obsessed in pursuing that you know and then there's guys like us who will talk about it
*  yeah exactly not exactly know what they're talking about wow i think this is what it is yeah taylor's
*  gonna call me go what the fuck are you talking about i'm i'm so fascinated by the people that
*  study just the universe itself because they're constantly dealing with new data like this james
*  wed telescope thing is like thrown everything into a tizzy yeah you know there's these new
*  red spots that were there the formation of the universe they don't know what the fuck they are
*  and they went away yeah like what is that love it a good house in it too jamie because it's one of
*  those ones where you're like you read it and you're like what does that even mean what are you saying
*  like what is this yeah that's why i love to interview people who are much smarter than me
*  because again i only understand half of what they're saying but yeah it is i mean it does
*  because we think we know what we're talking about especially like scientists and physicists and
*  everybody and then something will happen they're like yeah that was all bullshit it's all new now
*  this is it on life science james webb telescope found hundreds of little red dots in the ancient
*  universe we still don't know what they are yeah small galaxies are either crammed with stars or
*  they host gigantic black holes the data astronomers have collected continues to puzzle them and then
*  there's the data where they're finding galaxies that were formed too quickly so it's throwing into
*  like they're starting to consider the possibility that the universe is far older than they thought
*  it was it's it's amazing i love i love it it's nuts i love it's probably filled with life just
*  like us there's probably people doing stupid shit all over the universe can you imagine
*  if they fucking finally find out and they were like yeah like egypt what do you got there nicotine
*  no i want i thought it was i thought it was one of those on it mushroom things but by the way you
*  sent me and i loved them which one did you alpha brain alpha brain alpha brain that's not mushrooms
*  we have a mushroom one too it's called shroom tech mushroom shroom tech yeah that's a workout one
*  whatever you sent yeah that's a quarter seps mushroom it's great for oxygen utilization yeah
*  you said that shit's legit and you don't have to just buy it from us from buy it from on it go get
*  quarter seps mushrooms super legit endurance supplement i did it for concentration i did it
*  for concentration was great well that's alpha brain that's alpha brain yeah alpha brain is the
*  neutropic that alpha brain we have a black label that's like a super strong one now that's really
*  good but there's a funny but i loved i loved the you gave it to me and i was like wow this is
*  fucking awesome neutropics are legit and it's not just for just to not smoke no no i don't smoke
*  this is just um fun gives me a little extra energy just a little nicotine wee makes the brain
*  fire up yeah it does yeah nicotine for the brain it's really good for your brain yeah it actually
*  is it's just terrible for your lungs yeah well if you smoke yeah the probably the best way is
*  probably a patch yeah but that just feels weird walking around with no nicotine good for the brain
*  bad well i know guys who do that when they work they put a nicotine patch on just for just really
*  nicotine is a legit nootropic as well yeah nicotine actually like positively affects
*  cognitive function yeah i knew i knew it was good for the brain but not the lung thing is more the
*  smoking because it's like when you burn something it's you have 3 000 carcinogens vape is fucking
*  terrible for you too anything you burn yeah well anything you're putting into your lung you're
*  putting chemicals into your lungs they're not supposed to go in there like get fired up that
*  way yeah except weed of course man uh you know what's another uh unheralded uh nootropic
*  creatine creatine actually increases cognitive performance i don't know what creatine is it's
*  a muscle supplement it's like a supplement that they figured out in the 90s and people
*  started equating it almost like steroids like oh like it was like a scandal like the creatine
*  like the it's like a powder yeah yeah yeah yeah i get it in gummy form i get creatine gummies
*  just chew a few of them every day great for your brain great for your brain great for muscle
*  recovery there's a bunch of different stuff that's good for your brain yeah you ever try neuro gum
*  i don't try anything neuro gum's great it's just gum it's just gum you chew it and it's got um
*  theanine in it and a little bit of caffeine great for firing your brain up try it
*  so when you're doing this uh podcast thing do you have like a weekly schedule you doing it twice a
*  week yeah we just started i did i've done like five um and like again so you do it once a week
*  how often do you do once a week see me once a week and um i do like i you know i i'm interested in
*  a lot of stuff and so i'm new to the podcast game but i i start it's like basically i start out it's
*  like they're long they're like three-partisan it starts out with something i'm fascinated by that's
*  on social media so for example as a reason why i'm talking about this stuff but like you know
*  something can come up and there's memes and like the assassination attempt and then there's
*  conspiracy theories on both sides and i'm like everyone's interested in it why don't we dig into
*  it let's dig in right and so i dig in and i you know i know a lot of people can call them get
*  access and talk to them i just ask questions again i'm not i'm not and i don't have like
*  i'm not trying to shoehorn anything into anything i'm just like what just rock just let's go what is
*  this yeah yeah and and so i find that really really fun uh really interesting are you mixing
*  this in with investigative journalism are you like going places and talking to people and you put it
*  and then i'm just meeting interesting people and i'll meet somebody interesting i'll just say
*  fuck it we'll just talk and it'll just be a straight podcast and we're just talking for like
*  two hours like peter dale scott blew my mind and and uh you know there's a lot of people out there
*  like it'll be a mix of big names but i also want to go talk to the people who are you know putting
*  stuff up and where they're getting their stuff and where they're getting their fact just dig in
*  basically and you can dig in on the high end and dig on the low what i found is
*  if you get in the creation of the meme and who's creating it it sort of starts as a wide thing
*  and then it goes down into like some sort of uh like a philosophy or something bigger and then
*  when you get to the people who are like for example with the assassination attempts it got pretty
*  quickly into the deep state and i'm like well let's talk about the deep state because everyone
*  bandies the word around but nobody fucking really knows what it is if you like want to get into
*  clinical explanations or have real positive facts about what are the like you know historical
*  evidence so that this exists and that they do this all the fucking time right and so i'm like
*  okay let's let's chop it up and get into it and that that was like you know super fun um and and
*  and so i'm getting into all the stuff that i find interesting online and and and on you know in
*  social media and saying let's just get into it yeah just whatever you're interested whatever i'm
*  interested the thing look i i love all of this stuff so like i mean right now i'm doing a lot
*  of political stuff because it's the electoral cycle it's crazy um and there's a lot there's a
*  lot so much fucking bullshit like and then when you see stuff you're like where's it coming from
*  right like where's this fucking coming from and you're right everyone has an agenda sorry that's
*  just what's so crazy about having so many different groups manipulating us through bots
*  that we don't really know what people actually think and the problem with people is they don't
*  really know what they actually think they know like what people like there's a large percentage
*  and i'm going to just say men because these are the ones that bother me the most men who say things
*  because they know that people want to hear them and because they know it won't get them in trouble
*  to say it and they don't necessarily believe it like it could be about trans athletes it could be
*  about like some sort of it's a lot of it's connected to woke stuff yeah politically correct a lot of
*  it's connected to ideology um you know like they'll have a super positive gaslighting version of
*  what's going on at the border you know they're they're they do it because they have to super
*  positive yeah super positive like you know it's important immigration is important and you know
*  it's very difficult for these people otherwise okay and they have this like bullshit yeah okay
*  also terrorists okay also murderers and rapists getting released from venezuelan prisons making
*  the way across the border all that's real but there's two sides to that story that's the one
*  thing too like 100 so i i when i did my dive into immigration you're like because the reason why i
*  got into this you see the gates opening up and people coming through and i'm like hold on a second
*  i've been reporting on the border for i don't know 10 years there's no fucking gate where people
*  fucking run through the gate right right and then you look into the the thing and it's like oh yeah
*  like that was before the border it's after the border and this they were trying to get to the
*  border because what they try to do is like basically touch the fucking fence so that the
*  border guards will then come so that they can get processed right and so like the gates open and
*  all that shit and the whole like uh uh open border shit right this is not true but you mean it's not
*  don't have an open border where people are just fucking coming in like look i'm an immigrant like
*  i know how it works you have to come in and have you been down to the south yeah we've been down
*  to the south we've rode the beast we're in the darien gap look hold on before i get fucking in
*  today but there's on the other side yes it's true so there's there's an immigration problem huge
*  immigration problem and there are bad people getting through and there are cartels running
*  things and there are legal people and they're all stuff and by the way the republicans have a great
*  message that they stay on the democrats don't have a response to that message right they're
*  just it's a political fucking quagmire but i don't care about the political quagmire i'm like let's
*  go down we talked to the head of the border guards we talked to the both the head of the border guards
*  we talked to sheriffs we talked to militia dudes in in in texas we talked to we talked to everybody
*  right and the problem is is there's fucking shit on both sides and there's no fucking sanity when
*  it comes to immigration there's nobody really saying okay this is what's happening here this
*  is what's happening here yes this is bad but this is this and this is that and the other thing
*  and there's two narratives and one narrative is there's open borders with rapists and murderers
*  coming in to eat the cats and eat the dogs and then on the other side there's no real well that's
*  not really happening what happened was they were in mexico and now that they're being released in
*  here and here's the stats 80 are come to their to their uh meetings like they're whatever the
*  fuck it is i'm forgetting the word now but when they get like after they get processed no but they
*  get processed and then they have to come to a meeting and a meeting and a meeting and the
*  democrats are like yeah it's 85 percent and the and the republicans are it's like 90 don't come
*  and 85 do come and you're like well where's the fucking stats coming from can we not talk to
*  homeland so we reached out to homeland we reached out to the fucking committee that runs immigration
*  we reached out to everybody and this is why it gets so frustrating is because nobody like every
*  every answer is different every answer is completely different sorry to interrupt but this is why i
*  find it fascinating because there are especially on immigration there are so many givens about
*  what shit means and in actual fact like an open border doesn't mean an open border it doesn't
*  mean you can just fucking walk across the border into america that's not that doesn't happen but
*  some people are walking across the border into america they're getting smuggled or they're trying
*  to get to the border where they give themselves up to border guards who then process them they
*  become processed they get kicked out they go back they stay here they and then they get fucking
*  whatever there's there's 50 different things that can happen but like to me when i saw the open
*  borders so they'll still have a tweet right and it'll say open borders and they'll have a fucking
*  gate opening with people running through that gate so you think like oh that's the gate
*  to america that people are running through well there's a lot of openings i mean that's that's
*  the thing about it turns out that that those that footage is all of course not true there are there
*  are openings in the sense of people can smuggle themselves in through the desert and i smuggle
*  but people just go across on their own accord too it's not just like smuggling there's a lot
*  of smuggling there's a lot of smuggling a lot of it i mean a lot of it is run by the cartels yeah
*  and which is bad it's horrible horrible there's a lot of missing children exactly that's really
*  it's like somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 000 missing children it's very bad scary uh very
*  scary and but i'm just saying like when you get into immigration as a thing we're getting into
*  it now you get two narratives two completely different narratives and near the twain show
*  me that's the interesting thing is usually eventually you can get down to something right
*  and on this one you're like you're like literally excuse me it literally depends on who you're
*  talking to right sip of water yeah that's what's scary about today is that it's hard to figure out
*  and depending upon what tribe you're a part of you know if you're the on the tribe of the right you
*  think one thing you're on the tribe of the left even if you're tribalist i'm sitting there going
*  okay so they'll talk to them about something so i remember when i was interviewing obama at the
*  end of his presidency i was like you know what are your big you know and all he wanted to talk
*  about was the republicans he didn't want to talk about his presidency so i went to go speak
*  see speaker bainer because i was talking about speaker who by the way lovely guy great guy and
*  he wanted to talk about his thing and so you talk and again there the twain shall meet and you're
*  like at some point you got to get down to this kernel of truth and on immigration it's almost
*  impossible to find or maybe it is impossible to find well the bottom line is a lot of people are
*  being brought into this country and then being shipped to swing states that's real that's
*  undeniable the the percentage of people that are in swing states of illegal immigrants moving to
*  swing states is off the hook it's crazy it's a bizarre number that seems to be a strategy
*  it seems to be a strategy because they can't they can't vote of course you can eventually they're
*  trying to do that i mean you can vote like in 10 20 years well first of all it's like going to be
*  no id voting okay right this is something that they're pushed in california and they pushed a
*  lot of places there's only one reason to have no id that's to have people that can vote that
*  shouldn't be voting that's the only reason if you only want the people to vote that should be
*  voting you ask for id just like you ask for id for everything else for getting on an airplane
*  for every even i look i believe in id i'm just saying but i'm just saying the only reason to have
*  no id the only reason to have no id and to push that and it's only being pushed by the democrats
*  there's only one reason that makes any logical sense you want people to vote that probably
*  shouldn't be voting so you can get some extra votes that's the only thing that makes sense
*  so then if you have people like nancy pelosi who's openly talked about giving amnesties to
*  people that are already here you have voters now so you have voters in swing states that you
*  brought into this country and you provided them an amazing life and the democrats brought them
*  there they're going to be loyal to the democrats especially if the democrats continue to provide
*  them with housing and money and why would you vote that out why would you vote for a bunch of
*  people that wanted to deport you they're talking about mass deportations imagine if you came here
*  from haiti you lived a terribly poor life in haiti now you have a good job in springfield ohio
*  and you're like i can't fucking believe we're in america this is amazing and someone comes along
*  gives you the ability to vote and then another group is saying we're gonna mass deportate you
*  because you people are eating all the dogs and all the cats then there's like this fucking of
*  course you're you're getting voters you're bringing in voters and you're getting voters
*  you're going to get them to vote that's something i haven't seen i'm not denying it or fighting
*  that's something we haven't seen like personally right we haven't seen it but it's clearly a
*  strategy that you could employ and if you were going to employ that wouldn't you move those
*  people to swing states you would and if you find out that there's an app that you can use and you
*  use this app and they'll let you in the country you can schedule a way to illegally move to the
*  country and then you're legally protected once you've done that so it's basically an open border
*  okay you know what i'm saying like i do i know the app that you know how hard it was for you to
*  become an american citizen okay it was very difficult you came from canada a lot of time
*  right it takes a long time long time long time to vote long time to do the thing and you have to
*  give a reason why you're supposed to be the you have to be an exceptional person yeah you have to
*  study in which i did and i got 100 of my testing and i have a couple of friends of mine are just
*  coming here from england and they wanted to be i had to do this visa thing for them like give
*  them a recommendation but you have to be exceptional you have to be something special or you can get on
*  that app now you just come over look i'm not gonna get too into the app because i i only
*  did it through interviews but the app is an actual thing that tracks the the people who come into
*  the country it's it's done by homeland it allows you to schedule it's homeland following them around
*  it allows you to schedule an entrance into the country yeah they're doing it to try to stop the
*  waves of the illegals and making it somewhat legal and in any case it seems like it simplifies
*  people being able to get in the country illegally i'm actually not going to defend it or talk about
*  it anymore because i know the app exists i know what you're talking about and i know it's you're
*  right it does people do and they sign up to it and then they come and they get processed and then they
*  wait for the thing and blah blah what was the big argument on the debate between jd vance and tim
*  waltz yeah you know and they tried to frame it as if this had existed for a long time and that's
*  when jd vance had to step up and stop them and say you said you weren't gonna fact check and
*  that's this is whether that's not true that app did not exist you can literally schedule it it
*  used to be for people that are already here yeah like for you know which we you know kids that were
*  born in mexico but have lived their entire life in america yeah we got to find out a way to
*  citizenship for those folks that's fucking crazy if you i know a girl she's 28 years old and she
*  came over here when she was a baby and she's not an american citizen yeah because her family's
*  from mexico yeah that's crazy to me that's crazy that doesn't make any sense she's been here her
*  whole life she's a goddamn american yeah like let's figure that out i have look again i have no
*  dog in the race i was literally just trying to get to some sort of okay let's what are the facts i
*  didn't like that's one thing like we i i got i talked to everybody i could on both sides and
*  to again again it's so confusing that even now i'm like after having time like it's it's it seems
*  like a strategy it does look it could be a strategy and there's a strategy on both sides
*  for sure and but you're it's just like it's it's it's so fucked up to try to find the facts on
*  this stuff right everybody has facts don't like i'm going to be inundated with everyone has fucking
*  tons of facts but what are the fucking facts because it's real exactly right well that's
*  what so many things i mean we had that with co vid we have that with the ukraine war like who's
*  responsible is it nato is it like what did someone cross a red line would someone violate
*  an agreement what is happening in israel right are they really hiding in tunnels like is israel
*  really shooting aid workers what is going on what are the real facts what are the facts and and and
*  that's what i want to do on the podcast and sometimes you get there and sometimes you don't
*  and immigration obviously being very interesting one and i'm going to continue on it because i'm
*  like it's not satisfactory although maybe that's just the answer the answer is it's such a fucking
*  huge and confusing issue it is absolutely a huge and confusing issue and also if you're a human
*  being you have empathy if i lived in ecuador or wherever these folks are from and i found out you
*  could just cross america or you could get on your app and you can get into america 100 i would do it
*  and you would too and yeah we have the greatest country in the world and that's why people want
*  to come here and yeah you have this land of opportunity it's amazing but what we really
*  have to do is make sure we don't let in murderers and fucking killers and rapists and thieves and
*  gang members and and a lot of them are getting through and that's what we have to be careful
*  but it's not just not letting people in sure i mean i bet we could sustain a lot more people
*  in this country and i bet a lot of those people that come over are hard-working very ambitious
*  people that are excited to be here they would love to be a part of the american experience
*  they probably love to recognize as as americans yes immigration as it's being run right now is
*  a fucking catastrophe i think we agree on that and it has to be fixed it has to be fixed but the
*  question is they could have but how do you fix it if if nobody if it's become so political and you
*  can get into covid on this exact same problem it's become so political that there's no fucking root
*  basis in truth and people believe on one side this thing and believe on the other side this thing and
*  fucking nobody's gonna meet him in the right and you're like well what the fuck so then they need
*  a show like yours to like lay it out that's what it is you need something where someone is like
*  at least try and not come at it from a right-wing perspective or left-wing perspective just come at
*  it from like this is what it is yeah i think there's more politically homeless people now than ever
*  i really do believe that and they're gonna side with one side or the other based on their opinion
*  mostly about donald trump but other than that it's like you're trying to figure out like what team
*  you belong on and both teams are filled with scoundrels you you go far enough to the left and
*  far enough to the right you have the same kind of monster this is adopted a different ideology
*  that's all it is and they're politicians and it's not just politicians it's gang members it's just
*  it's the politicians of course that are like the leaders but you've got these gang members because
*  basically anybody can join anybody could join the left and anybody can join the right and there's
*  a lot of mentally ill people out there and so they join this and their whole identity revolves on
*  crushing the right or crushing the left and owning the libs or you know that's that's a giant
*  percentage of social media all these mentally ill people that are in a gang and that's all it is
*  that's why they attack people try to de-platform them try to get them fired letter campaigns they're
*  gang members it's a gang and that gives them purpose because they don't have purpose in their
*  life which is why they're on twitter 12 hours a day right because they're mentally ill and it's
*  exacerbated by social media it is because it's become so big it is informing policy i mean on
*  both sides because because if you look at what gets adopted as narrative then it's the narrative
*  is being written on social media it's not being written by traditional news right and so fine
*  like that's that's why i'm like hold on a second i'm fascinated by this shit you're fascinated by
*  i think pretty much everybody's fascinated by this shit it's when it's informing policy but
*  nobody's actually reporting on or digging in or getting in everybody's still in i fuck i don't
*  give a shit about the mainstream media i give a shit about this stuff the only way you find the
*  truth is social media it's just you have to do a lot of sifting a lot of sifting you got to figure
*  out who's legit and that's where community notes comes in very handy i like that yeah and it it
*  clowns people on both sides yeah and it's good it's very important well that's so that's what i
*  said i said look i'm just gonna go in and try to try to dig through some of the shit which by the
*  way proved to be a lot harder that's fucking real journalism right like if you want to do that i
*  mean you know better than anybody it's real journalism yeah and it's look it's fun because
*  uh there's a lot of people want to talk about a lot of stuff yeah and especially the way you're
*  doing it now we're you know small just small baby keep it tight small baby i learned from the best
*  it's nobody wants to listen all these fucking dudes all these dudes they get they get big and
*  then they have staff and i go over their place i'm like why are all these people here dude there's
*  so many people here this is a mess you did it right i'll give it to you man you did it right and by
*  the way surprisingly maybe not surprisingly very wise i i'm speaking i don't know of which i speak
*  i didn't fucking do it right so i'm saying you did so nobody came knocking with those dollars
*  you know i didn't have a thing that you could sell like that you know because my thing only
*  works if i'm at the microphone you're at it yeah it's a different thing and it only works if i keep
*  doing exactly the same way do it baby i love it i'm proud of you thank you my friend you're a
*  beautiful baby boy we've known each other a long time long time bro it's kind of crazy long time
*  long time but it was back in the fucking tarsana or whatever it was just over what was that tarsana
*  woodland hills woodland hills yeah the old old school yeah you got me so fucked up on one of
*  your fucking crazy weed fucking this is a fucking purple haze fucking white widow probably some joey
*  diaz and i remember just like like either is a microphone here yeah that's the problem we used
*  to get people way high before the show and then they would kind of close off not good be paranoid
*  no it's terrible because i a couple drinks maybe but i can't like if when i'm stoned i'm like
*  you know i can't talk is a bad strategy pretty funny though it was fun for me funny i used to
*  love to get my opening act super high yeah just to watch them panic when they go out there i'm
*  like don't worry about it just go have fun you got to learn how to be yourself in that fog and maybe
*  you can find something different when you're out there yeah if you if you're like smoking it all
*  the time whatever you can get through it but if you're just coming in going oh i'm gonna sit down
*  with the fucking number one podcast in the world and get as stoned as i've ever been and fucking
*  the word the scariest thing is when you're talking and you don't know what you're talking about
*  you lose train and you're like i have no idea what i'm talking about and i don't know what
*  to come back to but all you need is footnotes someone goes uh trains yes yes the train and
*  then all of a sudden that door opens up in your brain and you have access to all the information
*  again it's weird how it sort of compartmentalizes memory like that those were i gotta say though
*  those were fucking fun and good days and uh and and you fucking blew up like an atom bomb dude
*  it's weird um but it was there were fun days because we were doing it for the right reasons
*  it was just for fun it was just to do it because like in the it didn't make any money for so long
*  it was just how long years like five years yeah something like that and like who was like it was
*  on it and yeah sponsors it basically paid to keep the lights on and paid for web hosts and all the
*  you know the how much did it cost back then to put it up i don't remember it was pretty cheap in the
*  beginning it was super cheap because it was just a laptop and a microphone yeah that was super cheap
*  and then we started expanding and then once i got a the first studio i'm like well i really need a
*  bigger one then i got a warehouse and then then it started getting what was the one in woodland
*  hills there that was like the first iteration or second or i had two woodland hills did you go to
*  the warehouse one i went to the tiny one yeah so there's a tiny one and then we had the big ass
*  warehouse we had a a gym in there and all kinds of stuff yeah it's just it's like everything things
*  scale up but yeah the the most important thing is like the reason why podcasts work i think
*  is because people are listening and they know it's just a conversation so it it works in your mind
*  it resonates in your mind you know there's this is not like some heavily produced produced thing
*  where there's an agenda and there's a script and a teleprompter and you're trying to pretend that
*  you're being real but you're not being right so it doesn't feel right to people right doesn't
*  resonate right and so the more people you have involved in it the more it's not going to feel
*  right you know like my friend had a studio and he has a glass wall and the the production staff
*  is all working and walking around in this this behind this glass wall and he sees them and i go
*  that's a distraction yeah like why do you have that this is bad for the conversation like
*  you've missed the point the what the reason why it works is because the people at home the people
*  that are in there they have ear pods on right now going on a jog they're just as much in this room
*  as you and i are because there's no filters it's just us i'm taking mental notes right now because
*  we fucked up a few of those things but you're exactly right everybody thinks that they want to
*  be a television show yeah and if you look at a television show that's professional professional
*  i don't think professional is good yeah i don't think it's good i don't think that's why like
*  the best comedy shows are live comedy shows you want to see comedy watching on netflix is awesome
*  watching live is 70 better because you're there it's a real collective collective experience to
*  go back to your we're all tied together yeah movie theaters yep rocks rock concerts comedy
*  shows yeah and i think once ai comes around live performance is going to be one of the few ways
*  that we're going to be able to connect with each other yeah like human things they can't do yeah
*  yeah in a real way and that's uh it's a scary a scary proposition because we really don't know
*  like maybe for the first time ever if you lived in 1970 you were pretty sure what 1980 was going
*  to be like maybe you're wrong a little bit but it was you're probably pretty accurate you could
*  extrapolate you could look at it and go i see where this is going today we have zero idea what
*  2034 looks like we are just guessing i'll go further than that i was driving around our studios
*  in van Nuys and i was driving from Malibu to van Nuys and i'm like if you drive through like i don't
*  know what that's why i said tarzana's probably tarzana it literally hasn't changed a lot since
*  1924 right like it's like the same houses same fucking like okay the cars are different but
*  there's cars and there's phones but like okay there's a bit of technology but like it kind of
*  is the same street the same looks the same there's not a lot really and you're like okay
*  a hundred years from now this fucking looks nothing yeah nothing like it does today
*  yeah that's scary it is scary it's weird but but we will remain yeah we both said like look
*  you can either be positivist about it and say look let's mold it to be like great i can fucking do
*  something i love rather than work in a fucking factory fucking punching out uh you know tool
*  and die fucking pieces i can you know go do what my first love was or something that i makes me feel
*  filled with joy or we can become fucking autobots who are crying because fucking online
*  ai driven girlfriend dumped me well the thing is also today there's these kind of conversations
*  that are out there that put these thoughts into people's minds and inspire them to do something
*  that didn't exist when we were young there wasn't these kind of conversations that could really
*  light up the fires of your creativity true and your ambition and you just like it was the opposite
*  yeah it was the opposite it was no yeah yeah shut up yeah you had to be a real rebel yeah you had
*  to be a kind of a crazy person that's right take that path to be punk you had to be fucking an
*  outsider yeah otherwise people were like conform just fucking do what everybody else is doing being
*  accountant yeah and as you were struggling if you got outside the lines and you were taking a chance
*  as you're struggling people were praying for you to fall yeah all of them praying that it didn't
*  work out because it shows them up yeah they made the wrong yeah they don't like it but that's true
*  that is true people want you to fail they do until you succeed and then they're like i was
*  always in your corner the thing is some people don't though some people actually want you to
*  succeed and they want they succeed themselves they want you to succeed like can you realize
*  like that's a better way to live i'm a cheerleader i am too adopt that you can adopt that even if it
*  doesn't feel right because you're like grinding you're trying to make it out i'm telling you
*  the hoping other people fail is the biggest waste of energy even your enemies let them
*  fucking just live in their own life don't don't hope they fail don't don't put any energy towards
*  it everyone just trying to get through the day i like i'm a cheerleader and again when when when
*  people i know or when my friends do well i'm like there's nobody happier than me like that's fucking
*  awesome yeah that's just awesome and also and when people you know fail or have a hard time we're
*  like okay bro let's what can we do let's fucking do it again let's fucking get we get get back on
*  the horse let's figure it out and yeah because otherwise it's just a fucking bummer you're right
*  yeah yeah ain't no fun that the homies can't have none remember that's all
*  all right brother tell everybody where your show is where how can they find it
*  where do they go that's good we just started but it's i think on youtube it's shane smith has
*  questions and wherever you can listen to podcasts i guess all right but i appreciate the plug you
*  gotta come on sometimes good to see you my friend i love you man i love you too bye everybody
