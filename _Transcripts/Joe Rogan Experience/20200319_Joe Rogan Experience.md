# Joe Rogan Experience #1444 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4iO0GpgnlQ)
*  Oh, this smells good.
*  Oh,
*  demons be gone. Be gone demons. Be gone. Leave this studio. Leave this planet. Leave our universe.
*  Leave. This is legit sage from a Native American woman. Wow. So we're purifying this room.
*  Wonderful.
*  Please God bless this room. And Odin too, just in case they were wrong. That's what I was
*  referring to. They abandoned Odin. He was around first, you know. You got to think of all the gods
*  that everybody believed in and they're like, I'm not so sure about Thor. Yeah. Then they let
*  him go. What if Thor was legit? Right. And he's still out there just like somebody who just fell
*  out of fame as a god. Yeah. He's like, don't you fucker see the lightning? Yeah. That's me throwing
*  bolts. He's like one of those guys and you go to Vegas and you see one of those billboards for a
*  strange casino and you're like, oh, that guy. Yeah. Tony Orlando and Dawn. I remember them.
*  Thor's at the Mirage. Thor. Thor's doing a residency. You motherfuckers check out the
*  thunder. That's actually caused by atmospheric conditions. No, you fucks. Thor's on cameo. I
*  make that. Imagine who had a really, someone had a really good point about that. Some, some
*  atheist was arguing against religions. It might've been Sam Harris, probably was Sam Harris. It might
*  have been Richard Dawkins, but he basically said there's 99 different gods that people who believe
*  in the Christian God don't believe in. And then he goes, atheists just take it one step further.
*  They just get rid of the last. We just one got away. That's what he was saying. That's cool.
*  Yeah. I get confused with being an atheist all the time. I don't, I do not believe I'm an atheist.
*  I believe I am, I'm open to everything person. I don't believe stories about people coming back
*  from the dead and I don't, because they're written by people. Right? Yeah, man. I mean, that's right.
*  And also they're supposed to function on more than the surface level. They're supposed to be a kind of
*  fractal that has inside of it, a lot of like symbols related to just human existence. Yes.
*  Not, they're not meant to be so much like taken literally. That's when you embarrass yourself on
*  either side. Exactly. On either side. That's a really good point. It's the translations,
*  apparently are so difficult to do. Yeah. Apparently the trip, especially old Testament,
*  when they translate the old Testament, they had to translate it and think of all the different
*  languages that had to go through. It was Latin and Greek and German and English and all these
*  different languages that are so different. Like, have you ever used the translate button? Like,
*  I follow a lot of Russian fighters and they, you know, and their Instagram feed, they write in
*  Russian and I'm always like, Oh, translate. It's a really cool feature. You could, but you can tell
*  it's not exactly what they meant because it's all fucked up because their language is different.
*  Right. Like the way they structure sentences is different. So English doesn't just plug and play.
*  Right. You know, it's like sticking a USB three into a USB a like, Hey, this doesn't really fit.
*  Right. Now add time, add thousands of years and scrolls and like, things who wanted things
*  changed. Yeah. The King James version. Right. It's the best. That's my favorite one to read on acid.
*  That's the one King James book of John, baby hit that on acid. It's so wonderful. It's so trippy
*  because it's like, that's when I really like Christianity clicked for me, regardless of it's
*  whether it's real or not, but that's when I was like, Oh, okay. I get this because the book of
*  John, when you read it, you're like, well, someone wrote it. I don't know who wrote it. And whoever
*  fucking wrote this, their mind was blown, man. Like this wasn't written by someone who was just like
*  a normal person. This is a person who was freaking out in the most intense way. And so to me, that's
*  what I love about it is it's like something about the, how old it is and the distortions,
*  the historical distortions, the warping of it produce this kind of awesome glitched out mosaic
*  of if nothing else, human consciousness, 5,000 years ago, where our minds were, that's trippy
*  by itself, regardless of whether or not a person who could like graze the dead and walk on water
*  was walking about just holy shit. Here's how people thought back. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I mean,
*  all the stuff that you can't prove or you don't know, that's interesting. It's weird. It's weird
*  where those stories came from and why they're so universal. Like someone has to, everyone has like
*  a creator, everyone has like a main dude that did the thing. And, you know, there's some other
*  people that have like large groups of gods, like the Greeks had gods for everything. The Indian,
*  a lot of Native Americans had gods for everything. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Animism. It's like, I've talked
*  to people who make, who produce electronic music and some of them say that the computers have a
*  life and the sentience, a spirit inside their computer. So there's a collaboration happening
*  that isn't one-sided when they're making stuff. It's like working with like the spirit within the
*  machine, which is pretty trippy, man. Like, why do they, but this is based on input or the way they
*  react to when they're putting in the input to the thing. They think the thing is responding to them.
*  Yeah. It's, yeah, they think that there's a, it's, it's alive that like, it's standard keyboards or
*  this just electronic stuff. I know someone who makes visual art on their computer, their laptop
*  that you, and they like, or, you know, do you have an Alexa? You probably don't. Do you have an Echo?
*  Like sometimes I'll realize the way I'm talking to that thing is like really impolite.
*  That's kind of fun. Yeah. It's fun to yell at robots. Yeah. It's so much. Yeah, it is funny.
*  Robots. It's really funny. I made fun of this, but there is a point to this.
*  PETA had a statement that they put out a while back because these dudes from Boston Dynamics
*  are kicking the fuck out of these robots. They're trying to figure out, they're trying to figure out
*  how to get these robots to fall over. And they're trying, they're making, they're making these
*  insanely durable robots. Like this, if you take scientists and engineers and you say, Hey, I want
*  you guys, here's a shit ton of money. I want you guys to make the dopest robots you can make.
*  They're going to make robots you can kick and it's not a living thing. So, but PETA released some
*  statement saying they didn't think it's cool to kick robots. What? That's not real. That's gotta be fake.
*  No, it's real. It's real. It's real. What? Yes. They were thinking, I think the statement I'm
*  paraphrasing was something to the effect of there's other things that are more important,
*  but it's still not cool to kick robots. Jesus Christ. That's a tattoo right there, man.
*  It just shows you what will happen when robots become alive. Cause those fucking traders,
*  those people, those people that think that robots are alive and that they're us,
*  those emotionless things that have no place in our world with power, they're supposed to be things
*  that we control. As soon as you let them control themselves and you try to pretend they're a person,
*  this is going to wipe it out. Yeah, man. Can you imagine? I'm not going to try to kick one of those
*  fucking DARPA bots. They're terrified. They would have a record of it. They would always remember
*  that this one kicks robots. It's in the cloud. Yeah. And then they'll show it to you one day
*  on some super sophisticated genius God robot sits you down on a couch and shows you, you kicking
*  these unbeknownst to you sentient robots. They were just trying to fucking figure out what am I? What
*  am I? I'm like a baby. They were like little babies and you're kicking them. So the robots,
*  the robots are very, very upset at you in the future. They might just reanimate your ass and
*  just show you over and over that clip of you kicking the fucking robot. Yes. Did you see what
*  Trump tweeted? No. He tweeted and deleted. It's fucking hilarious. He said, uh, checks are coming
*  to everyone in America except the people who used hashtag not my president. I wouldn't want to offend
*  you with a check from someone that's not your president. Something to that effect. See if you
*  can find that. Holy shit. And then it would hashtag MAGA afterwards. I mean, he just dunked on them.
*  The president dunks on people. Yeah. I want to know who the tweet deleter is. Well, someone in
*  his department was probably like Mr. Trump. That's not a good idea. They have a siren that goes off.
*  You got to delete that. Yeah, the president can delete tweets. How much is he going to send?
*  I think, uh, I think they wanted to give like a thousand dollars a month or something like that
*  to Americans. Is that the idea, Jamie? It's hurt lots of things. I don't know up to 2000. I don't
*  know. Bernie said they should give 2000 a month. Yeah. It's gotta be 2000. Everybody. But if you
*  give everybody $2,000 a month, it's a good thing, but everyone's going to go, Hey, you could have
*  done this the whole time. That's right. What do you wait a minute? If you just raise taxes, can you
*  just give people money? Can you just give people more money? And if I'm not saying we should do
*  this, but imagine if that was the solution to all this. If you just give people more money,
*  everything just sort of levels out and relaxes. I think it's the solution. Everything drops. Drug
*  abuse drops. Well, I mean, they've got to know that when people don't have work, they don't have
*  money with no money, they can't support their family. That's when the riots start. Yes. That's
*  when you get desperate catch on fire. They know that. So it's like a bribe to try to keep people
*  from rioting until whatever the fuck you're passing. You could look at it that way, or it's
*  giving people a different environment to exist in one that doesn't leave them hostile.
*  So instead of looking at it like a bribe, look at it like, you know what, I see what a lot of
*  your problem is. You're not asking for affluence. You could barely get by. But if it was easy to
*  get by, if you could just get by and then you could pursue other things, would that be better
*  for society? And that was like what Andrew Yang was suggesting. If this whole automation revolution
*  took place and everything started getting automated and no one had a job anymore,
*  there might be something to that. There might be something to that now even.
*  The question is, what are you happy your taxes get used for? It's almost like you should be able
*  to vote on that. The one thing that we don't get real direction on in terms of what the country
*  actually wants, but if we could all just individually vote on things like that, where's my taxes go?
*  My taxes go 100% to education. I want to make that cut. You guys got to figure out
*  what to do with the rest of the money. My money, I want it to go towards education.
*  But then nobody or the people who would be paying for war and prisons and shit would just be like
*  BDSM people. How about the salaries? How about the salaries of politicians? How about the money that
*  they make going tours and all that kind of shit? Private jets. All that shit. It's crazy. Yeah,
*  it's fucking crazy. Also like the loose connection between the state and corporations and the way
*  it's just all kind of merging together right now. And also, you know, it appears to be kind of the
*  apocalypse at the moment. Well, if it's not the apocalypse, I don't think it's the apocalypse.
*  I think it's just a dangerous, dangerous illness, but it's definitely dress rehearsal.
*  It's a dress rehearsal for fucking people are going to become preppers. It is going to be amazing
*  for the toilet paper industry. They're going to experience a banner year. If you got toilet paper
*  stock, you're riding high right now. Do you remember the, I don't know if you had this
*  experience, but like I can remember sitting at my computer and pressing the button on Amazon where
*  I wanted to buy something. And it's like, this isn't available right now.
*  That moment of like, it's my button that brings me things. It didn't like suddenly just realize,
*  like, oh my fucking God, how completely weak have I become that I got accustomed to pressing this
*  button and people would bring groceries to my house. And now they don't. Now it's like stopped.
*  Not only that, I'm so accustomed to like, well, you know, I'll just go to the grocery store
*  and pick up some food. It's always been there. It's not there. Dude, I had an Instacart delivery
*  today, you know, because we wanted to get stock up on food. Oh, $200 worth of food. Guess what I got?
*  Strawberries, hummus, and I think we got like, I don't know, some like eggs. That's it. Out of the
*  whole order. Everything else was sold out. All the beef gone, all the chicken gone. Nothing's there.
*  It's like the shelves are empty. So it's like, okay, send everybody $2,000 a month, but what
*  are they going to buy if there's like no food on the shelves? Like what do you think? That was a
*  temporary freak out where people stockpiled stuff. And I think as long as food keeps getting delivered
*  on a normal schedule, I think that'll normal out. I hope so. I do. I think that'll normal out. But
*  it just shows you there's so many things in our society that are amazing, like grocery stores,
*  like cell phones, like we can call each other, all this, but those things are so fragile.
*  They're like, they're, they're so vulnerable. Like if, if an emergency happens and everyone
*  wants to call it once, the cell phone system can't handle it. Like it's not like you have a phone
*  and you can call anytime you want. And I have a phone I can call anytime I want. And everyone in
*  the world has a phone they can call anytime they want. No, if everybody does that, the system is
*  not set up to handle that. If everybody does that, like, ah, like that's why if there's an earthquake
*  or tsunami or anything, everyone's fucked. It's so hard to make phone calls. It's not going to get
*  through. Yeah. Well, dude, I just heard on NPR that so many people were requesting unemployment,
*  that it's crashed systems in several states. That's because this is a real problem. One of my
*  friends was saying, he's like, you know, a lot of people are running out of money tomorrow.
*  They're bartenders, anyone in the service industry, all the people who work at the comedy store. Yeah.
*  It's not like, I mean, how many of them had a lot of money like stored up? None of them. So what,
*  what happens now when there's no food on the shelves? We got to help them. Where we, um, I've
*  been a text message thread with, uh, Whitney Cummings and Nick Swartz and then Crystal Leah.
*  And we're talking about that very thing right now, like how to do it and how to set up a fund.
*  It needs to be done for sure. Um, you know, people that can help should help. This is not a normal
*  time. This is not a time where people are lazy. This is a time where the whole world got fucked
*  real quick. Yeah. Yeah. We weren't ready for it. And, uh, we're going to have to come together,
*  but this is a good time for people to recognize the importance of community.
*  It's a terrible time for humanity. It's a terrible time for us and terrible time for the people that
*  are sick, but it's a really good time for us to understand why community is important. We live in
*  this illusionary world that's provided to us by the culture that we've created, where you can just
*  buy things anytime you want. You don't need people. You come home, you watch Netflix, you don't engage
*  with anyone. You get in your car, you barely say hi to anybody at work. We're detached from each
*  other. And this is the only time ever in life we've been detached from each other. And we're
*  being detached by these goddamn electronics. Yeah. They're sneaking up on us. Yeah. Electronics
*  and cars, which is also, you know, it's, it's also a creation, a mechanical creation. And now more
*  than ever, they're driving computers. Yeah, man. It's true. What I'm trying to say is Ted Kaczynski
*  was right. Oh my God. We all know that. He was right. Do you ever read his manifesto? No,
*  I'm scared. It's catchy. Yeah, that's I went through a period of like doing ketamine and like
*  trying to watch the worst thing I like it. Charles Manson, Kaczynski. And yeah, it is, you know,
*  it is a little bit like, kind of interestingly, not that off, but then the tone is so imperial
*  or something when you're reading it, there's like this, it's a manifesto. That's I have to write.
*  But the one thing my wife is part of like, it's not like it's called a mommy group. So it's like a
*  connection of online of all these mommies and on like all over LA. And what they do is they post
*  people will post shit they need. So like, one of the moms just had a kid, they don't have any wet
*  wipes. And so then all the other moms will be like, Oh, we've got wet wipes. And then right now,
*  they're just leaving them on the door. So people come and get them. So it's like,
*  I think the community thing is exactly right. But also people have to maybe transcend money
*  for a second and figure out ways to set up in their community. Like, what do you need? What do
*  I have? And then start some form of like, trade or just giving people you know, there was someone who
*  set up a toilet paper exchange in LA, where he was just like, if you have extra toilet paper,
*  bring it. And then he had toilet paper, and you're just giving it out to people who are,
*  you know, that's, I think that's the sort of thing we're gonna have to start doing.
*  If we can, you know, it's like right now, there's old people who they can't do shit, man,
*  can't do anything. They're terrified. They can't even get online. If you know them, you got to
*  help them. And this is, you know, this is a weird time for us. But it's a time for us to reset.
*  You know, it's not it's not good. I'm not saying it's good. But I'm saying there's a we can get a
*  positive out of this. Yeah, the people that make through the people that make it through, we can
*  get a positive out of this. And the positive is, community is important. It's really important. And
*  it seemed like it wasn't important, because it seemed like we had everything set up. So you
*  didn't have to engage with people. It's not the right way to do it. It's not good for anybody.
*  Now, now, that kind of life is not good. And the detachment that we have, I mean, that's why
*  why do you think people have road rage on the highway? You know, when they're locked in their
*  little box separated from people in a way that they they wouldn't have it in person. Yeah, it was
*  just I mean, it's only a thin piece of metal and glass separating you from these people. Yeah,
*  with that, there's the other added factor of the heightened senses, because you're driving fast,
*  you realize you might have to make quick movements. So dumb things people do are elevated.
*  They're even more dumb. Yeah, but it's also that you're detached. You're you're in these boxes.
*  Right. It's like a weird dream. We've done weird shit to each other. Yeah, because of that. We're
*  all gummed up in that way. It's like something it's like it's like a fungus that grew on the
*  circuitry of society and starting or it's like, you know, when they talk about the dolphins and
*  the whales being fucked up by the high tech sonar they're using and washing up on the beach,
*  because the sonar is messing up their ability to communicate with each other. It's like there's
*  this kind of technological sonar that is completely made us disconnected from the earth,
*  essentially, like our earth connection has been replaced by a technological connection. Now,
*  technology comes from the earth, but we're talking about a secondary thing compared to, you know,
*  your feet touching the ground, being around another human and like recognizing them as having exactly
*  the same thing you have, which is they want to be happy, you know, feeling the connection between
*  people when you're with someone. I mean, I don't know if you've ever done that, but just like the
*  next time you're around anybody that you're like buying shit from or that you know, normally just
*  kind of go by feel that connect. You can feel it. There's an energetic connection that you can feel
*  there. That's easy to overlook. Yeah, we we've lost the biggest one, which is through light pollution.
*  I think every night people were humbled and reminded of the majesty of the universe when
*  they looked up and saw the infinite skies on a clear night. Yeah, the infinite stars, just the
*  whole Milky Way, you could see the whole thing. Yeah, you know, and there's parts of the country
*  where there's plenty of darkness and you could literally see the whole Milky Way and it makes
*  you think like, Oh, our ancestors saw this fucking freaky shit all the time. We decided to shut off
*  the greatest art the world has ever known because we want to be able to see better at night. Yeah,
*  the greatest art and art that literally not not just as inspired science and wonder to and fueled
*  it, right, but also has kind of always put people in place. Always just just understand. This is not
*  a backdrop. It's not a tapestry that up there is madness. It's forever and you're not protected.
*  There's just a thin layer of gas between you and the universe, which is infinite. You're this tiny
*  little speck of nothingness in this impossible to understand. Spence of planets and stars. It
*  just goes on forever, literally forever. And we're one little tiny piece of it. And we're being held
*  here with a spin and some air. And there's a giant fucking fireball in the sky that keeps us alive.
*  And it's a million times bigger than the earth. Yeah. And it's right there. And this is this is
*  the reality that we live in. It is almost too crazy to put in your consciousness on a daily basis. So
*  we forget about it all the time. It's the one of the most important things about our existence here
*  is that we're a part of the universe. Yeah. It's not just that we're in, you know,
*  fucking Sherman Oaks or we're hanging out in Montana. No, we're right there connected in the
*  universe. And it doesn't get brought up. And one of the reasons because we don't see it. We don't
*  fucking freak out. If you go to the country, you're camping, you fucking freak out. You're like, wow,
*  you see the stars like this is fucking nuts, man. You can see them all. It's a reset button. It
*  changes how you feel about life. Yeah. Yeah. Well, also seems like a lot of us have forgotten that
*  we're going to die on top of all that. I mean, not only are you like looking up at this void
*  filled with stars, but the thing you are is temporary. And that to me is, you know, the other
*  day, I'm like just washing dishes during this fucking pandemic. And I'm thinking to myself,
*  I feel so lucky to be washing dishes right now. I'm alive. I'm healthy. This is fucking it was a
*  different kind of washing dishes than a week ago when I was able to or two weeks or before this
*  shit started when I could order anything I fucking wanted off the Internet. It's suddenly I'm in a
*  different world. Like this is a world where we got to wash these dishes because man, if I get like,
*  if bugs come, I don't know if I want to call an exterminator right now. I don't know how many
*  people I want in my house right now. I don't know what this shit is. So it's like suddenly these are
*  what you're experiencing is this kind of like, well, what does it say in the Bible that we both
*  love so much? Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And I think you could easily translate
*  that to understanding your place in the universe should produce a kind of positive fear and
*  trembling. Not like you're anxious or terrified, but just a kind of like, whoa, this doesn't last.
*  Nothing about this last. And right now everyone around the planet is getting a first hand glimpse
*  of that very truth. Right? Yeah. All at once. One big dose, one big dose of it all at once. One big
*  dose for people to recognize how much of what they concentrate on a daily basis, how much of what
*  fills their consciousness is shit. It's utter nonsense. And we got tricked. We got tricked into
*  thinking it would go on forever. And now we know it's not going to. Now we know, hey, look, this is
*  a terrible thing. But relatively speaking, compared to super volcano asteroid impact,
*  it's compared to something solar flare, something really crazy that can happen and blow out all the
*  power, which is a hundred percent of possibility. Solar flares are 100% a possibility. And for people
*  that did not recognize that and just go through their life, it's just because we look at life
*  as if what we've experienced while we're alive is the norm. But it's not, it's not the norm. It's
*  just hard for you to recognize that your life is so short. Your life is so short that when they're
*  measuring all the different catastrophes that have happened over the earth, whether it's proven
*  sites of asteroid impacts or proven sites of volcano eruptions or all these different things
*  that have happened for sure and wiped out millions of people all over the world, they happen over a
*  time span that's too big. Our head doesn't get in there. Our head doesn't go, what is 13,000
*  years is just some scratches on some paper in my head, my stupid head. I don't know what 13,000
*  years means. I can't, I can't do it. But 13,000 years ago they think, and there's more and more
*  evidence every day, that there was some big impact on earth. And who fucking knows how many of those
*  humans have gone through? Who knows? For the, what I think scientists believe, what is it? It's like
*  300,000 plus years we've been this, right? Is that the idea? Homo sapien? Something like that, right?
*  Bro, that ain't shit. That's so short. That's so short just in the time that the earth has been
*  here, in the four point whatever billion years the earth has been here, and that's so short in terms
*  of the almost 14 billion years the known universe has been here. All of it's madness. Every single
*  step along the way is madness. But we get stuck in these little time periods where nothing changes.
*  And so we think that this is life. So we've built all these houses that only can work on electricity.
*  How many fucking people have a real fireplace in their house that live in cold places? They're
*  banning those now. So if they're banning fireplaces because they don't want to start fires, that's
*  great as long as you can ensure the gas and the power is going to stay on. And I don't think you
*  could do that. You just think you can because you've done it for a hundred years. That's right.
*  That's the thing. A hundred years is shit. A hundred years, the industrial revolution,
*  the roaring twenties from then to today. Let's go 150. Let's get crazy. That ain't shit.
*  That ain't shit. To say this is how things are every day is so dumb. It's especially to say
*  in terms of the earth, natural disasters, space anomalies, not even anomalies,
*  things that happen like solar flares. They have them all the time, man.
*  Yeah, man. Well, I mean, shit, we don't even know. That's the other thing. We don't know all the
*  data in the universe. We don't know that there isn't something called like a quadrisian ripple
*  that happens every, you know, 16 million years. Call Sean Carroll right now. I need information.
*  You know, do you know that poem, Ozymandias? Ozymandias? Yeah. It's by Shelley, I think. It's
*  like, I don't have it memorized, but basically it's like the poem is about someone who sees
*  the broken legs of a statue in the desert and written on a plaque is,
*  My name is Ozymandias, ruler of rulers, king of kings. Behold my works, ye mighty and despair.
*  Because he's just a broken leg. It's like, all you motherfuckers who think you have power,
*  who think you have all this control. It's like, we don't like, I guarantee, of course,
*  like in ancient Egypt, there was probably, I'm not talking about the pharaoh, but there's at least
*  like a thousand dudes who are like, I'm like the hot shit in Egypt and they're going to remember
*  me for a long time. It's like, we don't know who you are. It's all gone, eradicated, wiped out.
*  And this to me is like one of the really side effects of this thing, this technology thing,
*  is we've all become completely self-obsessed, self-absorbed, putting our images out there,
*  making sure that our profiles are updated. You know what I mean? Like we have this
*  insane idea of like, we're so deeply rooted in our identity instead of in the connections
*  between our identities that we're all, the only way that we can finally see how connected we are
*  is some motherfucker eats a bat. You know what I mean?
*  So fucking weird, dude.
*  You know what's really crazy, man? Think of this. If technology really did have an effect on the
*  programming of human beings and if human beings interacting with technology think we're innocently
*  interacting with a non-sentient thing, but all the while this technology and you could call,
*  we get confused when we think the technology is like a digital clock or a television or a computer.
*  It is, but it's also like a fish hook. It's innovation. Someone had to figure that out.
*  And imagine creating an ape that is aware of its environment. This is really the perfect storm.
*  Aware of its environment, but obsessed with itself. Knows in the back of its head that
*  it's temporary, that it's got a finite lifespan, but lives like it's going to live forever and
*  lives in the moment. Lives in the moment and wants to acquire things. It seems the number one goal
*  for the uber wealthy or the uber successful, the Jeff Bezos types characters, right? Or on the top
*  of the food chain financially. They want to acquire things. They're always acquiring things,
*  which means people have to make things, which means they're a big consumer as well as someone
*  who's making a shit ton of money. And this also fuels innovation because you got to keep up with
*  these people. You got to keep giving them bigger and better things every year. So all these resources
*  go into innovation of technology. It's the thing that progresses quicker than anything. Look at
*  cell phones every year. I need 150 megapixel camera or you're a loser. You're a loser.
*  These fucking Samsung phones that are like seven inch screens now, everyone's going crazy.
*  What is the goal though? The goal is to make better shit. And the goal along the way of like
*  this goal is it's working, but you know, it'd be even better if we made it so they don't touch
*  each other anymore. Maybe if we could come up with a disease where they can't shake hands,
*  they don't come close. And yeah, just keep them a little further apart from each other. It'll make
*  them more interested in the things, more interested in the technology, more separate from each other,
*  and encourage technology that connects them with each other. So through technology, they'll find
*  this human longing for contact that they've been missing in their life. They're going to get an
*  emulated version of it, but that emulated version of it is going to keep getting better and it's
*  going to keep getting better and it's going to get to a point where it's better than real life,
*  way better than real life. Cause you're like Jumanji. You get to be the rock, you know,
*  you get to be the like a superhero, like in, you could, you could live a magical life with
*  no boundaries of physics and that they're going to do that. People are going to do that. They're
*  going to give in. If I was a life form that was trying to haunt another life form and trick it
*  into giving birth to me, that's, I would create a person. I'd create people. We were like some
*  fucking ant. We're like some ant that's manufacturing our successors. That's what we are.
*  And we don't even know what we're doing. Just showing up every day. Look at my fucking watches.
*  I got all these diamond chain chain chain. Yeah. Blink, blink bitches. My house is bigger than the
*  rocks. The rocks house is this big. My house is this big. Like that's, that's what people are doing.
*  That's what we're doing. We're just buying more shit. And one good thing of something like this,
*  anytime a tragedy happens, people bond together afterwards. It's a terrible thing that it happened
*  for the victims and the family members of the victims. We all know this, but it, it can be a
*  good reset for us. Economically, people are going to have to get through it. That's going to be the
*  most difficult part. But I think there's, there's going to be an opportunity for us to just assume
*  a nicer stance towards our neighbors and towards our friends and towards our community. And instead
*  of embracing this idea, like you better get guns because they're coming. Maybe we can all come together.
*  I think people need to find if they're, that's going to happen, then we've got to find a better
*  metric for whether things are right or wrong. Yeah. Than the news. Yes. We need something to
*  retune ourselves. Like we're right now, we're tuning the guitar of our identities to these,
*  to like the most terrifying shit, which is the news or like what people are saying. And so
*  if that's, if I think many people become so accustomed to getting their idea of what's
*  happening in reality from the TV, instead of from like how they feel inside, what's going on with
*  their friends and their family. That puts people at incredible disadvantage because their pond is
*  being rippled by shit. You know, I was thinking it's like, what are those little, not prairie dogs,
*  those they stand and look around at the hawks. You know, I'm talking about what are those things
*  called? They're like, they're social little marmots or something like that. You know, there was a show
*  like lemur palace. I don't remember what they're called something, but they're like, they're like,
*  they're really cute. I see them at the zoo. They're fucking adorable. They're most one of the most
*  adorable animals ever. They stand and look, somehow they ignore all the humans around them
*  and just look in the sky for a hawk. It's kind of sad, but that's their life though. But imagine if
*  that one looking for the hawk had like the internet and could see hawks thousands of miles away,
*  how anxious all of them would be because he would always be like, get on the ground, get on the
*  ground, get on the ground. So, you know, I think this, this is what has happened is that we're all
*  constantly being told. I mean, I remember when I was growing up in the old days when the news had
*  an alert that was serious, some serious shit went down. You'll be what the fuck Fox news or any of
*  the news stations have an alert like every four minutes now. Don't alert, alert, alert. And it's
*  all telling us just what you're saying. Get underground, go inside, go inside danger out here,
*  danger out here. And so we're all like, even before this shit, we were huddled up a little bit.
*  Now we can rationalize the huddling, you know, and that's what we're doing. We're just huddling
*  inside right now. That's an incredibly vulnerable place to be. I mean, I'm not going to get
*  conspiratorial here, but you know, if I was the artificial intelligence and I was about to hit
*  the switch and become sentient, I would want to, I would want to remove the threat of human beings
*  as much as possible before I hit the switch, put them in. And this is the best way to make them
*  sick. I'm about to give birth. Make them, make them get sick, confuse them, keep them poor. And
*  then boom, it comes out of nowhere. And then what? Then they just start eating us because we're fuel.
*  They're not going to eat us. I think you know who came up with the, do you know that was a,
*  that was a DARPA project? What? E A T R robots. There were robots that survived on biological,
*  air quotes, biological material. So like maybe they could eat plants or babies, whatever's around.
*  I need a friend at DARPA. They made robots that eat tissue. This is, this is, do robots eat people?
*  Please tell me that's not. And it's a corpse eating robot. Yes. Bro. What? Yes. Why would you paint
*  it playground colors? It literally will use that. Who at DARPA is like paint it like a playground set.
*  So true. Look at it. The colors. It's ridiculous. It looks like a kid's toy. It should look like a
*  vulture. It should be like red and black, like a vulture. Yeah. It should definitely be black,
*  red, lightning bolts on the side. A nice patina, like a ward out patina. Like it's just going through
*  the battlefield eating bodies. Can you imagine getting eaten by a thing that looks like a
*  Tonka truck? Imagine if you're not quite dead and it starts chewing you feet first. I mean,
*  how does it determine whether or not you're dead? What if you can make it? What if you just out cold?
*  What if you got knocked out and it's like a movie, you wake up in the battlefield? I mean,
*  there's a bunch of movies where that happens, right? Sure. You guys aren't really dead. They
*  badly injured. These motherfuckers. There's a video right down below of us talking about it.
*  So it's freaked out by Eater Robots. How this happened more than once.
*  I'm fucking terrified of those things. Just the idea that someone made something that can eat
*  people. Well, listen, folks, the technology that existed in like early cell phones, right? Like
*  if someone made an early Motorola phone with a camera, all that stuff got into everything now.
*  There's so many things that can take pictures now. It's so many phones that can take pictures.
*  They develop one robot and one like proof of concept where something could be fueled on dead
*  bodies. You don't think other people are going to make those too? You don't think they're going to
*  get better? They're going to get better. And then when we do go to war with the robots and this big,
*  giant bulletproof metal ones just eating us and using us as fuel, we're going to be like,
*  what have we done? What have we done? We've created a thing that eats people. And even if
*  it's just the baby right now, that thing could evolve to become something that literally is
*  the thing of nightmares in a Stephen King movie where it's just running around looking for people,
*  eating people. It's a black mirror episode gone wrong. Man, I, to me, I just like to think about
*  the meeting where the guy was like, last night I woke up in the middle of the night with this idea.
*  I got it, y'all. What if we make a robot that devours corpses? And somebody was like,
*  you know what? I kind of like that. Jake, let's put 50 million into that project. See what we could do.
*  Jesus. Yeah. Just imagine like, this is the other thing, man, is like, we somehow imagine that that
*  thing that made Genghis Khan, Genghis Khan is like now out of people. Like there isn't somebody on
*  the planet right now that has the same ambition as a warlord. You know, we've somehow forget that.
*  See, I just think people don't understand that like, there's this idea that the world leaders
*  are just, you know, humanists and that they have our, you know, the interest of humanity is the
*  first thing they're thinking about when they wake up every day. We don't know that some of them aren't
*  interested in the same thing. Every conquering warlord has been interested, which is like,
*  maybe we could take over the planet. I wonder if there's a way. And, you know, imagine if you
*  ended up president of the United States or like president of Russia, president of any powerful,
*  wherever. You know, maybe when you're high one night, I don't know if they get high, but I would,
*  you know, or maybe when you're like just like thinking, wouldn't it flicker through your mind
*  kind of like, I wonder if there would be a way to take over the world. I wonder if there's a way that
*  I could become the king of Earth. Because, you know, when you look up there in the sky, I'm sure
*  there's many Earths out there that have one king, one ruler, someone who conquered the entire planet,
*  someone who figured out a way to do it to like just, why couldn't you? That's the other thing.
*  What's stopping that from happening one day? There being one primary authority, some imperial
*  majesty. We are all one, Duncan. I know. Yeah, if we were all one, but we just have to get rid of
*  some of our laws. Other people are not going to accept our laws, okay? We just got to tighten that
*  up a little bit and we can have one ruler of the whole planet. Yeah. And we're going to fix
*  everything by working together. We're going to evenly distribute resources. It's going to be
*  better this way. I don't know about the distribution of the resources. You're going to have to give up
*  all of your privacy. That's all. But through that, everyone's going to be happier. Yeah. Are
*  you in or are you an outsider? Are you going to act like you're not in? And if you act like you're
*  not in, then we'll find another way to hypnotize you because we'll just pretend to be people who
*  aren't in. You know, and then we'll trick you. We'll infiltrate. Like, yeah, yes. How easy is it?
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's what you do, man. That's the problem is like, no matter what
*  what revolutionary idea gets out there that anybody has, the contagion of the revolutionary
*  idea is easily warped and twisted by people who have like other ideas that run counter to that.
*  You know, like it's so easy to confuse people who believe that Twitter, Instagram, CNN, Fox News,
*  Drudge Report, Wall Street Journal, New York Times is an accurate metric of what's happening
*  on the planet. Yeah. That's not very many information streams, man. Right. Like, how hard
*  would it be to infiltrate all the information streams in some small way and gradually start
*  warping them so that people become more open to the idea of being constantly surveilled,
*  constantly monitored and not speaking up about it? Because if you speak up about it, then you're a
*  conspiracy theorist. I got another way of looking at it that I've been thinking. What if it's just
*  this is how life goes? What if instead of this being like some grand conspiracy by the robots
*  or by the the elites, what if this is just how systems go when one thing gets too big,
*  isn't in is in too much power, there's no no longer a struggle to survive. It's reached some
*  stagnant point biologically in some sort of weird way. And also maybe even without,
*  for lack of a better word, spiritually stagnant. Right. And then some people are breaking through
*  and realizing who, you know, who they are and their connection to other people. But globally,
*  God, there's a lot of people that are sleep, sleepwalking out there, sleepwalking, hypnotized by
*  technology and society. And this is this is their big wake up call right now. What if this all this
*  even materialism, right? Even our obsession with technology, maybe like if you look at all the
*  systems that exist in the universe, and particularly all the biological systems that exist on Earth,
*  some of them are so spectacular. You're like, what? What happened here? How did they do this?
*  Like, have you ever seen like leaf cutter ants when they take their their buildings,
*  and they pour cement in them, and they realize these these fermentation chambers, and they
*  ferment the leaves in there, there's air holes out to the earth. And there's all these fucking
*  tunnels. And this is crazy, elaborate city structure that's created by these ants. Well,
*  there's all these systems that that take place all over the earth. For if there's too much plants,
*  then these the insects involved, there's too many insects, the plants evolve, all these things happen
*  to sort of keep some sort of a balance. Ideas that infect people, the dumb ones that are so
*  intoxicated, think about what's the some of the most intoxicating shit, I mean, intoxicating,
*  meaning that you're not even really getting pleasure out of it. But you can't look away.
*  It's like some of the dumbest reality television, right? Right. And the fear factor, you're sitting
*  there with your mouth open like, huh, and you get sucked in to this thing that the earth is created
*  to make you it's not people. What if the what if the grand conspiracy is it's not robots,
*  it's not people, it's life is trying to get rid of you. Life is making it easier to survive,
*  which makes you soft as fuck, which makes you compliant to anything that keeps you in that sort
*  of soft, comfortable state. I don't want to ruffle any feathers. If they need to look through my
*  emails, you let them. Yeah. And all the while, it's just the world, it's the universe plotting
*  against us, because there's too many of us. And we fucked up. We have too much power. And we're
*  obviously doing shit to the earth that we shouldn't be doing. Like, look what we're doing to the ocean.
*  We're sucking every fish out. We're dumping in all our fucking straws. Yeah. Look at what we're
*  doing to fracking where people have to move because they can't use their water. And like,
*  well, it was an acceptable outcome. Basically, we don't need to rely on Saudi Arabia anymore.
*  But you poison these people's air, they have to move out of their fucking house, their water's
*  on fire. Literally, their water's on fire. And maybe life is like, okay, what do we got here?
*  Let's get a virus. Let's get them addicted to technology. Let's get a virus. Let's get them
*  obsessed with themselves. Let's make the predominant thing that people spend their time on,
*  not reading books, not fucking walking alone with their thoughts, but staring at these pictures of
*  other people's photos, selfies and butt pictures. And look at how this guy does chest. Do you ever
*  do chest like that? He gets sucked into looking at these fucking videos. And then when it's decided
*  you're weak, it starts sending in some more problems. Boom, here's a little bit of this. Boom,
*  here's a little bit of that. Boom, here's a new disease. Boom, here's a tsunami. Boom,
*  here's a new clear reactor you can't shut down. And then you try to figure out
*  whether or not we're going to be able to use our amazing intellect to bypass our own biological
*  switches that have us connected to this bullshit life. We have a lot of weird, dumb biological
*  switches that were put in place back when we had to survive against incoming hordes of soldiers.
*  And we're in the information age now. What we need to do is be sustainable in case of emergency,
*  which we're clearly not. And we need to realize that this is temporary. And when a bad thing
*  happens, it makes you realize that. It makes you realize, hey, I thought everything was going to
*  be fine forever. This is real. Just like a movie or a book. We're just not prepared for it because
*  we haven't experienced it. We're like, this is a once in a lifetime event. No, it's a once in our
*  lifetime event. Our lifetime is too small for us to really get a grip. It's a blink. It's a blink.
*  And this is just, like you said, dress rehearsal. If anything, it's a dress rehearsal for death.
*  The thing is, it's like that blink. If you're an atheist, which I get that. And I think there
*  must be some deep... Do you know any atheists that have done a real blowout psychedelic session?
*  No. I know a couple. And those are the most puzzling to me. Because people have done real
*  blowout mushroom sessions or blowout DMT sessions. I always think that they would leave the door open
*  to the impossible because it is impossible. And you experienced it. It's not like,
*  even if you're imagining it, I couldn't imagine that. So how am I imagining that? How am I
*  imagining something in such incredible, vivid color and detail and knowledge and love and all
*  these different things you experience in that state? That state is otherworldly. The fact that
*  that is accessible at all. I don't care if it's through a molecule or through a yoga session. I
*  don't care how it's accessible. The fact that that's accessible at all leaves open to me the
*  I don't know. Because I didn't know that that was a thing. So once I've experienced that, I'm like,
*  oh, well, all this flat plane of existence that we take for granted, that we think this is everything
*  around us, this is the whole environment we have to worry out for, this might be just one fucking
*  stage on the radio dial of experience and of dimensions that are interacting with us. We just
*  don't have the senses to tune into them. And when you can, for me at least, it leaves open the door
*  for who the fuck knows? Who knows, man? Just the fact that that's a thing. There's a, okay, so this
*  is a trip. This is very trippy. So I got this book called The Tibetan Yoga of Dream and Sleep.
*  Whoa, I feel like I just like this. It's fucking cool. But basically, it's like a form of Tibetan
*  Buddhism that invites you to explore the difference between when you think you're awake and when you're
*  dreaming. And so basically, the idea is there isn't much of a difference. There's like right now,
*  you're dreaming this thing you call your human incarnation. It's like it is a dream. And
*  when people are dying, they get all delirious and shit. They slide through time. I don't know
*  if you've ever been around a dying person, but they like suddenly they're back in Vietnam.
*  They're in the 50s. They're in the 30s, whatever their lifetime, which means that when you're dying,
*  you're going to spin through time too, meaning that this could be you dying right now,
*  spinning backwards through time. But like in a dream. So that when you, you know, this is the
*  main thing about it is that when we die, according to this, we sort of spend like 39 days, I think it
*  is in a place called the Bardo, which is essentially like what it's like to have no body but still have
*  this like, this basically like your karma, your identity sort of propelling you through. And that
*  that's how you like get your next incarnation. So essentially like that's what we're dealing with
*  here is so bizarre and surreal that it easily could just be a dream state that one of these
*  vast AIs that already exist is having. We're just processors. We're just being run. It's like running
*  a simulation of a pandemic or maybe this is a way that like an AI gets polished. Like maybe we're an
*  AI that's being like polished and taught through this process of having a limited incarnation.
*  You got to have that so that there's a reason for us to actually invest ourselves and stuff.
*  Like if we were gods, if we live for a million years, eventually we wouldn't have such a
*  passionate relationship, I think with the world that anyone who's going to. So you need that to
*  train the thing up. So it takes it seriously. You have to put the setting on mortal. Then you then
*  maybe you just run a series of tests on the thing. You start run to what is this? What have we made?
*  What does it do in a pandemic? And by it, I mean the sum total of all humans, which is right now
*  disconnected. It's like a malfunctioning brain. You know what I mean? We're not connecting.
*  But if we were being like sort of, I don't know how you put it, groomed, evolved intentionally,
*  then every single moment in an individual's life and in a planet, the planets, the life of history
*  could be looked at as a training or an upgrade. This could be an operating system upgrade. This
*  could be what an operating system upgrade looks like in the bio computer that we exist in.
*  It looks like a fucking pandemic. And that's what's happening right now is we're being like
*  upgraded for some reason, even though it's terrifying and obviously horrific.
*  We're being upgraded. And when you anyway, the whole point is, man, this thing that we're in
*  right now, whether or not there's a God, we just I think an atheist gets to lean into the idea that
*  when they close their eyes and breathe their last breath, it stops. And I just think that's a big
*  gamble, man. And I don't mean because you go to hell. I mean, how nice would that be if it just
*  stopped when more than likely it's, you know, the at least in this Tibetan yoga of dreaming and sleep,
*  more than likely what happens is way before you actually die. When you get really sick,
*  you already start waking up into your next life. You just wake. You just like go through a weird
*  dreamlike state called the Bardo where you freak the fuck out. And then you're suddenly alive in
*  another being completely oblivious to whatever your past incarnations were. And that's what we're in
*  right now. So, you know, I don't know, this is a great time for people to start, you know, looking
*  at that in one and preparing for that. We didn't prepare for the fucking pandemic.
*  We didn't prepare. Some of y'all did, I'm sure. But I did. There's a few preppers out there listening.
*  Oh, yeah, I was ready. I know you guys did it. Congrats, man. You were right. Congratulations.
*  I've got fucking hummus and strawberries and some like and but but I think that like also
*  preparing for like the authentic apocalypse, which is when you kick the fucking bucket. Yeah,
*  because the idea is, you know, this feel feel free to like the goddamn sage again.
*  But the idea is be gone. Thank you. The idea is that you can actually, like navigate through
*  that Bardo state, you can have a little bit of lucidity instead of sort of dying and like
*  freaking out because it's a hallucinatory state. You could actually have a kind of like, I don't
*  know, focus through it and control your next incarnation. Yeah, we just have to figure it out.
*  That's the thing. And when you're young, particularly if you're young, you don't have
*  a lot of guidance, which is me when I was younger, it takes a while to figure it out,
*  because you're just running on your own, right? There's no you're not getting like a lot of
*  direction to how to live your life. And I moved around a lot to which really didn't help.
*  But as you get older, you start getting a better sense of what makes sense and what doesn't make
*  sense and what's important, what's not important, what fucks up your life and what enhances your
*  life. But you don't live long enough to really get it down. See, if these these people like
*  David Sinclair, or Aubrey de Grey, all these anti aging geniuses that are out there that are
*  working on all these solutions to extend human life, they were really nail it. They really nail
*  it. You know, if David Sinclair comes up with something and you can live 150 250 years, by the
*  time you're 150 years old, you're gonna have so much less bullshit in your life, you're gonna
*  realize like, when you're 30, you'll date crazy people, you'll have more on friends that you have
*  to bail out of jail, you'll have these problems. But when you get older, you start going, look,
*  I see what's good for me. And I see what's not good for me. You know, and I see this some people
*  that are not willing to change. And they're trying, they're not trying to do better. Right,
*  they're just consistently making the same mistakes over and over again, and dragging everyone down
*  around them. You just got to move on from people like that in your life. When you're 150, man,
*  you're not going to be tolerating anything. You're just gonna just gonna only have cool people that
*  you hang out with and will attract each other. And then we'll be able to work together on things,
*  knowing that each other are sane and rational and are looking at these things. Honestly,
*  they're not talking from a position of trying to convince you of their virtue, or trying to talk
*  you in a position of doing something that will benefit them financially. They're doing it just
*  because they're just being in the moment and honest and being a human being. Yeah, man. I mean,
*  you basically just described like the secret societies. I mean, you know what I mean? We need
*  to come up with our own, which we call it. The Illuminati? No, that's too much. Well, you know,
*  that the- If we came up with our own right now, what would we call it? Whatever it is, don't do
*  initials, man. I hate that shit. That's not good. They can use those against you. Yeah. I don't know.
*  What do we call it? Jamie? Children of Jamie. You know, but the thing is like these immortal beings
*  that you're talking about, they do already exist, but they exist as like communities that have
*  lineages attached to them. So it's like, because our physical bodies die, we don't get to do the
*  thing you're talking about. When you're older, you do do that naturally. And plus when you have
*  kids, it's like, you just don't have time for bullshit anymore. There's no time to fuck around
*  with somebody who's like constantly fucking up their life. You used to get drinks with or whatever.
*  Like you have a child and you have to- But regardless, there already is set in place
*  in on the planet, these like lineages. There's essentially chains of transmission in martial
*  arts, right? Like when you look at a martial art, you're seeing a living being, you know,
*  that has its roots. I don't know how far it goes back. When you look at yoga, that's a living thing
*  that's transferred from person to person, right? So I think these things already, a mortality already
*  does exist. It just doesn't exist as a human. And also sometimes when I hear about these technologists
*  trying to live forever, I get a little scared thinking that's kind of like, you know, if you
*  could theoretically do it, you might be locking yourself in a dream that you don't want to stay in.
*  It gets worse. Yeah. And you can't die. You can't die. You engineer some polymer skin that's made of
*  that spider silk blend that they were trying to come up with that's stronger than steel.
*  Yeah. Remember they were doing that? There was an article about them trying to create some sort of
*  bulletproof skin by engineering it with spider silk. Yeah, I remember that. What if that becomes-
*  What if that's real? What if they figure out a way to make people completely invulnerable,
*  we live forever, and then we hate it. And we didn't realize that if we just shut the lights out,
*  we'd go to the next stage. And the next stage is amazing. Maybe that's like the big trick.
*  The big trick is like, how do you use this life? And how does it take you into the next stage?
*  Imagine if that's really what's happening. That's why every single- Look, I'm not saying that this
*  means anything, but every single religion has some place you go when it's over. Yeah.
*  Don't they? I mean, almost all of them? Yeah. I mean, that's an overlying theme. Now you could
*  say, well, that's just engineered to provide comfort to people because, you know, they want
*  to feel like this life means something, but the reality is the lights just shut off. And to that,
*  I say maybe. I say maybe. Maybe. But have you ever been whacked out of your mind on psychedelics?
*  Because if you are, you would go, who the fuck knows? Because that's a who the fuck knows moment.
*  So maybe death is a who the fuck knows moment. Maybe that's why every single religion has these
*  stories. Not every single one. But like, look, I mean, there's a lot of religions that people
*  clearly just made up, right? And we know the people that made them. They count too. They don't even
*  have to pay taxes. Yeah. So let's not get holier than that with the concept of religions. Right.
*  So there's a lot of really dumb religions that probably don't have an afterlife. But it's just
*  some shit that people made up all of it. But how many people have made up this idea
*  that there's a place you go that's better than this? I mean, is that just to make you incentivize
*  you to be good and to be a good person? Or is it like an inherent understanding of how the universe
*  works? It might be both things. It might be also be manipulative because you can get people to comply
*  with social norms and society's rules. If you tell them that if they don't, that God is watching them
*  and he will smite them down and burn them forever. That is a way that is part of a way,
*  but it's not going to stop people from doing most shit. It's just not. It never has. I mean,
*  some of the most horrific things ever done by human beings were done in the name of Christianity,
*  right? Or many other religions. But there is something to the possibility that it's both
*  things. That it's an understanding that when you do good in this life, you will go forth into the
*  next stage in a better place. You'll feel better. You'll be less burdened by the past. You'll be
*  less hampered by the failures of your ability to adjust and your ability to live a harmonious life
*  with people here on earth. That might be something that's real. And also the other ideas, it's not
*  like this place that they're talking about in religions is existing after you die. The idea is
*  like you're there right now. You just can't feel it. You're wearing a blindfold that looks like
*  your body in your life. You're wearing a blindfold that looks like your existence, your mind. And
*  that's why there's always these stories of Jesus healing a blind man or like Paul on the road to
*  Damascus being like blinded. There's all these stories of being like already existing in what
*  Buddhism, some forms of Buddhism call fundamental goodness. That's already where we're at. That's
*  the main channel. But we've sort of grown like little bits of grass into the time-space continuum.
*  And right now we're like waving in the wind of our karma and not realizing there's a beneath us or
*  through us or moving through us is a much grander, more beautiful, incredible thing. So
*  like I think when people say, yeah, they invented it so people be afraid, it sort of imagines that
*  these people are having one-way conversations with it. You know that when they pick up the phone,
*  it's just themselves they're talking to. It's not imagining that when people connect to this divine
*  source, it immediately says, oh, hi, yeah, this is the part of your program where you were supposed
*  to start remembering what's really going on here and reconnecting with me. Don't worry,
*  don't feel bad. It's okay. Everyone goes through that. In fact, you requested a disconnect for
*  the last 15 years when you were getting hammered and imagining you were Charles Bukowski or whatever.
*  Like if this was all part of the plan, that was actually teaching you what happens when you don't
*  take care of your body. Now, we're like connecting, sending a download to you, letting you know, hi,
*  it's us. We're here. We're not mad at you. How could we be? We're infinite. We've been here since
*  before the stars. You wanted this to happen. My apologies for cutting off your ball, killing your
*  mom and your dad. You know what I mean? But whatever, this is all part of a bigger thing.
*  I think that's to me what God is. It's this constantly rejuvenating, synchronistic
*  perfection that becomes increasingly perfect. It exists simultaneous to this seemingly imperfect
*  universe. It's always there for you to connect to at any moment. When people smoke DMT,
*  certainly that's one of the avenues. That's a beautiful thing. I think the reason for it
*  is not to scare people. It's more so that people become like fountains for that and in some small
*  way become little droplets or like divine bits of perspiration bubbling up into this place so that
*  folks who are really freaking out right now are worried or scared or disconnected could have at
*  least the chance to reconnect. Because listen, man, if I was God wanting to get blasted, if I was some
*  divine being wanting to get high and Alan Watts has a beautiful lecture on this, I really do think
*  at some point I would want to cut off all connection to the realization of my divinity
*  and experience infinite lifetimes on a planet, on a tumultuous planet and experience every
*  incarnation and all of it to get an understanding of what it is like to be extremely limited.
*  What would this do? It would just add to my data banks. It would just help me increasingly become
*  more and more beautiful and perfect, which seems to be what we're in right now. It's like we have a
*  limited data set based on our neurology. We can't see certain colors. We can't hear certain sounds.
*  We don't know what happened 20,000 years ago. We don't know what happens five seconds from now.
*  And so this is a perfect place to be in what's in becoming, to know what it is to become and to be
*  limited. And this is, who knows, man, it's just something sniffing data. It's something just like
*  snorting our lives, like the universe is snorting our lives on time and
*  on the mirror of time. Well, it's the big thing that keeps us from seeing that. The one thing
*  that all psychedelics have in common is the dissolving of the ego. They all dissolve the ego.
*  What's that word? Dissolution? Dissolution. Dissolution of the ego. What's happening with
*  all of them is it removes all this nonsense narrative in your head. Everyone's ego has this
*  nonsense view of the world that's based on them being the most important thing. And that all the
*  shit that they're thinking about right now is of the utmost importance, needs to be done right now.
*  That's why people run red lights. You can't even wait. You can't even wait, you fuck. It's one
*  thing if it's a medical emergency, kids being born, someone's got a broken leg and you just,
*  you got to get to the hospital right away. I get it. I 100% get it. But there's some people that
*  just want to be, they just want to make that left turn. They don't give a fuck if the light
*  changed. They want to cut in front of you, make that turn, even block traffic because they think
*  more about themselves than they do about other people. And that's a side effect of this life
*  that's been set up. But it's almost like maybe that's how it works. Maybe the life creates
*  challenges when there are no challenges and the challenges are it just tries to diminish you,
*  tries to see if you're paying attention, tries to weaken you and make you stupid and turns you
*  into a fucking zombie. If you walked into any restaurant, any restaurant during lunchtime,
*  and you see people on their phones, it's like this is bonkers. This is if this was anything else
*  that where half the room was using an electronic and staring into it for long moments at a time,
*  not interacting with the person across from them, like that becomes almost the norm.
*  They're like at least 50% of the people and everyone's interrupting everybody.
*  They're all just barely paying attention to each other.
*  Well, they haven't developed the muscle. I mean, it's a muscle. People just assume
*  that the ability to have a conversation is a natural part of being an adult. But I think
*  that's atrophying in a lot of people to the point now where I just try to be,
*  you know, as I guess is like, I just have lowered my expectations to the point of like,
*  I don't know how many people can pay attention that much. And I know I'm certainly distracted,
*  but doesn't it feel fucking weird? Even if you're just watching TV with somebody,
*  and they pull their phone out and start looking at it. So weird. It's like the energy immediately
*  downshifts the moment that it's like if you're watching a movie with someone and they're over
*  there on their phone, like, come on, yeah, watch the movie with me. Yeah, even though we're not
*  talking doesn't mean we're not connecting. It's weird. It's weird. Even fights. If you watch
*  fights with your friends, they're on their phone all the time. It's like, are you not even watching
*  these fights? You can feel it. Yeah. That's why, you know, at the Denver Comedy Works, they've got
*  the day. Yeah. So like, I was listening. Do you ever listen to an audience that doesn't have access
*  to their phones before a show? They're so mad. No, they want, they, motherfucker, where's my phone?
*  This, no, it's- They talk to each other. Yeah. It's like, it's like the sound is better. It's a
*  better sound out there. It's a different murmur than a phone murmur from a crowd. So yeah, I don't
*  know, man. I think that- I think life presents all sorts of adversity and some adversity doesn't feel
*  like adversity. It's sneaky. And that's what cell phones are. That's what technology is. And that's
*  certainly what social media is. You only realize what social media truly can do when it comes at
*  you. You know, you get canceled or there's a bunch of people who are tweeting mean stuff to you. Then
*  you realize like, oh, these are horrible feelings. Right. This feeling of being attacked by this thing
*  that's been grooming me. Yeah. It's like, what is that? Like, well, if the earth was trying to get
*  rid of us, if the earth had decided that there's an infection that doesn't think it's an infection,
*  it thinks it's so important that it should be allowed to pollute everything around it,
*  should be allowed to scab up the earth with giant concrete bandages. I mean, that's what we're doing.
*  We're putting these things everywhere that cover up all the ground, displace all the life. And
*  then we shut off the light so we can't recognize that we're in space. I mean, the whole recipe is
*  perfect. It's perfect for charming us to sleep. Every aspect of it, the ego part, the fact that
*  it exists, the fact that we have this biological imperative to stay alive and breed and then keep
*  our DNA alive. And there's all these things that are set into you to make sure that that happens
*  all the while where you recognize you definitely are a finite life form. Right. But yet you do
*  something you hate every day. Yeah. You just keep doing it. Yeah. You do something you don't enjoy.
*  And when you get into reincarnation, which I love, that thing you're doing that you don't enjoy,
*  you've been doing that for infinite lifetimes. Oh my God. That's called your clasias. It's your sort
*  of, it's like underneath your identity. It's basically your code. It's your tendencies,
*  I guess is the way you put it. So like, you know, if you have the tendency to lose your temper,
*  then that's something that you've been dealing with for infinite lifetimes. And it never ever
*  goes away until you start waking up. Because the idea is to just go from being this set of
*  conditioned responses, reactions to your environment, to being something that's like
*  lucid living. I mean, if you want to lucid dreaming, try lucid living, you know, which is the
*  practice, I would say of like, first, what are your habituations? You know what? Like the other day,
*  I was sitting on the couch, I took my sock off, and I spun it like a lasso and threw it across
*  the room. And my wife looks at me, she's like, what was that? I'm like, Oh my God, holy shit.
*  That's how I've been taking my socks off for years. And I didn't even know it. I pull them off,
*  lasso them and sling. And like, like that, just that little thing, I didn't even know I was doing
*  something so well. I've probably been doing that since I was a kid. Like, I probably saw some cool
*  kid lasso with socks and throw it. And I'm like, I'm gonna start fucking lasso on my socks. But like,
*  how many other things are you doing that are just like that? That are just pure habituation,
*  pure reactivity. And this is where you run into some scary shit, man, which is what
*  Jaron Lanier, God, I wish you could get him on. You know that guy is?
*  What say his name? Jaron Lanier. I feel like I've heard that name. He is. What does he do? He's an
*  author. He like developed all this VR technology. He was in Silicon Valley. And it's when it was
*  just starting working on VR before the technology was even there to have VR goggles. He was like,
*  building. I think he like, and helped his group help build. I think it might be the Oculus Rift.
*  I'm sorry, fans of his out there who are upset that I don't know that some VR system. Yeah, he's
*  and he's like, he's he's written a lot of great books, one of them, 12 reasons to get out or 10
*  reasons to get off your social media now. But yeah, he wrote a book called that. Yep. How do
*  you say his name again? Jaron Lanier, Jaron Lanier, Freaking brilliant human man. But, um,
*  you know, what's the name of the book? It's called 10 or 12. I can't remember 12 reasons to get off
*  your social media now or delete your account, something like that. There's a book of his I
*  like better than that called The Dawn of the New Everything. But and that's just him sort of like
*  talking about what it was like working in Silicon Valley back then and his sort of opinions on
*  on this stuff. Is he a white guy with dreadlocks? Yeah, look. Yeah. Hmm.
*  Suspect. Well, no, I think people do judge his meat body. But his meat body was physical
*  appearance. Oh, is he a large fellow? Fucking brilliant. I believe it. Listen, man, there's a
*  lot of brilliant people with wacky hair. Yeah, yeah, it's okay. It's okay to have. I'm defending
*  him because I'm like, I love him. He's doing is those bagpipes? What's happening with this guy?
*  He's playing pipes. Who cares? He's a genius. I don't care. What is this? Quite a few photos
*  of him with pipes. God damn it. I didn't see the pipe photos. Who cares? I didn't see the
*  pipe. When we say pipes, we should say like the kind you blow on like flutes and pipes and
*  a lot of them, bro. He looks real spiritual. Jamie, I don't look at it. Please put that picture
*  back up because there's very few things in life that I love more than white guys with dreadlocks
*  with their eyes closed playing the flute. There's very few things in life that make me feel like,
*  man, dude, if I had that picture of me online, I would want people to turn off their social media
*  too. Yeah, that's my guy. Here's a new flute with him, eyes closed. He plays a flute. He plays a flute.
*  I bet he's amazing at it. Dude, nothing wrong with what he's doing. I think it's amazing. I wish I
*  could play a flute. He's playing another flute. Look at that flute. That's a dope looking flute,
*  though. What is that flute? That flute looks dope. God damn it. Those flutes sound cool and I'm not
*  being disingenuous. I'm not being sarcastic. Flutes sound cool. I wish I could... What is that thing,
*  though? That needs to go away. It's like a zither. He's in The Hobbit. He's in the movie The Hobbit.
*  He's in the movie The Hobbit. He's in the fucking pub and he's playing that thing in the back because
*  they haven't figured out real music yet. Sir, I'm only joking. I appreciate your contributions. I'm
*  just joking. I'm sure you're brilliant. Duncan's one of my favorite people. He's brilliant. I'm
*  just joking. Look, if you want to listen, play the flute. The kind of people that are like super
*  intelligent and whacked out on technology, I think something like the flute would be an amazing way
*  to decompress. You're literally using your body to make a sound with air and tubes.
*  He said he plays like a hundred instruments or something. He's just some kind of genius, but
*  here's the scary thing he said, which is if B.F. Skinner's right and pretty much if you can
*  control a thing's environment, you can control it, this is the reason to be terrified of AI
*  because the more advanced an AI gets, our assumption is that things are going to eat us
*  or kill us or whatever. It might just gradually hypnotize us and hypnotize us by creating
*  more and more enticing things that grab our attention, hacks our neurology, and begins to
*  like just do things that are completely impossible to not look at. When you're saying an AI
*  advised the pandemic, how do you look away from a pandemic? All of our nervous systems right now
*  are completely fixated on every tremor, every ripple, every little data point that flies
*  across our screens. We are so absorbed in it right now. We are locked in like cats chasing laser
*  pointers. That is what he said we should be most afraid of is that these things eventually could
*  get to the point of completely grabbing us. What you were saying earlier is kind of maybe that's
*  what already happened. Maybe that is a process. Maybe it's a process that's not even put in place
*  by anything other than life itself. The life itself has these system setups. No one thing ever
*  totally dominates. When it does, they find ways into it. It's this constant state of chaos that
*  produces better and better life forms. That's what it is. If you want to admit or you want to state
*  that we are better than our ancient ancestors, the pre-homo sapien hominids, I think we're better.
*  I think we're better. They might have been stronger than us, but we've created more.
*  Overall as a species, I think it's better to be a person than it is to be a pre-person.
*  I think as it goes on and on, we're going to think the same way. I think the next stage of existence
*  is going to be so happy. It's not a person running around letting their dick think for them and
*  fucking getting drunk all the time and crashing their motorcycle. All the dumb shit that people
*  do, all of the dumb shit from alcohol and drug abuse to fucked up relationships to everything
*  we do to lying and stealing and being selfish, all that shit, we'd be so happy if that all went
*  away. Oh my God. Those, dude, the pre-humans used to eat each other's babies. They were always
*  fucking stealing and robbing. They couldn't talk. They couldn't express love. Who the fuck would
*  want to be that? And then the humans, the humans were so full of shit. They were all addicted to
*  their phones. They didn't even see it coming. The phone snuck in their life. They welcomed it with
*  new versions every year, paying for their own demise happily. And they were all angry and bitter
*  and mean and jealous and fucking thoughtless and polluting. And then the next stage came along and
*  they eliminated all that and we all live in harmony. Now we're all gravel. No, now we're all
*  great to be a gravel pebble. We're all space. Yeah. Or just we're all we're all part of the next.
*  Yeah. And we already are. I mean, I think probably we already are that. But I mean,
*  to me, I think that whatever's happening, you just have to make it a good thing. Like whether or not
*  it is a good thing or not, that's if there is something great about humans is that we're
*  capable of alchemizing phenomena in a way that it doesn't completely drive us nuts or paralyze us.
*  That's any anything that's happening to you can be converted into something either that's going to
*  make you scared, self-destructive, rationalize your anger, rationalize your shitty decisions,
*  or it can be used as a thing that completely, quote, converts you, completely shifts your
*  method or way of living. And that's what's beautiful about a human is that any given
*  moment you can do that. Like at any given moment you can shed your operating system.
*  Theoretically, you could drop all of the hangups, all the weird shit. Are you jerking off three times
*  a day? You could maybe take it down to two times a day. Are you drinking every single night? You can
*  stop that. And to me, that's like, yeah, the future beings, whatever they are, I hope one of the
*  qualities or one of the things they look back at is like, holy shit, those poor things had no idea
*  how powerful they were. They were sleepwalking when they could have at any moment connected to
*  the great truth, the divine, the glory of all things, and could have theoretically, any one of
*  them, just one of them could have converted the entire planet into an up-leveled, up-resonanced,
*  up-consciousness utopia. But they all were sleepwalking. And then finally, somebody woke up,
*  for real. And I don't know, maybe it's, I don't know what that looks like.
*  Maybe what looks like is what this is happening, what is happening right now with this virus,
*  where everybody's being forced indoors and forced to stop work. It's a terrible thing for people
*  financially, but it is, in a sense, a reset button. It's a real reset button. To know that this shitty
*  job that you hate going to could go away at any moment because all jobs could go away at any moment
*  is a real wake-up call because even the good jobs are going away. If you're in San Francisco,
*  you have the best job in the world. Guess what? You can't even go there. You might have the best
*  job. You're so fucking pumped to go to work every day. You can't go. You can't go. So that can be
*  taken away from you too. So if you're living a bullshit life, recognize that all of this for
*  everybody could go away. If Yellowstone blows, half the people die. Easily. Easily. Maybe more.
*  That motherfucker could easily go. We need these little catastrophes sometimes just to let us
*  understand that the window of time that we've been existing in that's been relatively free of
*  disaster is unique. And that's not normal. Normal is madness. Normal is we're in the middle of a
*  fucking shooting gallery spinning a thousand miles an hour around a fireball. That's normal.
*  Every now and then, shit flies into our atmosphere and wrecks havoc.
*  This is why I love hollow earth theory, man. You ever get into that shit?
*  Is that for people to get kicked out of the flat earth society?
*  Yeah. Flat earth people look down on hollow earthers. But hollow earth is to me, my favorite of
*  them all. Because if the idea is like, yeah, humans have been on the planet for a long time,
*  and if we want to go into the cool idea of the Atlanteans and advanced civilizations,
*  at some point, if you can't create a way to protect from the meteor impacts and you're
*  looking to create a sustaining civilization, you're going to want to go in there, man.
*  And so to me, it's such a fucking cool idea that in the core of the earth is another sun
*  that has an advanced civilization that hasn't been disrupted by the shit that happens on the
*  surface of the planet. It turns the earth into a spaceship. Inside the spaceship are these advanced
*  beings. And outside the spaceship, it's like a celestial fungus that's growing out. It's just,
*  or it's like, another way to put it would be outside the spaceship is Mad Max. Covering
*  outside the spaceship is just a bunch of us that are inside the thing who have basically
*  been completely disrupted over and over and over again. So they have no idea what
*  history is. They have no idea where the planet came from. They don't know anything. And now we've
*  sort of grown out of control all around the ship. And so this kind of shit that's happening is like
*  turning on the windshield wipers. It's like, hey, man, you got humans on you. You know that, right,
*  man? You're like crawling with them. Oh, fuck. Wipe them out. Get rid of them. Let's just scrub
*  the fucking surface. Do with some earthquakes. Yellowstone is just a windshield wiper for the
*  people who live inside the planet. Well, you know what humans are, man? Really? A vector for ideas.
*  It's ideas that change everything. The humans just do the work of the ideas. What we are,
*  we're the first thing that can manipulate our environment that has ideas. We're the first thing
*  with ideas. All these other animals, they had instincts. They had ideas in terms of trying to
*  figure out the best patterns to acquire food, how to sneak up on birds. But if you think cats have
*  ideas, well, guess what? They all have the same fucking idea. Cats aren't inventing shit. You
*  know, they're not inventing things. There's a specific kind of idea that's unique to a human
*  being. Regardless of the sentience of other animals, ours is unique in that it allows us to
*  make stuff, not just little things. We can make gigantic machines that travel in the space and
*  all the wild creations of human beings all came out of ideas. We think it's all humans, but true,
*  we are the ones that put forth. But if you're a thing that wants to get born, you need a host,
*  you get that curious ape that's just been trying to figure out better ways to stab its neighbor
*  with a spear. Get that thing and slowly infect it with ideas. Ideas of new stuff to make. And then
*  it goes out and does the work for you. And then you take over the earth. The ideas have taken over
*  the earth. The people are just the toys, the ideas. Now, if instead of ideas, you said demons,
*  I mean, that's literally what people used to think was happening to folks when they did terrible
*  things. They had bad ideas, they acted on those bad ideas. And ancient religions thought of those
*  ideas like they were demons, like these people were possessed. That was a common thought that
*  someone's possessed by a demon. We're all possessed by ideas. And some possessed by them more than
*  others. Like Elon Musk is particularly haunted. He's possessed by ideas, swarms of ideas. And
*  what does he do? Well, look at what he's done. He's one guy that's probably had more of an impact
*  on our perception of what the future holds in terms of technology than any other one individual
*  human being that is widely known of like he is a famous human like he is. I mean, he's doing
*  Tesla, which is the most advanced electric cars in the world. They're insane. Then he's doing this
*  fucking loop thing, right? The hyper or the the boring project where he's boring. We see the
*  hyper loop. He's doing the boring project. He's making tunnels under LA and Vegas. And you're
*  going to be able to shoot through those tunnels going 120 miles an hour. Then he's making rockets
*  that shoot up in the space. Oh, and solar power too. Yeah. Like what? How is one guy's doing all
*  this? What's going on there? Well, that guy's infected by ideas. That guy probably has a huge
*  receptor and ideas have clung on to him. Just like some girls have big tits. Some people have crazy
*  parts of their brain that soaks in ideas. And it's no rhyme or reason to why. But what what they are
*  is an antenna for ideas. Those ideas come up, you're like, Wow, I'm glad I thought of that. And
*  then you go to work on fracking. You got to work on all kinds of different crazy things that
*  change the world forever. Whoever invented Fukushima, right? He's like, I'm figuring out
*  to shut it off when that time comes figured out no one ever does. But that person talked people
*  or that group of people whose ideas all coincided talked people into building a gigantic nuclear
*  furnace that you can never shut off. Yeah. How crazy is that? Ah, that's crazy. It's crazy. We
*  scan the skies for meteor impacts, but we have no way to scan human consciousness for some incoming
*  ideas. Yeah, because some ideas coming in are going to be great. But there's going to be a few
*  that are really bad ideas. Like, you know, Hitler, he had an idea. Yeah, and it was a bad fucking idea.
*  And he implemented terrible idea idea was just floating astral plane, gradually just
*  shooting towards Hitler's fucking brain. That idea is fueled by an ecosystem. And just like
*  you're fueled by nutrients, right? Human beings are fueled by plants and fish and animals and
*  vitamins and all these different things. Well, you're these ideas are fueled. They're fueled by
*  insecurity and ego and lust and greed and jealousy and anger and virtue and love and prosperity and
*  comfort and community and all those different components of human consciousness all interact
*  with this idea. So the idea becomes like it just hitches a ride. It hitches a ride with all these
*  ideas that that already exist in your brain. And then with these pre existing structures, like
*  businesses and warehouses and all these different things that we use to make stuff and then ship it
*  out, then the idea becomes a thing. And then the idea winds up in the belly of a seagull because
*  it looks like a fish. Whoops, sorry, you're dead. You're dead. Seagull you couldn't figure out that
*  that's a bottle cap. Not a fish. And that this is this is how things change. They don't just
*  change because of people were blaming ourselves and it is definitely us that's doing the work.
*  But it's all coming out of ideas. If we thought of ideas as a life force, instead of thinking
*  ideas is like something you own. Yeah, something you hold. But even though you do deserve credit
*  for your ideas, because your discipline to sit down and try to cultivate these ideas accelerates
*  the production of those ideas and exercises the muscle through which those ideas come
*  through focus and energy. So you deserve credit for it. I'm not this is not a socialist way of
*  looking at it. But everybody that has an idea that's really good, till we'll tell you it's like it
*  came out of nowhere. Like every great bit that you've ever had, it's like pop, a light bulb goes off
*  and you have this thought and it comes out of nowhere. Right. That's like most things that you
*  write that are really cool, they kind of come out of nowhere. Yeah, you just sit there and then
*  also you think of things and you write them out. They're like they're an idea that you're wrestling.
*  You just catch them. You just catch them. Well, man, this is this is why I love collaborating
*  with people because the more people you collaborate with, you instead of just using your own brain as
*  the net to catch these ideas. When you have a group of people sharing whatever the intention
*  may be, whether it's to make flesh eating robots or to cure cancer or whatever, then that becomes
*  this amazing solar panel for big ideas. This is to me the weirdest thing about when you're
*  working with a group of people or collaborating with people. If someone's off, you will sink to
*  that level. But when you're around funny people, you get funnier. Yes. When you're around people
*  who can draw, you can draw a little better. It's like something about being in a group. Sure.
*  Share. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, that works that way with martial arts. Really?
*  It works. Yep. It works that way with pool. When you watch people play pool that are really good,
*  you can play better. If you're a player, like you see someone play really good, you realize like
*  things that they do and you see them and you emulate them and then you can do it. We feed off
*  each other in that respect. I think that's a big argument for why the Comedy Store is so good
*  because there's so many great comics there and we all feed off each other. That's right. If you're
*  going on after Jessalynick, you're like, fuck, that guy's so good. That's so funny. It elevates
*  everybody. That's right. If you're there with Delia or Joey or you or Sebastian, like fuck, man.
*  How am I so lucky? Ali Wong and Whitney and Eliza. You're working with some of the best people in the
*  country, the people that are killing it all over the country. Bert and Tom. I keep going on and on.
*  And then they're helping you punch up jokes. Yes. I got off stage. This is one of my favorite
*  memories there. And Jeff Garland and Whitney Cummings are helping me punch up a joke.
*  And I'm sitting, I'm just thinking like, what the fuck? This is like Hogwarts. How am I getting,
*  how are these two people who are brilliantly funny, you know, helping refine some like ridiculous,
*  just dumb jokes. Do you ever still have imposter syndrome? Yeah. Yeah, me too. Everybody does,
*  I think. I'm so glad you admit it, man. That's powerful. Yeah, I don't get it as much anymore,
*  but it still do. I particularly used to get it with famous people. Yeah. I get it. When I was
*  around famous people, I always felt weird, like, oh my God, I'm not supposed to be around these
*  people. They're too famous. They're real famous. I'm just fake famous. Right. You know, it's a weird
*  insecurity that pops up. But I think for you, it's like, you know, when we first became friends,
*  you were the guy who answered the phone at the store. Yeah. And that's really, there's those
*  crazy conversations that you and I had when I would call and give my avails. We would talk to
*  the phone for a fucking hour sometimes about wacky shit. But those sort of, those kinds of
*  interactions that you have with people, they shape, like they shape, they shape what you are.
*  That's right. You know, and the more people that you have in your life that are like that,
*  that are interesting that you like you feed off and you, you can have good ideas. We could,
*  we could engineer a society that's way better, that doesn't have all the pitfalls, but we all
*  have to pull our own weight. It's like, there's, there's a problem in this society where there's,
*  there's siphoning off of money, right? There's massive moving and exchanging of money in some
*  weird way with like banks and mutual funds and all that stuff. It's like, what are you guys doing?
*  Like, what is that? How are you so rich? Like, moving money around? Like they're that's sort of
*  that system, since they run the financial system, that sort of idea of how everything gets
*  distributed is kind of hijacked because they kind of run the system. We all are in the system and
*  we all clearly benefit from the system is the best system we know of. But still, there's some
*  people that are doing some wacky things with the system and they have giant yachts and like,
*  yeah, they own 50 buildings. But if that wasn't the case, if it was a more fair distribution,
*  meaning not, not meaning that you shouldn't be rewarded for your work, but that you can't just
*  kind of hijack money the way bankers can write, you can't just kind of do this. There's so, so,
*  so much weirdness about using money to make money. And that's all you do. You're moving money around.
*  What are you doing? You don't even have a real job. Right? I mean, you have a real job. Like,
*  you're not making a thing, right? You're not writing a thing. You're not, you're not teaching
*  a thing. You're just moving monies around. You decide this company sucks. I'm going to
*  fucking bet on this one. Like, whoa. And those are the people oftentimes that have the most
*  exorbitant amounts of money. That it's not saying that they shouldn't have a lot of money. They've
*  figured something out. I'm saying that the system as it exists, that it would allow someone to make
*  that much fucking money from things is a little crazy. Crazy. It's a little crazy. It's not saying
*  you shouldn't be able to get ahead. I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to kick ass. Not saying you
*  shouldn't be able to acquire an extraordinary amount of wealth. I'm just saying, I don't know
*  if that makes sense to keep that sort of banking system to keep it in place the way it is to keep
*  the stock market in place. What is it? What it's based on confidence. Like, what are they doing?
*  They're moving numbers around. They're buying and selling and things are getting, oh, it's not worth
*  as much anymore because this happened. Oh my God. Sell, sell, sell. A lot of people are shorting it.
*  What are you going to do? I'm going to buy these fucking idiots. They're wrong. Apple's coming back.
*  Yeah. And you're just moving money around. Like, what a wacky way to run an economy. Yeah, man.
*  Bunch of fucking pill heads. Yeah. It's like, why you used to know these fucking kids from high
*  school? That one guy that I delivered newspapers with that went on to become a stock broker. That
*  guy was always doing coke. Really? He was a madman. He was a madman. Well, that would be,
*  I mean, it would probably be fun to be like blasted on blow, like buying stocks, but I would,
*  yeah, I just love the pictures on the stock exchange whenever it's crashing. Who are those
*  fucking dudes? Like it always cuts to like the guy whose tie is kind of pulled down and he's like,
*  dude, who are they? What are they? What is that? I don't know. But until my friend who was a wild
*  man became a stock broker, I didn't think of stock brokers like that. I thought stock brokers
*  were like super nerd genius guys that are figuring things out and counting and selling and paying
*  attention to all the markets and moving. I didn't know they were animals. Like stock market guys are
*  fucking savages. Right. And then the Wolf of Wall Street came along and people are like, what? Well,
*  yeah, that's like my friend. That's my friend. These are the type of people that are like,
*  they have a big impact on the stock market. People like that fucking, that crazy asshole that went
*  to jail. What the fuck's his name? Madoff, Bernie Madoff. People like that guy. Like what the fuck,
*  man? You're just lying to people. You weren't even investing anything. Oh my God. Like those
*  type of crazy assholes. There's so many of those in finance. I mean, there's great people in
*  finance. Don't get me wrong. There's people that follow the rules. There's people that are wonderful
*  human beings that also exist in that chaotic world, but it also attracts a lot of sociopaths.
*  Yeah. Well, that's the, isn't that the idea is that, that like there's the sociopath personality
*  type is going to do better in certain industries. Yeah. Because you're going to be cutthroat. Yeah.
*  You've got to be, yeah. You just have to look at other people as being things you manipulate.
*  Yeah. Dude, man, I feel like a dick. Can I show you this thing from my show?
*  Okay. Cool. I feel like a dick because you know, that was part of the thing. I know, man, but I,
*  you know, plug, you know, that kind of like, yeah, here's a clip in my, yeah, but I'm proud of this
*  fucking thing. We spark up one more time before we see it. Yeah. We should. Yeah. You should have a
*  lighter on your side. Don't you know? Here I have a lighter. Thanks. Joe. I'm not going to touch that.
*  Oh yeah. Right now I just know all the people are like, he's tanned, all this mask. He's already,
*  I know it doesn't work. I've got a beard. It doesn't work anyway. Oh man. Yeah. There's a lot
*  of people out there that will critique your technique and lighting joints. Really? I critique
*  everything. I think I have one of the best joint lighting techniques in the, I think the problem
*  is listening to them. The problem is not them saying it. The problem is if you like tune into
*  all this stuff, the Chappelle's got it right. He doesn't do anything. He's got no, no social
*  meter at all. Man's a genius. You don't want to get contaminated. He's just got it locked
*  into what he's doing. Just constantly doing shows. He was doing shows pretty late up until the
*  cancellation. I did, I forget the last day I did a show. Man. I think it was, I think it was,
*  I don't remember, but by Friday everything was canceled. By Friday we were like, we can't do
*  this. Yeah. I remember talking to you about that, man. I was fucking weird. It was weird.
*  Comedy stores shut down, man. That's like. Yeah. But it had to, it had to. And for everybody that's
*  skeptical, it's really about old folks and folks that are immune compromised. I mean, if you look
*  at Idris Elba on his Twitter page, that guy, first of all, that guy's a stud. I mean, that guy had a
*  lot of respect for that guy because not only is a bad ass actor, but he also had a real Muay Thai
*  fight. He had a real amateur Muay Thai fight. He was training Muay Thai and he got into it as a
*  fucking huge movie star. And it's a real fight. If you watch it, they're really fighting. Really?
*  Yes. Yeah. It's fucking. What movie is this? Not a movie. I don't know what he trained. He trained
*  it probably for, he was in James Bond, right? Wasn't he? He's done a shit ton of movies. He's
*  definitely done movies where he had to fuck people up. So he probably trained martial arts for that,
*  or maybe he just enjoyed doing it, but he really got into Muay Thai and he actually had a fight.
*  And he looked good. He looked good. He looked like a really good amateur, you know, and he fought hard.
*  It was a real battle between him and this other guy. But he has it and he's been doing these videos
*  updating and talking to people on his Twitter and he seems fine. He seems fun, but he's really
*  healthy. He's a robust, healthy, well-kept man. He takes care of himself. Same as a lot of these
*  NBA players that supposedly have it. A lot of them are asymptomatic. We're not worried about them.
*  Old people, we're worried about people that are overweight, people that smoke cigarettes.
*  But this is a wake-up call to a way worse disease. Like if this was the avian flu,
*  if this was something that killed 60% of the people, like, you know, there's an article in
*  the Atlantic about this. I think this is where I found out that the avian flu killed like,
*  it was like 60%. The one that they killed all the chickens in the early 2000s. It was 60%
*  fatality rate. So if you got it, it was more likely to kill you than not kill you.
*  Jesus Christ. Yeah, and they got rid of that one pretty quick. But that kind of one is what we got
*  to be really worried about. This one we have to be worried about for our older folks and our folks
*  that aren't doing well. But it's a good wake-up call. It's good. Look, no one responded perfectly.
*  No one in terms of no cities, no countries, no one did. But everybody got caught off guard.
*  We have to realize everybody got caught off guard. We didn't know. The only way they really know
*  that something like this is going to happen is that it happens and then there has to be a response.
*  So now we're going to get better at figuring out what to do. So my hope is that we get through this
*  and then it makes us a little nicer to each other. And then we also realize, okay, we have to have a
*  plan in place in case a really bad one happens. And we have to figure out what steps can be done
*  to make sure that doesn't happen again. Right. Yeah, man. I mean, this is to that is definitely
*  what I mean, if we needed something like this, I wish it wasn't something that is going to kill
*  a lot of people's grandparents. And I wish it was something a little less, but damn, you're totally
*  right, man, because it's been a long time since we've had to as a planet deal with a problem at
*  this level. And it's teaching us that there is a global civilization. It's teaching us that we are
*  interconnected. And it's definitely inviting us to reprioritize our lives, man, because holy shit.
*  And there's consequences to living in a way that you don't feel are healthy or ethical.
*  Right. Like one of the reasons why they have those ag gag laws, we're not allowed to film factory
*  farms is because people would find it horrific. Right. And that that would be bad for business.
*  Well, that's not how we're supposed to look at it. See, that is that's that's a symptom of
*  terrible thinking. It's supposed to be the opposite way. We're supposed to make it so
*  that it's not horrific to look at. Right. We're supposed to make it so that it's not this terrible
*  thing. Now, that's the difference between doing things that are that feel natural, and doing things
*  that are horrific. And the horrific ones are the ones where all the diseases are coming from.
*  If you think about these farming operations, like, for just like, let's just think about these wet
*  markets. When you got all these animals in the open air piled on top of each other, dead animals
*  laying on a plate, dead animals laying on a table, some laid stretched out on the floor, and you have
*  them all over the place, you're going to have problems. There's going to be air and heat and
*  bacteria is going to mix with each other. And then it creates things. That's what happened with the
*  avian flu that happened in animal agriculture, swine flu, same thing. These fucking flus, these
*  horrible bugs, a lot of them come from animals. So you don't think it was a bio weapon? No, I don't
*  think so. I don't think so. I think the real fear, if you talk to all the experts, the real fear is
*  an actual known thing jumping from animal to human. We talked to one. That's what this is. Yeah, when we were
*  at the CDC, down in Galveston. I'll never forget it. I'll never forget it either. Scariest fucking interview ever of all,
*  not just that show, just of all time, sitting with that, I wish I could remember his name, the guy who
*  ran the head of the place. Didn't we have some crazy flight too? We flew in and we didn't have any
*  sleep. When is something nutty? We missed a flight because we got stoned and we talked at the airport.
*  And we talked for like a fucking hour and a half and then suddenly we're like, oh fuck our flight.
*  That's right. We didn't just miss it by like five minutes either. We missed it by like 20,
*  30 minutes. And we were at the airport. And it was empty at the airport. And we're like, oh fuck man,
*  we have to tape this show tomorrow. You remember? Yeah, so we had a flight, a different flight,
*  and we like barely got an hour's sleep, right? I think one of us might have had some
*  metaphenyl. Oh, that's right. We took that stuff. Yeah, that stuff, if you've never, like new vigil,
*  if you've never had, or provigil or new vigil, I think they're real similar. I don't remember
*  which one I've used. I think provigil is what I used. No, new vigil. That's what I used. Definitely.
*  The new one. And it doesn't, it's not speed, but it definitely gives you energy and it keeps you awake
*  in the weirdest way. But it's like, but you're making an agreement. Like, okay, here's my
*  agreement. I want to stay up. But I promise to get sleep from now on. I'll get sleep the next day.
*  I'm not going to keep using this. There's not something I'm going to keep using and stay up
*  all the time. No, no. Well, that's where you go crazy. But that's, you can use it for that. Like,
*  if you're a real crazy person. Like, I know some people that use that shit for writing. They write
*  on that shit. And they feel like without it, they don't feel like they have any energy. Yeah, man. I
*  mean, that's the trap of all those things. Any kind of anything that's any kind of new tropics
*  going to do that, man. It's like, but also I think some people from the sleep deprivation, that's where
*  they become antennas for the good ideas. You know, they like to get in this like fevered state of not
*  sleeping for days at a time and go literally insane. And somewhere in there, they write really good
*  stuff. That's what the, you know, news radio, the staff at news radio, they used to do that on purpose.
*  Paul Sims, Paul Sims, brilliant guy, the guy who created news radio, and he thought it would be a
*  good idea to have a writing staff fill with a bunch of psychos who were willing to play video
*  games and stay up till four o'clock in the morning every night. It was like this mad vagabond crew of
*  writers that he had assembled. And they would play video games and just talk shit. And then they would
*  start writing at like 2am sometimes. But they would come up with these amazing scripts because
*  scripts were so ridiculous. Some of them were so ridiculous. And it's because they were delirious
*  when they were writing them. They were just instead of doing drugs, they were doing the drug of just
*  staying awake. Dude, this is for me. I've just I'd started doing this about six months ago, maybe a
*  little longer. Waking up at 4am, regardless of when I went to sleep, I was having some insomnia. And
*  so I started I realized like, shit, I'll just like wake up when I wake up. And then
*  waking up 4am, if you have insomnia, that is going to cure your fucking insomnia. Because when
*  nighttime rolls around, you're exhausted. But not only that, 4am is like the great time for
*  writing weird shit. Oh, you're still half asleep. And the stuff you write is it's like, really feels
*  like you're tripping, you know, especially waking up at 4am and then like eating weed. I was doing
*  that. So you do eat weed first and then start writing? Yeah, well, no, my system before the
*  fucking apocalypse was. And again, I wasn't doing this every day. But I did do it for a stretch
*  because I got into David Goggins. Oh shit. The Goggins flu, man. I'm waking up before I gotta go.
*  But 4am, eat weed, go to the gym. And because I was at the gym, because I was at the gym, that's
*  where I'd write. You were there that early? Well, no, because it would open it. I got there once
*  before the gym opened. You must have felt like a savage. No, I didn't, dude, because what happened
*  was I got to the gym and then I did it. I felt pretty fucking cool. But then I went into the car
*  and I had like 30 minutes to blow. And I'm fucking stoned, man. And I'm sitting there, baked. And I'm
*  like, fuck it. I'll just like sit in the car and try to meditate. This is in the parking garage of
*  the goddamn Hollywood Equinox. Now, let me tell you something, man, that area of Hollywood is
*  already fucking weird. But I'm sitting there with my eyes closed, kind of tripping. I feel like I'm
*  half asleep, half awake. I look over. There are two dudes creeping up to my car window, creeping up
*  there. And I'm like, what the fuck? I was sitting in the passenger side. I jumped to the driver's
*  side, started the car. I'm driving through the parking garage, stoned. These two weirdos were
*  definitely walking up to my car. I'm like tripping. I'm like, what the fuck? Fuck, fuck, I'm not going
*  to work out. And so I leave and I'm like, what the fuck? I'm going to let these two like 4 a.m. weird
*  vampires stop me from working out. So I drive back in. One of them's like leaning up against a pillar,
*  like just staring at me. Creepy, dude. These people look like the Lost Boys or something.
*  Well, they're probably preying on the cars of people that go to work out. They're probably
*  looking for a car to break into. Right. And that's what like 4 a.m. people that are out on meth
*  and they know that these assholes like to go to the gym and leave their shit in their car.
*  Right. There you go. There you go. It was terrifying. But, you know, those, that's what you get at 4, 5,
*  4 to 5 a.m. is you get meth heads and you get people who are trying to improve their lives.
*  It's the funniest mix of people. You get people who are like, I'm not going to waste a fucking second.
*  I'm going to get up early. I'm going to exercise. I'm going to write because that's when like,
*  I mean, this is a woo idea. Feel free to light that shit again. But like there's this,
*  there's an idea of prana, which is like energy. And there's more energy in the morning than there
*  is at night. So if you get up at four, you're getting like the purest, most amount of this shit.
*  So that's why a lot of people meditate it really early. Why like a lot of monks get up really early
*  is because like it's a, I don't know, it's just a very, it's the most psychedelic time,
*  way more psychedelic than like midnight. Yeah. It has, you're, you're having,
*  you're exerting some form of control over your life. That especially, right? You're exerting
*  discipline. Like my friend Jaco, he says discipline equals freedom. He gets up every
*  morning at four 30. There you go. And he puts a photo of his watch on Instagram and usually it
*  says go time or something along those lines. Get after it. That's so fucking cool. Every fucking day.
*  It's the best driving. I mean, before the pandemic, when there was still traffic
*  driving around at 4 AM, you're awake, you're half asleep. Also, I think it's easier to work out that
*  early because you're, whatever part of you resist that shit is just like weak. You got to be careful
*  lifting weights in the morning. You really want to warm up because you can injure yourself a little
*  easier sometimes. Yeah. Cause you're sleeping all night and you're kind of stiff. You want to warm
*  everything up, get everything going. They say that people lifting weights, it's not the best idea to
*  lift like your personal record, dead lifts and shit like that. First thing in the morning. It's just,
*  yeah, you got to heat your body up. That makes sense. Your body's more heated up by the end of
*  the day. By the end of the day, you're loose. You've been walking around doing stuff, looking
*  forward to your workout, getting pumped, and then you can go in there and work out. I used to love
*  jujitsu class at 8 30 PM. For me, that was perfect because jujitsu was like at 8 30. It's like, man,
*  I got plenty of energy. I've eaten all day. It's like, I'm not tired yet. Like going to bed tired,
*  but because back then I was going to bed at like two o'clock in the morning every night anyway,
*  but it was like 8 30 was perfect. Done by 10. I'd hit the comedy store, be on stage at 11.
*  That's crazy. I don't like working out at night. I loved it. Loved it. It's great because you have
*  energy, but it's easy to do because you wake up at noon and just fucking stumble out of bed,
*  do whatever bullshit you have to do that day if I have my day off from doing stand up at night.
*  It's easy. Just eat and hang out and then eventually work out. But if you get up in
*  the morning, you get a little bit of a victory. Yeah, a little bit of a victory. Just having
*  accomplished that thing, you've gotten up and then next thing you know, you're doing chin ups.
*  Maybe you're doing chin ups. You don't do any chins? Well, I could do like two. Do two. What I
*  would do, more of what it would be is like me sitting on those nice couches at Equinox
*  riding because like I so don't want to work out. I would procrastinate and that's what I realized
*  is like I do my best riding at the gym. That's hilarious. So do you bring a little notebook?
*  Yeah, I just started bringing my gear there to write and then I would just sit and write and
*  I would spend so much time writing because of that part of you that doesn't want to work out
*  would rather write. It's like when you have to write and you find yourself cleaning,
*  it's that you can like sort of convert your procrastination into something positive. Yeah,
*  that's interesting. Then I would go work out, you know, but I would like I was so when I was
*  doing that, man, I was getting the best ideas. I was just running on the treadmill, stoned at,
*  you know, 530 or whenever the gym opened and I was listening to this like I started listening to
*  that was when I was listening to Goggins. So I'd be blasted listening to Goggins running on the
*  fucking treadmill like, yeah, fuck yeah, I'm gonna do an ultra fucking marathon. How about that? I'm
*  never gonna do ultra marathon. You listen to him too and he's aware that people like me are gonna
*  be hypnotized by him because he's like, don't do what I'm doing. You can kill yourself.
*  Or just exploding. How many people do you think have collapsed at the gym because of David Goggins?
*  I bet like what 30,000 people have just like driven themselves. Yeah, for sure. There's probably a
*  lot of blown out knees out there. Blown out. Fucked up backs, torn biceps. That guy will run with his
*  foot falling off. That book is really good. What's that? It's called Can't
*  Hurt Me. Yeah. Jesus, it's amazing. He like sews his calf muscle back on with twigs and becomes a
*  Navy Seal. He's a badass, man. 100%. That guy could like, if that guy wanted to like burrow into an
*  elephant, he could. He's a good dude too. I like hanging out with him. He must be. I've hung out
*  with him a few times. Gone to dinner a few times. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He went to the fights a
*  couple times. He's a good dude. He's a fun guy. I enjoy him. Me and my friend think he's enlightened.
*  He's something. He's something special. There's a switch that that guy has that we all wish we had
*  where he can power through. But also he's a beacon of inspiration. Like for other people,
*  when David Goggins does the shit that he does and when he has those speeches while he's running,
*  someone was talking to him. It was like 104 degrees outside and he goes, why are you running? He goes,
*  I'll tell you why I'm running because you're not, motherfucker.
*  He goes, that's why I'm running. And he's out there just, I mean, he's constantly doing it.
*  Like he's constantly pushing himself. That's what I love. To me, he's like a servant in that way.
*  He's a servant to the world. He's not just like, he's really giving people,
*  because he's put he posts pictures of himself when he was like sort of fat all the time, man.
*  I'm like, he's showing people like, look, this is the possibility at any moment. You can do this at
*  any moment. And I love that because I know when I see him, he's like running through glass.
*  He's running through swarms of mosquitoes and malarial swamps just to show
*  people, look, it doesn't the part of you that's telling you that you can't do this because of
*  X in your environment is probably wrong. Not all the time, but for sure, man, a lot of the time,
*  wrong. A lot of the time. And that for a lot of us, that's like so powerful. Like I've never,
*  all the self-help books I've listened to, I listened to on audible. That's the best one by
*  far hands down. That's the best one, man. But because it's real, it's not from a guy who really
*  hasn't done anything that's trying to get you motivated to go out there and conquer in life.
*  It's from a guy who's actually done some really fucking crazy shit and is telling you that you
*  can do it too. And that he used to be weak. Yeah, he's doing something right now because
*  Cameron Haynes son Truett is trying to break Goggins 24 hour chin up record. So Goggins was at,
*  he was like, I think it's on Cameron Haynes Instagram page. See if he let put the video on
*  his Instagram page, but he was at some ungodly number of chin ups when they were making the
*  video. He's trying to break that record. He's like, I've been doing chin ups for nine hours straight.
*  Fuck that. He was at like 1500 chin ups or something stupid. Crazy. Yeah. And he still had
*  all those hours to go. So I think it might even be like a two day thing. I don't know how many
*  days they're supposed to be doing this, but it's some, does he have it in there with Goggins?
*  Is there a video of Goggins doing chin ups? I mean, the stories have got, I hope I'm not releasing
*  any information that shouldn't get out. Is this live again? Nope. Oh, there you go.
*  Can't find it. Eh, whatever. Anyway, um, you want to see the show he's doing? I want to
*  love to see your show. So anyway, shout out to, shout out, shout out to Truett.
*  Good luck Truett. Shout out to Goggins. I hope, I hope they battle. Um, all right. This thing,
*  Netflix, I told them it's called the Midnight Gospel. The Midnight Gospel with Duncan Trussell.
*  And Pendleton Ward, the guy who made Adventure Time. It's kind of cool. It comes out 420.
*  Look at that. Netflix. This has never been seen. It's exclusive for your show. They gave us
*  permission. This is Joey Diaz is in this and this is a podcast I did. I'm taking off my glasses.
*  Yeah, I'm gonna take mine off. This is a podcast I did with Damien Echols. Do you know who that is?
*  He was like in the group of kids who got accused of murdering someone in the woods. There's a whole,
*  no. Oh yeah. There's like a whole documentary about him on I think HBO. It's like basically he
*  with this dude, I had him on my podcast. He wrote a book on magic. He practices magic, but
*  Jesus, he was on, he was on death row and they did a DNA test that exonerated,
*  but he was like about to be executed. He's on death row studying Zen Buddhism. Like a Zen priest
*  was working with him to like basically like, you know, prepare him for his death. You know,
*  so he was badly beaten on death row. He was almost executed. Then he was exonerated because
*  of DNA, but we did this interview before the show, obviously, and this is just a way that we figured
*  out to take podcasts and put them in. Hey, once he gets exonerated, did it before we start this,
*  do they have to pay him? I don't know. It's a great question. I think maybe part of it that they
*  may, I'm not, I don't want to say it because I have no idea. I have no idea. I think the guy's on
*  death row. Yeah. I mean, it seems like you owe him something. Well, yeah. He's literally innocent.
*  Yeah, I would say. He's an actual innocent person that you almost killed and then you made their
*  life hell. Yeah. Imagine the torture of knowing you didn't do something, but being accused of
*  that thing. Well, I know, man. Knowing it's going to cost your life and you really didn't do it.
*  Yeah. But let's play it.
*  You know how in certain Buddhist traditions, like say Tibetan Buddhism, they talk about,
*  what's the word they use? Empowerment. Sure. You know, it's like a current of energy that is
*  passed along from master to student. Ceremonial magic is the exact same thing. The Knights Templar
*  started receiving this current whenever they were over there. That's how it makes its way back to
*  Europe. Eventually it makes its way to the United States through the Hermetic Order of the Golden
*  Dawn, which was the order that Crowley was a member of before he, you know, went off to the OTO.
*  You had MacGregor Mathers, Dion Fortune, the poet W.B. Yeats. All of these people were members of
*  the Golden Dawn. That's how this current makes its way to the U.S. One second. Hey, Steve.
*  What the fuck? You need to shine that light in my fucking eyes? If that's how you're going to talk
*  to customers, I'll just take my ship full of cats and find another junk island. A ship full of cats?
*  Ah, shit. My apologies. Look at all these wonderful gifts and gadgets here. We got a fresh printer,
*  time slapper, and some cans. And oh, you want that? A vintage and little.
*  Ugh, it ain't cheap, pal. It's going to be five cats. He's bluffing. I can get it for three. Watch this.
*  Three. Five. Fine, Steve. Four. And that's my last offer. All right. You're taking flakes out of my
*  minnow's mouth, but fine. Four it is. Send them over. That is so Duncan Trussell. That's so bizarre.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, man. It was like, it was the craziest thing working on that show with Pendleton
*  because he's like, like, you know, we throw the word genius around, but the guy's an actual genius.
*  So it was like really, really, really cool to get to do just. So I'm sorry to interrupt you,
*  but it's so it's a combination of your podcast and then some interstitial stuff that like you,
*  that you just like scripted. It's yeah, it's like basically my character is this guy Clancy
*  who lives in a place called the Chromatic Ribbon where people use multiverse simulators to
*  simulate universes so that they go inside and harvest the technology and sell it.
*  And so my character has a malfunctioning used multiverse simulator that isn't really
*  working to produce technology. And because it's malfunctioning, every single
*  world in it is going through some kind of apocalypse. And so my character goes into
*  his simulator and interviews people in the in the dying world. So that's basically the idea of the
*  show. So we took podcast dialogue. It's basically what happens with, you know, during the apocalypse,
*  what's going to happen? People are going to do podcasts. People are going to still have
*  conversations. So these conversations, we just set them in these surreal universes where shit's
*  melting down and, you know, where like Clancy meets these various people and kind of learns
*  from them. What's crazy is you started this a long time ago and it's coming to fruition right when
*  the apocalypse hits. I know, dude. That's the thing. It's like a little on the nose. I mean,
*  you know,
*  it's on the nose. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like, it's almost like,
*  it's almost like you knew. It's almost like you had a time and then the universe was like,
*  this is a perfect time for Duncan shit to come out. Let's, let's coincide it. I mean, look,
*  just look at how bizarre your show is. Yeah. Strange. And then the fact that it's a hybrid
*  of podcast conversations and then written stuff. So strange. Yeah. Perfect time for it. Yeah. You
*  know, I think it is a perfect time for it. And I hope like, cause some of the, like every guest we
*  chose for this, they all had this like really like amazing thing to say, like Echols in this episode,
*  one of the things he says, you know, I asked him like, do you feel like you kind of like were
*  blessed that you ended up in solitary confinement? Cause that's where he woke up.
*  That's where he started meditating. That's where he started studying magic. That's where he started
*  working on himself. Cause there was nothing else to do. Right. And in this one, he's, he says like,
*  I feel luckier than some millennials out there right now who are like completely disconnected.
*  Cause that's the coolest thing about him is you would expect a person who'd been on death row
*  to be bitter. He's the sweetest, most genuine, wonderful person ever. And it's like whatever
*  went on in the situation of being on the brink of the abyss where he's about to get
*  murdered by the state for something he didn't do. Something about that didn't turn him into
*  someone who was like shell shocked or angry, but like really turned him into like someone very
*  compassionate and I guess grateful for his life, you know, and that to me, like it's like,
*  he's like the Goggins of death row. I mean, if you can be not bitter after being on death row
*  for something you didn't do and like getting physically assaulted, you know, just wondering
*  every day, if you were going to die, if like, you can still maintain an attitude of service or
*  contribution to society in some way or another, then any of us can, any of us can, you know,
*  like any of us can. And to me, that's like, I think that's, I hope some of that stuff trickles
*  out from the show into the world right now, especially man, right now, especially when you
*  say he studies magic, what do you mean by that? So, well, he wrote a great book called High Magic,
*  which is, I think that's what it's called. It's a fantastic book on magic is really the wrong word
*  for it. There's an entire like mythos or religion that got sort of wiped out by,
*  Terrence McKenna talks about it a lot. It got kind of wiped out by,
*  I guess, you know, superstition. So, witchcraft, as we understand it now, because of Hollywood is
*  like, you know, ladies riding around on brooms and shit, but it just used to be midwifery,
*  used to be like healing women who would like deliver babies and stuff. But these were all
*  connected to, they all had pagan roots. And so essentially you can follow back this branch of
*  data that some people say started in Sumeria or Egypt, ways of meditating, ways of connecting
*  with the universe that are ritualistic in nature, but seem mysterious to us because even though,
*  if you want to see what it looks like, just look at a Catholic mass, you're looking at a ceremony.
*  It's theurgy, I guess you'd call it. That is a magical ceremony where bread gets converted
*  into the flesh of a god that you eat. So that's your watch. They're all wearing robes. They're
*  burning incense. So that is magic. That's what ceremonial magic looks like. It's non-different
*  from ceremonial magic. Someone in the Catholic Church might tell you this isn't magic. This is
*  me praying to the infinite and asking for forgiveness. That's magic. You're connecting
*  with a divine intelligence. You're hoping from your connection with the divine intelligence to
*  produce some change in your own psychology, in your own life, and maybe create good fortune or
*  whatever it is you're praying for, healing, whatever it may be, that's magic. So magic
*  is that. I'm not saying the Catholic Catholicism wouldn't necessarily be considered
*  a branch of magic. One of the things he said in this interview is like if the Bible is one of the
*  most powerful magical grimoires there is, I mean you read that shit, if you really look in it,
*  there's all kinds of bizarre stuff that doesn't seem to make it onto Christian radio.
*  Like what? Well like when in the book of Genesis, why do they refer to themselves as a plurality?
*  When God's talking, it's not like when they're saying like why do we throw Adam and Eve out of
*  the garden? It's we. If we don't do something about this, they will become like us. We. There's a
*  plurality that's being mentioned there. And so what is that plurality? So throughout the Bible,
*  there's mentions of angels. The book of Ezekiel, the famous one that ufologists go to,
*  there's all these contacts with angels, hyperdimensional beings that have some data
*  set they want to bring to the world. Quite often, depending on what book you're in,
*  it's some terrifying prophecy about the end of the world that's coming.
*  But sometimes it's some message of hope or some message of healing. So you could say magic is a
*  non-Christian oriented method for connecting with those various entities using ritual. That's one
*  branch of it. Now I'm not saying by the way these beings exist or don't exist, but you could say if
*  you wanted to get like psychological, you could say we have buried inside of us
*  archetypes, bits of the collective that are buried deep inside of us and that there are ways to
*  connect to these little fragments of the collective mind. And many people know, have their own method
*  for doing that. One of the methods to do that might be doing a ritual and for a moment allowing
*  yourself to imagine that you're trying to talk to an extradimensional being. Alastair Crowley famously
*  did one of these rituals and contacted a god, what was that? I can't remember what the being was called,
*  but it looks like a gray alien. This is before people were talking about gray aliens.
*  Will you look that up? Did he draw it? He drew it. There's a drawing of it. Yeah, and it looks like a gray alien.
*  What year was this? It's like the 1800s. Alastair Crowley was in the 1800s? Yeah,
*  18-1900s. When you keep pulling at your ghillie suit, you remind me of a drunk overweight girl
*  with large breasts that keeps adjusting her halter top like you're in Florida outside drinking at some
*  motel. I told that motherfucker, I'm going to leave you. I'm going to leave you, Clarence. I'm tired of y'all
*  bullshit. I told them with a cigarette in their hand, wow, look at that drawing by Alastair Crowley.
*  That does look like a gray alien. Yeah, man. That's what we're going to look like, man. Let's cut the
*  shit. That's what we're going to look like. When you see people that are hairy and broodish,
*  we think of them as being closer to prehistoric man. We see a guy covered in hair. He looks more
*  like a beast. When we see people that are thinner and more slender, they become more a gentle version
*  of people. We associate that oftentimes with intelligence. We directly associate intelligence
*  with frailty. We all do that. When you see some super genius guy, usually they're frail. Occasionally
*  they're badasses, but there's a lot of those super genius guys that couldn't fight their way out of a
*  wet paper bag. Well, Hawking's the ultimate example because his body literally failed him
*  while he was coming up with his greatest discoveries. This is our future. We're going to
*  have big heads. They're going to fucking crisper your way into a head that lets you live in any
*  dimension you want at any time. You transport yourself from one planet to the other. Imagine
*  what we've done with our stupid monkey brains. Now imagine it was 150% larger, 150% more brain,
*  and then incorporated all sorts of fucking electronics that lets you interface with space
*  time around you and all kinds of other wacky ways of communicating. We couldn't even possibly
*  imagine now just like people from the 1800s couldn't have ever possibly imagined cell phones.
*  Right. This is the idea. It's like, okay, we're going to go there. When we get there,
*  the way we understand space time is going to be different than the way we understand it now.
*  What that means is theoretically you could connect or communicate with a being that is outside of
*  space time, which is a future version of us right now using various methods, DMT being one of the
*  big ones on the planet right now, but also using other methods that are a little bit more precise.
*  Because with DMT, it's kind of like you're not really putting in GPS coordinates necessarily.
*  Some people do it with intention. A shaman will do it with intention and can like,
*  excuse me. Can you give me another Bloody Mary? I told you Clarence, I'll fucking leave you.
*  Cigarette in your hand, flip flops on. I will fucking leave you. Clarence, if you keep summoning
*  these demons, I am out of here. Clarence is over there with Miller like, you ain't going nowhere.
*  Just stop. Just fucking stop. You always do this. She gets drunk. She says she's leaving.
*  I'm a fucking leave you. I'm out of here, Clarence. Clarence, I'm going to fucking leave you,
*  son of a bitch. I'm putting on my ghillie suit and going down to Tampa. You son of a bitch.
*  I'm going to visit my family in Clearwater. I'm out of here, Clarence. It's over. Anyway,
*  yeah, maybe you can connect through time and space to these things that are already here.
*  Like our understanding of time and space, we're locked in, man. But like, so magic is like
*  ridiculous on one level as it absolutely sounds and is on one level. On another level is at the
*  very least a creative technique so that you can sort of summon a dream state while you're awake
*  with the intent of causing some change in the world around you using, for a lot of people,
*  what would be considered a non-standard way. Well, just in terms of your perception of how
*  you view the world, you can alter that pretty radically. I mean, from someone who has an
*  amazingly positive perception versus someone who has an amazingly negative perception,
*  you look at the results. Overwhelming benefit of being a positive person. There's something
*  to thoughts and ideas that propel you in a good way and for having a good architecture,
*  having a good philosophy, having a good operating manual for how you view the world and how you act
*  and behave. Part of that's you getting up at four o'clock in the morning. That's what that is. You're
*  enforcing your ability to sort of dictate the positive aspects of your future. You're deciding
*  to take action. You're strengthening your bond with the way you interface with current reality.
*  What happened? Why'd it stop?
*  What the fuck? Oh, Christmas.
*  Goddamn it.
*  Listen, man, if you want to meet me here, I'll meet you here. We could do some 5A intercessions.
*  I'd love that, man.
*  Let's do it.
*  I mean, yeah, I would love that.
*  Let's do it. I'm 100% down.
*  Come down here. We'll get pump. We'll put Slayer on and fucking rock out.
*  I'm down. What else do we have to do?
*  What else do we have to do? It'd be a great thing. Look, I'll tell you one thing, though.
*  I am enjoying not going out. I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying being home most of the day other than
*  the days I do podcasts, but not doing shows at night gives you so much more energy. Oh my God.
*  It's crazy. Can you feel rested? Feel good.
*  I fucking love it, man. I get to be with my son more. It's like really nice.
*  The place we just moved into, whoever lived there before us had a flourishing garden.
*  So I've just been going out back, pulling spinach out of the ground.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I know, man.
*  It's so good.
*  They left you food.
*  They left us food.
*  That's pretty dope.
*  That's such a smart thing if you have a yard.
*  I get mad at myself for not having a garden.
*  I don't have a garden right now. I've had one in the past, but I don't have a garden right now.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's like especially now we should realize like man, you should have food in a freezer
*  somewhere and you should have a garden.
*  That's right. And a gun.
*  I got some elk for you.
*  Do you really?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Man, the trestles would be very grateful for some elk.
*  I bought a box of these insulated freezer bags for people too.
*  Dude, thank you.
*  Yeah, that's a nice aspect of being a hunter because you get hundreds of pounds of meat
*  from one animal.
*  So you can share that with a lot of people.
*  It's really it's it makes me feel real good that I'm giving some to people.
*  Then they send me pictures of cooked food.
*  I'm like Tom Papa just sent me this picture.
*  Really?
*  This roast that he cooked.
*  Yeah. He's an elk fiend now.
*  Tom Papa eats a shitload of elk.
*  I don't think I've ever had elk.
*  You'd love it.
*  It's delicious.
*  I'm going to give you a bunch of different kinds, but the sausage is the easiest to make.
*  Cool.
*  So easy.
*  You just pan fry it.
*  You can do it in butter.
*  I prefer to do it in beef tallow.
*  I just sear it in beef tallow.
*  My favorite way to do it is I get to get it to like a medium medium temperature and then
*  I put tomato sauce in with it and let it simmer in the tomato sauce.
*  Man, you're the best.
*  That's going to be so cool for my kid to have apocalyptic Rogan elk.
*  That's going to be the best to bring back elk during a pandemic to your family.
*  Well, that's an I mean, that's an elk that died from a shot from a bow and arrow.
*  You know, I mean, that's a there's something about that to me.
*  There's more power to the meat.
*  It's like not more power in that.
*  It's like a powerful thing.
*  More power in that.
*  Like I know what that animal was.
*  That animal is a wild beast evading predators and me, a stupid, doughy human being managed
*  to sneak into range where I could hit it and kill it in one shot with a bow and arrow.
*  I even have a video of it that my friend Cam Haynes took.
*  So I have this animal that dropped and then we took it apart and butchered it.
*  And now I eat it.
*  When I eat it, I think of what that animal was.
*  That animal lived a majestic life.
*  And if I didn't take it out, it would have gotten taken out by mountain lions or bears
*  or it would have froze to death in the winter.
*  Sometimes that happens.
*  Their teeth get ground down.
*  And there was an older male too, which is what you want to get because those are the
*  ones that have passed their DNA down.
*  So there's a story to that meat and there's a connection to that meat.
*  And there's no risk from that meat.
*  When you're thinking about the risk to society of these kind of diseases that happen through
*  agriculture, I think one of the reasons why that is is because it's not natural ever for
*  animals to be stuffed together like that.
*  So when it is, nature is just like, fuck you for breaking the rules.
*  And then these viruses start spreading.
*  It's almost like that's what it is for being unnatural because those kind of diseases
*  don't exist that much in animals in nature.
*  They do sometimes like brucellosis, like some buffalo have brucellosis.
*  It's a bad disease that cattle can get.
*  And then it can infect the cattle and sometimes elk have it too.
*  Like there's a few diseases, like animals always have diseases, but it seems like those
*  ones that jump to people, the vast majority of them have come from us treating animals
*  in a very unnatural way.
*  That's true.
*  But dude, I don't mean to get all conspiratorial here, but isn't it a little weird that Wuhan
*  is where that virology laboratory was?
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like, I don't know.
*  To me, they're just weird.
*  But it's also weird that there's bats laying on the floor there.
*  Good point.
*  That's weird too.
*  And we know for a fact that diseases jump from, they're tracing these things.
*  This is what's fucked up.
*  Michael Osterholm, who was on, he's an expert in infectious diseases and viruses and stuff
*  like that, he was explaining to us how they know certain diseases are morphing and they're
*  changing.
*  They become more and more human-like.
*  And they were talking about this, actually this one that deer get, that's called CWD.
*  And it's called chronic wasting disease.
*  And they first discovered it.
*  My friend Doug Durin sent me a synopsis of when they first discovered it.
*  But I believe it existed in like the 1980s is when they first started seeing it in animals.
*  But it was like a mule deer here, an animal there.
*  But now it's infected like a giant population of deer in the Midwest.
*  And they don't really have a cure for it.
*  It's fatal 100% of the time.
*  And it hasn't made the jump to people, but it could.
*  And they're scared.
*  And Michael Osterholm was saying this.
*  Basically, these things are morphing all the time.
*  They're becoming more and more human-like.
*  They're becoming more and more like something that can invade the human host.
*  See that?
*  Bro!
*  That's terrifying.
*  Terrifying.
*  Terrifying.
*  And I think there's a battle constantly going on between these things that hog up too much
*  resources and take up too much of a population slice like humans.
*  We're on every goddamn rock everywhere.
*  And nature tries to throw curveballs at you.
*  I mean, that's what nature does.
*  Nature's like, what are you doing?
*  You living in your own shit?
*  Oh, great.
*  Here's the plague.
*  That's what's happened throughout history with poor sanitation or whether it was animal
*  agriculture, whatever the fuck it is.
*  People have caught weird diseases throughout time, whether it's different animals that
*  can bite you and give you Ebola, that kind of shit.
*  These weird diseases have existed forever.
*  And they're basically the same as like viral panthers.
*  What's a panther?
*  A panther's got to make sure there's not too many deer.
*  Panther is the fucking cleanup crew because if it wasn't for that, there would be fucking
*  deer everywhere.
*  You're from North Carolina.
*  You know what it's like in the country.
*  It's crazy sometimes because North Carolina doesn't have any mountain mines.
*  North Carolina doesn't have any wolves.
*  So maybe they have a little bit of wolves, but not a lot.
*  Right?
*  They got some bears and they got a lot of deer fucking everywhere.
*  New York State, they have a terrible situation with deer in Long Island.
*  There's parts of Long Island that were infested with deer.
*  And they're like, what are we doing?
*  We can't just shoot them.
*  Just going to go out and shoot.
*  They're trying to give them birth control.
*  They're thinking about giving deers birth control.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yes, because there's no animals out there to eat them.
*  So they just keep fucking.
*  They just keep fucking and overpopulating.
*  Did you read the stand?
*  Yes, I did.
*  Remember that seat?
*  That was one of the things he talks about is how as they're going down the highway,
*  they would hit like herds of deer so thick.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  It would like block the highway because they were like starting to overpopulate
*  because there is no one there to like call the herd.
*  Dude, I had a gig once when I was living in New York and it was in Western Massachusetts.
*  So Western Massachusetts, if you are in New York where I was in New Rochelle,
*  you could get there in a few hours, like two and a half, three hours or something like that.
*  You get to where this area is and where the fucking gig was was so infested with deer.
*  I've never seen anything like it in my life.
*  You're driving down the street and it was probably it was hot out.
*  So it's probably the summer.
*  So I was driving down the street and these things are just jumping in front of the car
*  left and right.
*  I was like, this is nuts.
*  Coming home on the highway was terrifying.
*  I had to go 30 miles an hour on the highway just with my foot hovering,
*  just ready to stomp on the brakes because these motherfuckers were just running in front of the
*  highway.
*  I saw a hundred of them.
*  I saw them all over the place.
*  I might have seen 200 of them driving home everywhere.
*  You look, there was fucking deer.
*  Why?
*  Because there's no predators.
*  It's an imbalance and eventually something's going to happen.
*  And one of the things that has happened is Lyme disease.
*  These fucking deer have spread this terrible disease to so many people out there through the ticks.
*  The ticks have jumped from the deer because there's so many of them.
*  There's fucking ticks everywhere because they're well fed.
*  And like some ungodly percentage of these ticks have fucking Lyme disease.
*  And they jump on people and they give it to people and the people get sick.
*  And then the people have to have a reaction to these deer.
*  So they want to go out and slaughter the deer.
*  It's almost like nature is trying to balance itself out.
*  For us, the goddamn COVID-19 is the worst thing that's happened to people in their lifetime in
*  the sense like the shit we're experiencing right now is completely unique.
*  For COVID-19, I guess it's the equivalent of humans colonizing another planet.
*  That fucking virus, just like what it did is for, it's amazing.
*  It finally made its way out of one biome into another.
*  It pulled it off.
*  Whoever was down there mutating, somebody had the great idea to do whatever they did.
*  I guess it's like to create a way to connect to those two receptors.
*  What's it called?
*  It's like it connects to these two.
*  Anyway, I don't know.
*  I wouldn't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
*  That's okay.
*  It's like, but it like, what it did is so spectacular for the virus.
*  What's a catastrophe for humans?
*  It's glory for the COVID-19 superorganism that's now sweeping through the human biome.
*  You know what else it did that's really interesting?
*  It made it so that it doesn't give you any symptoms and you're still contagious for days.
*  The worst case scenario.
*  So you can just keep spreading it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was reading a friend sent me an email from Aspen where apparently there's one Australian
*  tourist, a bunch of Australian tourists had it, but one guy refused to quarantine and
*  he went skiing and went to restaurants, rode the bus and like, it's like a movie.
*  But it's a movie, right?
*  That's what happens in a movie.
*  There's this new thing going around and this guy's like, fuck that.
*  I'm here to ski.
*  He's like, I'm here to ski.
*  I'm going to eat.
*  I'm going to a restaurant.
*  I'm riding the bus.
*  Wow.
*  What a dick.
*  But that's in the movie.
*  That's what happens, right?
*  There's a guy who's in the lab and they're like, you have to be quarantined in the lab.
*  And the guy's like, fuck this.
*  I'm going outside and he has a cigarette and then something bites him and runs off.
*  And then that thing carries it in its teeth and bites him a person.
*  And the next thing it spreads to people and bugs.
*  And next thing you know, it's a fucking epidemic and it goes through this
*  and then turns everybody into zombies.
*  Yeah.
*  That's 28 days later, right?
*  Was it a monkey?
*  They were working on some sort of a disease and the monkey got out.
*  PETA.
*  Rage.
*  There was like some, it was a animal rights group trying to free monkeys that had an
*  experimental shit had been pumped into them and the monkeys like attacked the people trying
*  to save them.
*  And those people instantly turned into zombies and spread through the planet.
*  Well, I was reading about this mountain lion that tried to attack this.
*  I think it was a police officer.
*  It was someone, I forget who, but the cops had to wind up shooting the mountain lion.
*  But the mountain lion had rabies.
*  And now how crazy is rabies?
*  Rabies tricks you into biting people to give them rabies.
*  Like raccoons, raccoons are usually terrified of people.
*  They'll just run up on you and they got rabies, squirrels, rats, all sorts of things.
*  They're not scared of you at all.
*  They'll just fucking jack you if they have rabies.
*  They come after you and you're like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Well, that thing is trying to give you its disease.
*  It's a zombie movie.
*  And if you don't go to a doctor, if you go to a doctor, they can fix it.
*  But if you don't go to a doctor, rabies is fatal.
*  It's just straight up fatal.
*  There's like one person ever that survived from rabies and he probably wishes he didn't.
*  Why?
*  It's probably horrific.
*  Probably.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I don't even know.
*  Does it cause permanent like neurological damage?
*  But there's very few cases of people surviving.
*  It's more than 99% fatal.
*  Rabies is a terrible disease to die from apparently too.
*  Oh, it looks fucking awful, man.
*  But there's a lot of animals that have it and they want to bite you.
*  That's so crazy.
*  It makes normally animals that are afraid of people.
*  It makes them aggressive to people.
*  Well, I mean, dude, did you read that thing about that guy who knew he had AIDS and was
*  infecting people on purpose?
*  He was like getting off on giving people AIDS.
*  You wonder how much of that was his decision and how much of it was some dark mutation where it started.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, because think of like, OK.
*  It's trying to spread.
*  I know you do this.
*  I do it.
*  I try not to do it as much.
*  But the spreading of bad news like you hear some bad thing that just happened.
*  This person died.
*  This catastrophe happened.
*  You get on the phone and call someone like, hey, did you hear?
*  And there's this weird rush in like spreading the bad news.
*  You're kind of getting off on it.
*  So in the same way your idea swarm concept, it's the same thing with bad news.
*  You become a carrier for the darkness.
*  And so you call it now.
*  I'm not saying don't tell people when awful shit's going on.
*  But sometimes I notice I'll go through periods where all I'm doing is telling people about shit they should be afraid of.
*  You know, spreading.
*  And usually the way you do it is through some story about what's happening in the world.
*  That's really a form of contagion.
*  You know, and then that spreads and spreads and spreads and spreads.
*  And then everyone's freaked the fuck out.
*  And who knows, man, maybe that creates the condition of sleepiness or sleepwalking that we need for these viruses to appear.
*  You know, I wonder what it is that's so attractive to us about breaking the news.
*  I don't know.
*  Did you hear who died?
*  I used to hear what happened in India when Michael Jackson died.
*  I made a point of every single one who called me.
*  You didn't tell them.
*  No.
*  And they're like, do you hear?
*  I'm like, no, what?
*  Just to get them off, to let them have the moment of like, I hadn't heard yet.
*  Like, holy shit, really?
*  That's hilarious.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  No, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
*  You're joking, right?
*  Because it's like, you know, for them, I don't know what that feeling is.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Do it the next time some awful thing happens, like give your friends the satisfaction.
*  People are going to know now.
*  They're going to hear this podcast.
*  I used your trick.
*  It's true, though, man.
*  What is the rush of telling people?
*  I don't know.
*  It's probably built into us, right?
*  Because it's like a survival thing.
*  Like if you were in a community and you knew a fire was coming, you didn't want to tell people.
*  So there's probably some reward mechanism.
*  The worst is when someone told you, but you forgot they told you.
*  So you try to tell them and they're like, I told you.
*  You shitty listener.
*  I broke the news to you.
*  My wife does that to me all the time.
*  She's like, I told you, dummy.
*  I'm like, oh no.
*  I hate that feeling.
*  That's the worst.
*  When you get caught not listening.
*  You're like, yeah, I knew.
*  I was just saying it again.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You tried to do some pathetic escape from your lack of failure.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I didn't really fail.
*  I did it to myself.
*  No, I knew exactly.
*  I remember what you were saying.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I'm just talking out loud.
*  That's the worst.
*  My wife has done that, actually, where she's like, wait, well, what did I just say?
*  And you're like, you were talking about the baby.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When people are around each other all the time, they learn how to filter each other out.
*  You need your alone space, and sometimes you get it while you're still there.
*  You get it while you're still there by zoning out.
*  You just got to be present more than you are doing that.
*  That's right.
*  That seems to be the key.
*  You got to zone, man.
*  It's OK to zone.
*  Don't get into some ridiculous, definitely don't beat yourself up for zoning.
*  No.
*  Well, especially as a creative person, I think zoning, spacing out sometimes, and just being bored
*  sometimes are where the best ideas come from.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you can sit around and think about things.
*  Today, we're never bored.
*  This is a common complaint about people when they're talking about one of the consequences,
*  unintended consequences of social media addiction, is that you're never bored.
*  And that being bored is actually probably not a bad thing because it fills your head up with ideas.
*  You start thinking about things, and occasionally you're thinking about things that are good,
*  that you might not have thought of if you're just staring at people's butts on Instagram.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Boredom.
*  Well, that's like the guy I work with you with meditation, this guy, David Nicktern.
*  He teaches me about boredom.
*  It's a Buddhist concept, hot boredom and cool boredom.
*  There's two types of boredom.
*  One of them is where you're like, man, that's like the addictive boredom,
*  where you're like, I'm going to get out.
*  I'm bored.
*  But there's this sense of like, ah, the other type of boredom, cool boredom.
*  That's more like what you're talking about, which is like just being OK where you're at
*  in the moment, but admitting to yourself, this is boring.
*  That's one of the things.
*  It's boring.
*  I'm bored right now.
*  YouTube videos are more fun.
*  I'm going to go see something crazy on YouTube.
*  I see a car chase.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fucking do you ever like go to your phone when you wake up at night?
*  Do you do that?
*  Is that your go to?
*  Like when I wake up at night, you ever wake up at night?
*  I do.
*  And I try to go back to sleep.
*  I never just stay up.
*  I just go back to sleep.
*  See, that's what I mean.
*  I got to stop doing it because I'll wake up and the first thing I do,
*  reach over for the phone, start looking at it, waiting to get sleepy again.
*  Doesn't make you sleepy.
*  It wakes you up.
*  It wakes you up.
*  That's not good.
*  It stimulates that area of your brain that gets lit up by electronics.
*  Beep beep beep beep.
*  It's so exciting and stimulating.
*  Next thing you know, you're awake.
*  I do the smoke pot thing too and then write, but sometimes I do the smoke pot and workout thing
*  and then it becomes the smoke pot and write things because the rush right after you get high
*  is like those are where the best ideas come from.
*  And like I feel like you got to grab those fuckers while you have them.
*  And if it means postponing your workout for an hour,
*  that's actually the smart thing to do.
*  The dumb thing to do to go through the workout first, especially if you got high,
*  because those ideas, they're coming hard and fast for the first part of the high
*  and you probably won't get them like that for the rest of the high.
*  While you go from being straight sober to the big rush that you get in the beginning,
*  that's when all my best ideas come from, is the big rush, which is like an hour
*  from getting high to an hour later.
*  That's the big rush.
*  That's when I feel like I get the most like where the fuck did that come from ideas?
*  Yeah.
*  And the best writing.
*  Like when I write things, it's like the cleanest, filled with the most gems.
*  There's more stuff in it.
*  And then the other stuff is like editing it and putting it apart and taking it apart.
*  But if you don't capitalize on that rush, I feel like you only get one of those a day.
*  One big, especially like if you're sober and then you get high,
*  that one first high rush of the day, that's not, doesn't last that long.
*  And if you keep staying high, I don't think it's the same.
*  I think staying high, you sort of settle in, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But the rush of just getting high is like, wah, wah, so many ideas.
*  If you wasted that by doing chin-ups, you're an asshole.
*  Just go right, right?
*  And then lift afterwards.
*  Yeah, for sure, man.
*  I mean, this is, yeah, you've got to harvest when the wheat is growing,
*  you've got to harvest.
*  You can't just, but it's easy to trick yourself into thinking,
*  oh, no, I've got to stick to my fucking workout or whatever the thing is.
*  It's not just working out.
*  It's like, whatever.
*  I think it's important to prioritize those moments.
*  I mean, especially if you're going with your, like with what a lot of people say,
*  which is this, the antenna idea, you're a receiver, you're picking up signals.
*  You're like SETI, but not for aliens, for ideas.
*  And these search for extraterrestrial ideas, that's what you are.
*  You're a satellite for that.
*  And if you start getting, I mean, imagine SETI.
*  Imagine someone at SETI doing chin-ups and suddenly they get like
*  some signal from a far star system.
*  And he's like, I'm going to finish my workout before I check out whether or not
*  we're getting contacted by aliens.
*  That's an asshole.
*  If you're, because the real question is, where do your ideas come from?
*  Exactly.
*  And if you're picking up whatever these creatures are and you've been blessed
*  enough to get them, yeah, you should write them down.
*  You got to write them down.
*  It's kind of like, I mean, not, I don't like-
*  You got to honor them.
*  Honor them.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  You got to act on them.
*  I mean, that's why people that think of the muse, like the concept of the muse,
*  that's one of the more, it's a productive way to think of it.
*  Like Pressfield writes about it and Pressfield in the War of Art,
*  and he's, you know, he's a very down to earth.
*  He's not a, he's not a silly man.
*  He's a very down to earth person, but his perspective on the concept of the muse,
*  it's very beneficial if you follow it.
*  Because his perspective is essentially that you pay honor to this thing.
*  You show up and you do the work like a professional,
*  and then it responds in turn.
*  It comes to you.
*  Yeah.
*  And then these are what, it's like, we think of an idea,
*  even though it's one of the most important factors
*  in the entire construction of civilization,
*  but somehow or another, we don't think of it as that.
*  We think of people being that.
*  And we are, but we're being used by ideas.
*  I know that sounds crazy.
*  I really do.
*  I know it sounds dumb too, but you are,
*  you're coming up with these thoughts and we're thinking of them as like
*  random connections that you're making in your brain, which might be.
*  It might be that, but it also might be that ideas are like a life form
*  from another dimension that's trying to manifest itself in our current realm.
*  And they do so through getting into people's heads.
*  And the more you call for them, the more they're there for you.
*  And the more you show up, and you can call that the muse.
*  You can call that whatever you want.
*  Angels.
*  Tesla believed it.
*  Tesla believed some, he was getting signals from some other,
*  some other, some other planet or some other life forms.
*  He had some weird shit that he wrote that's hard to decipher
*  about what he see if he can find that.
*  Cause that's a very interesting thing, Jamie.
*  See if you can find what did Tesla like Tesla had a take on
*  receiving information from other galaxies.
*  He had this take on where I, some, some of his inventions were coming from.
*  It's like, what are some, some of the transmissions that he would receive.
*  I mean, God damn it.
*  Wouldn't it have been amazing to talk to that guy?
*  Yes.
*  Imagine having Nikola Tesla on the podcast.
*  Oh, oh, who knows?
*  Man, maybe you still can one day.
*  Maybe we can bring them back.
*  Yeah. Bring them back or like create an AI Tesla.
*  I think a lot of people have that feeling and some of them just don't
*  come out of the closet, so to speak with it because they're afraid they're going to get
*  judged or ostracized.
*  I think a lot of people feel like they have a direct contact with some kind of
*  sentience that isn't embodied inside of them.
*  And it's giving them ideas and they're just terrified to put it out to the world
*  because it sounds like you're fucking nuts.
*  His claims of receiving signals from outer space were proven right a century later.
*  Ooh, during the summer of 1899, Tesla set up a field laboratory in Colorado Springs,
*  Colorado to pass to the possibilities of using high altitude stations to transmit
*  information and electric power over long distances.
*  One July.
*  This is not what I'm talking about.
*  This is about the signals, not like him getting.
*  I went too quickly on that.
*  Oh, OK. Where is the signals?
*  This is like radio signals.
*  Oh, that he was getting radio signals from other planets.
*  After the ruling out, I think this is about sending.
*  After ruling out solar and terrestrial causes, he concluded the signals must be from
*  another planet.
*  He had a seizure and had a vision, which is what like that's a.
*  Yeah, here it says on one July day while tracking lightning storms.
*  Oh, so is his actually equipment.
*  His equipment picked up a series of beeps.
*  After ruling out solar and terrestrial causes, he concluded the signals must be from
*  another planet.
*  The following Christmas in response to the American Red Cross's request for a prediction
*  of the greatest scientific achievement of the coming century, Tesla wrote Brethren,
*  we have a message from another world unknown and remote.
*  It really it reads one, two, three.
*  In 1996, scientists published published a study replicating Tesla's experiment and
*  showing that the signal was in fact caused by the moon low passing through Jupiter's
*  magnetic field.
*  Holy fuck.
*  He was picking up a moon passing through Jupiter's magnetic field.
*  Yeah, but he had woo ideas to him.
*  Oh, yeah, he was in love with the pigeon.
*  He's in love with a pigeon.
*  Not just that, though, he like I think he did think he was in contact with like some
*  kind of sentient intelligence for sure.
*  Why not?
*  Why wouldn't you think if you're that smart?
*  Imagine how smart he was in comparison to like a regular dope.
*  Hey, mister, you want to buy a paper?
*  You know, those people from back then, some fucking dude selling papers in the corner
*  and then the greatest genius the world's ever known up to that point.
*  Wandering around trying to figure out how to send electricity through the sky.
*  Maybe that's all intelligence is though, man.
*  It's like having the willingness to let yourself go crazy enough to believe you're not the
*  creator of your ideas to believe that you're an antenna.
*  Maybe that's what makes a person intelligent.
*  Maybe that's all it takes that and discipline.
*  Well, yeah, the discipline to learn all the things that you need to know to be able to
*  study and actually implement that technology.
*  It's like Tesla was both things.
*  He was a genius and he was probably some sort of a visionary in that way.
*  Like he had like Elon has.
*  He had an extra large magnet for ideas.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, I think anyone can do that.
*  How strong is this weed?
*  Fucking strong, man.
*  I'm so glad anytime you give me weed, I always forget how strong it is.
*  And every time I'm like, man, you got to be careful.
*  We go high grade up in this pitch, son.
*  It's important to go high grade.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  What do you think is what do you think is going to happen to us?
*  Do you think we're going to get through this in relatively short order or do you think
*  this is going to take five, six months?
*  How long is this going to take?
*  God damn, these lockdowns are crazy.
*  I can haunt you.
*  San Francisco, the lockdown is crazy.
*  Three weeks, 24 hours, stay off the streets, don't go to work.
*  Yeah, man, I think we're probably going to like listen, if you go, if you want to hear
*  my like just instinct, which is definitely going to be wrong, I think it's going to go.
*  It's going to get better much faster than we expect.
*  I don't know why I think that.
*  I have no reason to think that if you go by what they're saying, we're looking at like
*  months and months and months.
*  I guess like if I have to choose between listening to my own stoned intuition regarding stuff
*  which fits into my desires, which is I want it to blow over because I don't want people
*  to get sick.
*  I don't want to live in the apocalypse.
*  I have a son.
*  I don't want to run out of food.
*  I don't want things to get back to normal.
*  I want to go around people.
*  But if you look at like unless we're living, unless it's some vast, ridiculous conspiracy,
*  I think we're looking at least a couple of months, man.
*  I mean, this is and I'm going by not a conspiracy because I think that
*  because I have a son now and if I listen to my own instincts when it comes to shit for my kid,
*  I'm going to be afraid to vaccinate him.
*  I'm going to be afraid to do things that like millions of scientific papers have shown as safe
*  that's good for his health because I'm like going to get superstitious.
*  So I lean into science.
*  It saved my life.
*  You know, science kept cancer for spreading through my body and killing me.
*  I'm going to trust the scientists right now and self isolate and try as much as possible
*  to not spread this shit.
*  And I think that that's even if it turns out to be a panic, a hysteria, whatever, at least
*  you were part of the people who weren't fucking going out and skiing.
*  Yes.
*  During this fucking thing.
*  So I think it's going to go on longer.
*  And I think while it goes on longer, if you have the ability to limit human contact
*  and to avoid the superstitious part of yourself that I've got to that's looking at this and
*  thinking like, come on, really, I don't know anyone who's sick.
*  I don't know.
*  It's also a rejection from change or rejection of change that you don't have any control over.
*  Denial.
*  You deny that it's happening.
*  Because that's the easiest thing to do.
*  If you deny that it's happening, you don't have to face the fear.
*  And if you don't face the fear, well, then you put yourself in danger.
*  But really, probably, I don't know how old you are out there, but you really who you're
*  putting in danger somebody's granddad.
*  Yes.
*  That's the main thing is like.
*  And people with diseases, people with autoimmune disorders.
*  People that are compromised.
*  There's a lot of us that are not that strong.
*  Maybe some people are recovering from something like talking to Jonathan Ward yesterday and
*  his wife's recovering from cancer.
*  She's going through chemo.
*  They want to make sure she doesn't have to deal with any of this shit.
*  Like you're not exposed to any of it.
*  Those are the type of people we have to be really scared of.
*  People that are compromised.
*  But this is a fucked up moment for us, but a learning moment.
*  I really hope that this prepares us in case something really horrible comes down the pipe.
*  And I hope it prepares us for understanding that this is a possibility.
*  It lets us understand like, hey, we need to accept this is how it goes.
*  And if there's some new shit that comes on, let's act quicker and let's take care of this quicker.
*  And like if everybody just had a two week off thing, like, you know, and this was something
*  that Dana White and Frank Fertitta were talking about before anyone did it.
*  Frank Fertitta told Dana White, he's like, why don't we just have everything shut down
*  for two weeks?
*  Just no one go to work.
*  No one do anything.
*  Two weeks.
*  Stop the planes.
*  And the way he explained it to me was like, he said, pull the bandaid off of it.
*  I'm like, that is actually probably a really good idea.
*  Well, guess what?
*  Now that's being forced, mandatory forced in certain cities where they've got bad outbreaks.
*  If they had just done that, the moment it cut, the moment it cut loose,
*  just no one goes anywhere for two weeks.
*  Let's nip this fucking thing in the bud.
*  If that was really done, they're right.
*  If you could really get that to be implemented at a scale of 350 million people,
*  you definitely would have radically slowed down the pace.
*  We weren't ready.
*  We weren't ready.
*  Well, now we know.
*  Yeah, I hope.
*  I hope.
*  I hope we learn.
*  And I hope it doesn't morph.
*  And I hope it doesn't get more deadly.
*  And I hope they can figure out a way to allocate funds to get more respirators.
*  And all that shit has to be done.
*  And you can make your own hand sanitizer.
*  Yeah, I heard that too.
*  We can just wash our hands with soap too.
*  Yeah.
*  Soap apparently kills it.
*  What do you think are the three things you should have at your outing?
*  You should have food.
*  You should have water or something that purifies water.
*  Whether they're water purification tablets.
*  They can buy iodine tablets.
*  Why that?
*  What, you think the city water is going to get turned on?
*  Anything can happen.
*  Anything can happen.
*  You might need to drink water that you don't want to drink.
*  That's possible.
*  You might have to drink puddle water.
*  The reality is if things go real bad, you might have to drink from a lake.
*  And that's what water is.
*  We take water from various sources and they purify it and rain water and all kinds of other shit.
*  That's what we're drinking on a daily basis.
*  We're drinking this weird process water.
*  The water you're really supposed to be drinking is the stuff that comes right out of the ground.
*  That's what you're supposed to be drinking.
*  But if you get stuff that's biologically infected, you get stuff that animals have been in.
*  It's animal waste, feces and stuff or bacteria or diseases or anything.
*  You can purify that.
*  You can take these water tablets and you drop them in there and it kills everything.
*  It torches the water.
*  In cases of emergency, backpackers will find an elk wallow and they can drink that water out of an elk wallow.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  There's a thing called a SteriPen.
*  A SteriPen actually uses ultraviolet light.
*  Let's say you have a water bottle.
*  You fill it up with elk piss and you wave your thing because you're trying to stay alive.
*  You're out there.
*  If there's no water, if you're on a high country desert mule deer hunt and you can't find any water,
*  you've got to take water wherever you can get it.
*  You're not bringing all your water up there if you're staying there for 12 days.
*  You're hoping you could find creeks.
*  You might not find a creek.
*  If you do, it might be fucked up.
*  There might be a dead animal in it.
*  Shit.
*  Something might have gone there to die and polluted the water or beavers might have shit in it.
*  You have to have something that kills all that stuff.
*  That's something that people should have.
*  They should have, I think you should have some sort of a first aid kit.
*  Bandages, things like that, disinfectants, antibiotics, stuff like that.
*  You should probably have something like that in case something goes wrong and someone gets hurt
*  and there's no hospital available or there's no doctor or you have to wait in the morning
*  before you can take someone to a doctor, whatever the fuck the problem is.
*  You should have that.
*  You should have batteries that you've charged.
*  Cell phone, get some backup batteries.
*  Charge those bitches.
*  If you have a generator, fantastic, but some people can't afford one and they don't have
*  the room for one and they can't have one.
*  It's not feasible if you live in an apartment building.
*  Having charged batteries for phones is very important.
*  Food and water.
*  Food and water are number one.
*  You want to have dried foods, things like rice and pasta.
*  You can store a lot of it.
*  You can eat it.
*  It's high in calories.
*  You can eat it and it doesn't take up too much room.
*  There's canned things you can keep forever.
*  That's what you want.
*  You want food that you could have that could keep you alive.
*  Let me ask you this, man, because this is something I've been talking to people
*  and myself I've experienced it a little bit.
*  I don't know if you have, but what about those of us who are like kind of secretly freaking
*  out right now?
*  Not so secretly.
*  To me, that's like I think one of the big questions is, you know, I was talking to a
*  friend of mine and he was like, man, I totally was losing my shit yesterday, man.
*  And like I told him like, dude, me too.
*  Everybody.
*  Yeah, but how the fuck are we going to deal?
*  It's just such a weird form of anxiety.
*  I've never had this kind of anxiety before.
*  It's there's an invisible monster.
*  Yeah, invisible monster that wants to kill your grandma.
*  Yeah, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  And a visible monster that kills upwards.
*  The high level is like somewhere around 3% of the people, you know, and with old people,
*  it's even worse with people over 80.
*  I think it's, you know, it's really deadly.
*  It's fucking scary, man.
*  What's scary is this is only one of many that could be coming our way.
*  And that this happens every X amount of years or something.
*  Last one was, you know, H1N1 and SARS and this and that.
*  And there's always a new one.
*  And just the fucking flu, man.
*  I didn't, you know, I didn't until we were looking into this, I didn't know how many
*  people the flu killed.
*  The flu can kill 90,000 people in America every year.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, I didn't know that.
*  Did you know that?
*  I knew that.
*  So when they say this is 10 times more deadly than the flu, you're like, holy fuck, maybe
*  15 times more.
*  Holy fuck, that's a million people.
*  That's a million plus.
*  That's scary.
*  That's scary.
*  That's scary.
*  And then, you know, other really horrible diseases that have devastated populations,
*  those are possible too.
*  And new ones are possible.
*  Joe, I was asking, how do we deal with the fucking anxiety?
*  Now I'm feeling the anxiety.
*  You got to look at it.
*  You got to look at it for what it is.
*  This is reality.
*  The way to deal with anxiety is to be prepared as best you can, accept where you are and
*  what you are and who you are, and just live.
*  It reprioritizes our values.
*  You know, that's what's going to be good out of this.
*  Nothing good ever comes from having it too easy.
*  Right.
*  Like, for us, I think as a culture, having it too easy was probably a little bit toxic
*  to us, like always eating junk food or always eating sugar.
*  That's all we're eating.
*  It's okay to eat cake every now and then, but you can't just live off cake.
*  Well, as a culture, there's a lot of what we're doing.
*  We're living off cake, you know?
*  If you ever seen that Werner Herzog documentary, Happy People, Life and the Taiga,
*  it's a great documentary about these really nomadic people that live in Siberia,
*  and they're super happy.
*  And they live in these log houses that they build themselves.
*  They show them building these houses.
*  They don't have enough mosquito repellent.
*  They have to make their own mosquito repellent with tar, and they grind it up and add stuff to it
*  and rub it all over their face and everything.
*  They're super happy.
*  They live up in Siberia, dude.
*  It's so fucking cold.
*  It's only summer for like three or four months.
*  It's only nice out, and then the rest is just bitter, brutal cold where the winter
*  freezes the river solid where you can ride a snowmobile over the river.
*  So they use the river like the highway, and they all have dogs and they run around trapping
*  and killing animals and living off the land and catching fish and living off the fish.
*  Dude, they're so happy.
*  What's fucked up is these people are encountering life-threatening adversity every day.
*  If you stay outside, you will die.
*  You will die just from exposure to the cold.
*  It will kill you.
*  It's 50 below zero outside.
*  It will fucking kill you.
*  And because of that, they're all like happy and smiling and laughing.
*  And the documentary just shows like it's weird.
*  We're never happy like this in a collective group unless we're all living in this constant state
*  of like alertness and consequences for inaction.
*  Like there's no lazy people there, man.
*  Everybody does their part.
*  You have to.
*  And they're all working and laughing and they're all making their own canoes out of boards.
*  They're chopping out a log.
*  They're hollowing out these canoes and stretching them out.
*  It's amazing, man.
*  They're just always working and they're always happy.
*  It's so weird.
*  That's it.
*  That to me, I think a lot of people don't realize that you can work together with people
*  not for money, just to do stuff.
*  For community.
*  And how fun that is when you find yourself.
*  Even, you know, my wife and I fucking moving and like unpacking boxes.
*  It's been like nonstop for the last like four days.
*  And we've had to like, you know, it's there's something in it, even though it's terrifying,
*  that really is joyful and there's is so like feels more alive than I've felt in a long time.
*  I think that's the thing we've got to tune into is that if nothing else were alive right now,
*  that's beautiful.
*  And yeah, maybe this just extend.
*  Maybe we can become like those people up there.
*  I mean, I think that's one of the anytime a fucked up thing happens to you personally,
*  it's a chance to become a bitter piece of shit or a little more angry or a little more tired
*  or a little more depressed or to become a hero.
*  Anything, whatever it may be, any bit of phenomena that comes your way as a person.
*  You know, anytime I fight, like anytime something's really got to get done that
*  I've been procrastinating or anytime some shitty unexpected thing comes my way.
*  I have a moment to decide, am I going to react to this?
*  Like I always react to shitty things and like become negative or dark or get pissed.
*  Or can I like react to it in a completely new way?
*  And I think every time you do a new way, this is my concept,
*  you pop into a different part of the multiverse.
*  It's a little better than the one you were in before.
*  And it's like a trajectory you can go on.
*  When I was getting stoned at the gym at 4am,
*  I was imagining on the treadmill that I was running through the multiverse
*  towards a healthier version of me that I wasn't getting in shape.
*  I was actually being inhaled into a more in shape version of me that already existed.
*  That's the kind of shit I have to do to get myself to work out.
*  Dude, that's heavy.
*  Yeah, man. It's a fun. It's fun to do that.
*  You know, every single decision is like a binary.
*  Do you want to continue doing the shit you've been doing over and over again?
*  Whatever it may be.
*  Or do you want to try a mildly new way?
*  And every time you do that, sure as shit, it's not just you that starts changing.
*  You'll notice like other stuff starts changing too around you.
*  You know, things just tend to generally get better.
*  Yeah. I think there's there's thoughts that I've had that are real similar to that
*  where I've wondered like if if multiverses are real
*  and they're supposed to be different versions of you,
*  infinite versions all over the universe,
*  why are we assuming that this is the same every day you wake up in the same version?
*  Why are we assuming that?
*  The thing about sleep is you just go away,
*  then you come back with a memory of what life was like before you went away.
*  And you wouldn't notice if it just slid you one notch to the right or one notch to the left into
*  the multiverse.
*  If there's an infinite number of donkeys out there with ghillie suits and gas masks on,
*  and you just slid over to the right by letting a little old lady in front of you
*  and not even complaining when she was driving 30 miles an hour.
*  You're like, it's all right. She's a nice lady.
*  Let me just get around her nice and slow and safe.
*  Wave to her.
*  Hi.
*  And the more you do that, the more you do that,
*  the more you start running into other people who are doing the same thing.
*  You start ending up in that part of the multiverse where many other people are doing
*  the same thing.
*  Yes.
*  And eventually, theoretically, I think, eventually through those series of decisions,
*  maybe that's where you can like, that's where all of a sudden you start realizing like,
*  oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm in a temple. I'm not even in a reality that I thought I was in.
*  I was just like in a deep state of contemplative meditation.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know. There's all kinds of interesting experiments you can do.
*  Have you ever heard the term pro noia? Pro noia?
*  It's the opposite of paranoia where you think the universe is conspiring to help you instead of hurt
*  you. That's brilliant.
*  Yeah. Maybe that's what we'll call our group.
*  Pro noia.
*  Pro noia.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah. That's it.
*  Perfect. Yeah.
*  Yeah. We needed a name. Then it just came to us.
*  Pro noia.
*  It sounds like a dope band.
*  Yeah.
*  Gonna go see pro noia at the Stable Center.
*  Pro noia.
*  It's fun. If you do that, if you really do imagine that every single thing that's happening in your
*  life is a grand conspiracy.
*  To help you.
*  To advance you.
*  Or another way to put it. Do you ever listen? I love listening to Christian radio.
*  This guy was talking about a thing called convection, which is being inhaled into the Christ.
*  So when you start like-
*  Like a black hole?
*  I think like a white hole. I guess it would be a black hole.
*  Gobbling up planets?
*  You're being drawn into the super intelligence and you're becoming
*  you're being sort of lifted up into it.
*  The thing that makes the fucking big green egg work, the thing that sucks smoke up,
*  that's happening to you into the divine intelligence.
*  And as it happens, you imagine you're the one doing the stuff to get you closer to it.
*  But really, it's just your mind playing tricks on you.
*  You have no choice. You're gonna wake up.
*  You're gonna gain realization.
*  As that's happening, you can quit something.
*  You can quit drinking.
*  You can quit smoking.
*  But you kind of long for it.
*  But then sometimes you notice you just stop doing shit that was bad for you
*  because you found a better way to live and it naturally falls away.
*  That's convection.
*  You're being drawn into the divine mind.
*  As that happens, this shit that looks like austerity when you're further away
*  begins to actually just be a natural way that you act.
*  You just become naturally more graceful, naturally less inclined to do shitty things,
*  naturally more tuned in with the 150-year-old version of you.
*  You know, that you sort of naturally, and that just happens on its own
*  because you're being convected into the Christ, sucked into the omega point.
*  The divine.
*  We should probably leave on that.
*  Should we end on that?
*  That's the perfect way to end, right?
*  Thanks, man.
*  Thanks for letting me come on your show.
*  It's already almost 4 o'clock.
*  How the fuck did that happen?
*  What the fuck?
*  Time warp, right?
*  This is a total time warp episode.
*  You and I always have the strangest episodes, man.
*  We really do.
*  I don't believe it's four.
*  It's almost four.
*  It's 3.46.
*  Normally I would have had to piss like three times.
*  You're evolving.
*  Dung and trussle, tell everybody when your show is out.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  April 20th on Netflix, the Midnight Gospel.
*  You can follow the Midnight Gospel on Twitter and Instagram.
*  And thanks Pendleton for making the show with me.
*  And thanks, y'all, for watching it.
*  Thanks for letting me plug it on your show, man.
*  It looks awesome.
*  I can't wait to watch it.
*  It looks so Duncan Trussell.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  It's very you.
*  All right.
*  We're going to keep on keeping on, folks.
*  Stay healthy out there.
*  Much love.
*  Bye.
*  Hare Krishna.
*  Woo!
*  Damn!
