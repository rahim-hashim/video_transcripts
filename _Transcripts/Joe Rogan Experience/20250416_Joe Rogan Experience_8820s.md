# JRE MMA Show #166 with Ilia Topuria
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6.0s)]
*  Alright bro, come in. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=12.0s)]
*  What's happening? Pleasure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=14.0s)]
*  No, please, my pleasure. Thank you very much for having me here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=16.0s)]
*  My pleasure. My honor. I'm very excited about this new thing you're doing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm very excited about your journey into the lightweight division. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=22.0s)]
*  Something that I felt very excited also about that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=26.0s)]
*  What are you walking around at? What do you walk around at when you were fighting at 45? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=29.0s)]
*  I'm going to tell you in kilos. I walk around 80-82. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=33.0s)]
*  What is that Jamie? Like 160-170? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=38.0s)]
*  180. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=42.0s)]
*  So you were losing quite a bit of weight. 35 pounds? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=44.0s)]
*  25-30 pounds. That was the hardest part of the fight game for me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=48.0s)]
*  I wasn't enjoying all the last couple of fights that I had. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=55.0s)]
*  I had to become more professional in the weight cut than in a fight game. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=59.0s)]
*  It was taking a lot of time and energy from me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=65.0s)]
*  My dream is to become a world champion. I want to end up this chapter that I have. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=69.0s)]
*  I started at 145 and now it's time to really enjoy it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=74.0s)]
*  I'm very excited about that. I already have one fight in 155. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=79.0s)]
*  Jai Herbert. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=84.0s)]
*  I really wish the UFC would eliminate weight cutting. I really wish there was a way. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=86.0s)]
*  Why did they allow you to do that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=90.0s)]
*  It's sanctioned cheating that everybody has to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=92.0s)]
*  If you're saying you're 180 pounds, you're not really 145. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=96.0s)]
*  It's crazy that you're the 145-pound champion, but you're an 180-pound man. It's kind of nuts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=101.0s)]
*  At the same time, if you go to the next weight class, you are playing with a disadvantage. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=106.0s)]
*  The guy in the next division is cutting a lot of weight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=112.0s)]
*  If you don't do that, at the end of the day you walk inside the octagon and you are the smaller guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=116.0s)]
*  Islam Akhachev is huge. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=121.0s)]
*  How he makes 155, I don't understand it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=124.0s)]
*  Every time I stand next to him, I'm like, how are you 155? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=128.0s)]
*  How much do you think he walks around? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=131.0s)]
*  He's got to be 190-ish in the 190 range. He's got to be. That's what he looks like to me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=133.0s)]
*  I never saw him in a person. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=138.0s)]
*  He's thick. He's thick and big. He's not a 150-pound man. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=140.0s)]
*  It's just so silly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=146.0s)]
*  It's an old thing that we kept for no reason. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=148.0s)]
*  I feel like they should blow all the weight classes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=154.0s)]
*  I've talked to Dana about this. I actually talked to Ari Emanuel about this when they first bought the UFC. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=157.0s)]
*  I said the first thing you should do is get rid of this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=162.0s)]
*  Get rid of the weight cutting and just add a bunch of weight classes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=164.0s)]
*  Because some of the weight class gaps, like the gap between 70 and 85 and then 85 and 205, they're too big. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=167.0s)]
*  The gaps are too big. 20 pounds is nuts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=175.0s)]
*  I would do something with the drag test. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=177.0s)]
*  If I go to your home to make the drag test, I put you in the scale. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=179.0s)]
*  If you walk around 8% or 10% over your weight, I would obligate you to go in the next weight class. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=184.0s)]
*  Just to give you an example, for example, if you're fighting 100 kilograms, I'm going to say 8 kilograms, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=193.0s)]
*  and I go to your house, I do the drag test, I put you in the scale, and you weigh this 110 kilograms, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=199.0s)]
*  I would force you to go to the next weight class. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's realistic. That makes sense. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=209.0s)]
*  I think that they should have more weight classes because the weight class gaps are just too large. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=212.0s)]
*  Or maybe that's an option also. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=217.0s)]
*  At the lower weight classes, it's 10 pounds, which seems reasonable. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=219.0s)]
*  But really, at the lower weight classes, when you're like 125 and 135, it could easily be 5 pounds. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=223.0s)]
*  5 pounds is reasonable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=230.0s)]
*  But Dana doesn't want 12 weight classes or 15, 20 weight classes like boxing ass. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=232.0s)]
*  He wants it to be like the UFC has now. But it's not enough. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=238.0s)]
*  I don't really know the real reason behind that, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=242.0s)]
*  but I would love to talk to Dana and ask him this question also because it's kind of dangerous also for the guys. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=245.0s)]
*  Many times you put on a show for the people and you don't really know if they're going to make the weight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=251.0s)]
*  Right. Exactly. And they're going to be compromised. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=258.0s)]
*  There's a lot of guys who fight just deeply dehydrated from the day before, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=261.0s)]
*  and even though they've rehydrated themselves, their brain's not rehydrated yet. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=266.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=270.0s)]
*  It's not smart. And it's also not necessary. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=271.0s)]
*  Like, why would you make for better fights? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=274.0s)]
*  Why would you want someone to be physically compromised 24 hours before they're fighting? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=277.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=281.0s)]
*  But at the same time, the weight cut takes something out from you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=283.0s)]
*  That's crazy. It's like putting a dog inside the room for 20 days without any food, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=287.0s)]
*  and you open the door and you put him in a different room full of food. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=293.0s)]
*  It's like the same thing. When I'm cutting the weight, I'm a different person. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=299.0s)]
*  I feel that. My mind goes different. My thought process is different. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=303.0s)]
*  Everything is so different at that moment. I'm not so kind when I'm cutting weight. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=309.0s)]
*  Yeah, more focused, dialed in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=315.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=317.0s)]
*  Dominic Cruz says it's a good thing. He likes weight cutting because it gets you dialed in. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=318.0s)]
*  He says it gets you completely dialed in for a fight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=324.0s)]
*  How much he cuts? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=326.0s)]
*  I don't think he cuts that much. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=327.0s)]
*  That's why he likes it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=329.0s)]
*  Ask Alex Pereira if he likes it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=333.0s)]
*  Because when he was fighting at 85, he was weighing in at 85 and then fighting in the cage at 225, 226, which is crazy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=335.0s)]
*  I don't know how that guy was making 185. That's crazy because he's huge and he's so tall. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, how about Drakus Du Plessis? How the fuck is he 185? That guy's huge. He's a tank. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=350.0s)]
*  He's huge also. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=356.0s)]
*  There's a lot of these guys. But it's very deceptive because the general public thinks that's a 185 pound man, but he's not. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=357.0s)]
*  Drakus is probably, when he gets into the cage, he's well into the 220s. He's a big guy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=366.0s)]
*  I don't know in what way he walks around, but he's a huge guy also. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=371.0s)]
*  And when he was fighting in 170, he was big also. He was almost killing himself. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=376.0s)]
*  The craziest one was Anthony Rumble Johnson. Do you remember Anthony? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=382.0s)]
*  Anthony, I ran into him once in between fights and I said, how much do you weigh? He said 230. He was fighting 170. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=386.0s)]
*  He switched how many weight classes? He started from 170, he went to light heavyweight and then he ended up fighting in the heavyweight division. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=395.0s)]
*  He went to middleweight and didn't make weight. He missed weight and lost that fight. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=404.0s)]
*  And then he fought heavyweight outside the UFC and then came back and fought light heavyweight in the UFC. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=409.0s)]
*  You know, something similar happened to me also. I started fighting in the bantamweight division. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=415.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=420.0s)]
*  Yeah. Before the UFC, like in cage warriors, when I was fighting in the cage warriors, I actually missed the weight also when I was fighting for the belt. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=421.0s)]
*  I was fighting at that time in the bantamweight division. Then I kept fighting in the featherweight and now I'm in the lightweight. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=430.0s)]
*  I hope I don't end up fighting in the welterweight. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=438.0s)]
*  How old were you when you first started fighting? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=442.0s)]
*  In MMA, you're asking? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=445.0s)]
*  When did you first start martial arts? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=448.0s)]
*  When I was four years old, my dad put me with my brother in judo. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=451.0s)]
*  Then we went to Georgia. We kept practicing with the Grecarumon Wrestling. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=458.0s)]
*  Then we moved to Spain when I was 15 years old and completely by chance we found a gym and we started training the MMA, the Mixed Martial Arts. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=465.0s)]
*  Totally by chance? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=475.0s)]
*  Totally by chance. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=476.0s)]
*  Were you a Mixed Martial Arts fan at all? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=478.0s)]
*  I didn't know anything about the Mixed Martial Arts. I didn't know anything about the BJJ, the groundgap, any fucking thing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=481.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=487.0s)]
*  We went to Spain and we wanted to keep with the same discipline as we were doing in Georgia with the Grecarumon Wrestling, but they don't have the culture of that sport. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=488.0s)]
*  So we were a little bit sad because we wanted that sport. My brother was really, really good on that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=499.0s)]
*  So my mom was working and he saw a man with the cauliflower ears. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=507.0s)]
*  She went to him and she asked him, like, what are you doing? Because my kids want to do wrestling. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=514.0s)]
*  Do you train in some gym or something? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=523.0s)]
*  And he said, no, I'm doing the BJJ. Bring your kids and I'm going to show you the gym. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=525.0s)]
*  She came to home and my dad and my mom, they started to convince us. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=531.0s)]
*  Like, there's a gym, they are practicing like Jiu-Jitsu, MMA, all the sports. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=536.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck is this? I don't know what's this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=542.0s)]
*  And my dad started to show me the videos of the Gracies. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=546.0s)]
*  He told me like this is one of the best sports in the world right now. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=551.0s)]
*  You are going to guys love it. This and that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=555.0s)]
*  And at that day we went to the gym and I felt in love since the first second. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=558.0s)]
*  Well, it's actually a great base to start out from, starting with Judo and then Grecarumon Wrestling and then going into Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=562.0s)]
*  It's really great because you already have an established grappling base. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=568.0s)]
*  It's great. Of course, my recommendation for everyone is if you want to have a career in MMA, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=573.0s)]
*  you should start with wrestling because for me personally, because this is my personal experience, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=579.0s)]
*  that it's much easier to learn in the future boxing than start with boxing and learn the wrestling. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=585.0s)]
*  Really? For me, yes, I think so. And I saw that in many people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=593.0s)]
*  But how old were you when you first started boxing? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=598.0s)]
*  Seventeen years old. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=601.0s)]
*  That's fairly old. Like when you think about how high level your striking is. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=604.0s)]
*  Of course it is. But when I started, I was like, OK, I'm very good with the wrestling. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=608.0s)]
*  I can take people down. I can control them. I have a great ground game. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=615.0s)]
*  But what if I go to the highest competition and I find some adversities? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=619.0s)]
*  I have to be able to fight in the striking also. So I have to develop my game in the striking. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=626.0s)]
*  And I started from that and I started with my brother. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=632.0s)]
*  We were like the first people to go inside the gym and the last ones to leave it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=636.0s)]
*  So we were starting every day all day, like so obsessed. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=640.0s)]
*  We were watching all the videos of Julio Cesar Chavez, of Canelo, all that, practicing all the techniques. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=644.0s)]
*  And then putting in interaction, the sparrings and all that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=651.0s)]
*  And I was like finding my style, what I really like to do. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=656.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because Spain doesn't have a long history of mixed martial arts. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=661.0s)]
*  So you are the first champion from Spain in the UFC. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=666.0s)]
*  So it's very interesting that you got in there as a young man and there wasn't really like a big established community yet. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=671.0s)]
*  So I was the first guy to get into the top 15, the top 10, the top 5, and then the world champion. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=680.0s)]
*  We had a guy in Spain who fought in the UFC. I don't know if you remember him. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=688.0s)]
*  Enrique Wasabi. He did the Ultimate Fighter. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=695.0s)]
*  Then we have another guy also, Joel Alvarez. He's doing a great job also. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=699.0s)]
*  But before that we didn't have anyone in the UFC. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=703.0s)]
*  So when you first started training, were there amateur competitions in Spain? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=706.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=711.0s)]
*  There was amateur MMA? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=712.0s)]
*  Yeah, there were three fights in amateur. And then I started with a professional game. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=714.0s)]
*  I did four fights in Spain. And at some point it was so difficult to find a fight for me that I had to start to travel in the European territory to get a fight. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=719.0s)]
*  Yeah, and everything started from that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=732.0s)]
*  But it's fascinating because a lot of world champions generally, well there's a good percentage of them come from an established gym that already has elite high level competition. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=734.0s)]
*  But it seems like that's not the case with your gym. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=745.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't. So I don't know what was the reason to be honest to came this far. I don't know. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=747.0s)]
*  Well that's always the question with champions. Like are champions born or are they bred? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=755.0s)]
*  Because there's gyms that develop like Marvin Hagler came out of the Petronelli Brothers gym in Brockton, Massachusetts. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=760.0s)]
*  They're not known for world championship fighters, but Marvin Hagler is one of the greatest of all time. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=767.0s)]
*  It's like there was something inside of him that made him excel. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=772.0s)]
*  The same thing. There was something inside me that made me the person who I am today. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=776.0s)]
*  Did you know when you first started training, when you first started doing MMA that you were going to fight professionally? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah, since the first day. So my mindset always was the same, exactly the same as I have right now. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=789.0s)]
*  I'm like if someone did it, I also can do it. And if no one did it, I can be the first one to do it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=796.0s)]
*  This is the mindset I always had. It's like, yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=803.0s)]
*  I think that the champions are not born, they are made also because you can burn in an extraordinary situation, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=811.0s)]
*  but you can end up so bad, you know, and the opposite also. You can burn in a crazy situation and end up in a paradise. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's such an interesting thing because all champions are not the same type of person either. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=831.0s)]
*  You've got guys like Sugashon O'Malley who's silly and smokes weed and has crazy hair. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=837.0s)]
*  And then you've got guys like Alex Pereira who are very stoic, very serious. Everyone's different. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=843.0s)]
*  He's very serious. I met him in Sydney. I went with my brother because he made his UFC debut. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=849.0s)]
*  And yeah, he was kind of quiet. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=857.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's intense. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=860.0s)]
*  He's so serious. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=862.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's intense. I remember watching him fight for the first time in glory in kickboxing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=864.0s)]
*  And I was like, Jesus Christ, this was chaos people. I was like, this guy is different. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=869.0s)]
*  Huge. Great. Crazy power. His power is just ridiculous. I mean, like, guys would be blocking. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=874.0s)]
*  Who do you love watching fight? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=881.0s)]
*  I love watching you fight. Yeah, I'm a giant fan. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=882.0s)]
*  I like all styles, man. I'm fascinated by the game in all different styles. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=885.0s)]
*  I mean, I like watching all the champions. I mean, I love watching Marab fight. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=892.0s)]
*  Wow. He's a fucking animal. He's the machine. I love him. He's an animal. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=897.0s)]
*  I mean, I just don't understand that cardio. His cardio is fucking crazy. It's like superhuman cardio. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=902.0s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you something about Marab that surprised me that maybe you see him in the mat [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=909.0s)]
*  and he's not the most special guy, the most careful guy in the room. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=916.0s)]
*  But I don't know what happens to him when he gets inside that octagon. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=921.0s)]
*  Wow. That man is a fucking machine. He's a fucking machine. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=926.0s)]
*  I'm right now. You ask me who I love to watch fight. That's Marab. I would pay. Take my money. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=930.0s)]
*  When he's fighting in the pay-per-view right now, at this point, I'm like, bro, take my money. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=939.0s)]
*  I love Umar, too. Umar, that fight was incredible. That was one of the best fights I've ever seen [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=943.0s)]
*  because they're so skillful, so high level. And to see him make Umar start to wilt, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=950.0s)]
*  to see Umar, you see the wobble when guys start getting fatigued. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=957.0s)]
*  You see this a little bit of loose movement in the way. You see that? Marab had none. Zero. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=961.0s)]
*  Just shooting like he was in the first round and the fifth round. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=966.0s)]
*  Because this is what I exactly think that happens to Umar. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=970.0s)]
*  Because you see Marab from outside, like you are sitting and you are seeing him training or fighting, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=973.0s)]
*  and you're like, he's not going to be able to take me down. He's not going to be able to do that to me. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=980.0s)]
*  And then you get inside that octagon with him and everything changes. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=985.0s)]
*  It's like you have a machine in front of you who has like nonstop. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=989.0s)]
*  Daniel Cormier went to visit him right after he won the title. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=995.0s)]
*  Daniel Cormier went to his house on Sunday. Marab wasn't home. He was out running. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=998.0s)]
*  He won the title on Saturday. Daniel went to his house on Sunday. Marab's out running. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1002.0s)]
*  Wow, he's crazy. He came to Spain also to help me once when I had the training come. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1007.0s)]
*  I was supposed to fight with Moser. He came to help me. Crazy. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1012.0s)]
*  The same exactly. We were finishing the training. He was going for a run. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1017.0s)]
*  He was going actually to his house running. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1023.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's no shortcuts. No shortcuts. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1026.0s)]
*  But to answer your question, I'm fascinated by all the different styles. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1029.0s)]
*  I like watching everybody fight. I love Volkanovsky. I love watching him fight this past weekend. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1035.0s)]
*  He's so great. I was so happy for him this Saturday because he really deserved to get that title back. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1042.0s)]
*  Does it bother you to see someone win your title? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1051.0s)]
*  No, not at all. You're good? I'm good. I'm good. Happy for him. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1054.0s)]
*  You established. You won. You defended. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1058.0s)]
*  I won. I defended. Right now I have a completely different challenge in front of me. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1060.0s)]
*  I wish him nothing but the best and to everyone. I wish the best wins all the time. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1065.0s)]
*  That's great. Yeah, that's great. I don't care. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1069.0s)]
*  What about Patti Pimlet though? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1071.0s)]
*  He did a great job. He did what he had to do. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1074.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1078.0s)]
*  But for me, I'm going to be completely honest with you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1079.0s)]
*  For me, Chandler, he never was an extraordinary fighter. He was an average level fighter. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1084.0s)]
*  Who did he beat in the UFC? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1093.0s)]
*  Dan Hooker and Tony Ferguson. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1095.0s)]
*  Dan Hooker. Yeah. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1097.0s)]
*  Dan Hooker is a good fighter. He caught... Well, Dan Hooker had that war with Dustin Poirier. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1101.0s)]
*  Dustin Poirier is a very good fighter. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1106.0s)]
*  How many losses he had? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1108.0s)]
*  He's got a few losses. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1109.0s)]
*  He's a good fighter. Very entertaining fighter. For the fans... [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1111.0s)]
*  He's a wild dog. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1114.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's a dog. He goes inside that octagon and he fights. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1115.0s)]
*  I think he's on a resurgence. I think he had a skid for a while and now he's rebuilding himself. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1123.0s)]
*  And he's on a resurgence. You smile and look at you, motherfucker. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1129.0s)]
*  So he beat Dan Hooker and Tony Ferguson when he was almost four years old. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1133.0s)]
*  I think honestly we got Michael Chandler after his prime. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1139.0s)]
*  If you go watch Michael Chandler fight Eddie Alvarez and Bellator, those were fucking crazy fights. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1143.0s)]
*  Crazy fights. Wars. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1149.0s)]
*  Yeah, but at the end of the day, you see wars. It's a very competitive fight. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1150.0s)]
*  You see almost a bar fight. You see two guys in the middle of the octagon exchanging punches, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1154.0s)]
*  but you don't see technique. You don't see skills. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1160.0s)]
*  You see a great fight because as a fan it's very entertaining to watch fights like that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1163.0s)]
*  But if you really think about it, it's like you don't see skills in that fight. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1169.0s)]
*  You don't see someone trying to take you down, control you, some great submissions, great transitions. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1175.0s)]
*  I don't know, striking. You see a guy that he's looking for a combination. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1180.0s)]
*  He's looking for his moment, creating spaces. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1186.0s)]
*  You don't see like, I don't know. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1189.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1191.0s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1192.0s)]
*  It's the end of tax season and I know by now you all are probably sick of numbers, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1194.0s)]
*  but there's one more expense we need to talk about, and that's how much you're investing in your well-being. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1200.0s)]
*  The cost of traditional therapy can be outrageous, between $100 and $250 a month or even more. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1205.0s)]
*  So how do you get the help you need without blowing your monthly budget? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1211.0s)]

*  like how to better manage all that stress tax season brings or how to communicate better with your partner [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1238.0s)]
*  or even how to be more mindful. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1244.0s)]

*  So it's not as tactical or technical. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1278.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1282.0s)]
*  It's just wild dogs. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1283.0s)]
*  It's just wild dogs. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1284.0s)]
*  I mean that's why Michael Chandler is so popular because he fights like a wild dog. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1286.0s)]
*  Exactly. That's cool. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1290.0s)]
*  That's cool. You need the guys also like him. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1291.0s)]
*  But I would never recommend my friend to fight like that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1293.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1296.0s)]
*  I never would recommend to someone, watch this guy and learn something. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1297.0s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1301.0s)]
*  Learn. Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1303.0s)]
*  It's like he's so entertaining, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1304.0s)]
*  but sometimes it's best to not be as entertaining and just to be better. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1307.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1312.0s)]
*  Yeah. And shut people down. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1313.0s)]
*  At the same time, you don't have to be Bilal. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1315.0s)]
*  Right. I see what you're saying. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1318.0s)]
*  But Bilal, I think, gets too much bad rap. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1320.0s)]
*  Like Bilal, when he beat up Sean Brady, that was very entertaining. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1325.0s)]
*  And Sean Brady is very good. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1328.0s)]
*  I think Bilal just does what it takes to win. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1330.0s)]
*  And also, he didn't really have a background in wrestling at the level that a lot of these guys did. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1333.0s)]
*  He had to develop that over time. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1340.0s)]
*  Yeah. But there are two types of champions for me. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1342.0s)]
*  There are champions who prepare themselves to win, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1346.0s)]
*  and there are the other ones who prepare themselves to dominate. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1349.0s)]
*  I prepare myself not to win because I know that I'm going to win. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1352.0s)]
*  I want to win in fashion. I want to dominate. I want more people. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1356.0s)]
*  I want people to be entertained. I want people to be like, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1359.0s)]
*  well, I'm happy that I spend the money this Saturday night going to watch this guy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1362.0s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1367.0s)]
*  Yeah. Someone was talking about that recently on Instagram. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1368.0s)]
*  I don't remember who the coach was, but he was talking about levels of athletes. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1372.0s)]
*  That there's people that train to compete. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1378.0s)]
*  There's people that train to win. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1380.0s)]
*  And then there's people that train to dominate, to be the greatest of all time. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1382.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1386.0s)]
*  There's a different mindset. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1387.0s)]
*  There's a never satisfied, always improving mindset that the great champions have. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1388.0s)]
*  All the time. I want the people to be entertained all the time. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1393.0s)]
*  When actually I started with the MMA, I was recording myself all the sparrings. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1397.0s)]
*  And after that, I was watching my sparring. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1406.0s)]
*  I was like, will I pay my money to watch this? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1409.0s)]
*  What do I have to change in my game to be more entertained? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1415.0s)]
*  And this is how I was looking at myself all the time. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1419.0s)]
*  I was very critical with myself. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1423.0s)]
*  And this is how I developed and developed and developed. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1427.0s)]
*  And all the time I go inside the octagon, I don't go there just to win. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1430.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1435.0s)]
*  I want everyone to be like, wow, what he just did. How he did it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1436.0s)]
*  He was the greatest of all time and he made him look easy. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1442.0s)]
*  This is what I want. I want to change the game. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1446.0s)]
*  I want you to say, watch this guy and learn something. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1449.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, mission accomplished. So far so good. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1453.0s)]
*  And now a new journey into the lightweight division. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1459.0s)]
*  I don't understand why they won't just book you and Islam. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1463.0s)]
*  There's many times that I wish I was running the UFC. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1468.0s)]
*  I would change so many different things. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1470.0s)]
*  That would be one of the first things I would change. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1471.0s)]
*  Book that fight. Book that fight right away. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1473.0s)]
*  You would do sound fights also in Mars, I'm sure. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1476.0s)]
*  I would probably. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1481.0s)]
*  You would all go with the starship. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1482.0s)]
*  I got some wacky ideas. I don't even think they should fight in a cage. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1488.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think the cage is an unnecessary. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1489.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1492.0s)]
*  I think it's an unnecessary element in fighting. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1493.0s)]
*  Like to push someone against something or to be able to get up from something. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1499.0s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1503.0s)]
*  And how would you do it? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1504.0s)]
*  I think they should be in like a basketball court, like a basketball court that's matted up. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1505.0s)]
*  Have a big space. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1509.0s)]
*  Have a warning track where you can't. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1511.0s)]
*  If you go outside the warning track too many times, you could lose points. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1513.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1516.0s)]
*  And so when someone takes you down, you have to actually get up. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1517.0s)]
*  I also think at the end of a round, like say if you've got a guy mounted at the end of the round, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1521.0s)]
*  you start the next round mounted on him. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1526.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1528.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1529.0s)]
*  Because why would you give him the advantage of getting up when he never got up? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1530.0s)]
*  He never got up. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1534.0s)]
*  Never got up. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1535.0s)]
*  You have to earn a get up. You have to stand up by yourself. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1536.0s)]
*  I love it. I never thought about that actually. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1538.0s)]
*  No stand ups ever. Ever. No stand ups. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1541.0s)]
*  Unless someone commits a foul. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1544.0s)]
*  Like if someone commits a foul and you want to stand them up and take a point away, that's fine. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1545.0s)]
*  But if the guy's in the bottom and he commits a foul, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1549.0s)]
*  if the guy's in the bottom and he gouges someone's eyes on purpose, take a point away, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1551.0s)]
*  put him right back in the same spot. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1555.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1557.0s)]
*  Because otherwise, like say if you're fighting a guy like Alex Pereira, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1558.0s)]
*  who's never taking anybody down. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1561.0s)]
*  He's just going to strike with you, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1563.0s)]
*  Why would you let him back up again and have the advantage of him standing up again? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1565.0s)]
*  The beginning of the round, he starts standing up again. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1570.0s)]
*  Now you got to take him down again? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1572.0s)]
*  But also, you don't think that it's a part of the show? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1574.0s)]
*  It is a part of the show, but I don't give a fuck about that. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1578.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm a hardcore fan. I'm a purist. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1581.0s)]
*  I think it should be about fighting, about elite fighting. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1585.0s)]
*  And elite fighting is you got to get up. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1588.0s)]
*  Like if a wrestler takes you down and he just does this to you and it's not entertaining. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1591.0s)]
*  But if he can do that to you, that's tough shit. That's what he did. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1595.0s)]
*  You would change also the time range? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1599.0s)]
*  Or you would leave a three-round or five-minute with one-minute rest? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1602.0s)]
*  The good thing about five-minute rounds, the good thing about five-minute rounds is it's sustainable [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1605.0s)]
*  and guys can fight at a high pace. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1610.0s)]
*  If you had just one 15-minute round, guys would be exhausted. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1613.0s)]
*  And the end of it would be sloppy. It wouldn't be the same. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1618.0s)]
*  The pace would be much slower. It wouldn't be as good. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1621.0s)]
*  So I think there's nothing wrong with rounds, but I think it's one fight. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1624.0s)]
*  It's not five fights. So why does he stand up at the end of every round? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1628.0s)]
*  I think if a guy takes you down and he's got you mounted, trapped in an arm, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1632.0s)]
*  and he's punching your ribs trying to secure an arm triangle, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1638.0s)]
*  why does he get to stand up again? It doesn't make any sense. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1641.0s)]
*  Especially if he's a striker and you wasted all that energy to get him to the ground [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1645.0s)]
*  and you got so close to cinching up a submission and then all of a sudden he's back on his feet again. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1649.0s)]
*  And then you have to stand up. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1654.0s)]
*  And he didn't even earn it. Start him right back down there. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1655.0s)]
*  No cage, no stand-ups. No stand-ups ever. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1658.0s)]
*  If everybody booze, tough shit. Go watch baseball. Go watch something else. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1661.0s)]
*  You wouldn't like to see at some point the world championships in mixed martial arts. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1667.0s)]
*  Like, for example, let's say the seven best fighters from the United States in every weight class [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1673.0s)]
*  against seven best fighters from, I don't know, from China or from Russia. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1680.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would love that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1686.0s)]
*  The best flight weight against the best flight weight from the United States. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1687.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1691.0s)]
*  And you do that and you have seven fights because you have seven weight divisions. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1692.0s)]
*  And if you win four weight divisions, that country won. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1697.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1700.0s)]
*  That will be fun also. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1701.0s)]
*  That would be great. That's a great idea. I love that idea. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1702.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that idea sounds really good. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1705.0s)]
*  And also, there is a bit of an issue, right, with the UFC being the premier organization for martial arts. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1708.0s)]
*  The UFC is like, if you're not a champion in the UFC, no one thinks of you as a world champion. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1715.0s)]
*  Like, you're a world champion. World champion. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1720.0s)]
*  Someone can fight in the PFL and they can say, oh, it's the PFL world champion. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1723.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, right. Come on. Come on. Great fighters. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1727.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day... [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1730.0s)]
*  You know that you have all the best fighters, the best collection of fighters in the UFC. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1732.0s)]
*  Yes, but I watch one FC and I watch some of those fucking animals that they have over there. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1736.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Jesus Christ, these guys are good, man. Some of these guys are good. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1743.0s)]
*  And, you know, they're calling them one FC world champions. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1746.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'd like to see them. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1749.0s)]
*  I'd like to see them because some guys look real good until they fight elite talent. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1752.0s)]
*  We've seen that before. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1757.0s)]
*  Like, some guys look like destroyers and then they get in the UFC against guys who are just a little bit more technical, a little smarter, and they get pieced up. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1758.0s)]
*  What happens is that I think that in one championship, you most of the time used to fight with strikers. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1765.0s)]
*  In the UFC, you don't know who you're going to face next. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1773.0s)]
*  Maybe he's a wrestler. Maybe you're going to fight Demi Amaya, who wants to fight you on the ground. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1777.0s)]
*  Maybe you fight Alex Pereira. You don't fucking know. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1782.0s)]
*  So you have to be good everywhere and you have to be prepared for everything. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1785.0s)]
*  In one championship, maybe you are good at striking and you can be a world champion. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1789.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. I mean, there are some good grapplers over there. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1794.0s)]
*  But my point is I really wish there was no organizations. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1797.0s)]
*  I really do. I really wish it was just all the best fighters competing. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1802.0s)]
*  Look, I love the UFC. I've been working for the UFC forever. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1806.0s)]
*  My loyalty is to the UFC. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1810.0s)]
*  But I wish there was just only fighting. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1812.0s)]
*  No organizations, just like boxing is. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1815.0s)]
*  But the problem with boxing is it's very difficult to get these guys because they all have different promoters. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1819.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1824.0s)]
*  And if they all have the same promoter, they all get fucked when it comes to negotiation. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1825.0s)]
*  If they all have the same promoter and the same managers. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1829.0s)]
*  You know something about soccer? No. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1832.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know a little bit about it. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1834.0s)]
*  How they do the Champions League. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1836.0s)]
*  They have, for example, let's say Real Madrid, they have a team. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1838.0s)]
*  That's why I would, what I would do is I would create a team against another team. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1843.0s)]
*  For example, I have Real Madrid. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1849.0s)]
*  I signed the best seven fighters in the world, whoever I want in different weight classes. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1851.0s)]
*  And you have, for example, Barcelona. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1857.0s)]
*  You signed the seven best fighters in the world, around the world. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1860.0s)]
*  You train them in one place. You do all the strategy. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1863.0s)]
*  And we meet each other. We do a competition like a Champions League. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1867.0s)]
*  And we do the whole year calendar and the best wins. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1871.0s)]
*  At the end of it, we do the finals and we give them the space to recover. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1874.0s)]
*  We create like a competition between teams, not individual people. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1878.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yes. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1885.0s)]
*  So I would do something like that. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1886.0s)]
*  That's a great idea. But the problem is I think guys get injured, guys fall out, guys get sick. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1888.0s)]
*  That's right. And soccer, you have guys that in your position, you always have two or three guys. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1893.0s)]
*  That if you are injured, you have another guy that can change you, switch you. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1899.0s)]
*  You know, between the rounds even. In soccer, sometimes it happens. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1904.0s)]
*  Someone gets injured in a stadium and they can switch them. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1909.0s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. But I mean, at the end of the day, like imagine, say, if you get scheduled to fight Islam. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1916.0s)]
*  And Islam gets injured in Armand Tsaroukian takes his place or something like that. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1923.0s)]
*  The NBA 82 game grind is done and now the real fun begins. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1929.0s)]
*  The NBA playoffs are here and it's time for all the high stakes drama, clutch moments and jaw dropping plays. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=1934.0s)]

*  Again, you are focused on individuals. You are not focused on teams. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2010.0s)]
*  Because no one is going to care who is going to fight from the flyway division. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2039.0s)]
*  Who is going to be your representative from the flyway division or from the lightweight division. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2043.0s)]
*  I'm like, maybe I bring you Islam that I have him in my team or also I could have Charles Soluweila in the same team. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2047.0s)]
*  Or maybe I bring Charles Soluweila because I think that against your team, the guy you have in the lightweight division, Charles does it better. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2057.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. They do that with grappling like Quintet. They do that. They have like grappling teams. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2065.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that would be interesting. I just there's there's certain fighters like I was my main regret in MMA that we never got to see Fador fight in the UFC when he was in his prime. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2070.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2082.0s)]
*  If I could have one thing, one fight in their prime, Fador Cain Velasquez. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2083.0s)]
*  Oh, that would be a great fight. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2089.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Great in their prime. That would be incredible. Incredible. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2092.0s)]
*  Actually, Cain was an amazing fighter. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2096.0s)]
*  Bro, that guy had a gas tank that was superhuman for a heavyweight. It didn't make any sense. You would see guys just fall apart. They would just wilt. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2099.0s)]
*  Pure boxing style. Pure boxing style. Great wrestling. Incredible chin and just indomitable will. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2108.0s)]
*  Too tough for his own good, which is why he wound up like towards the end of his career. He was just his body had deteriorated so much. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2115.0s)]
*  He had so many back injuries, neck injury, shoulder injury, knee injury. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2122.0s)]
*  Actually, what's going on with him? He's he's in jail right now. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2126.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got sentenced. He got sentenced to five years and the judge said this was the least amount he could sentence him. He didn't want to sentence him. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2129.0s)]
*  Well, what happened to him? Do you know that? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2137.0s)]
*  Yes. So Cain's son was going to daycare and there was a man who molested him at daycare. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2139.0s)]
*  Cain found out about it, chased the man in his car and shot at him. He tried to catch him in his car and shot at him. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2147.0s)]
*  Cain gets arrested. Cain stayed in jail. The guy gets arrested and he got out on bail. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2154.0s)]
*  I don't know what's happening with the guy. I don't know if he's been sentenced yet or what. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2160.0s)]
*  But this guy molested his son multiple times. I don't know how many times, but he did what every father would have done. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2165.0s)]
*  If you're not a father, you do not understand the murderous rage you would have if some man molested your baby. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2173.0s)]
*  You don't understand. It's you would see red in a way that no one can describe to you unless you're a parent. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2183.0s)]
*  That fucking anger is... I mean if there's ever a plea for temporary insanity, that's the plea. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2192.0s)]
*  If there's ever a person who could justifiably say, I was temporarily insane, it's a father that's chasing after someone, especially a man who molests your boy. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2201.0s)]
*  Everybody understands it. Everybody understands it. He should have never gone to jail. He's not a threat to society. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2212.0s)]
*  He's not a danger. He shouldn't be in prison. And he already did three years. He was already in jail for three years. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2220.0s)]
*  And he has been a great example for so many upcoming guys, like for the new generation. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2226.0s)]
*  I don't know why guys like him have to end up in the jail for something like that. He didn't rob anyone. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2232.0s)]
*  Exactly. It's horrific. It's horrific. I just don't understand it. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2239.0s)]
*  I mean the judge's hands were tied. He had to make a sentence. And this is I think the minimum amount. They were trying to give him 30 years. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2247.0s)]
*  Yeah. For attempted murder. Because he was just shooting at this guy. And obviously when you're driving and shooting, you could miss him and kill a bystander. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2255.0s)]
*  It's very dangerous. But also, the guy was in a murderous rage for a good reason. For a good reason. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2263.0s)]
*  And if he killed that guy, the world would be better off. That's my opinion. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2272.0s)]
*  That's true. That's also true. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2276.0s)]
*  A guy like that walking around him unless children should be dead. That's just my feeling. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2278.0s)]
*  All this thought of, I mean there's a bunch of people on the left here in the United States that they have this crazy way of looking at pedophiles. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2283.0s)]
*  They call them minor attracted persons. They want to make it a protected class and say it's like someone being attracted to someone of the opposite sex. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2291.0s)]
*  Or someone being attracted to someone of the same sex. No it's not. No it's not. You're victimizing children. The most vulnerable and protected people that we have. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2301.0s)]
*  Of course. You can't even talk to the kids about something like that. You know what I mean? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2315.0s)]
*  But like I heard so many crazy things about that topic that let's leave it right there. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2316.0s)]
*  I know. Let's leave it right there or we'll just get in trouble. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2323.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean kill them all. That's how I feel. Kill them all. Anybody who wants to do that to children, there's no reason for them to exist. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2326.0s)]
*  You're just going to ruin lives. And not just their lives but you're going to ruin all the people whose lives they ruined because they're all fucked up now. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2333.0s)]
*  You kill so much potential from a human being to do that to a baby. It's just insane. It's just fucking insane. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2343.0s)]
*  So that's unfortunately the story with Kane right now. And you know he was out for a while and once they let him out he was coaching at AKA and you know he's an amazing coach. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2353.0s)]
*  We hope that they're going to think it again and they're going to give him the freedom he deserves. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2364.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean I hope Trump pardons him. I mean that's what I really hope. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2371.0s)]
*  I hope so too. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2374.0s)]
*  I hope Dana makes something happen with that. Maybe that's possible. I mean that might be the best option. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2375.0s)]
*  But anyway in his prime Kane Velazquez versus Fedor, that's my biggest regret. A fight that we never got to see. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2381.0s)]
*  Because when Fedor was fighting in Pride, and this is before the UFC was really huge right, because they were huge in Japan in like 2001, 2002. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2390.0s)]
*  They were filling stadiums in Japan when the UFC was just sort of emerging in the United States. It really hadn't hit its peak until 2005. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2402.0s)]
*  And why do you think that they never bring him to the UFC? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2410.0s)]
*  Well they tried. But I got to be careful how I say this. So Fedor was controlled by some Russian people that were very rough men. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2415.0s)]
*  As it were. Gangster type characters. And they had a bunch of negotiations with the UFC but they were very unreasonable demands. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2429.0s)]
*  Like they wanted part of the promotion. They wanted to own a piece of everything. They wanted a lot. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2438.0s)]
*  Because they knew that with Fedor they had their golden ticket and they wanted to play it out as much as possible. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2445.0s)]
*  And negotiations were very intense and very confrontational. They got bad where Dana had to up his security. It got pretty heavy. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2451.0s)]
*  These were dangerous people. I can tell you more off air. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2463.0s)]
*  Wow I didn't know that story. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2470.0s)]
*  I'll tell you more off air. You should talk to Dana about it. It got crazy. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2472.0s)]
*  Wow. That's why. Because I always thought why they don't bring that guy to the UFC because it's going to be so fun for the fans. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2476.0s)]
*  They wanted to co-promote. They wanted to be a part of the promotion. They wanted more than they deserved. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2487.0s)]
*  They didn't just want Fedor to get paid. They wanted to get paid. They wanted to make a lot of money. And they wanted to get their hooks into the UFC. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2492.0s)]
*  Got you. Got you. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2499.0s)]
*  Yeah. Russian gangsters. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2502.0s)]
*  I get it. From their perspective too. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2503.0s)]
*  How they rule everything. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2508.0s)]
*  Well Pride was run by the Yakuza. So it was Japanese gangsters and Russian gangsters. They speak the same language. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2510.0s)]
*  They got along fine. But then when they came over to the UFC, the UFC was like that's not how we do it over here. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2517.0s)]
*  We'll give them a lot of money. We want them to fight in the UFC. And it never took place unfortunately. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2525.0s)]
*  Wow. So crazy. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2531.0s)]
*  Yeah. So he's about to fight again. Fedor's going to fight bare knuckle. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2533.0s)]
*  Yeah. I heard something about that. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2537.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think Conor's promotion. I think it's Conor's promotion. That BKFD. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2539.0s)]
*  Actually do you think he's going to come back, Conor? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2543.0s)]
*  If I had to bet? No. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2546.0s)]
*  No. Why? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2548.0s)]
*  Because he hasn't come back yet. And he could have. If he really wanted to, he would have been back in the gym, had a fight scheduled, drug tested, clean, training, gone through a camp. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2549.0s)]
*  Had a fight. Like he had a broken toe before the first fight with Tran Chandler. I understand that. Okay. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2560.0s)]
*  Why should you fight in a broken toe? Especially a guy who moves a lot like Conor. He relies on movement so much. Yeah, I get it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2566.0s)]
*  So he'll that toe up. What's that? That's two months. Broken toe is two months. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2573.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2577.0s)]
*  And so then you're back in camp and then you reschedule a fight and then you fight again. But he didn't. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2578.0s)]
*  And also partying, constant partying, all these law, legal problems that he has, you know, scooting around on yachts and, you know, driving around a Lamborghini. He's wealthy. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2585.0s)]
*  He's done. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2599.0s)]
*  Maybe. I mean, what's really sad is if he comes back when he's like 39 or 40 and his body just doesn't have it anymore. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2600.0s)]
*  You know, so right now he actually has a great opponent, Mike Chandler. He could fight. Right. Right. They could fight right now. Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2609.0s)]
*  Good fight. Because if they put him against Patti, I think Patti beats him easy now. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2617.0s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of years off, right? A lot of years off. You know, on the feet, Conor's a motherfucker. No, at the feet he's a motherfucker. I know that. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2623.0s)]
*  He can knock out like everyone if he's still the same guy. Yeah. But the thing is, he's 36 now, you know, and if he's natural also reality. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2633.0s)]
*  OK, when he breaks his leg, he gets off the drug testing, right, because he's got to do something to heal his leg quicker. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2643.0s)]
*  So what is he going to do? Well, you're going to take steroids. So if you're going to take steroids and you're already 34 ish, your endocrine system gets fucked up by taking steroids where your body stops producing testosterone. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2650.0s)]
*  So I've had explained to me by scientists before and essentially say if you take steroids for six months, you need at least six months before your body starts producing testosterone at a normal level. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2662.0s)]
*  Again, some people think it's twice as long. So that would be a year, a year of no steroids before your body regains its natural testosterone levels. If it does, depending if it does. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2675.0s)]
*  You think that if someone puts steroids in his body, he never comes back as a as he's at his normal body. Vitor Belfort is the best example of this, right? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2688.0s)]
*  He's the best guy that we could use as an example. But he took a bunch of steroids. He took like. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2702.0s)]
*  Luke Rockhold said when he when he was weighing in, when he fought him, he said this guy's got muscles on his fucking teeth. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2707.0s)]
*  Exactly. But if you go back to Vitor when he fought Anderson Silva before they had testosterone use exemptions, he didn't look like that at all. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2716.0s)]
*  No, he looked old. Actually, he looked like his body was relaxed. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2728.0s)]
*  Yeah, because Vitor. Yeah. So this is look at the difference before you saw it and after you saw it. That is a crazy example. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2733.0s)]
*  So when he fought Chris Weidman, his body looked soft and like his muscles look empty. They just didn't look the same. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2741.0s)]
*  And that was just a couple of years after test. They fucked up with the testosterone use exemption because what they did was they would test guys. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2749.0s)]
*  And if you're low on testosterone, oh, you can have a testosterone use exemption. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2758.0s)]
*  But you could get low on testosterone in a night if you wanted to. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2762.0s)]
*  All you'd have to do is eat a bunch of shitty food and drink and stay up all night and your body's natural levels of testosterone would be low. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2766.0s)]
*  So you could go get drug you who has normal healthy levels of testosterone. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2774.0s)]
*  You could wreck your body on purpose, then go get drug tested. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2778.0s)]
*  And they say, oh, Ilya, you have low testosterone. I'm going to prescribe to you testosterone exemption. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2783.0s)]
*  And so then you go and take testosterone and you become a fucking animal and you're healthy. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2788.0s)]
*  You don't need it. So there was a lot of guys that were taking it that didn't need it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2794.0s)]
*  So you think that at this point there are guys in the UFC that are taking like steroids? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2798.0s)]
*  I would imagine there's for sure someone doing something they're not supposed to do. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2805.0s)]
*  Wow. I don't know, because at this point I feel that they are so strict with it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2810.0s)]
*  They are. But there's a lot of guys that do their camps in faraway lands. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2815.0s)]
*  And I think that like people always just joke around about Dagestan. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2820.0s)]
*  You know, like try getting a USADA guy into Dagestan. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2824.0s)]
*  The moment he lands, everybody's going to call everybody. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2828.0s)]
*  They did some drug test in Dagestan. They test Khabib, for example, in Dagestan. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2832.0s)]
*  I'm sure. I'm sure they must have. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2839.0s)]
*  And what if someone lands from USADA? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2841.0s)]
*  Was there an issue where some guys from USADA and Khabib's camp, they had like... [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2844.0s)]
*  They had some issue. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2849.0s)]
*  They had some, I remember, something like that. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2851.0s)]
*  You go over there and you want to get out, you got to be careful. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2853.0s)]
*  No, you get out. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2859.0s)]
*  But I would imagine that if you want to avoid being tested all the time, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2861.0s)]
*  like say, like if you are in America and you live in Arizona, whatever, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2865.0s)]
*  they'll visit you all the time. They'll test you a bunch. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2872.0s)]
*  There's some people that have been tested a bunch. They get tested a lot. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2875.0s)]
*  And then some people that don't get tested as much. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2878.0s)]
*  And if you're going to go and do your camp in Thailand, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2880.0s)]
*  or you're going to go do your camp in Dagestan, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2883.0s)]
*  it's a lot more difficult to get to you to test you randomly. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2886.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they can anyway. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2889.0s)]
*  So you can trust on if they come or not. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2891.0s)]
*  But there's short acting stuff. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2895.0s)]
*  There's like when Alex Rodriguez... [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2897.0s)]
*  Is that his name? A-Rod, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2901.0s)]
*  Yeah, when he was fighting, or excuse me, when he was playing baseball, rather, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2903.0s)]
*  they were taking gummies, testosterone gummies. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2906.0s)]
*  And the testosterone literally only lasts for a few hours. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2909.0s)]
*  And it's out of your system. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2913.0s)]
*  Wow. I never heard that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2915.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's certain stuff that you can take like EPO that's very short lasting, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2917.0s)]
*  very difficult to test, very short lasting. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2922.0s)]
*  In my case, I don't like that because I wouldn't feel good with myself. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2925.0s)]
*  I'm going to feel like I'm cheating. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2930.0s)]
*  I don't deserve the win because I'm cheating. I'm a cheater. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2932.0s)]
*  I can't have that thought about myself. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2936.0s)]
*  All the time when I walk inside the Octagon, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2940.0s)]
*  I feel that I didn't cheat and I deserve the win. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2943.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm going to win. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2947.0s)]
*  Well, that's why guys like BJ Penn are so impressive, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2949.0s)]
*  because BJ Penn was clean when everybody was cheating. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2952.0s)]
*  Because back then it was really difficult to test. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2956.0s)]
*  All they tested was at the weigh-ins. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2959.0s)]
*  So at the weigh-ins, that's like an intelligence test. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2961.0s)]
*  Like if you cheat and take steroids intelligently, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2964.0s)]
*  by the time you get to the weigh-ins, you're going to be clean. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2968.0s)]
*  If you do it with a doctor. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2971.0s)]
*  I know camps, and I want to say the names, but they had scientists working for the camps. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2972.0s)]
*  And the scientists, these doctors, would study guys' blood work [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2978.0s)]
*  and make sure that they were clean by the time they got into camp [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2982.0s)]
*  or by the time they got into the weigh-ins. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2986.0s)]
*  So when they were on the scale, they still had all the benefits of steroids, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2988.0s)]
*  but they had no steroids in their system. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2992.0s)]
*  And their body hadn't started to deteriorate yet from the lack of steroids. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2994.0s)]
*  I know some camps also that they use steroids. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=2998.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3001.0s)]
*  For me, you can have all the muscles in the world, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3003.0s)]
*  but if you are not mentally strong, because that's a so specific moment, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3006.0s)]
*  when you are in the backstage, you need your mind so badly. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3010.0s)]
*  You need it more than your body sometimes. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3016.0s)]
*  Because, as I told you, you can have all the muscles in the world, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3019.0s)]
*  but you need this muscle as strong as possible. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3023.0s)]
*  And if you know you cheated. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3026.0s)]
*  And if you know you're cheating, that you are not what you in reality are saying that you are, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3027.0s)]
*  that's a tough one. I don't want to see myself in that situation, never. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3036.0s)]
*  That's a champion's mindset. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3043.0s)]
*  That's a real champion's mindset. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3044.0s)]
*  Some guys, they just want to do anything to win. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3045.0s)]
*  They want to do anything to win. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3048.0s)]
*  And if they have to cheat to win, they'll cheat. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3049.0s)]
*  And they'll justify it by saying everybody cheats. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3052.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a God believer. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3055.0s)]
*  And my mindset is like, of course I want to win. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3058.0s)]
*  I prepare myself to win. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3063.0s)]
*  But if he destroys my plants, it's because maybe my plants could destroy me. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3065.0s)]
*  So I don't want to have anything because I want to have it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3071.0s)]
*  If he decides it, if God decides to give it to me, I accept it. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3076.0s)]
*  I will do everything to get it because I decide it from all my heart. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3081.0s)]
*  And if he says that if I decide it, I have the faith, I will get it. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3085.0s)]
*  And the reality is, if you give everything you have and you lose, you win a lesson. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3090.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3098.0s)]
*  And you realize you're not at the level that you need to be. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3099.0s)]
*  There's never a lose. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3101.0s)]
*  Or you win or you learn. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3102.0s)]
*  And learning is also a winning. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3104.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3106.0s)]
*  Where did you develop your mindset? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3107.0s)]
*  Have you got any mental coaching? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3109.0s)]
*  Did you read books on psychology? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3111.0s)]
*  I read a lot of books. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3113.0s)]
*  I try to read at least 30 minutes a day. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3115.0s)]
*  But it's every day. Every day. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3119.0s)]
*  What you do in your daily habits, it's what makes the difference. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3121.0s)]
*  Because we can decide our future, but we can decide our habits and our habits decide our future. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3127.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3133.0s)]
*  So what kind of stuff do you read? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3135.0s)]
*  I read more like... I read a lot of books. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3137.0s)]
*  I love reading books of self-development books. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3145.0s)]
*  Also, how can I tell you? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3151.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the most of the books I read. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3157.0s)]
*  Self-development books. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3162.0s)]
*  I read biographies of the people that I like. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3164.0s)]
*  For example, Donald Trump, Warren Buffet. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3169.0s)]
*  Businessmen? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3173.0s)]
*  Yeah, I try to. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3174.0s)]
*  Why do you read businessmen's biographies? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3176.0s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, right now I'm in sports, but at some point I'm going to retire. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3179.0s)]
*  I have to make a living from something, right? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3185.0s)]
*  Because I'm not going to be fighting my whole life. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3188.0s)]
*  And I don't want it even. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3192.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I want to prepare myself. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3194.0s)]
*  If you want to have an extraordinary life, you have to be an extraordinary person, right? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3197.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah, absolutely. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3202.0s)]
*  I'm trying to become an extraordinary person. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3204.0s)]
*  In all walks of life. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3207.0s)]
*  In all walks of life. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3209.0s)]
*  So do you have an idea of when you want to retire? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3211.0s)]
*  How old are you now? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3216.0s)]
*  Till I enjoy 28. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3218.0s)]
*  Till I enjoy, I don't know how many fights, maybe till 32, 34. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3220.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3225.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3226.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3227.0s)]
*  Till I enjoy. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3228.0s)]
*  Right now I'm enjoying. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3229.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3230.0s)]
*  So you'll take that road when it comes? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3232.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3235.0s)]
*  You'll find, when that happens, when you no longer enjoy, then you will go on a different path. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3236.0s)]
*  Then you will retire. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3243.0s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3244.0s)]
*  Right now I want to become a lightweight world champion. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3245.0s)]
*  I want to hold out Bell 2. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3248.0s)]
*  So I don't know what's going to happen then. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3250.0s)]
*  If I'm going to keep motivated, it's kind of difficult. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3253.0s)]
*  This is a fight game. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3259.0s)]
*  Fight game is so hard. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3261.0s)]
*  So hard because you have to go in and take someone's head off. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3263.0s)]
*  And you can't be that soft guy, you know what I mean? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3267.0s)]
*  Like that kind guy. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3271.0s)]
*  You have to be, you got to have that testosterone up. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3273.0s)]
*  You got to be vicious. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3276.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3277.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to be technical, you got to be smart, but you also have to be vicious. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3278.0s)]
*  And at the same time, everyone from my family is involved in my career. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3281.0s)]
*  You know, at some point, maybe I will end up doing different things, maybe some businesses. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3286.0s)]
*  Right now I'm doing different things and I'm enjoying it also. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3293.0s)]
*  So you're doing different things outside of fighting as well? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3297.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have a promotion in Spain right now. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3299.0s)]
*  Oh, an MMA promotion? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3301.0s)]
*  MMA promotion. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3303.0s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3304.0s)]
*  WoW. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3305.0s)]
*  WoW. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3306.0s)]
*  And the goal with WoW is to, because as you mentioned... [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3307.0s)]
*  What do you say, WoW? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3311.0s)]
*  How do you spell that? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3312.0s)]
*  Way of the Warrior. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3313.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3315.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3316.0s)]
*  So from Spain to get to the UFC before was so difficult. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3317.0s)]
*  I had to do so many crazy things to get to the UFC. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3322.0s)]
*  But right now we create WoW. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3325.0s)]
*  And actually we are in the UFC Fight Pass. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3328.0s)]
*  Everyone can get in that promotion fight if you have the skills. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3331.0s)]
*  If you are ready, someone is going to see you and they are going to sign you in the UFC. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3336.0s)]
*  The promoter's life is a hard life. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3341.0s)]
*  That's a hard job. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3343.0s)]
*  Yeah, you think so? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3344.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3345.0s)]
*  It's very entertaining to be honest. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3346.0s)]
*  When I talked to Dana, at least promoting for the UFC, like I was talking to him this weekend. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3347.0s)]
*  He was telling me all the issues that they're having. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3352.0s)]
*  And with different fights, I was asking him some questions like, what are you doing with this? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3354.0s)]
*  What are you doing with that? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3358.0s)]
*  And he starts telling me, this guy wants that and this guy wants to fight this guy. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3359.0s)]
*  Did he tell you something about me? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3362.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3364.0s)]
*  Maybe a little bit. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3365.0s)]
*  If he did, I can't tell you. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3366.0s)]
*  I did ask who you're going to fight. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3368.0s)]
*  And they said, we're working on things. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3370.0s)]
*  But he was actually specifically talking about what happens if Bilal wins. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3372.0s)]
*  You know, because Islam and Bilal, they've been talking about Islam fighting Bilal. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3377.0s)]
*  That's going to happen. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3383.0s)]
*  I would like that to happen if Bilal wins. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3384.0s)]
*  But that's an if. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3387.0s)]
*  Jack Delamattalena is a bad motherfucker. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3389.0s)]
*  He's good, man. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3391.0s)]
*  That guy's good. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3392.0s)]
*  Even if he wins, they're going to make that fight happen against Islam. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3393.0s)]
*  You think so? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3397.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3398.0s)]
*  Well, if Jack Delamattalena wins, then Jack is the new welterweight champion. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3399.0s)]
*  And, you know, maybe he fights Islam. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3404.0s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3406.0s)]
*  The problem with Islam fighting Bilal is that they train together. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3407.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, they had kind of said how many guys we see fighting [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3411.0s)]
*  fighting between each other that they used to train before. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3416.0s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3419.0s)]
*  I mean, I think they should fight. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3420.0s)]
*  Yeah, they should fight. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3422.0s)]
*  I definitely think they should fight. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3423.0s)]
*  I think Khabib doesn't like that idea. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3424.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3428.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3430.0s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3431.0s)]
*  But it's not just that. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3433.0s)]
*  I mean, Jane is always putting out a million fires. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3434.0s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3437.0s)]
*  They have 500 fighters on the in the roster at least. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3438.0s)]
*  And, you know, there's all these things that are happening and like like the Armand [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3442.0s)]
*  Sarukian thing, like his back hurts the day of the fight. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3446.0s)]
*  He's got to pull out. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3449.0s)]
*  This is fucking crazy. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3450.0s)]
*  This is you know what I mean? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3451.0s)]
*  Like imagine that you have this whole promotion based around this elite fighter [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3453.0s)]
*  who's who fought Islam in his first fight. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3457.0s)]
*  Short notice. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3460.0s)]
*  They go to a very close decision, very close fight. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3461.0s)]
*  Armand's gotten a lot better. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3464.0s)]
*  Islam's got a lot better. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3465.0s)]
*  Then they're going to fight again. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3467.0s)]
*  And then the day of he hurts his back. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3468.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3471.0s)]
*  Happens. Yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3472.0s)]
*  Crazy. Yeah. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3473.0s)]
*  But if you will be in the Danish place, who would be in the Danish place? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3474.0s)]
*  Who would be my next opponent? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3478.0s)]
*  Islam. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3480.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3481.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3482.0s)]
*  I wish they I try to tell them that this weekend. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3483.0s)]
*  That would be a great fight. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3486.0s)]
*  That's the that's the fight to make because you have a world champion versus a world champion. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3487.0s)]
*  Like if anybody deserves a fight for the world title in the next weight class, it's you. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3492.0s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3497.0s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3498.0s)]
*  You knocked out Max Holloway. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3499.0s)]
*  I mean, it's simple. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3501.0s)]
*  You knocked out Alexander Volkanovsky, one of the greatest of all time. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3502.0s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3506.0s)]
*  That's a no brainer. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3507.0s)]
*  That's the fight. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3508.0s)]
*  You know, he doesn't want to fight 45 anymore. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3509.0s)]
*  He wants to fight 55. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3511.0s)]
*  We're all tighter shot. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3512.0s)]
*  And nobody would argue with that. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3514.0s)]
*  That would be a huge fight. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3515.0s)]
*  Everybody would get excited about it. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3516.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3518.0s)]
*  Hopefully they they make that fight happen. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3519.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3521.0s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3522.0s)]
*  I don't have any say. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3523.0s)]
*  Like I said, I'd get rid of the cage. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3524.0s)]
*  I'd get rid of stand up. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3526.0s)]
*  I'd fuck everything up for them. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3528.0s)]
*  I would make it less marketable. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3530.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3532.0s)]
*  I would. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3534.0s)]
*  Anyways, if they give me the fight with Charles, it's going to be a good one. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3535.0s)]
*  That's a great fight, too. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3538.0s)]
*  That's a great fight, too. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3540.0s)]
*  There's a lot of guys in that division. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3541.0s)]
*  You know, there's there's a lot of good fights for you at one hundred and fifty five pounds. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3543.0s)]
*  Do you have a timeline of when you would like to fight at one fifty five? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3546.0s)]
*  I would like to fight with with Islam. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3550.0s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3554.0s)]
*  I would like to fight him. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3555.0s)]
*  But if they don't give you that fight, if they give you like a number one contender fight, when would you like to fight next? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3556.0s)]
*  I wouldn't fight for a number one contender fight. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3562.0s)]
*  Really? You only want to fight for the title? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3564.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3566.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3567.0s)]
*  OK, of course. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3568.0s)]
*  I understand. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3569.0s)]
*  That makes sense to me. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3570.0s)]
*  Look, also, it's the most marketable fight. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3571.0s)]
*  Everybody else is lost to him. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3574.0s)]
*  I don't care if Islam decides that he doesn't want to fight me. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3576.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3579.0s)]
*  I said till you're going to have to fight me. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3580.0s)]
*  OK, you say that you are the world champion. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3582.0s)]
*  You're going to keep dominating the division. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3585.0s)]
*  All that. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3587.0s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3588.0s)]
*  You can't keep avoiding me all the time. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3589.0s)]
*  So you would just sit on the sidelines rather than fight someone else? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3592.0s)]
*  I don't think that they're going to do that. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3595.0s)]
*  I don't think they would put me on a sideline because they asked me to. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3597.0s)]
*  I would keep the belt because I told them that I wouldn't fight in 145 again. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3601.0s)]
*  But I get the promise that I would fight for the title in my next fight. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3606.0s)]
*  So how much time you will stop me from the fighting? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3612.0s)]
*  So they did give you a promise that when you vacated the belt that your next fight would be for the title? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3618.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3622.0s)]
*  If they give that chance to everyone, why not to me? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3623.0s)]
*  They gave it to Henry Sejula, they gave it to Conor McGregor, they gave it to George Seypier, they gave it to everyone. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3626.0s)]
*  And I proved that I deserve that shot. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3633.0s)]
*  As you said, I knocked out two of the all-time greats. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3636.0s)]
*  To the greats, Wolk, who was dominating everyone in 145 division, and Max Holloway. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3644.0s)]
*  Great fighters, both of them. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3651.0s)]
*  Especially after Max Holloway's victory over Justin Gaethje, which was the greatest victory of his career. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3654.0s)]
*  To knock him out after that? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3659.0s)]
*  No one did it. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3661.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3662.0s)]
*  I'd say world title fight, but I don't get to make the rules. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3664.0s)]
*  And the last fight he had was in 155, against Justin Gaethje, who also fought for the title. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3667.0s)]
*  And the other thing is there's not really a compelling challenger in 155 other than you. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3674.0s)]
*  If you look at it, he's kind of cleaned out the division. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3681.0s)]
*  There's no one else. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3684.0s)]
*  Armand's got to build himself back up. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3686.0s)]
*  He's not going to get a title shot. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3688.0s)]
*  I would put Justin Gaethje against Paddy Pimblitt, me against Islam. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3690.0s)]
*  Once I pass him, I get the title, and you put me against Paddy. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3696.0s)]
*  Because I think that he's going to... [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3702.0s)]
*  You think Paddy's going to beat Justin Gaethje? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3704.0s)]
*  Easy. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3706.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3707.0s)]
*  Really easy. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3708.0s)]
*  Yeah, easy. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3709.0s)]
*  Really easy? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3710.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3711.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3712.0s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to say, because Justin Gaethje's a fucking animal. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3713.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he doesn't know how to grapple. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3717.0s)]
*  And Paddy knows that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3719.0s)]
*  But he's a Division I wrestler. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3720.0s)]
*  He knows how to grapple. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3722.0s)]
*  You don't think he knows how to grapple? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3724.0s)]
*  He just chooses not to. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3725.0s)]
*  He chooses to stand and fight. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3726.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3728.0s)]
*  Did you ever saw him submitting someone? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3729.0s)]
*  I don't believe he's ever submitted someone, but I think that's because he likes to just crush people. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3732.0s)]
*  He likes to bang it out and fight. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3738.0s)]
*  He used to fight in a very... [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3740.0s)]
*  What everyone likes is to dominate people and to win as soon as possible. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3741.0s)]
*  If you have the ability to submit someone as soon as you can, you would do it. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3745.0s)]
*  I think that's your mindset. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3751.0s)]
*  I think Justin Gaethje's mindset is to be the most violent person alive. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3753.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3757.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3758.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why he lost some fights early in his career, because he took unnecessary chances. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3759.0s)]
*  And he fought recklessly. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3763.0s)]
*  Then, as he adjusted later in his career, he fought more intelligently. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3765.0s)]
*  He took a lot of risks still, but he was more intelligent about it. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3769.0s)]
*  He was more intelligent about the way he approached fights. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3773.0s)]
*  Then he started winning and beating guys. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3775.0s)]
*  Where he might have thrown himself into wars before, like the Michael Johnson fight was just chaos, just a war. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3778.0s)]
*  The first fight in the UFC just throws himself into chaos. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3786.0s)]
*  I remember that fight. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3789.0s)]
*  Yeah, chaos. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3790.0s)]
*  He would just try to see... [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3791.0s)]
*  He was like Michael Chandler, but a better fighter. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3794.0s)]
*  Just more successful at it, at a high level. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3798.0s)]
*  So you pick Justin Gaethje over Patty? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3802.0s)]
*  I don't say that. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3804.0s)]
*  I do think that Michael Chandler was 38 years old with a lot of miles on him. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3805.0s)]
*  Although he's a fucking animal. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3812.0s)]
*  How old is Justin Gaethje? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3814.0s)]
*  Justin's probably 35. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3816.0s)]
*  How old is Justin? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3818.0s)]
*  35, 36, turns 37 in November. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3819.0s)]
*  That's when it starts to slip away. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3821.0s)]
*  If you're natural, everything after 35, this is one of the most extraordinary things about Alexander Volkovsky. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3824.0s)]
*  I don't think that he's the type of guy that takes care of his body all the time. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3829.0s)]
*  He's very strict with his health. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3834.0s)]
*  I think he slept more at day than at night. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3838.0s)]
*  Oh, you think so? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3843.0s)]
*  Do you think he parties? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3844.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3845.0s)]
*  They put the camera on him on the last pay-per-view and he looked like he was so high. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3847.0s)]
*  High I'm not worried about. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3854.0s)]
*  What I'm worried about is drunk. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3856.0s)]
*  Because high doesn't give you a hangover. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3858.0s)]
*  High doesn't kill your body. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3860.0s)]
*  Drunk kills your body. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3861.0s)]
*  If guys are in between camps getting fat and drinking, that's never a good sign. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3862.0s)]
*  That's a bad sign. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3867.0s)]
*  Because you're not just not training, you're deteriorating your body. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3868.0s)]
*  If Justin Gaethje is just smoking a little weed, I'm not worried about that. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3873.0s)]
*  It's not the best for focus. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3877.0s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be that guy that drinks a lot. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3879.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3881.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3883.0s)]
*  Cocaine is the worst. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3884.0s)]
*  When you hear guys doing coke, that's the worst. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3886.0s)]
*  That's the one that deteriorates you more than anything. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3889.0s)]
*  I never ever saw cocaine in my life. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3891.0s)]
*  Me neither. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3893.0s)]
*  I never done cocaine either. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3894.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, I had a friend whose cousin was hooked on cocaine. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3896.0s)]
*  I got to see it up close. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3899.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck that stuff. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3901.0s)]
*  That's a scary one for fighters too because the thrill of cocaine for some reason is exciting to people who love exciting things. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3903.0s)]
*  There's something about fighters who are adrenaline junkies. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3912.0s)]
*  They like to be pumped up. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3914.0s)]
*  Connor seems to enjoy it, which is one of the things that makes me think he probably won't come back. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3916.0s)]
*  But if he does come back, it's got to be now. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3922.0s)]
*  Again, at 36 years old now, Patty Pimlet. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3925.0s)]
*  That's the fight. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3929.0s)]
*  That's going to be a big fight. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3931.0s)]
*  Big, big fight. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3933.0s)]
*  But I don't even think Connor is in the drug testing pool anymore. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3935.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3939.0s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3941.0s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3942.0s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3943.0s)]
*  Why don't you Google that? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3944.0s)]
*  Find out if he's in the drug. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3945.0s)]
*  I think he pulled out of the drug testing pool. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3946.0s)]
*  I think he's going to come back. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3947.0s)]
*  You think so? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3948.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3949.0s)]
*  If they give the opportunity to, I don't know, to guys like, I don't know, at 40 years old, like Arlowski, you can have so many names that they fought at 40 years age. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3950.0s)]
*  Why not Connor? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3965.0s)]
*  I know that you want a world title fight at 155, but would you make an exception for a Conor McGregor fight at 155? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3966.0s)]
*  But right now? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3973.0s)]
*  Right now. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3975.0s)]
*  No. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3976.0s)]
*  No. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3977.0s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3978.0s)]
*  Do you think it's going to be excited if I beat Islam and then I give the chance to Connor? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3979.0s)]
*  No, I mean like right now, before Islam. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3985.0s)]
*  Like if the UFC calls you up and says, I know you want a world title fight, we guarantee you a world title fight after this. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3987.0s)]
*  Actually, we had that talks a little bit. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3992.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3994.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3995.0s)]
*  What was that talk? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3996.0s)]
*  Tell me what that talk was like. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3997.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3998.0s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=3999.0s)]
*  I did this one. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4000.0s)]
*  I'm going to get some calls. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4002.0s)]
*  You know how the UFC is. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4005.0s)]
*  They are very specific. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4006.0s)]
*  Don't say anything to no one. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4007.0s)]
*  Well, no one's listening. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4010.0s)]
*  You can tell everybody. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4013.0s)]
*  Only a couple of million of people are listening. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4014.0s)]
*  What up there? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4017.0s)]
*  What up there? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4018.0s)]
*  No one's going to notice. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4019.0s)]
*  It'll slip right by. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4020.0s)]
*  Yeah, if they offer me a fight against Connor right now, we'll see. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4021.0s)]
*  Why not? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4026.0s)]
*  Why not? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4027.0s)]
*  Why not? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4028.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say no. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4029.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say no. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4030.0s)]
*  Just for the numbers. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4031.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4032.0s)]
*  Cut of that paper too and it hits two million buys. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4033.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4034.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4035.0s)]
*  Why not? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4036.0s)]
*  That's the thing about Connor is like still, even though he might not be the best fighter in the world right now, he's still the he's the golden goose. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4037.0s)]
*  Of course he is. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4043.0s)]
*  That's something you can't take away from him. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4044.0s)]
*  He's kind of amazing. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4047.0s)]
*  You know, that's still he still guarantees that many eyeballs will go to see him. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4048.0s)]
*  You know, it just. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4053.0s)]
*  That will be a great one. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4054.0s)]
*  But what excites me more is the fight with Patty. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4056.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4059.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4060.0s)]
*  That fight excites me even more. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4061.0s)]
*  And if they could put that fight in Spain in the Baynaville Stadium. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4063.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4069.0s)]
*  I know that Dana doesn't like to to put the events in the stadium, but that's the only stadium in the world that they can close the roof. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4071.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4080.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4081.0s)]
*  And this prepare for that kind of how many people? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4082.0s)]
*  Eighty thousand. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4085.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4086.0s)]
*  You get a thousand in Spain. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4087.0s)]
*  Easy to get. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4089.0s)]
*  Not from in Spain. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4090.0s)]
*  No problem. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4092.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4093.0s)]
*  That would be insane. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4094.0s)]
*  I might have to go to Spain for that. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4095.0s)]
*  And a lot of people could travel from England to Spain. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4096.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4100.0s)]
*  And that happens very often. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4101.0s)]
*  But if they do it in Spain, it's got to be on Spain time. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4103.0s)]
*  They can't do that shit that they did when Leon Edwards fought. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4107.0s)]
*  It has to be in Spain time. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4111.0s)]
*  But I think that with the like the negotiations they they are having with ESPN and I don't know which platform they are going to put the UFC events. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4112.0s)]
*  They're going to ask for space for four or five who ends in Europe in the prime time for Europe. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4125.0s)]
*  Europe prime time. Europe prime time is fine because it's in the afternoon in America. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4133.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4139.0s)]
*  So the fights at one o'clock in the afternoon. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4140.0s)]
*  You people watch football games of a hundred million people watch a football game. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4143.0s)]
*  It still is to be a virgin market. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4146.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4149.0s)]
*  You've got five hundred million people in Europe. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4150.0s)]
*  It's more than the United States. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4154.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4156.0s)]
*  And if they did it on Netflix, everybody has Netflix. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4157.0s)]
*  Everybody has Netflix. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4160.0s)]
*  That might happen. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4161.0s)]
*  That's why they're in negotiation right now. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4163.0s)]
*  That will be a massive one in Spain in Spain. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4165.0s)]
*  I can't against that pimple. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4170.0s)]
*  What happened with you two? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4175.0s)]
*  Because I saw the video where you guys are yelling at each other. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4176.0s)]
*  Was it in a hotel or something? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4179.0s)]
*  Yeah. He said something about Georgia. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4180.0s)]
*  Oh, he said something about your country. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4183.0s)]
*  Yeah. What is that? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4185.0s)]
*  He said like now I understand why the Russians are bombing Georgia or something like putting bombs in Georgia. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4186.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4194.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4196.0s)]
*  Don't joke with that. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4197.0s)]
*  You can joke about me. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4198.0s)]
*  Say whatever you want to say about me. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4200.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4202.0s)]
*  He's a mushroom. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4203.0s)]
*  He is this. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4204.0s)]
*  He is that. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4205.0s)]
*  That. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4206.0s)]
*  Don't talk about war because you don't know how is it. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4207.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4211.0s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to say. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4212.0s)]
*  Don't say that. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4213.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4214.0s)]
*  So that was the beginning of it. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4215.0s)]
*  It just out of nowhere. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4218.0s)]
*  He said that he said that on Twitter. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4219.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4222.0s)]
*  He said that on Twitter. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4224.0s)]
*  Maybe he was too high, too drunk. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4225.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4229.0s)]
*  He was talking shit. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4230.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, it gets people to pay attention. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4231.0s)]
*  He's really good at getting people to pay attention. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4233.0s)]
*  You know, he is really good at that. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4235.0s)]
*  I mean, he could be the next Conor McGregor star like that kind of a star where the whole weird personality. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4238.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4246.0s)]
*  He has that. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4247.0s)]
*  Well, he's very disarming because people they see I talked about this in the last pay review. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4248.0s)]
*  I said I said it's a very sneaky trick because guys like you look at you the way you carry yourself week. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4251.0s)]
*  That's a fighter. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4256.0s)]
*  Like you look at that guy's a dangerous motherfucker. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4257.0s)]
*  But when you see Patty, he's dancing like this. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4259.0s)]
*  His hair is flopping around like he's in the Beatles. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4262.0s)]
*  You know, he's like he seems silly, but then he fucks people up. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4264.0s)]
*  And so I think people get confused. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4267.0s)]
*  He fucks people up like Michael Chandler. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4270.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4273.0s)]
*  But when he he he faced a real fight, who did he face? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4274.0s)]
*  Well, he hasn't faced anyone yet. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4277.0s)]
*  Like he fucked up Michael Chandler better than Charles Oliveira did. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4279.0s)]
*  It does in Charles Oliveira. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4284.0s)]
*  Even this what I was telling you before, like when you got 10 losses in your record, that's not one, two, three, four, five, six. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4286.0s)]
*  That's 10. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4296.0s)]
*  Like when you walk in with a guy that has 10 losses, the level of confidence is completely different. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4297.0s)]
*  It's completely different than when you walk in with a guy that it's undefeated. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4304.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4308.0s)]
*  He's a dangerous guy in the striking ground game. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4309.0s)]
*  Everywhere you look at him, he's a dangerous guy. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4312.0s)]
*  He never takes the loose. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4315.0s)]
*  That's a different mentality. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4317.0s)]
*  You've got to you've got to have to kill him to give up. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4318.0s)]
*  He's not going to even give up. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4321.0s)]
*  You've got to have to kill him. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4323.0s)]
*  In the case of Charles, if he finds some adversity, he's going to go to the ground. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4324.0s)]
*  He's going to sit and he's going to be waiting like till you end up the fight. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4331.0s)]
*  This is what I think. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4337.0s)]
*  This is what I feel. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4338.0s)]
*  This is what I see. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4339.0s)]
*  That was certainly the case early in his career. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4340.0s)]
*  I think things changed with him when he had a child. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4342.0s)]
*  Then he went on that run and became a champion. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4345.0s)]
*  And like when he beat Justin Gaethje, when he beat all those guys, he was he was pretty elite, man. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4349.0s)]
*  He was really fucking good. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4354.0s)]
*  When he beat Chandler, when Chandler beat him up in that first round, he came back in the second round and fucked him up. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4356.0s)]
*  Who? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4361.0s)]
*  Chandler. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4362.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you're saying. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4363.0s)]
*  I get it. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4366.0s)]
*  I get it. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4367.0s)]
*  Connor's been tested 11 times last year, five the year before, none this year. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4368.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4373.0s)]
*  He was tested this year? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4375.0s)]
*  None this year. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4376.0s)]
*  None this year. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4377.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4378.0s)]
*  11 times last year. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4379.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure if he's in the testing pool anymore. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4380.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4385.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4387.0s)]
*  You know, I've heard no plans. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4388.0s)]
*  You know, the UFC would tell me. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4391.0s)]
*  I would say what's going on with Connor? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4394.0s)]
*  And I don't even bring it up anymore. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4396.0s)]
*  I think with him, it's going to happen like instantly if something happens. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4398.0s)]
*  Well, that's crazy. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4402.0s)]
*  I mean, if he's going to prepare, he needs like a real long camp to really get his body back to fighting shape, like real fighting shape. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4403.0s)]
*  And he's got to remember, you know, what happened when he came back from boxing and then fought Dustin Poirier. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4412.0s)]
*  And it depends who he's going to face, because if you put him against me, he needs to die and be burned again. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4417.0s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4430.0s)]
*  When you think about like your division when you were the champion at 145, would he have been the fight that you would have won when he was in his prime at 45? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4436.0s)]
*  Would that be the number one fight that you would have wanted at 145? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4445.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4448.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4449.0s)]
*  My God, for sure. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4451.0s)]
*  He was a dangerous guy in 145. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4453.0s)]
*  He was so big. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4455.0s)]
*  He was big, dangerous. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4456.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4458.0s)]
*  He had the knockout power. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4459.0s)]
*  Smart. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4462.0s)]
*  One shot knockout power. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4465.0s)]
*  He had that. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4466.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4467.0s)]
*  When he would make 145, I remember that was back when the weigh-ins were literally right there. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4468.0s)]
*  You'd weigh a guy in and then they would cheer in front of the crowd. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4475.0s)]
*  Now the weigh-ins are early and it's a ceremonial weigh-in. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4479.0s)]
*  So when Conor would weigh in, he would look like deaf, deaf. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4482.0s)]
*  See if you can find the video of the weigh-ins with Conor McGregor versus Jose Aldo. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4487.0s)]
*  He looks like he was on a boat in the middle of the ocean for six months. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4493.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4498.0s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4499.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4500.0s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4501.0s)]
*  Look at that one right there with Mike Goldberg. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4502.0s)]
*  Click that one with Mike Goldberg. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4504.0s)]
*  Yeah, click on that. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4506.0s)]
*  My God. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4508.0s)]
*  Look how fucking skinny he looks. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4509.0s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4511.0s)]
*  His cheekbones. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4513.0s)]
*  He looks like he just got out of some Russian prison. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4514.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4517.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4518.0s)]
*  Bro, that one on the right is insane. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4520.0s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4522.0s)]
*  Fuck with muscles. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4523.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4525.0s)]
*  I wonder how much weight he lost. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4526.0s)]
*  I think he walks around in 185. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4530.0s)]
*  So he lost 40 pounds before he fought. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4534.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4537.0s)]
*  He fought also at the welterweight division, right? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4539.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4542.0s)]
*  Well, he fought Donald Cerrone, who was really not a welterweight either. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4543.0s)]
*  He was a 155-pounder. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4546.0s)]
*  But he wanted to fight welterweight when he came back. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4549.0s)]
*  When they were talking about Chandler, he said he wanted to fight at middleweight. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4552.0s)]
*  And Chandler was like, OK. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4555.0s)]
*  But part of me wonders whether he was ever really going to come back. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4557.0s)]
*  I really think that at some point he's going to come back because I don't think that he wants to leave the sport with a defeat. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4565.0s)]
*  I don't think. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4575.0s)]
*  I think that he's going to come back, try to get the win, and then retire in the octagon. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4578.0s)]
*  Well, I'd like to see that. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4583.0s)]
*  I'd like to see him one more time. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4585.0s)]
*  It'd be good for him to actually go to a real camp and stop partying. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4587.0s)]
*  It would be good for him, for his family, for everyone. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4592.0s)]
*  But at some point he's going to stop. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4596.0s)]
*  He's got a lot of legal problems, too. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4598.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on with him in Ireland. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4600.0s)]
*  But he's running for the president. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4603.0s)]
*  Well, they're talking about prosecuting him for old tweets, too. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4605.0s)]
*  Ireland is going crazy with their woke shit, with the restrictions and censorship. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4607.0s)]
*  The same way the UK is. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4615.0s)]
*  It's really scary stuff. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4617.0s)]
*  But they're prosecuting people for tweets. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4619.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4621.0s)]
*  England arrested like 4,000 people last year for posting things on social media. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4622.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4628.0s)]
*  What did they say? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4629.0s)]
*  You don't even have to say anything crazy. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4631.0s)]
*  You could just say, I don't want any more immigrants in my country. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4633.0s)]
*  And they'll fucking prosecute you. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4636.0s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4639.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4640.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4641.0s)]
*  That's not the freedom. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4642.0s)]
*  No, it's not at all. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4643.0s)]
*  That's not a free space. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4644.0s)]
*  It's totalitarian government. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4645.0s)]
*  And it's scary because they're using it to silence people, to silence people's opinions. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4647.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4654.0s)]
*  See if you can find what's going on with Conor. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4655.0s)]
*  Because there was something about Conor McGregor possibly being prosecuted for social media posts from, I believe it was, 2023. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4658.0s)]
*  Some recent posts that he had made where they were going to bring them back up and prosecute him for it. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4667.0s)]
*  And he had also the case with the rapids and all that. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4676.0s)]
*  And I think because he wants to run for president, of course then they're going to use the law to try to stop him. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4677.0s)]
*  Because look, he's very popular in Ireland. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4682.0s)]
*  And he might win. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4685.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, if these people think that their country is being invaded by migrants. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4686.0s)]
*  I asked some people from Ireland, like, what are the odds that Conor becomes the president? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4690.0s)]
*  They told me like, probably zero. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4695.0s)]
*  Conor McGregor will not face charges over social media posts made before and during the Dublin riots. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4698.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4704.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4705.0s)]
*  They said that about Trump too. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4706.0s)]
*  That Trump wasn't going to win either. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4707.0s)]
*  They said Trump wasn't going to win. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4709.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the fucking newspapers. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4710.0s)]
*  Everything was saying the chances are none. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4711.0s)]
*  No, but I asked to the people. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4713.0s)]
*  I didn't ask. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4715.0s)]
*  I didn't read the... [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4716.0s)]
*  Depends on who you're talking to though. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4717.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4718.0s)]
*  You know, it really depends on how he conducts himself. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4719.0s)]
*  To him. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4722.0s)]
*  Oh, to him. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4723.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4724.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4725.0s)]
*  They're like, no way. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4726.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4727.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4728.0s)]
*  Look, he should be fighting. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4729.0s)]
*  And he should be fighting while he can because you don't want to be 49 years old sitting back thinking if you could have just one more, could have got it together if I just stopped partying. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4730.0s)]
*  I really think that he's going to come back at some point, but we'll see. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4741.0s)]
*  There's also the problem with that shin. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4744.0s)]
*  You know, when a shin snaps like that, nobody really comes back from that. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4746.0s)]
*  He's fucked. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4750.0s)]
*  His body's fucked. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4751.0s)]
*  He's toy's fucked. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4752.0s)]
*  His chin is fucked. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4754.0s)]
*  His body's fucked. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4755.0s)]
*  With that much parties and drugs and all that, you're going to have to pay that price at some point. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4763.0s)]
*  And you are paying the price with your health. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4764.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4767.0s)]
*  Which is the dumbest thing you can do in your entire life. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4768.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4771.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4772.0s)]
*  Especially for an athlete. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4773.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4774.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4775.0s)]
*  He also suffered a lot with the weight cuts. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4776.0s)]
*  That's a big damage for your body. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4779.0s)]
*  That's also one of the reasons why I changed the weight class because I realized that my health is the most important thing in my life. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4781.0s)]
*  You can have everything in this life, but if you are not healthy, you don't have anything. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4790.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4795.0s)]
*  You know, when you're cutting that much water out of your body, you're essentially getting to death's door. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4796.0s)]
*  You're getting to death's door 24 hours before you fight. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4802.0s)]
*  At a world championship level, which is crazy. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4805.0s)]
*  You sometimes feel that you're really going to die. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4808.0s)]
*  I wasn't able to sleep in 48 hours at all because I was so dehydrated. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4812.0s)]
*  My body was so skinny and I was dreaming with water, with food, with everything. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4821.0s)]
*  I was. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4827.0s)]
*  My social media and Reels, everything was about the food. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4828.0s)]
*  Everything was about food. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4835.0s)]
*  At that moment, you don't give a fuck about anything material, about anything. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4836.0s)]
*  So tell me when you start. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4841.0s)]
*  So if you were going to make 145 on Saturday, what is your weight cut or on Friday? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4842.0s)]
*  What is your weight cut like for the week? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4847.0s)]
*  When does it start and what do you weigh before it starts? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4849.0s)]
*  So, okay. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4852.0s)]
*  Basically, I started weight cut since the first day I started the training camp, which is 12 weeks. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4853.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4859.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4860.0s)]
*  I'm on like very strict diet and I have only one cheat meal a week on Saturday, on Wednesday. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4861.0s)]
*  Whenever I choose it, I have just one cheat meal. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4869.0s)]
*  And at the same time, you have to perform at the highest level. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4872.0s)]
*  You have to train as a motherfucker all the time. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4876.0s)]
*  And you have like 1,800 calories in your body and you burn 4,000 calories. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4879.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4887.0s)]
*  So you are wasting so much energy, but you aren't getting back very low. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4888.0s)]
*  So that fucks with your mind. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4895.0s)]
*  That fucks with your mind. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4896.0s)]
*  And you don't feel happiness. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4898.0s)]
*  You feel like stress, depressed. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4901.0s)]
*  You don't find the happiness in anything. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4903.0s)]
*  They could bring you all the money in the world, but you don't give a fuck at that moment about anything material. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4905.0s)]
*  So you're doing it all through camp, but when you get to fight week, what do you weigh at? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4914.0s)]
*  We do the water load. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4919.0s)]
*  I start on Sunday with 8 liters and I don't have carbohydrates. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4922.0s)]
*  I don't have any sodium, salts and all that. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4928.0s)]
*  Do you drink distilled water? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4932.0s)]
*  Distilled water, yeah. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4934.0s)]
*  Oh, distilled? Do you know what I'm saying? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4936.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. Just normal water. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4938.0s)]
*  I'm not having carbohydrates, sodiums and fibers. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4941.0s)]
*  You say fibers? Fibers? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4946.0s)]
*  Yeah, fiber. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4949.0s)]
*  I only have fat and proteins in very small portions. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4950.0s)]
*  And I drink 8 liters on Sunday, then 8 again on Monday, 6 on Thursday, Wednesday. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4956.0s)]
*  I drink 4, I think. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4966.0s)]
*  And then on Thursday, I don't drink anything till Friday, till the weigh-ins. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4968.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4972.0s)]
*  And before the weigh-ins, I start the dehydration. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4973.0s)]
*  Like we do one session in the morning and I have to lose almost from 2 to 3 kilos [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4978.0s)]
*  and the rest I have to lose at night because I always like to go to the bed on weight. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4987.0s)]
*  I don't like to wake up in the morning and have to cut the last part in the morning on Friday morning. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=4995.0s)]
*  When did you start drinking wine before weigh-ins? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5001.0s)]
*  I did it twice in my career. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5004.0s)]
*  It was once in Las Vegas. I was supposed to fight with, I was fighting with Damon Jackson. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5007.0s)]
*  And I had like still 6 kilos or something like that. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5013.0s)]
*  That's a lot of weight to cut. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5021.0s)]
*  And the guy who was taking care of my nutrition, he called us and he told me, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5024.0s)]
*  drink wine, drink half a bottle of wine. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5031.0s)]
*  I'm like, you sure? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5034.0s)]
*  Yes, he told me because if you drink a liter of wine, you're going to wake up the next day [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5035.0s)]
*  if you don't put anything else in your body with 2 liters less. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5040.0s)]
*  Dehydration. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5044.0s)]
*  Yeah, because the alcohol, it's going to provocate the dehydration. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5045.0s)]
*  I did it and it works. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5053.0s)]
*  And after that, I did it in my next fight. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5056.0s)]
*  But then I was like, I don't feel good. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5059.0s)]
*  Doing this in the wake up. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5062.0s)]
*  This is kind of crazy. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5067.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5069.0s)]
*  It's fun because everyone wants to, I don't know, everyone is almost dying. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5070.0s)]
*  That night I was like partying with my team, so skinny drinking wine. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5076.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck we doing? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5082.0s)]
*  And after one day I have to face a monster inside the octagon. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5084.0s)]
*  It's an experience in life. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5090.0s)]
*  And so then you weigh in and then what is the rehydration process like? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5092.0s)]
*  So I used to drink the electrolytes until I don't start to pee. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5098.0s)]
*  I don't put any food in my body. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5105.0s)]
*  I drink almost for 3, 4 hours in small portions. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5108.0s)]
*  Right now we are so lucky that we have the Performance Institute. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5113.0s)]
*  We have great nutritionists in that program that help us to do it from the right way. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5118.0s)]
*  So I start drinking half liter of electrolytes, for example, let's say for 20 minutes. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5125.0s)]
*  I have to drink that. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5133.0s)]
*  I can't drink more. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5135.0s)]
*  Then one that 20 minutes passed, I have to drink the another bottle like that, progressively. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5137.0s)]
*  And so once you start to pee, then you allow yourself to eat food. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5144.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5148.0s)]
*  And what kind of food are you eating? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5149.0s)]
*  Most likely carbohydrates. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5151.0s)]
*  I don't use to eat any proteins because it doesn't help you at all to have a great performance inside the octagon. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5153.0s)]
*  Because the protein doesn't give you any glucose that your body needs at that time. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5164.0s)]
*  Everything you need is electrolytes and carbohydrates. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5178.0s)]
*  That's all you need, not even fibers. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5182.0s)]
*  So what kind of food? Like pasta? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5185.0s)]
*  Yeah, pasta. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5187.0s)]
*  How good does that taste after all that time? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5189.0s)]
*  Amazing. Amazing. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5191.0s)]
*  You could cook the pasta for me that day. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5193.0s)]
*  I don't know how good you cook, but it would be amazing. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5196.0s)]
*  Amazing. I don't care about... [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5200.0s)]
*  So you've gone so long without carbohydrates. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5202.0s)]
*  I have like almost a week and a half without carbohydrates. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5206.0s)]
*  And I'm struggling for 12 weeks because I have only one cheat meal. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5211.0s)]
*  So once I finish the cheat meal, I know that. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5216.0s)]
*  And one week, I'm not going to have another cheat meal. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5219.0s)]
*  So I'm going to have to eat whatever they tell me to eat. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5223.0s)]
*  Like I wake up, I know that I'm going to have two eggs with one slice of bread and I'm going to have to train. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5226.0s)]
*  I don't know how much in the morning and then in the afternoon I'm going to have to train again and I'm going to have the same food all the time. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5233.0s)]
*  And the good thing about that is that my wife, she was like a very important part in my last training camps because he made my diet more fun. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5241.0s)]
*  I didn't have to repeat the food all the time because when I was in charge of that, just imagine what I was eating all the time the same. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5258.0s)]
*  Just the same boring food, just get through the month. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5269.0s)]
*  Because I didn't even have like the opportunities that I have right now. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5272.0s)]
*  Right now I have a chef, I set up my home with everything. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5276.0s)]
*  Everything is so comfortable. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5281.0s)]
*  But before, I had to cook for myself, go to the supermarket, doing everything by myself. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5283.0s)]
*  And it was tough. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5292.0s)]
*  So all the foods weighed out, all the calories are measured. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5293.0s)]
*  Everything is very systematic. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5297.0s)]
*  So with this extra 10 pounds, how much better do you think you'll be able to perform inside the octagon? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5299.0s)]
*  Because I would imagine physically that's got to take a toll on you. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5306.0s)]
*  As good as your performances were, and they were spectacular, but as good as your performances were, your body could not have been operating at 100%. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5310.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5317.0s)]
*  You are going to see me at 155 that I'm going to touch someone and I'm going to take his lights out. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5319.0s)]
*  Even if I don't need to touch his chin, I just touch his head and it will explode. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5326.0s)]
*  I feel so powerful at that weight class, so stable in the ground. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5331.0s)]
*  Like, do you want to wrestle? Let's wrestle. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5337.0s)]
*  No problem. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5340.0s)]
*  I had the gas tank for five days, not five rounds. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5341.0s)]
*  Do you think that a lot of fighters maybe diminish their potential by competing at a lower weight class for too long? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5345.0s)]
*  It depends. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5352.0s)]
*  It depends. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5354.0s)]
*  Some of them yes, some of them no. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5356.0s)]
*  Because I think there are guys fighting at 145 that they could fight at 135 because they are smaller. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5359.0s)]
*  Like Jose Aldo. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5368.0s)]
*  I mean he was one of the best ever at 145 and really looks fantastic now at 135. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5370.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5375.0s)]
*  And says this is the first time at 35 in his career that he's ever taken nutrition seriously and had a dietitian. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5376.0s)]
*  At the same time, he was a world champion for so long. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5381.0s)]
*  And one of the best. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5385.0s)]
*  And one of the best. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5386.0s)]
*  May he would cut the weight at 135 and he wouldn't succeed at this level. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5387.0s)]
*  Right, because he wouldn't have the energy. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5392.0s)]
*  But Jose Aldo was big at 145 back in the day. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5394.0s)]
*  He would struggle to make 145 earlier in his career, but I just think he wasn't doing it the right way like you're doing it. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5397.0s)]
*  I think athletes of today are much more systematic about it. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5404.0s)]
*  And they have more information about the nutrition. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5407.0s)]
*  We got more help from the Performance Institute as they call you. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5410.0s)]
*  The UFC Performance Institute is incredible. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5414.0s)]
*  I remember when they first opened it I was a little skeptical. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5416.0s)]
*  I'm like who's going to use this? What is the big deal? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5419.0s)]
*  And then I went there I was like oh, okay. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5421.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5423.0s)]
*  This is amazing. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5424.0s)]
*  Without them you wouldn't see many of the fights that we have seen. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5425.0s)]
*  A lot of people would miss the weight. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5429.0s)]
*  A lot of people. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5431.0s)]
*  So at 155 you're going to be able to eat more. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5434.0s)]
*  You're going to be able to train more. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5438.0s)]
*  You'll be able to recover better. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5440.0s)]
*  Much better. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5442.0s)]
*  They're really taking care of you. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5443.0s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5446.0s)]
*  I can't wait to see it. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5447.0s)]
*  I can't wait either. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5449.0s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5451.0s)]
*  I want to fight. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5452.0s)]
*  So take me through what is a typical training week like for you. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5453.0s)]
*  How much strength and conditioning do you do? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5458.0s)]
*  How much do you concentrate on technique? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5461.0s)]
*  How much do you spar? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5464.0s)]
*  Outside or inside the training camp? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5466.0s)]
*  Let's go with outside the training camp first. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5468.0s)]
*  Outside the training camp I try to develop my skills in every discipline. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5471.0s)]
*  I try to not mix it up. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5475.0s)]
*  I don't train MMA at all. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5478.0s)]
*  I do boxing classes, wrestling classes. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5481.0s)]
*  I try to learn every discipline separately. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5484.0s)]
*  Why do you do that? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5487.0s)]
*  Because when the training camp comes I try to mix it up [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5489.0s)]
*  and polish everything that I have been able to learn till that moment. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5494.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5499.0s)]
*  Everything that worked for me in the wrestling and boxing [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5500.0s)]
*  and the places where I feel comfortable. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5505.0s)]
*  That's why I want to develop all the time my knowledge. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5508.0s)]
*  I want to get better all the time. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5512.0s)]
*  And I can get better if I only go and train MMA [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5514.0s)]
*  and I only drill the same things all the time. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5517.0s)]
*  My head is getting stuck. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5520.0s)]
*  I need to learn new techniques because I think that [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5524.0s)]
*  I have much more to learn in every discipline. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5529.0s)]
*  Like in BJJ you never end up learning. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5532.0s)]
*  All the time you learn new things, you see new things, you want to try it. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5535.0s)]
*  It takes some time. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5541.0s)]
*  That technique works for you when you're rolling with someone. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5543.0s)]
*  For example. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5548.0s)]
*  One thing is what you know and the other is what you do with what you know. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5550.0s)]
*  How do you know how much time to allocate to each specific discipline? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5555.0s)]
*  Because something like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, it's a never ending journey. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5560.0s)]
*  There's so many techniques. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5563.0s)]
*  There's so many different combinations of things you could do [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5565.0s)]
*  to a human body when you're grappling. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5569.0s)]
*  So the thing about me is you have to decide what kind of style do you want to have. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5571.0s)]
*  Do you want to fight from the guard? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5578.0s)]
*  How do you say guard? [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5582.0s)]
*  Do you want to pass the guard? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5584.0s)]
*  There are different styles, right? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5586.0s)]
*  But at some point I was fighting all the time from the guard. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5588.0s)]
*  I was doing the beating bolos, baby bolos, everything. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5594.0s)]
*  Because I needed to feel what the people feel when I'm passing the guard. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5598.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5604.0s)]
*  So the same thing with boxing, for example. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5606.0s)]
*  Someone has a defensive style, someone has an aggressive style but from distance. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5609.0s)]
*  Someone needs to cut the distance and work more in the body. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5614.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5619.0s)]
*  It's so difficult to explain to you. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5621.0s)]
*  You know what you're saying though? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5627.0s)]
*  I think one of your most impressive performances was Josh Emmett. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5629.0s)]
*  Because Josh Emmett, he's such a powerful puncher. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5633.0s)]
*  He's such a dangerous puncher. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5636.0s)]
*  But everything he throws you has murder on it, everything. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5638.0s)]
*  But you just kind of slipped and moved with everything and just systematically broke him down. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5641.0s)]
*  But you adjusted your style for his danger. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5647.0s)]
*  You adjusted your style for him and just dominated the fight. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5651.0s)]
*  I think that was one of the most impressive performances because it showed how skillful you could be. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5654.0s)]
*  Whereas imagine if Michael Chandler fought Josh Emmett. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5658.0s)]
*  It would be fucking madness. Just madness. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5662.0s)]
*  Two dudes just trying to murder each other. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5664.0s)]
*  Just fucking throwing the haymakers. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5666.0s)]
*  But what you did was you broke down what he was doing. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5669.0s)]
*  You found your openings. You started to get your timing. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5673.0s)]
*  You started to figure out, you put all his movements into your computer. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5676.0s)]
*  And then you rolled with everything. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5680.0s)]
*  Everything he threw you rolled with when he had big shots, you moved with them. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5683.0s)]
*  All his big shots were coming with the right hand. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5688.0s)]
*  He's the type of guy that ends up every combination with the right hand. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5693.0s)]
*  So everything I had to do, it's all the time I didn't have to exchange the punches with him. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5699.0s)]
*  I had to let him throw me all the punches, roll his right hand and then start with my combinations. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5705.0s)]
*  This is what I really did. I was hurting him with the calf kicks. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5711.0s)]
*  Then I was going for my combinations and long combinations all the time. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5715.0s)]
*  In MMA no one works the long combinations. No one. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5719.0s)]
*  They always used to do one, two, one, two, three. But no one does. One, two, three, three, four, five, six. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5723.0s)]
*  Like the Jai Herbert fight. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5729.0s)]
*  Exactly. Usually you're getting two punches. Everyone blocks two punches. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5733.0s)]
*  But after the second one, they put their hands down again. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5737.0s)]
*  Then is when I go again. Like one, two, one, two, three, four, five. Boom. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5741.0s)]
*  You are not waiting for that. And if I change the levels and I go in the head and the body, calf kicks, I go for the takedowns. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5746.0s)]
*  I mix it up, you get crazy. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5753.0s)]
*  It's interesting that you didn't start boxing until you were 17. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5756.0s)]
*  Because you're probably the best boxer in not just the featherweight division, but you might be the best boxer in the sport. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5760.0s)]
*  In terms of your movement and then your one punch power. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5767.0s)]
*  Your one punch power is pretty fucking crazy. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5771.0s)]
*  Which I think you either have or you definitely can develop it and it definitely is dependent upon technique. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5774.0s)]
*  But either you have power or you don't have power. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5779.0s)]
*  So did you always notice that? Like from the very beginning when you first started training? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5783.0s)]
*  I always had power. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5788.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5790.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5791.0s)]
*  It's a God given thing. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5792.0s)]
*  God given thing. 100%. I always had that power. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5793.0s)]
*  I remember myself without much technique, but I was connecting the punch and putting guys to sleep in the trainings. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5796.0s)]
*  And I wasn't that skillful guy. But I had that power. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5803.0s)]
*  But you were smart enough. See, this is the difference between like a Josh Emmett approach and your approach. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5809.0s)]
*  You were smart enough to realize that, OK, I've got this power, but now I need to develop laser sharp technique. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5814.0s)]
*  Of course. And I have to be able to find the moment. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5821.0s)]
*  I don't have to just throw it and believe that I have the power. If I connect it, I put you to sleep. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5824.0s)]
*  No, it's not if I. I'm going to connect you to that punch. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5829.0s)]
*  I'm going to work for that. And I'm going to find that specific moment to put your lights out. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5832.0s)]
*  And I know with everyone, even if in one fifty five, I know that I'm going to I'm going to be able to find that find that moment where I'm going to be able to connect that one punch or two or three punches. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5839.0s)]
*  Because sometimes it's not only one. I'm able to combine eight punches. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5851.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes you think that I'm going for your head and I'm going my main combination is to go to the body. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5855.0s)]
*  And I go to that with the liver shot. And that hurts also. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5863.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. And little by maybe I don't knock you out, but it takes a lot of cardio from you. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5868.0s)]
*  A lot of moments you start doubting yourself. You're getting like, wow, he connects me this punch in the chin. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5876.0s)]
*  I'm done. And you're starting to to to doubt. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5885.0s)]
*  And then the doubts kill you at the end. Yeah. It's like little by little, little by little. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5889.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's interesting how few guys really work the body well. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5895.0s)]
*  That's one thing about Jack Delamadelina is that he's a very good body puncher, which is one of the things that I think is very interesting about this fight with Bala Mohammed. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5899.0s)]
*  He's a dangerous body puncher. He's very good at mixing up and down. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5908.0s)]
*  No one usually used to attack the body in the UFC. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5912.0s)]
*  I don't know why. So such a beautiful technique to go to go and work the body, not only the head. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5917.0s)]
*  Everyone goes for the head. But there are also weaknesses in the human being's body, which is the body, especially with those little MMA gloves. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5923.0s)]
*  You know, everything cards. Yeah. And you're digging, digging into that rib cage. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5932.0s)]
*  But it's just it's interesting how the sport evolves. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5937.0s)]
*  And I think when a guy like you comes around that does mix things up so well and does have elite boxing, the next generation will also copy you. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5940.0s)]
*  They will copy your style, you know, because I think about the calf kick. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5949.0s)]
*  There was no calf kicks forever, forever. I don't know when they started with the calf. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5952.0s)]
*  Benson Henderson, Benson Henderson, Benson Henderson. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5957.0s)]
*  He was the first guy I ever saw do him. He was doing a lot. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5960.0s)]
*  And I remember pointing it out. He wasn't doing it as effectively where he was like crippling guys movement, but he was doing it a lot. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5963.0s)]
*  And then I remember when Dustin Poirier fought Jim Miller, Jim Miller almost took him out with calf kicks like Justin Poirier's calf was destroyed in that fight. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5971.0s)]
*  And then, you know, Dustin Poirier became a really good calf kicker after that. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5980.0s)]
*  And then it became ubiquitous. Everybody has to have a calf kick. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5984.0s)]
*  But it comes from Muay Thai. It comes from kickboxing. It comes from. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5987.0s)]
*  It sort of does, but in Muay Thai, they don't throw it very often. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5991.0s)]
*  It's not a common technique in kickboxing or Muay Thai, which is interesting. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=5996.0s)]
*  It's not as common as it is in MMA. It hurts so much. It's like a jab. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6000.0s)]
*  But for the legs, it's a jab. It also cripples your movement, which is terrible because you can't punch as hard because you don't have a left leg anymore or right leg, depending on what's forward. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6005.0s)]
*  At the same time, it distracts you a lot. Right. You know what I mean? It hurts so much. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6013.0s)]
*  Yeah, it hurts. It distracts you. You have to. You don't only have to think about the hands. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6018.0s)]
*  You have to think about also about the kicks. Well, Izzy said that when he lost to Alex Poirier, the first fight in the UFC, he said he wasn't hurt that bad with the punches. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6023.0s)]
*  He said he couldn't move. He said his leg was so destroyed. He said my left my left leg was so compromised I couldn't move. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6032.0s)]
*  And then in the second fight, when Alex when he knocked Alex out in the first round, he said, My leg was fucked already. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6039.0s)]
*  He's like he was getting me again. He's so sneaky with that calf kick because he throws it. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6046.0s)]
*  He's got that weird style. He stands. He's standing. Just kind of throws it out there and you don't even see it coming. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6051.0s)]
*  Yes, he's not twisting his hips. He's not. And it's still he hits so hard that he doesn't have to turn his body weight into it. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6056.0s)]
*  And he's still fucking you up. And at the same time, he had that muscle memory. He was like if he starts with the calf kick. Yeah, I'm going to be fine. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6063.0s)]
*  Yeah, he said that to me. He's like at the end of the round, I was like, Oh, this motherfucker did it again. I can't believe he got me again. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6072.0s)]
*  He's like my leg was fucked. And then he caught him with that right hand. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6078.0s)]
*  What's your all time favorite fighter to watch in the UFC? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6081.0s)]
*  Boy, I don't think I have one. I don't think I have one. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6085.0s)]
*  Top five. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6090.0s)]
*  You're in there. You're in the top five. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6092.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6094.0s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6095.0s)]
*  I'm always joking. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6096.0s)]
*  For real. Yeah, definitely. How could you not be? You knocked out two Hall of Famers, two of the all time greats. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6098.0s)]
*  Volkanovsky and Max Holloway are all time greats. Two of the greatest featherweight champions. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6106.0s)]
*  So if you're a great featherweight champion, you're the greatest in a division that probably has, if not the most skill. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6111.0s)]
*  There's like there's an argument for the most skill. I think it's 45 and 55. I think those are the two divisions that have the most skill. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6124.0s)]
*  So to be a champion at 45 or 55, you're a champion in the most skillful weight class. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6125.0s)]
*  Like look at 45. So many fucking killers at 45 now. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6131.0s)]
*  Like look what Jean Silva just did to Bryce Mitchell and he wasn't even ranked. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6136.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I mean, this guy's a motherfucker, man. You know, and these guys are coming up and they're so goddamn good. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6140.0s)]
*  And Yair Rodriguez, you know, you got these guys are so skillful. You got so much talent. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6146.0s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you about Yair Rodriguez. I'm not a big fan of him. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6151.0s)]
*  Yair? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6154.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6155.0s)]
*  No? Okay. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6156.0s)]
*  No, I don't know. I see him. He's the type of guy that you don't even need to take him down. He goes to the ground by himself. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6157.0s)]
*  I don't know. He's like very spectacular. The way he fights and the striking and the kicks he throws and all that. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6166.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not a big fan of him. I'm a fan of Wolk and Max Holloway. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6175.0s)]
*  Actually, they were the smartest guys that I ever faced inside the Octagon. I felt that they were smart. They had that fight IQ. They know how to fight. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6181.0s)]
*  Do you think Max Holloway made a mistake in going up to 55 and then back down to 45 again? Because he got big when he fought. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6191.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6197.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think so too. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6198.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6199.0s)]
*  Yeah. He looked too compromised. He didn't look healthy at 45. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6200.0s)]
*  He gets crazy for the title shot. He was like, take the gold. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6204.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6209.0s)]
*  Yeah. I understand it. I get it. I understand it. The guy who's the 145-pound champion, he knew it would be hard to make the weight, but he felt like he could do it. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6210.0s)]
*  The thing is he gained so much muscle to get to 55 to fight Gagey. He did it over a long period of time where he really bulked up well. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6220.0s)]
*  At the same time, I don't know. If he wouldn't try it, he would stay for life with the doubt that, if I... [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6228.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So another one is Pereira. Just because what he's done inside the octagon is so crazy. Two division world champions in a short period of time and hadn't been fighting MMA for but three or four years. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6239.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6253.0s)]
*  It was crazy. And it's also what he does when he hits people. What he did to... Well, basically what he does to everybody when he connects. His power is just different than what he did to Jamal Hill. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6254.0s)]
*  One left hook. Boom. And Jamal Hill, who's good at taking a shot, all of a sudden he's gone. He's just... There's something... Yuri Prochaska, that fight. The second fight was crazy. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6267.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6277.0s)]
*  He just like... He hits you one time. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6278.0s)]
*  That was with a head kick, right? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6280.0s)]
*  Head kick in the second round, but dropped him with a left hook. He was basically done after the first round because it was at the buzzer. He hit him with a left hook and then he drops and then the bell rings. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6282.0s)]
*  And then he knocks him out with a head kick in the second round. But he's just got this crazy style that's different than anybody else's style. And he's such a specialist. Such a kickboxing specialist. Two division world champion in glory. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6291.0s)]
*  And then goes on and becomes a two division special. And 37. He's older. He's an older guy to be fighting at such an elite level. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6307.0s)]
*  John Jones, definitely. John Jones is one of the greatest of all time. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6318.0s)]
*  And John, what do you think about him? He's going to come back? He's going to fight Tom? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6322.0s)]
*  Yes. I think he'll fight Tom. I think he'll hang out. You don't think so? [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6327.0s)]
*  No? Really? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6330.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6332.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6333.0s)]
*  For what? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6336.0s)]
*  For glory. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6338.0s)]
*  He already has the glory. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6339.0s)]
*  Yeah, one more glory before the lights fade. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6341.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6344.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think John's a conqueror. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6345.0s)]
*  He is. He's the best of all time. No one can say the opposite of that. He's the best. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6347.0s)]
*  Look, the guy developed a spinning back kick at 36. Did he have a spinning back kick his whole career? And then all of a sudden knocks out Stipe with a spinning back kick for the heavyweight title at 36, 37 years old. That's crazy. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6358.0s)]
*  And they showed me a video three days ago, four days ago. John, before the fight with Stipe, he was practicing that kick at the day of the fight. And he said something like, this is the kick. I'm going to knock him out with this kick. And the guy showed me the video. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6372.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Well, John's fight IQ is insane. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6391.0s)]
*  Insane. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6394.0s)]
*  Insane. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6395.0s)]
*  Insane. He's a smart guy. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6396.0s)]
*  And did a lot of his career partying, which is even crazier. Like, diminished his body, did coke. Like one of the things he said to Daniel Cormier, which is one of the coldest things anybody's ever said. He said, I beat you when I was on coke. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6398.0s)]
*  That's such a cold-blooded thing to say. It's so cold-blooded. It's so cold-blooded. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6414.0s)]
*  Crazy. He's so crazy. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6423.0s)]
*  He was so good. But he was so good, he was better than everybody in his division, so he didn't work hard. But then when he has to work hard, he's fucking terrifying. Like when he fought Alexander Gustafsson, barely trained. They said he barely trained. Barely was in the gym. They were really worried about him. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6424.0s)]
*  Greg Jackson said they were even considering not letting him fight. Like, you shouldn't be fighting. You're not training. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6439.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6444.0s)]
*  And then he guts it out in the final rounds, wins the decision, very close fight. Then they have a rematch. And in the rematch, he's fucking trained. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6453.0s)]
*  And then he just destroyed him in the rematch. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6454.0s)]
*  The first fight was very competitive. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6456.0s)]
*  Very competitive. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6458.0s)]
*  The second one, yeah, he dominated. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6459.0s)]
*  Not competitive at all. Yeah, when John is focused and John is in shape and training, he's the greatest of all time. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6460.0s)]
*  I think he fights Aspinall because I think it's going to be a lot of money. It's glory. And look, Aspinall is amazing. He's unbelievable. He's fast as fuck for a heavyweight. He's big. He can grapple. Black Belt and Jiu Jitsu. He's got knockout power. But he's never been in deep water. Ever. I don't even know if he's gone to a second round. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6466.0s)]
*  I don't want to say that he doesn't have any chance because everyone has it. One punch can change everything inside the octagon. Of course, we everyone think that John Jones is going to get it. But you can't count him out at all to Tom Aspinall. But I don't think that he's going to come back. Me personally. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6488.0s)]
*  What is this here? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6510.0s)]
*  One time, Andrei Lerovsky took him to the second round. That's it. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6512.0s)]
*  Oh, really? Wow. I don't even remember that. And then he TKO'd him. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6516.0s)]
*  That's four years ago. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6522.0s)]
*  That's kind of crazy if you look at his career. It's all one and two. And then in Bama, he had a two round fight. That's great, but it's also not great because he doesn't have any deep water experience. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6523.0s)]
*  You know, if you're fighting a guy like imagine if he fought Stipe when Stipe was in his prime, or he fought Kane, you can't have one round fights and expect to beat Kane Velasquez in a five round war because the chances are you're not going to catch him in the first round. And he's going to his cardio is just like an alien. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6535.0s)]
*  Yeah, but at the same time, you don't know how he's going to look at the fourth and fifth round. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6556.0s)]
*  Right. He might be great. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6561.0s)]
*  Sure, he might be great, but he doesn't have that experience. So in his head, you've got to think there's got to be some no matter how confident he is, there's got to be a couple questions. If you've never been to like John has no questions, right? There's no questions in John Jones's head. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6563.0s)]
*  He's gone through five round wars like the Gustafson fight five round ward no training wins. He knows that he's got what it takes. He's got heart. It's it's undeniable. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6577.0s)]
*  So there's no questions. But with Aspinall, it's like, yeah, he can get everybody out of there. He's got the confidence that he gets everybody out of there. That's for sure. Like he's got the confidence that he connects. He's so fast and athletic for a heavyweight. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6588.0s)]
*  And he's a legitimate heavyweight like Tom Aspinall is not making 205. He's big. He's big. He's a big fucker. He's big. So for him, you know, it's [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6601.0s)]
*  But John Jones is special. He's special. He is special. And he has that fight that he he's not that type of guy that he walks in and for example, I don't know, Francis Ningenu. You know that he he got that one punch power. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6612.0s)]
*  But he doesn't have the same level of fight that he was John Jones. Right. You know what I mean? With John is like if he feels that you are dangerous in the striking, he's going to grab your legs. Try to mold you a little bit in the ground. Then if you go in the second round with him in the striking, you're going to be tired. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6627.0s)]
*  It also beats the fuck out of your knees. That front leg side kick to the knee, the oblique kick to the knee. He's a bad guy. He wants to hurt you. He's trying to fuck you up. He doesn't care to go with the elbow with the knee. He wants to hurt you. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6646.0s)]
*  John when you know when he fought Tiago, Tiago Santos at the end of that fight, Tiago needed two knee surgeries. Both of his knees were destroyed and he was basically never the same fighter since ever after that fight is what happened with that guy. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6659.0s)]
*  Exactly. Never. We fought again after that and he left the UFC. But his his knees were never the same. He had multiple knee surgeries after that fight. Crazy. Both of his knees got kicked out. I mean, he was front leg side kicking the shit out of his knees. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6672.0s)]
*  And what about you used to train sometimes? Sure. MMA? Jiu Jitsu? Mostly Jiu Jitsu. I did Muay Thai. I started in Taekwondo. I would love to share some training with you. I would love to share some training with you too. I want to see what you do. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6687.0s)]
*  I watched you grapple with Marab. I was super impressed. I watched the video you grapple him. I'm like, anyone that could do that to Marab, like, holy shit. Because people think about you, they're scared of you're striking. But one of the things, like, you open up a lot of people's eyes in the Ryan Hall fight. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6701.0s)]
*  Because Ryan Hall was this weird puzzle. He was like this elite Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt who do a lot of strange things. Like he would turn his back to people. Crazy. And do weird things. Heel hook BJ Penn like that in the first round. With that Imanari roll. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6717.0s)]
*  Yeah. But when you dominated him like that, I was like, Jesus Christ. And then you put his lights out. I was like, wow. Because people think, when people see a guy who can strike like you do, they kind of forget about the ground game. They forget that your ground game is very elite too. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6731.0s)]
*  Which is really interesting because you tend to put people in categories of danger. But with you it's all danger. You have a very well balanced game. Which is unusual. Like Pereira, for instance, doesn't have a balanced game. His game is he's going to connect and you're going to wake up. That's all it is. His game is kickboxing. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6749.0s)]
*  But your game is like it's everything. It's all over the place. You know, like the Bryce Mitchell fight. It's everywhere. It's stand up. It's the ground. It's comprehensive. It's like Georges Saint-Pierre when he was in his prime. It was coming from all different angles. You never knew if he was going to take you down. You didn't know if he was going to strike with you. It was all, your mind was overwhelmed with possibilities. Which is, in my opinion, what I like to watch. That's what I like the most. A guy who can do everything. I love specialists. I love like Damien Maia. Because when Damien Maia was in the game, he was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6772.0s)]
*  I would get you, he would clench you. Like, oh, you're fucked. To this day, the one fight that drives me the most crazy where a referee fucked it up was Kamaru Usman and Damien Maia. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6802.0s)]
*  Because in the first round, Damien Maia had Kamaru Usman's back standing up, had one leg laced, had his back, but it was taking too long and the referee separated them. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6813.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you motherfucker. He's so close. He's so close. This is it. Look at this shit. Like Kamaru Usman's in deep shit here. He's in deep shit here. And the referee fucking separated them. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6824.0s)]
*  This is crazy. This, this referee, this drives me nuts. Back it up a little bit. Back it up a little bit. Because it's before this. It's before this. So like once he finally secures it, go a little bit before that. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6841.0s)]
*  A little bit before, a little bit before, a little bit before. Do it right from the moment where they clench up. Okay, right here. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6857.0s)]
*  So as soon as he clenches up and he ties that leg, as soon as he gets his hands together, Kamaru is in deep shit right here. Deep shit. Kamaru has one loss on his record and that's by rear naked choke. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6867.0s)]
*  And now he's grappling with one of the best to ever do it. To this day, this fucks me up. This is one of the reasons why I hate when they separate fighters. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6878.0s)]
*  I hate when they stand people up and I hate when they separate fighters. This is a huge mistake here by this referee. Because you've got one of the greatest ground specialists of all time. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6888.0s)]
*  Do you think that he was the most dangerous guy in the ground? Yes. In his prime. In his prime, he dominated people. He's just so close, man. Kamaru is in real trouble here. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6899.0s)]
*  The way his arm is compromised behind his back, he's fucked here. You gotta get out of this. You can't get separated. Just because the crowd's booing, the referee's like too involved. Get the fuck out of there. Get out of there and let him work. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6911.0s)]
*  Because if he gets to the ground, Kamaru might be fucked here. And there's two minutes to work. There's plenty of time to this day that drives me nuts. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6926.0s)]
*  I think he's doing something very interesting there with his left. With the butterfly. Yes, with that left butterfly. He's constantly keeping you off base. And you know that if you make any mistakes here, that right hook is coming over, the arm's coming over the top. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6935.0s)]
*  As soon as he lets go of that arm, that arm that he's got trapped with his left arm, as soon as Kamaru gets that arm over the top of the shoulder, Kamaru's fucked, man. This is a terrible spot to be. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6948.0s)]
*  And for the referee to separate them and not let him work, I was talking to Matt Serra about it the other day. And he was like, yes! They fucked them! Yeah, he fucked them. They fucked them. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6964.0s)]
*  And Kamaru wins this fight and then the world changes. It changes. Because this could have been a loss. And then Kamaru could have been back to the drawing board. It's a bad situation to be in with the ground. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6974.0s)]
*  See, look, now he has this advantage of being able to stand up again. Why? Why does he have this advantage? You should be back where you were. There's no reason to separate those guys. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6987.0s)]
*  Referee mistakes are crazy. You know, like, there's moments in fights where referees make mistakes where a fighter's whole career just changes, just flashes before their eyes. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=6998.0s)]
*  The other day also something happened in the paper, in the car with Dan Eagher. Yes, yes. I don't know why he stopped the fight. Yes, that was a bad decision too. That was bad as well. Same thing. Sean Woodson, yeah. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7013.0s)]
*  I think he would win the fight anyways, but he didn't have to stop the fight. It was a bad stoppage. Yeah, there's bad stoppages, man. I mean, it happens. It happened to Jared Cannonier. Jared Cannonier had a bad stoppage. I guess, who was that against? Was it Imamo? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7027.0s)]
*  The worst stoppage? The Robbie Lawler against Ben Askren? Oh yeah, that was the worst one. That was the worst one. They thought he was out and he wasn't out. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7046.0s)]
*  I was so excited for that fight. Yeah, Robbie was beating the fuck out of him too before that headlock. Yeah, that was terrible. That was a bad stoppage. Yeah, there's been some bad stoppages. But, you know, look, the referees have the second hardest job in the sport. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7056.0s)]
*  The first hardest job in the sport. Yeah, here it is. This is Jared Cannonier and Imamo Volf. So he gets cut. Look at that right there. That's crazy. That's a crazy stoppage. He stopped the fight? Why? Yes. No. Yeah, look at this. He got hurt. He got hurt, but he's covering up. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7069.0s)]
*  And by the way, Jared Cannonier can fucking take it, man. He comes back. Jared Cannonier came back against Rodriguez in his last fight. He was hurt way worse than this and he came back to score a knockout. But that was a crazy stoppage. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7085.0s)]
*  It just, you know, like I said, referees have the second hardest job. Fighters have the first hardest job. Second hardest job is being a referee. Because those moments when you make a decision like, you can't take it back, the fight's over. That's true. It's terrible. It's hard to be a referee. Yeah. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7100.0s)]
*  And then there's the judging. Some judges. The judging. Yeah. That's also something that drives me crazy. It's like, how do they keep having the same bad judges come back again? That's what's crazy. Because the UFC has no control of the judges. The judges are all established by the athletic commission. Yeah. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7118.0s)]
*  So sometimes you get great judging and like, oh, the judge is good tonight. These are good decisions. And sometimes you get what the fuck is going on? Yeah. Sometimes judges are horrible. Horrible. Doesn't make any sense. You never know if they give you more points for wrestling, for striking, for defending. Right. It's crazy. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7138.0s)]
*  Some judges just aren't qualified. They don't have a martial arts experience. They don't have a background. You know, they just learned how to judge. I don't think you can do that. It's like, I don't speak Spanish. But if you taught me some Spanish and then I was judging Spanish, would I? You know what I'm saying? I'm not qualified. Right? You are not. Right. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7159.0s)]
*  So if you have a guy who doesn't really understand who's got the dominant position, like maybe you see a bullshit guillotine that has no chance. It's not like they never fought. It's they not even never trained. Right. Exactly. Most of them. I remember early on in the UFC, one of the judges turned to one of the people next to this person. It was a woman. She turns to this person. He goes, what is he doing? Norway. Yeah. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7180.0s)]
*  What is he doing? Someone was trying to get a Kimura. She's like, what is he doing? She didn't know what a Kimura was. So how did they get there? They were boxing judges. So the boxing judges, they started using them for MMA fights with no martial arts experience at all. Never, never stepped on the mat, never put in a mouthpiece, never got punched in the face. That's crazy. That's crazy. They don't know how it works. And it's they're judging at a professional world championship level at the highest level. It's crazy. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7210.0s)]
*  It's crazy. It's crazy. I think they should have more judges. Let me ask you something. What do you think was the decay of success of the UFC? Like it was Dana White. It was the matchmakers. It was the fighters. It was the promotion. What it was. I think the big thing was the ultimate fighter. I think everybody kind of agrees with that. The ultimate fighter reality show. What what made the UFC huge was that first season of the reality show, because this was 2005. So reality shows [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7240.0s)]
*  were really popular back then. This is you know, survivor and fear factor. And there's always reality shows and Big Brother. And so they had this reality show that people are watching with fighters. And then they have the finale. And in the finale, Forrest Griffin fights [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7270.0s)]
*  Stefan Bonner, and it's such a crazy fight that people are just telling their friends that the ratings were going up as the fight went on. And, you know, the Fertitas, the people that own the UFC before this current company, they were in the hole $40 million. And they just kept losing money. And they said, Listen, this is the last they were going to sell the UFC at one point in time. And then they got to this point where they're like, Look, let's just try this one more thing. Let's just try this one more thing. And they they [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7283.8s)]
*  did this, this reality show and the reality show worked and then 2005 and then they had Chuck Liddell. And Chuck Liddell was the perfect poster boy for this new cage fighting thing is fucking maniac with a mohawk and a tattoo on his head. And he's just crushing everybody. You know, he was the perfect guy because the fights were so exciting. And he had this insane style, this insane almost like Michael Chandler style, but but entertaining style. Very, very entertaining. Just warrior was a good boxer. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7313.8s)]
*  Good striker fast hand. Yeah, fast hands, vicious knockout power. And he was a wrestler. But he didn't wrestle any he was a heavyweight, light heavyweight. Yeah, big guy. Yeah, he was light heavyweight, big guy, chaos people with one punch. And you know, it was perfect for the sport. Because like he was so exciting. And he looked the part he was like a maniac. And after we'd win, he'd go run around the cage. So exciting. So he was the poster boy. He was the guy he was the guy that put the sport on the map because people would watch. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7343.8s)]
*  Him to go. Yeah, that time, like timeline of MMA was so fun. It was rampage Jackson also. Oh, yeah. And then when rampage Kato him, you know, he became the man and, you know, and then John Jones comes along and you know, it's like the sport. That's what's crazy about John, right? John has been dominant now for like, what, 1516 years? Yeah, that's nuts. That's why I say he's the best. He's the goat. He's the goat. I don't know how they don't pull him as the number one pound for pounds. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7373.8s)]
*  You know, it's just because he doesn't fight as often as Islam. You know, Islam's defended his title more recently, more often against top flight competition. Whereas John's, you know, John takes a year off. Does a year off here, year off there. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7403.8s)]
*  But when you look at the overall record, the overall career, he's the greatest of all time. But when I when I talk about like just technique, you got to listen. The other thing about Mighty Mouse to man, Mighty Mouse in his prime was a bad motherfucker. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7417.8s)]
*  He would do shit to guys like suit when he suplexed Ray Borg and caught him on an armbar in the middle of the air and finished him. You don't think so? I see your face. I see your face. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7432.8s)]
*  No, no, no. It's not like I don't know. I never was a big fan of him. No, no, no. I think when you call yourself a Mickey Mouse, Mighty, Mighty Mouse. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7442.8s)]
*  So I always thought that he was a Mickey Mouse. Bro, how the fuck you calling yourself a Mickey Mouse? No, he was a good fighter. He was a good fighter. He was a very technical fighter. He dominated the whole division. How many times he defended his belt? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7459.8s)]
*  Many times. Fourteen times. Many times. He fucked a lot of people up. But then there's an issue where the quality of the competition in the 125 pound division back then was not at the level that it is now. Like Pantoja, he's a bad motherfucker. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7474.8s)]
*  I would have loved to see Alexandre Pantoja versus Mighty Mouse in their prime. Pantoja is a fucking animal, man. That guy's a fucking animal. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7492.8s)]
*  There's a guy coming up in 125. He fought in the last paper in London. His last name is Kamana in the 125. He's going to be a problem in that division. He's a very skillful fighter. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7501.8s)]
*  Well, I think like all weight classes, now you have the best fighters of all time. Because we see guys from the Dana White Contender Series now that are coming along that enter into the UFC for their first fight. And you see these guys like, Jesus Christ, this guy looks like he has 15 pro fights in the UFC. They look elite. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7514.8s)]
*  That's a cool program also, Dana White Contender Series. That's something cool because they have some story behind them before they get to the UFC. And that's cool. And actually, they make a good matchmaking also for that fight. I like to see sometimes Dana White Contender Series all within some fight nights. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7534.8s)]
*  Yeah, you get to see guys. Well, that's where we found Sugar Sean O'Malley. You get to see guys. I prefer that to the Ultimate Fighter because I don't want to watch all the in the house bullshit and all the games that they play. I don't care about all that. I don't care. I just want to see them fight. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7557.8s)]
*  Not anymore. But before it was very entertaining. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7572.8s)]
*  In the beginning. Yeah, in the early days. But now they're on season 2000. There's been so many seasons. I can't even keep track. I forget who won. There's so many seasons. But my point is that the caliber of new guys when they're just entering the... Like Mauricio Ruffi, perfect example. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7575.8s)]
*  Yeah, you see this guy first fight in the UFC. He's fucking huge. You see this guy first fight in the UFC. You're like, Whoa, this guy is elite already. You know, same thing with Jean Silva. Elite already. Like these guys, they're entering into the sport at a very Carlos protest. Same thing. Like right away. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7595.8s)]
*  Like you're seeing like a very high level right away. And I just think that because there's so many guys like you to watch, there's so many guys like, you know, Hamza and all these people, you get to see elite talent. So these young fighters that are coming up, they have a higher level to aspire to. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7615.8s)]
*  That's true. Now, like the sport is growing that the talents are better than before. Yeah, because the sport has developed so much that right now you have so much experience. You can learn so much about the game. Like even in YouTube, you go on YouTube, you can learn everything by yourself. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7638.8s)]
*  I think in the future, guys like you will be everywhere. There will be only guys like you at world championship level. I don't think there'll be any specialists anymore. I think there'll be guys who are elite everywhere. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7656.8s)]
*  Elite everywhere. This is what I was saying like all the time. Now it's time for the new generation. What's the new generation that if you want to want to be the best, you have to be the best in everywhere that the fight takes the place. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7668.8s)]
*  And the ground and the wrestling and the striking, you have to be good everywhere because that's how the sport is developing right now. Because before you were good only in wrestling, you would take people down and not probably you could become a world champion. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7684.8s)]
*  But right now, so tough, so tough. The competition all the time is higher and higher and higher. And there's more knowledge in the sport. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7702.8s)]
*  Yeah, there really is. It's very inspiring and it's very interesting because there's no other sport where you could go back and look at it from 1993 to 2025 and it's almost like a completely different sport. The athletes are so much better than they were. I mean even from like 2000. Go back to 2000 and watch the sport and then watch it today, at least in the UFC. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7712.8s)]
*  It changed a lot. Everything. Even the production. Everything. Changed everything. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7737.8s)]
*  I mean it's so interesting because it's the one sport also that translates to all languages. Like everybody understands it. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7745.8s)]
*  But UK is so special because you saw the sport growing since nothing and you saw so many great fights in front of you. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7755.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very lucky man. I feel very fortunate. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7765.8s)]
*  What about you? Do you have a plan where you want to retire or you are just enjoying and you love what you're doing? Because I think that it's a, I don't know, you are enjoying a lot. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7768.8s)]
*  Yeah, I just enjoy it. I don't think about retiring. No, no. If Dana White quits, I might quit. But that's it. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7779.8s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7784.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's actually my contract. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7785.8s)]
*  No. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7787.8s)]
*  Yeah, if he leaves, I leave. Yeah, so in my contract if he leaves, I don't have to stay. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7788.8s)]
*  Why that? Something personal? [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7794.8s)]
*  I wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't for him. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7797.8s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7799.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's my friend. He talked me into doing it. I mean I started working for the UFC before him. I started working for the UFC in 1997. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7800.8s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7807.8s)]
*  And it was nothing. Nobody was watching. We did it at a small, like a high school auditorium in Dothan, Alabama. You had to take a propeller plane to get there. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7808.8s)]
*  Like, wow. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7817.8s)]
*  What is this? Like, scary ass planes. And that was the first time Vitor fought. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7818.8s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7824.8s)]
*  I was actually training at the same gym as Vitor when Vitor made his debut. Vitor was 19 years old. And we were at Carlson Gracie's. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7825.8s)]
*  He started very young. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7831.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We were at Carlson Gracie's gym in Hollywood, Hollywood, California. That's where I was training. Just dumb luck. I was a white belt. I had just started. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7832.8s)]
*  So how old you were when you started like training or you had some relationship with the sport? [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7840.8s)]
*  Well, jujitsu. Well, martial arts I started when I was 15. Well, I started when I was 14, but really seriously when I was 15. And then I competed in taekwondo from 15 to 21. And then I kickboxed until I was 22. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7845.8s)]
*  And then I was doing comedy at the same time. And then I realized like I was half in, half out. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7858.8s)]
*  Something crazy about you is when I hear you explaining some positions, I'm like, this guy has to know how to fight, how to do it. Because the way he is explaining it, I couldn't be able to explain it. And I'm a world champion. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7863.8s)]
*  I know the game, but you explain like way better than anyone else. I think that you put 10 world champions together. You still explain much better than all of us. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7878.8s)]
*  Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I learned how to explain it because I learned how to teach people that didn't know what was happening once it went to the ground. Right. Because in the beginning, nobody understood the ground game. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7889.8s)]
*  Exactly. You know, and I'm a black belt jiu jitsu. So when it goes to the ground, I can explain what's happening. Very specific. Yes. Well, you have to be specific because some people don't know. Like sometimes I'll be watching with my wife at home. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7900.8s)]
*  Like we watch a fight that I'm not calling and she's like, what's going on? And I'd be like, his right arm is in trouble right now. Like, see, see what is he where his elbow is? Now, if he can get his elbow past this point, he's fucked. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7913.8s)]
*  Okay, now he's fucked. And then I would explain it and I would say, now what he's going to do is going to take his right leg. He's going to wrap it up with the top. Oh, he's got it. Oh, he's got. Okay. He's going to cinch the left leg over the top. That's it. That's it. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7924.8s)]
*  You're the best. Yeah, but that's it's just I it's you can't live it. Passion. Yeah. Either you love it or you don't love it. And if you don't love it, you can't pretend it won't work. No one's going to believe you. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7934.8s)]
*  If you're just a regular sports guy, say like you call hockey and they hire you, you're going to learn about MMA and you're going to call MMA. Come on. Come on. There's no you're not going to be able to do it right. Of course. You got to do it like you like if I was calling hockey. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7947.8s)]
*  I'm like, yay, this fucking puck went in the net. Woo. I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit if the puck goes in the net. It doesn't mean anything to me. But when someone gets your fucking neck, you can see the guys you got to tap. He's happy that that to me is life. That's everything that is like it's not just winning. You're not just winning. You killed that guy. We can say that. Yes, you. We can see your passion. Yeah. Like even right now. I'm here. I feel your passion. I feel your passion. Yeah. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7961.8s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=7991.8s)]
*  And when was the moment maybe I'm going like to the but I wanted to ask you this like when was the moment when you feel like I'm succeed in life I feel that I'm having success and what's for you actually success like how do you describe it. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8021.8s)]
*  Well, I guess the moment was when I didn't worry about success anymore. I don't think about success. I think about what do I enjoy doing and am I doing it the best that I can do it. That's what I think about. I don't think oh, I'm going to make more money. Oh, I'm going to do this and I want to do I want this goal and that goal. I'm a process oriented person. I think about the process of what I'm doing and then the results come. So I think like what am I doing? Am I doing what I want to do? [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8038.8s)]
*  Am I doing it the best that I can do it? And if I'm not a better or you better either quit if I don't want to do it anymore. If I like this why I stopped fighting. I was there was no money in fighting when I was fighting. There was no money. There was no UFC and I was just getting brain damage for no reason. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8068.8s)]
*  I was sparring and having fucking headaches every night. I was like what am I doing with my life? And then I would also meet guys in the gym that were punch drunk and they those guys scared the shit out of me. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8084.8s)]
*  Back then everybody was stupid too and like in you know this is 1989 everybody was stupid. They just beat the fuck out of each other. They didn't there was no like sparring you know like technical sparring. It was just wars. It was just fights always fights. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8092.8s)]
*  Got you. And there was no future and I still like that in some gyms. Yeah a lot of gyms a lot of gyms. You know some gyms are intelligent but there's a lot of gyms that are stupid. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8107.8s)]
*  I don't use to spar at all. Really? Yeah I don't spar only in training camps. But I see you spar in training camps so it's only in training camps. Only in training camps. So when you're not in camp what do you do? [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8117.8s)]
*  I do like as I told you sparring maybe in boxing but before I used to go like more crazy than now. Because before I had like more ego I wanted to prove myself like I can knock you out. I can submit you. I can do this. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8130.8s)]
*  And like once like you're winning fights you're growing as a person. You're like I don't need to prove anything here in the gym. I know what I'm able to do in the competition is the day when I have to fight. The fight that's the day when I'm when I'm get paid and that's it. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8147.8s)]
*  I'm not gonna gonna damage anyone no more because sometimes you knock people out and then you go back home and you feel bad. You're like I could not doing it. Right. And he's suffering right now. I sent so much people to the hospital. So much people to the hospital. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8166.8s)]
*  I'm sure I've seen a few videos. I opened so much damage that right now I'm like no no no. Sometimes people comes to me like let's spar. I'm like I recommend you to know. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8187.8s)]
*  I recommend you to not. Yeah that's good advice. Yeah it's interesting right. It's like your ego can help you because your ego is what makes you want to be great. But at a certain point in time you got to put a leash on it. Yeah you got to say not not right now motherfucker. Not right now. When I let you go when I say sick him then I'm gonna let you off that leash. But not right now. And like that's Marcello Garcia always used to say that about Jiu Jitsu that you have to always be a good fighter. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8202.8s)]
*  Open up your game in the gym and don't be afraid of being tapped. He goes you got to be open. You got to take chances in the gym and learn and put yourself in bad positions on purpose. And you might lose training sessions but that's not what's important. What's important is growing. I see a lot of guys struggling with that. Like they don't want to lose in training. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8232.8s)]
*  Well a lot of guys never develop a guard because they never want to be on their back. There's a lot of guys like that. They have no fucking guard. Which is crazy. It's crazy. There's black belts out there that they get them on their back like a turtle. Because they don't want to lose. Exactly. They don't know how to lose. If you tap out no problem. You get better. Like yes. How I don't put myself in this position. But that's the fascinating dance of the mind that allows someone to become a fighter. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8251.8s)]
*  To become a champion versus someone to become just a good fighter. Like whether you can figure that out. Like when to put your ego on a leash. And when to be able to look at yourself objectively. Like what you're doing with separating all of your disciplines I think is very important. I think that's a very interesting way that you put it because I think it's a very intelligent way to approach it. Like get very good at your boxing. Get very good at your Muay Thai. Get very good at Jiu Jitsu. But do it separately. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8281.8s)]
*  Like every week. Every Sunday I sit down and I do my schedule by myself. Like on Monday I'm going to do boxing. From this hour to this. Then I'm going to do afternoon Jiu Jitsu. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8310.8s)]
*  And how do you decide what you're going to do and when? It depends on how I feel. What I want to do. What you want to work on. And what I want to work on. And what I feel like I have to develop something. What I want to do. What do I feel in reality. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8322.8s)]
*  It's not like all the time I'm going to do this because I have to do it. No I don't have to do anything. I choose to do it because I enjoy it. Every time I go to training I enjoy it. I don't do it because I feel forced. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8339.8s)]
*  Sometimes in training camp yes I feel forced because I feel tired. I don't have food in my body. I don't have any energy. And I have to do it because I'm forced. But outside the training camp I enjoy it. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8353.8s)]
*  Even if I retire tomorrow I would keep training like that. Because that's something that I enjoy. You said something very interesting before that. Like right now I'm in the moment of my life where everything I do I do it because I enjoy it. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8363.8s)]
*  I don't do anything to make anyone happy. I don't live a life dreaming to have another one. I just enjoy the moment I'm living right now. That's so important. That is so important. It's so important to be satisfied with your life. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8381.8s)]
*  So important to just live in the moment. It's so hard for people to do. It's so hard for people to do especially if you've fucked off too many times. You just made too many mistakes and slacked off and lazy. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8398.8s)]
*  This is the best moment we have right now. This is it. This is who we are. No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8415.8s)]
*  And you know what's really important? Hearing a guy like you say this. Hearing a guy like you say this to young people out there that are listening. They're just not sure how to approach life. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8424.8s)]
*  Because the way you think about life and the way you decide to approach life can change the whole direction of your future. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8433.8s)]
*  100%. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8443.8s)]
*  100%. And so a young guy is probably listening. Guaranteed there are people, not just one, many young people are listening to you talk right now. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8444.8s)]
*  I'm sure there's many people come to you like Joe, tell me the secret. There are no secrets. There's no bottom for the elevator. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8454.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8462.8s)]
*  Everything in life you get step by step. The slow is the fastest way to get where you want to be. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8463.8s)]
*  I was talking to David Goggins about that. You know who David Goggins is? [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8468.8s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8471.8s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8472.8s)]
*  Fuckin' maniac. David Goggins said, there's no finish line. He's like, it never ends. It never ends. It never ends. You never make it. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8473.8s)]
*  You ever feel like you make it? I'm like, you never make it. There's no making it. It's bullshit. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8481.8s)]
*  One day you don't think about it anymore and you just, every day you're just trying to get better. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8485.8s)]
*  Of course. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8490.8s)]
*  And if you don't feel like that, it's not fun. If you're not really trying to do something difficult and aspire to greatness and just trying to do your best all the time, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8491.8s)]
*  you don't have satisfaction in your life. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8501.8s)]
*  100%. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8504.8s)]
*  In everything. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8505.8s)]
*  Some people think that you accomplish something and that's going to make you happy. That's bullshit. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8506.8s)]
*  Well, you know, I think also there's the poison of social media because social media poisons people to think that one day I'm going to make it. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8511.8s)]
*  I'm going to be like Conor McGregor driving my yacht around. Like those videos are so bad for you. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8519.8s)]
*  100%. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8525.8s)]
*  Those videos of people like, look at me, look at my watch, look at my diamonds, look at this, look at my house, look at this, look at these girls. Don't you wish you were me? [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8526.8s)]
*  100%. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8535.8s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8536.8s)]
*  Everyone is showing you the best part of their life. No one is going to show you how they are struggling, the problems they are facing on a daily basis. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8537.8s)]
*  I mean, like, no one is going to show you that. No one's going to show you, look, I have a pimple here in my face. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8545.8s)]
*  No, I'm going to use a filter to hide that. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8551.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. It's not good for young people. That's for sure because they aspire to all the wrong things. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8555.8s)]
*  Yes, young people today, whether they want most of them just want to be famous. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8561.8s)]
*  They want to be famous and they think that money makes them rich and you skills make you rich, not the money. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8565.8s)]
*  If you don't have the skills and you don't have the mindset, you're going to keep poor all the time. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8572.8s)]
*  Not only that, you're not going to have the satisfaction of knowing you got really good at something. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8577.8s)]
*  There's something about getting really good at something that gives you a deep satisfaction that's not available anywhere else. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8581.8s)]
*  If you just win the lottery, those are the most depressed people in the world. They all go broke. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8587.8s)]
*  They win the lottery and then everybody wants money from them and then they feel empty and hollow and they don't know what to do with themselves. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8592.8s)]
*  And now they don't have any goals because they have a hundred million dollars in the bank. They don't know what the fuck to do. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8598.8s)]
*  Yeah, but in reality, they don't have any ability. They don't have nothing to enjoy with. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8602.8s)]
*  I say that success comes from not worrying about money. Success doesn't come from making a lot of money. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8608.8s)]
*  Success comes from now I have to think about that. Money is not the thing. Now I think about what am I doing? What am I doing? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8614.8s)]
*  I want to be the best parent I can be. I want to be the best friend that I can be. I want to be everything I do. I want to do it to the best of my abilities. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8621.8s)]
*  Becoming the best person you could be. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8629.8s)]
*  Yeah, the best person you could be. When I was a kid, my martial arts instructor told me this that I'll never forget and I say it all the time. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8632.8s)]
*  Martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential. Through that struggle, through that difficult thing, you will learn how to be better at everything. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8639.8s)]
*  100%. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8648.8s)]
*  100%. That's what I think life is about and that's why martial arts are so exciting to me. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8649.8s)]
*  You know, people think, oh, you like violence. They're like, that's not it. That's why I don't like slap fighting. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8655.8s)]
*  I think it's stupid. You stand in front of each other, smack each other in the head. I want to see a guy enter into a cage fully prepared with skills against another guy fully prepared with skills. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8661.8s)]
*  I always describe martial arts, mixed martial arts in particular, as high level problem solving with dire physical consequences. That's what it is. It's problem solving with dire physical consequences. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8672.8s)]
*  That's so cool. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8686.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8687.8s)]
*  Most of them, they didn't understand what's behind a fighting game. It's not like only violence. You have to prepare yourself. You have to be smart. You have to be, you have to work smarter than the other guy you're going to face. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8689.8s)]
*  There's so much factors that it's going to play out that they, it's so much sacrifices that someone has to make before getting inside that octagon. It's not only fighting. It's more than that. I don't know. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8704.8s)]
*  I don't know. I love that. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8721.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8725.8s)]
*  Most of the people before they used to see fighting as something very violent in Spain. They hate it. Right now. It's becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and they're starting to love that. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8726.8s)]
*  And I saw that since the day I started because I used to say to the people like 10 years ago in Spain, what you doing? I'm fighting. Ah, don't do that. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8739.8s)]
*  Start learning something. Start studying. I'm like, I'm studying. Everyone chooses a career in his life. Someone wants to be a doctor. Someone wants to be a constructor. Someone wants to be this or that. I want to be a fighter. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8749.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8765.8s)]
*  And I have to learn to be a fighter also. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8766.8s)]
*  But by your example, by being a true champion and by living the way you live and by performing the way you perform, you will change people's opinions and they will see it and they will say, oh, this is different. This is not what I thought it was. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8769.8s)]
*  This is something special. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8784.8s)]
*  Yeah, for sure, brother. For sure. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8786.8s)]
*  Well, listen, my friend, thank you very much for being here. I appreciate you very much. I'm a big fan and I can't wait to see you inside the octagon again and all the best. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8790.8s)]
*  Joe, thank you very much, brother. It's been a big pleasure for me. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8798.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. All right. Bye, everybody. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RmF0ryPA-k&t=8802.8s)]
