# JRE MMA Show #163 - Protect Ya Neck
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMDdsINNITk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Gentlemen, we still don't have a name for this.
*  We're not the Cucks, right?
*  What was wrong with the Cucks?
*  Protect your neck. I think Protect Your Neck is best.
*  That's the best one.
*  Yeah, let's go with Protect Your Neck.
*  Protect Your Neck is a Wu-Tang theme song.
*  Yeah, Wu-Tang, perfect.
*  Yeah, the theme song's already done for us.
*  Exactly.
*  You got it.
*  There's two Wu-Tang songs I always listen to when I'm going to an arena, when I'm doing a show.
*  It's Protect Your Neck and Gravel Pit.
*  Those two, they just get you in the groove.
*  Yeah, yeah, get you going.
*  Especially Gravel Pit.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  This is our theme song, boys.
*  I like it.
*  That's all we got without getting kicked off of YouTube.
*  Even that might get us in trouble.
*  You all right there, Rollo?
*  It's not my headphones.
*  Are you fingering that skull?
*  Yeah, not hearing anything right now.
*  Oh, for real?
*  All right, we're going to pause real quick, see if Jamie can fix this.
*  We'll pause.
*  Can you hear it now, Rollo?
*  Yes, sir.
*  There we go.
*  Hey, you know what we never tried?
*  What?
*  The smelling salts.
*  We got them right here.
*  Oh, yeah, you're right.
*  But we got to show Dean the sheathing.
*  Oh, what is the fucking sheathing?
*  What is that?
*  It's when metal rings.
*  Oh, I want to see that shit.
*  The three of us have rings on with the rubber.
*  All right, let me see.
*  All right.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh, God.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, my chicken wings.
*  Come on.
*  Don't wear a ring on the mat.
*  Oh, all right.
*  Turn it off.
*  Turn it off.
*  Don't wear a ring to the gym.
*  You could drop a weight on it or rip your finger off, like for real.
*  You wear these.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  These are great.
*  Exactly right.
*  These are great.
*  Just don't wear nothing.
*  That way you can cheat, too.
*  I think the goofiest looking one is the tattooed ring.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That one's goofy.
*  I got different colored ones.
*  It's almost as bad as the bicep with the fucking chain with the, you know, the old school barbed wire.
*  I'm actually wearing my Marvel ring.
*  It says Marvel on it.
*  There you go.
*  Good man.
*  It does actually say Marvel on it.
*  Your wife will shame your fucking name.
*  This fucking dork.
*  It's nice though.
*  When I get handed with the Marvel rings, I can just fling it at her.
*  Marvel ring.
*  I think she got me the ring.
*  Yeah, I'm just flinging right at her.
*  You could use it like a slingshot.
*  That's great.
*  Yeah, I heard about a dude in, god, I forget who's Jim.
*  One of the, some big name dude.
*  And he took a photo of one of his students and said, don't ever come onto my mat with a ring on.
*  Ever.
*  Oh my god.
*  This is what happens.
*  And he posted it.
*  I don't remember who posted it, but fuck man, it's like you can't, it's just too dangerous.
*  You basically have a metal wedge on your finger.
*  If you do anything heavy, if you're in the outdoors, if you're climbing something, it can just dig right into your meat and rip your fucking finger.
*  When I was, when I was fighting, when I was champ, I had the, I just got married.
*  I was telling you earlier.
*  And when I had the ring on, this was before they had the rubber rings, you know.
*  And guys get excited to see you.
*  So sometimes you give them the hand, they squeeze your fingers.
*  And it's so exciting.
*  So excited.
*  You try to be nice.
*  I'm like, give me my hand back motherfucker.
*  I wonder if that's why you wear a wedding ring on your left hand.
*  So you shake hands with your right.
*  I wonder if that's, I mean, that's good.
*  That totally makes sense.
*  It does.
*  Especially though, I hate those douchebags that always try to give you that fucking, they have a nice squeeze.
*  They grab the tips.
*  And they try to break your hand.
*  That gets on my fucking nerves when they squeeze your fingers.
*  It's a bitch move.
*  Shake your hand.
*  It's a bitch move.
*  I like a firm handshake.
*  I like a man with a firm handshake.
*  Look in the eyes.
*  I like a firm handshake, but I don't like that finger squeezing bullshit because that's cheating.
*  You know I don't have a good grip when you're squeezing anyway.
*  But you're a douchebag move.
*  A nice person would relax their hand, you slap your hand, and you give each other a nice firm handshake.
*  That's right. For sure.
*  Even that, like when guys try to over, like they got a real strong grip and they try to fucking give you that squeeze.
*  I just feel, especially my right hand, like I got a fucking bump here from Shoney Caught His Head.
*  I had a hoof after I got done with that second fight.
*  Remember that shit?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And it's still, like I start to double rap it when I hit with Longo after a while.
*  So when guys squeeze that shit, I feel like, alright dude, alright, you got me beat with the grip, but I'll fucking strangle the fuck out of you.
*  What are you trying to show?
*  What are you trying to, oh yeah, good.
*  Do you do that gripping thing?
*  Fuck yourself.
*  It's like men feel so uncomfortable when they're around a guy like you.
*  They don't know how to behave.
*  Can I grab some coffee?
*  Yeah, yeah, just for you.
*  I'll do like a sneak and make you.
*  Do you want an espresso or do you want a cup?
*  There's a cup, because it's just regular coffee.
*  Oh, that's a lot better.
*  Yeah, I make a mess.
*  Because like, you know, when they get around a guy like you, they don't know what to do.
*  Because guys always like to pretend that they can beat another guy's ass.
*  Right.
*  Even if they're just posturing, oh fuck that guy up.
*  They meet a guy like you, all of a sudden they're like, hey how are you?
*  Hey sweetie.
*  That's why I put on some weight.
*  That's why I'm trying to get over 200 just so I can posture on them back.
*  I understand.
*  Flex a little bit.
*  Like if you're meeting Francis Ngano, how fucking terrifying is that?
*  Oh yeah, no doubt.
*  You're regular dude.
*  You're regular dude.
*  And you shake that guy's head.
*  You're like, oh what the fuck, man.
*  I remember the first time I interviewed him.
*  I was standing next to him.
*  I'm like, what the fuck, man.
*  That guy is so powerful.
*  He's fighting a guy bigger than him.
*  The Henneperet guy?
*  The Peloton guy?
*  Yes.
*  The guy is head up.
*  His first name is good.
*  Yeah, he is good.
*  He's like 6'8".
*  He KO'd Ryan Bader real quick, right?
*  He like jumped up him or something.
*  Dude, he hit him with a clean right hand.
*  Let's watch that because this guy's good, dude.
*  This is a dangerous fight.
*  I've never seen a fight.
*  I've never seen a sizeable one.
*  After a bad KO, you have to think, he fights Anthony Joshua.
*  That was a bad KO from one of the best knockout artists in boxing.
*  How tall is this guy?
*  This guy is big.
*  He's athletic too.
*  He's really athletic too.
*  Because he's a lot taller than me.
*  Super fast, man.
*  And he does a lot of wild shit.
*  He throws a lot of kicks and knees.
*  Dude, he's good.
*  How much taller is he than a few inches?
*  I think Francis is like 6'4".
*  6'5", something like that.
*  This guy is taller.
*  Francis is bigger though, for sure.
*  But this guy is fucking dangerous, man.
*  And he's real long.
*  Watch this combination.
*  When he lands it on Bader.
*  See, Bader can't close the distance here.
*  He's having a hard...
*  This guy is from the outside side.
*  Look at that right hand.
*  He waited for him to throw that jab.
*  Bro, watch that again.
*  That shit was perfect.
*  Watch that again.
*  Look at the timing on this guy, man.
*  Watch this.
*  Bader is trying to close.
*  He's trying to close.
*  Check out this.
*  Watch this fade away a little to his left.
*  Boom!
*  Oh!
*  I mean, that's right over the top of the jab.
*  That guy can do that to him.
*  That guy is dangerous, man.
*  He's fucking dangerous.
*  Dude, his footwork was real nice.
*  But Bader is also 40.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  But Bader at heavyweight has been doing pretty good.
*  Especially with the Bellator testing.
*  What kind of testing is that?
*  That's a multiple choice test.
*  What the fuck?
*  How many times did Bobby Lashley compete?
*  No disrespect to Bobby Lashley.
*  But still.
*  We know what's up.
*  He was always on an Indian reservation somewhere.
*  No real permission.
*  Bro, what a body though.
*  What a body.
*  Bobby Lashley is the only guy I've ever fought in MMA that looked like he could enter a bodybuilding competition the day of the fight.
*  Mark Kerr in his prime too.
*  But Bobby Lashley had everything.
*  Randleman, Randleman.
*  Oh, Randleman for sure.
*  Randleman for sure.
*  But Lashley, yo.
*  He was like a WWE guy.
*  He was.
*  He was a real man.
*  He could fight.
*  Was he like a D2 national champ or something like that?
*  He was.
*  He was a real legit wrestler.
*  He's a legit fighter.
*  But there ain't no way he's testing positive or negative.
*  Yeah, because he wrestled at like 189 in college.
*  Also, he's 48.
*  Whoa.
*  You know, but no disrespect.
*  Guy looks fucking great.

*  It's amazing some guys are natural, like Paulo Costa.
*  He's just got the genes, son.
*  Is he natural?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I guess he is.
*  Maybe.
*  What do you think?
*  I need to put these up with the secret juice.
*  It's easy.
*  I don't think you'd be talking that much shit if you were really just.
*  No, but, no.
*  I think he always looks the same.
*  He never tests positive.
*  And the guy has crazy genetics.
*  Look how handsome he is.
*  Look at that broad jaw.
*  That is true.
*  The guy's got freak genetics just in looks and also in his build.
*  He's been tested a billion times.
*  A billion times.
*  Motherfuckers have chemists out there.
*  Hey, you used to work for American Top Team.
*  Tell us the secrets.
*  Tell us the secrets that they got over in that fucking.
*  Tell them.
*  It's not a secret.
*  I want to know what the fuck happens over there.
*  I am not going to Juliana Pena this one.
*  No.
*  I'm not doing that.
*  You're not going to be getting paid by then.
*  Oh my God.
*  By the way, great work with Sean Brady.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Sean Brady's a fucking star.
*  He looked great.
*  He looked great.
*  Yeah, man.
*  He's a hardworking kid.
*  He's young.
*  I know he was on this show before.
*  He's young, hardworking, and he's on his way up.
*  He's got a double-sized back.
*  You know, when you're behind him, his back.
*  It looks like he's got a turtle shell on him.
*  Yes, it's double-sized.
*  And that's genetic.
*  His father has that.
*  That's crazy.
*  His fight the other night with Gilbert Burns was fucking smart, man.
*  It was impressive.
*  Even though he has really, really good wrestling, he knew not to shoot his wad trying to get
*  him down.
*  Because Gilbert's fucking...
*  What I love about Gilbert, and it happened in the Damien Maia fight, is if he's getting
*  out-wrestled, the second he hits the floor, right into Jiu-Jitsu sweeps, half-carts, he's
*  playing Jiu-Jitsu, they go to play back, he's back to his feet.
*  It's really nice.
*  It's amazing.
*  Oh, Gilbert's one of the very best ever on the ground in MMA.
*  It's like we've just seen him in so many stand-up wars because it's so fucking hard to get
*  people to the ground.
*  Right, right, right.
*  I love Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Ultimately, that's where it becomes a problem.
*  It's just so hard to get a world-class guy to the ground.
*  Well, I mean, so when Hamzah fought Gilbert, Hamzah was on top for a second.
*  And as soon as Gilbert started playing Jiu-Jitsu, Hamzah was like, get me the fuck out of here.
*  He stood up quick.
*  But that's what's so smart about Brady, though, because he was patient up against the cage.
*  And then he waited to the later rounds.
*  He's the younger guy.
*  He's banking on his cardio.
*  Then he started committing to those doubles.
*  And now he's got a better chance of getting more time on top.
*  Also, if you look at him in comparison, he doesn't have the same accolades as far as
*  Jiu-Jitsu competitions as Gilbert does.
*  But he's like world-class and straight-up rap-like.
*  For sure, for sure.
*  He definitely is.
*  Craig Jones, he did.
*  Yeah, Craig Jones.
*  There was a special rules thing.
*  There were no leg locks.
*  That was it.
*  There were no leg locks.
*  Which is, you know, with Craig Jones.
*  That's a big part of his game.
*  Yeah, if you're going to compete against that guy, you've got to let him use the whole game.
*  It's the whole game.
*  The whole game.
*  You don't say you can't use your best stuff.
*  It was funny.
*  It was pretty stale.
*  But Brady can hang with anybody on the ground.
*  He's so strong, he can hang with anybody.
*  And I firmly believe that Craig Jones, if Craig Jones got him in any kind of a position,
*  like a heel hook, he would never rip his shit apart.
*  Right, yeah, no doubt.
*  There's no chance.
*  But I understand the fighters, the current fighters.
*  Look what happened to Cubs-Swanson.
*  I'm all for these guys taking grappling matches, but I'm also for them taking it with certain rules.
*  Exactly.
*  Because that'll fuck...
*  I was trying to tell that to Khalil Roundtree.
*  Because Khalil Roundtree, before he got the title fight, was in here.
*  He was telling me he was going to take a grappling match.
*  I go, think about Cubs-Swanson.
*  He blows his ACL out.
*  He's gone for nine, ten months.
*  And he's in the thirties.
*  He's already in his thirties.
*  That's a death sentence almost.
*  He came back.
*  You can come back, but it's so unnecessary.
*  I get you're a bad guy.
*  I get you're a badass, but you're also a professional athlete.
*  You can't be motorbike riding.
*  Well, Cironi did it.
*  Cironi wants to be the biggest headache for the UFC.
*  He's got there fucking riding holes.
*  Jumping jet skis.
*  I don't remember him pulling out of too many fights, though.
*  No, I don't believe he ever did.
*  I don't remember a single fight.
*  I mean, there might have been one his whole career, but he had to have a broken fucking leg or something.
*  But he was still reckless as fuck.
*  Like, we were still out there doing dumb shit.
*  He's a adrenaline junkie, man.
*  Yeah, he's a freak.
*  He's still out there doing it.
*  He's still out there doing it.
*  He's a wild man.
*  Same reason why people stick around too long in the game.
*  Yeah, but that's also why he's so much fun to watch, man, because he genuinely didn't give a fuck.
*  In the early days of his career, man, he was very interesting because he's a wild kickboxer that had a great triangle.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He finished off a lot of his early fights with Jiu Jitsu.
*  Right.
*  He was good off his back.
*  Nasty off his back.
*  So, like, guys would want to take him down, and then he'd throw up that triangle.
*  Exactly.
*  He was like, oh, fuck, I didn't expect that.
*  His first fight with Benson Henderson was one of the sickest fights ever.
*  He had Benson in a hundred different submissions, and Benson got out all of them.
*  It was pretty sick.
*  Benson doesn't get enough love.
*  Benson doesn't get enough love.
*  Yeah, it was a great fight when they were in the WEC.
*  Damn, dude.
*  Do you think about all the fucking wars that a lot of people have forgot about?
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Because there's so many fights now.
*  Right.
*  Like, it's not like when we were fighting back in the day, it was far and few between.
*  It was an event because there was only a few a year.
*  Exactly.
*  Right.
*  People forgot about Jose Aldo's beginnings.
*  Man.
*  Bro.
*  I didn't.
*  Bro.
*  When he was in the WEC, was there anybody really better?
*  No.
*  A complete fighter?
*  Yeah, he's for sure the best WEC fighter.
*  You can't, look, you can't keep that pace.
*  Whatever that pace is when a guy is at the top of the food chain, you can't keep that
*  pace up for very long.
*  Man, he kept it for 10 years.
*  I always say you have to look at a guy by where he was when he was at his best.
*  Like, if we're going to do this, like, who's the best guy ever thing, that's why I always
*  throw BJ Penn in there.
*  Me too.
*  Because BJ Penn, and you fought him, BJ Penn in his fucking prime was a demon.
*  And he ran through everybody.
*  He's a demon.
*  He's a fag too.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  But when he was in his prime, it was like BJ and then everybody else.
*  Yes.
*  For sure.
*  You just can't keep that up forever.
*  For sure.
*  So if you look at Aldo, like the Aldo that fought Uriah, man, what he did to Uriah's
*  leg.
*  Jesus.
*  And how tough is Uriah?
*  How many dudes would have tapped?
*  How many dudes would have just rolled over and that would have been the end of it?
*  I think Aldo respected him and actually like backed off towards the end.
*  I think he did too.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, the guy might have lost his leg.
*  I mean, he almost got compartment syndrome.
*  Yeah, he did.
*  Right?
*  He had to go in a hyperbaric chamber every day to try to heal that fucking thing.
*  Yeah, man, full disclosure, like at the end of my career when I was fighting in 45, I
*  was like, I'll fight anybody but Aldo.
*  I ain't fighting that guy.
*  I'm not trying to get my leg kicked by that guy.
*  Yeah, I ain't fighting that guy.
*  That's the thing that's missing from him later was the frequency of his leg kicks.
*  You think it was just because of injuries or?
*  Well, he started boxing a lot.
*  Is he back now, by the way?
*  He is back.
*  He is back, yeah.
*  I think your fucking shins just go, man.
*  I mean, think about it.
*  That's what was going on with Amanda, right?
*  She was having nerve damage in her shins.
*  Yeah.
*  Just think about it.
*  Especially now with the calf kick, how many guys that fought by hit are going to be fucked
*  up for the rest of their life?
*  You know?
*  How many guys are going to have like some weird thing with their foot?
*  They're going to get like dropped foot or something from nerve damage.
*  My biggest fear was that shin break, like what happened to Chris.
*  Even before it happened in the UFC, I seen it in kickboxing and I'm like, you know.
*  It's horrible.
*  Like you got to really, like you could trust your shins, but like, could you?
*  How do you know?
*  How the fuck do you know?
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  It was always something in the back of my head when I was throwing kicks.
*  And it's so spontaneous too.
*  Even when I'm watching fights now, like when it happens, I always like have this responsive
*  be ready to look away.
*  Yeah.
*  Because if a leg snaps, I don't want to see that.
*  Nobody wants to see that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's interesting the way Paheta does everything.
*  Because he doesn't, I don't think he runs the risk as much of that because first of all,
*  he kind of kicks around the outside of your leg always.
*  He never goes shin to shin.
*  Right.
*  And even when he kicks the thigh, he's like kicking up.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like an upward, even on the back.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  He always catches that back angle or.
*  Until he wants to smoke you like Yuri.
*  Like Yuri, he came across and just smoked him.
*  But it wasn't just about touching.
*  He knew he already had him.
*  He almost knocked him out at the end of the first.
*  He knew he had him.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's just his, the power that he can generate from no hip at all.
*  He's a slapper.
*  He's slapping you.
*  Yeah, he don't have a big, he doesn't really have a tail.
*  It just flicks out there and hits you.
*  It's crazy because it's the perfect combination of a guy who has this
*  insane God-given power.
*  Like he's got insane one touch of death power.
*  And then the intelligence to not wind up.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  He's just tapping you with it, tapping you with it.
*  But the thuds are so bad.
*  And they're so, it's such a clean shot.
*  Yeah, it's a clean shot.
*  I think this is going to be a wild take.
*  I don't think it's going to be a popular take.
*  I think that Pereira is going to mix in a take down.
*  Really?
*  I think that he has, I think.
*  Against Khalil?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe I'm retarded.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I think, I think.
*  That's already been established.
*  You said that to me every week.
*  Listen, hear me out, hear me out.
*  Yes, he's, I mean, listen, he's, you don't get more confident on the feet than him, but he hangs out with our good friend, the great Glover Tixera.
*  Yeah.
*  And you see him sparring, you see him mixing that shit in.
*  Is he doing it for shits and giggles?
*  Is he doing it to work his cardio?
*  Maybe.
*  Or he could be dealing with Khalil Roundree and say, you know what, let me show them.
*  I mean, he did, he did shoot on, is he?
*  I'm not giving him a wrinkle, just to give him something to think about.
*  Well, he's got to learn it, right?
*  And he is learning it.
*  And why not just do that too?
*  If he could just mix that in, how many more strikes would he land too?
*  Because then if there's a real threat of him taking you down.
*  Oh yeah, for sure, yeah.
*  How many more, and by the way, how fucking strong is that guy on the ground probably?
*  I know, his hands are probably so big he's just like, he's got baseball mitts.
*  That dude's made out of wood.
*  If I put my hand on him to talk to him, he's made out of wood.
*  Especially at 85.
*  What does the comma mean when he says comma?
*  Chama.
*  Chama.
*  Chama.
*  It means everything.
*  Chama.
*  Chama.
*  Chama.
*  It's cool when he says it.
*  When someone says they want to fight, he's like, Chama.
*  Chama.
*  You don't want to hear that from that dude.
*  You'd rather hear him talk some shit than hear Chama.
*  He's got the scariest walkout of all time.
*  That little limp that he does.
*  That arrow.
*  Yeah, it's good.
*  And you're in that octagon waiting for him and you see that stomp.
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  But think about his come up, man.
*  He was able to come up this year without talking shit.
*  Yeah, at all.
*  Yeah, so all these fighters think they got to talk shit to come up.
*  He did it by just stepping up to the plate and fighting and knocking motherfuckers out.
*  He doesn't even smile.
*  Much less talk.
*  He doesn't even smile.
*  He leans into that Easter Island thing, too.
*  He'll wear the chain with the big head.
*  Very seriously, he thought him and Jamal were going to be cool with each other.
*  And Jamal started clowning up.
*  Right.
*  And he got angry.
*  That was a mistake.
*  He got really angry.
*  It was a mistake.
*  You don't want that guy angry.
*  But Jamal, that fight, there was that weird moment where he kicked Jamal in the nuts.
*  Or Jamal kicked him in the nuts, rather.
*  And he waved when he waved her being off.
*  And he did a little step.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He got a little closer.
*  He got in the kitchen.
*  Yeah, but Jamal, I talked to Jamal about that.
*  Jamal called all of us on the broadcast.
*  He was like, yo.
*  And he was like, he stepped on and got the angle.
*  And I couldn't move because Herb Dean was there.
*  He's right.
*  He's definitely right.
*  But we didn't see it.
*  Right.
*  I didn't see that.
*  All I was thinking is, so there's so much happens, right?
*  A guy gets kicked in the nuts.
*  I'm like, oh, shit.
*  Is he hurt?
*  First question is always, is this going to fuck the fight up?
*  Like, how long is this going to be?
*  OK, he's going to take a break.
*  Is he going to be OK?
*  Because I think every time you get kicked in the nuts, one point.
*  Every time you get eye poked, one point.
*  One point.
*  Because even if it's an accident, if you get slammed in your nuts and then you have to
*  go back to fighting two minutes later, you've been affected.
*  Yeah, no doubt.
*  Two minutes ago, you couldn't even fight.
*  Yeah, no doubt.
*  And now all of a sudden, you're supposed to fight full clip against a guy who's trying
*  to kill you, who just cracked you in the nuts.
*  Who's that?
*  Is that you, Dean?
*  Is that you, Matt?
*  Not me.
*  I'm a professional.
*  Who is it?
*  I'm on airplane mode.
*  Hold on, let me see.
*  I think it's you, James.
*  Is that you, James?
*  It's a smartphone.
*  No, it is a son of a bitch.
*  Hold on, man.
*  Wait a minute.
*  I got to tell you.
*  I'll tell you a whole joke.
*  You know what it was?
*  You know what it was?
*  I've been listening to you motherfuckers and telling me to get an iPhone and I don't know
*  how to work it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I'll help you.
*  I'll help you.
*  There's a little button on the top.
*  It should shut it off.
*  All right, let me shut this off.
*  Oh, you can do do not disturb.
*  You know how to do that?
*  No, I don't know how to do that.
*  You do it.
*  OK, look, open your phone up and then scroll down.
*  Like, scroll down from the top and then you can get to airplane mode.
*  I would rather just turn it off.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Do not disturb.
*  All right, just turn it off.
*  How about I put it on the floor and start bombing it?
*  Let me see.
*  Yeah, here we go.
*  I turned it off.
*  All right.
*  So anyway, we're talking about Alex and Jamal.
*  But so we didn't notice it.
*  We didn't notice it because, OK, he gets kicked in the nuts like, oh shit, they stop in the
*  fight.
*  What's going on?
*  So I didn't notice that little hop in here.
*  It already did.
*  He already got closer.
*  Yeah, you see now you got the foot on the outside.
*  Yeah.
*  It was brilliant on his part.
*  But on the flip side, Herb wasn't in Jamal's way.
*  He could definitely have moved.
*  Right.
*  But Jamal did relax.
*  Look, he relaxed.
*  He straightened his legs.
*  He gave him the thumbs up.
*  Are we cool?
*  And it looked like he was trying to touch gloves.
*  So they touch gloves.
*  But he's already way closer than he's ever been before.
*  So most of the fight up until this point was fought with Jamal about a foot per past where
*  they are right now.
*  He was in the outside and he was touching him from the outside.
*  And that was his game plan.
*  I talked to him on the phone about it.
*  He was explaining to me his game plan.
*  Everything was going great.
*  Who?
*  He had a point.
*  He had a fucking real point.
*  Did he call you too?
*  Yeah.
*  I called him.
*  He called like.
*  But he's right because we didn't notice it.
*  But this is one of those moments where you're like, are they stopping the fight?
*  No.
*  Okay, they're not stopping the fight.
*  Like I didn't realize that.
*  He made that right?
*  That little hop hop he does?
*  That little hop hop is legit, dude.
*  It's such a good move.
*  Watch it now.
*  Let's see.
*  Watch.
*  So Herb moves to him.
*  He's going to stop the fight.
*  He puts his hand up.
*  Watch this.
*  Touches him.
*  Nope.
*  But look how close he is now.
*  See how close he is now?
*  He's a lot closer.
*  Back it up.
*  Back it up.
*  So back it up before the nut shot.
*  Now look at the distance now.
*  See the distance?
*  Big difference.
*  Jamal does fire off first though, doesn't he?
*  Watch.
*  After he gets kicked.
*  Yeah, probably.
*  Let's see.
*  Who throws the first punch?
*  Jamal throws it first though, I think.
*  Does he?
*  Let's see.
*  He might be right.
*  He's getting a corner.
*  Look at Jamal.
*  Ready?
*  Jamal throws.
*  It's obvious that Alex is coming in.
*  But he also put his hand on the outside of Jamal's hand to clear the angle for him to
*  throw the left hook over top of it.
*  And dude, his left hook, it's like a shovel hook.
*  Half an uppercut, half a hook, and it's just perfect.
*  Perfect.
*  All right, maybe he won't shoot on Khalil.
*  Not only that.
*  Hey, hey.
*  Remember when Khalil knocked out Go Kansaki?
*  Man.
*  Dude, he's fucking dangerous.
*  I know.
*  Khalil knocked out my boy Anthony Smith.
*  Had him in slow motion.
*  And I was like, damn.
*  Off speed uppercut, he threw.
*  That was slick, dude.
*  He's fucking terrifying.
*  When Khalil's on.
*  Oh, Khalil.
*  Khalil Raunchy's fucking terrifying.
*  He came back from Thailand like a different fighter.
*  I think once he went over there and was training full time, there was a big change in him,
*  I thought.
*  Well, Khalil's had moments in his career where he hasn't been dialed in.
*  There was a few fights where he admittedly wasn't all in.
*  And now he's all in.
*  Now he's super focused.
*  You're like, oh shit.
*  That's a dangerous contender.
*  We're going to find out.
*  But do you think the UFC would want Khalil to be champ?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Why not?
*  Because he just don't really have that championship thing about him.
*  Where you go, oh, that's my champ right there.
*  He don't really have that.
*  Yeah, but nobody does until they do.
*  Olivera didn't have it until he got it.
*  Right?
*  And Olivera was the guy that everybody was beating.
*  So many guys beat Paul Felton and fucked him up.
*  A lot of guys beat him.
*  Cubs Swanson knocked him out.
*  For sure.
*  A lot of guys beat Olivera because he was cutting too much fucking weight.
*  Right.
*  And he just didn't have any energy.
*  Well, I'm just saying, every time you see Khalil Roundtree do interviews, he crying
*  and stuff like that.
*  Like, is that the type of guy that we really want?
*  Is he crying?
*  He's sensitive.
*  He's a sensitive guy.
*  You don't cry?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Sometimes the whole game ends.
*  There is nothing wrong with someone who's sensitive who can fuck you up.
*  No, I'm not saying there's something wrong with it.
*  But I'm just saying, is that the guy that we want holding the belt?
*  Maybe that's what we need in 2024.
*  To get people on the ball board.
*  Yeah.
*  As you guys get older, do you get more emotional?
*  Do you find yourself?
*  I'm emotional.
*  I'm an emotional guy.
*  I don't see that.
*  I'm an emotional.
*  You guys don't get all emotional.
*  People think we're toxic.
*  Let's talk.
*  We're not toxic.
*  We just don't have a filter.
*  Yes.
*  This is just what actual men are like when there's no one around.
*  Where your boys shouldn't be.
*  Yeah.
*  When there's no one around they can yell at you.
*  If we had the same conversation with our wives, you'd be like, what the fuck are you saying?
*  Are you sinking down the fucking air?
*  There would be a lot of that.
*  True.
*  It's like, this is what people would be talking about if you were hanging out in your living
*  room.
*  It's true.
*  Four buddies hanging out in your living room.
*  How would you talk?
*  This is it.
*  For sure.
*  Just do it in front of the world.
*  In that case, I don't cry at all.
*  You pussies.
*  I cried the other night.
*  I was just going to see if you do.
*  I was watching Chimp Crazy.
*  What?
*  Oh my God, it was an HBO show.
*  It's Max now, whatever it is.
*  It's a docu-series about people that own chimpanzees.
*  Dude.
*  That just can't end well.
*  Wait, hold on.
*  What made you cry about that?
*  It's horrific, man.
*  Oh, wait, wait.
*  They went bad?
*  When the chimps tear people apart, they tear your face off.
*  They bite your face.
*  They bite your fingers off.
*  They pull your dick off.
*  Dude, there's so many moments in that show where you're just like, what the fuck?
*  It's so sad.
*  Is there anything happy in it or no?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  There's nothing happy in this show.
*  There's nothing happy in this show.
*  This show is all about what happens when people have pet chimps and the chimps get to be about
*  five years old and they don't want to listen to you anymore because they're a 200 pound
*  fucking super predator.
*  For real.
*  They can do whatever they want.
*  What they are, they're our closest relatives and they're really fucking smart.
*  When they get to be like five years old, you can't even put them in a combination lock,
*  like they were telling me, because they'll figure out the combination.
*  They'll watch you do it.
*  That's all.
*  Oh shit.
*  And then they'll do it.
*  They'll see what you do to get out and then they'll replicate it.
*  So this is real planet of the apes type shit.
*  They're really smart, man.
*  They just can't talk.
*  They're not as smart as people, but they also they're vindictive and spiteful and they're
*  angry and jealous.
*  They do that a lot with the wild animals, like the fucking people who own hippos.
*  But the thing about these things is when they hit like five, you just got to keep them in
*  cages all the time.
*  So when they're babies, everybody's hanging around with them.
*  You can bring them to the pizza place.
*  Oh my God, it's the lady with the chimpanzee.
*  But then they get to be five and then they rip someone's face off for no fucking reason
*  at all.
*  What was the Netflix series?
*  Oh yeah, Chimp Empire.
*  That's what I thought, Chimp Empire.
*  That was a crazy, crazy show.
*  Crazy show.
*  Because that one, these scientists were embedded in this group of chimpanzees for 20 years.
*  So these people, these chimpanzees, their whole lives they had seen scientists.
*  They had these rules.
*  You have to stay 20 yards away.
*  Don't look them in the eye.
*  No food.
*  Can't have any food anywhere near them.
*  So are they gremlins?
*  What the fuck?
*  No, man.
*  They're just chimpanzees.
*  If they decide you have something, if they decide that you have something they want,
*  there ain't shit you can do about that.
*  Like they were fighting over territory.
*  I mean, you got to see the hierarchy within, you know, their clans or whatever you want
*  to call it.
*  It's a bad ass.
*  And the guy told me...
*  You had the guy on your show, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, the guy who produced it.
*  That's how I heard it.
*  The show is so good, dude.
*  This is much better than Chimp Crazy.
*  This is like the opposite of Chimp Crazy.
*  Yeah, this is real shit.
*  Chimp Crazy is sad, but this is amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  Because these chimps are so accustomed to these scientists that they acted completely
*  normal around them.
*  Like they were just a part of nature to them.
*  Because their whole life they had had scientists around with cameras.
*  It was just a thing in the forest.
*  It was just like that's a different kind of tree or something.
*  As long as you don't have food, as long as you don't look them in the eye and don't get
*  any closer than 20 yards.
*  Damn.
*  Those are the rules.
*  So if the chimps start moving towards you, you move away.
*  Don't look them in the eye.
*  You look away.
*  Don't have any fucking food.
*  If you got a candy bar, they'll rip your dick off for that candy bar.
*  They don't have any sense of what's appropriate.
*  They don't, you know, there's no remorse.
*  They bite each other's hands off.
*  Oh my God.
*  Bro, they're ruthless.
*  And that's our closest relative.
*  So you know what you do.
*  You just get a dog.
*  You don't get a fucking, you don't get a fucking.
*  It's not PJ and the Bear.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  Who needs that?
*  Who needs that shit?
*  That's awesome.
*  Nobody needs that shit.
*  All that shit you see in those movies though, those were all young chimps.
*  You can't even train them when they get old.
*  They're not listening to nothing.
*  There's no listening.
*  I gotta watch this.
*  You remember that Clean This Wood movie?
*  Fuckin' Any Which Way But Lucy.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to love those movies.
*  And Any Which Way You Can.
*  The best is the second one when they were going to have that fight.
*  And then it's me, oh they heard they're still fighting.
*  And then it's you know, the guys there are different, oh let's get on the plane and let's
*  go see the fight.
*  Dude, they're fighting for fucking two hours these guys.
*  Like across the state.
*  And who's that guy's name?
*  Tank Murdock?
*  Is that the guy's name?
*  The first one, yeah.
*  They became friends with him.
*  I remember all that shit.
*  Philo Beto was clear.
*  Philo Beto.
*  Yeah, and they had the right turn.
*  Right turn Clyde.
*  It's funny because back then you would never think that people were actually having bare
*  knuckle fights for money.
*  And now it's on pay-per-view.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I know right.
*  So that's the original Mike Perry.
*  There was never going to be bare knuckle boxing.
*  I'll tell you man.
*  As a sport.
*  That's crazy.
*  So this was just some backyard shit that people would do.
*  Like this is the big killer.
*  This is the guy that's like the big money champion.
*  He's going to eventually fight him.
*  He's watching Clint.
*  And he steps in to help him and he starts fucking some people up.
*  We didn't even know what real fighting was back then.
*  I had no idea.
*  Somebody needs to redo it.
*  All those things he did would work.
*  I mean it's not crazy.
*  He's not doing any like jump split kicks.
*  I used to like these movies as a kid.
*  I loved them.
*  These movies were great.
*  This movie was great.
*  Clint Eastwood was the fucking man.
*  Hell yeah.
*  He has the best western movie of all time.
*  Unforgiven.
*  Unforgiven.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I saw that.
*  I'm a fan of Tombstone with Val Kilmer too.
*  I love that movie.
*  That one scene made that whole movie.
*  That one scene was so intense.
*  Which one?
*  Unforgiven or?
*  I'm your Huckleberry?
*  When he's looking at it he's like I'm your Huckleberry.
*  Anytime you get Kurt and we did this in a cool text.
*  We talked about Bone Tomahawk.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Now this is a movie.
*  I think I find these movies that I never heard about.
*  It came out in like 2015.
*  I saw it on Netflix.
*  I thought it was new.
*  I didn't know so I started watching it.
*  Holy fuck.
*  You see that?
*  Good one.
*  It's like a western horror movie.
*  Horror movie.
*  Because these carnival Indians are almost like predators because they got these things.
*  Well they're completely different, like a different species of person.
*  They have these things in their windpipes.
*  Remember?
*  They have that crazy call.
*  And what about Matthew Fox in this?
*  This guy is the guy from Lost.
*  He was phenomenal.
*  You're very good in it.
*  This movie is now, I get like obsessed with some movies.
*  This is my latest obsession.
*  I fucking love this movie.
*  I've never seen this.
*  It's a great movie.
*  It's a fun horror movie and the fact that it didn't get the attention that it deserves.
*  I think there's too many movies out.
*  I never heard of this.
*  That's true.
*  There's too many shows.
*  There's so much stuff.
*  Everybody's like, have you seen this show?
*  It's like man, I can't watch everything.
*  I love Shogun.
*  I haven't finished it.
*  Me neither.
*  Me neither.
*  For sure.
*  There's certain things that take a while to get through.
*  I blew right through Shogun.
*  Bro, I just blew right through Peaky Blinders.
*  Peaky Blinders?
*  Yeah.
*  I got it.
*  I got it.
*  Hey, Tom Hardy and Peaky Blinders?
*  Oh man.
*  The first season.
*  The first season is slow as fuck.
*  Once you get out of the first season, you'll be good to go.
*  I love the first season, man, but it gets hot after.
*  How good is Tom Hardy?
*  Tom Hardy and Peaky Blinders.
*  Oh, I see clips of him in that.
*  That motherfucker can act.
*  Man, he's gonna be good.
*  He's gonna be good.
*  He's gonna be good.
*  He's gonna be good.
*  He is.
*  He's like on a totally different level.
*  Like even just everything about it.
*  You buy that eccentric psychopath.
*  You buy it.
*  You buy everything about it.
*  Like these guys.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, he was the man in Peaky Blinders.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no.
*  I like, I'll tell you what I tapped out on.
*  And you know me.
*  I like superhero shit.
*  And the show The Boys, I was in and there's some good stuff in that show.
*  You ever hear of The Boys?
*  I've heard of it.
*  I haven't watched it.
*  It gets redundant.
*  No, no.
*  But no, this is the, you wanna know what I tapped out?
*  The scene where I fucking tapped out.
*  Now you know in like X-Men, you ever hear of a multiple man?
*  He can make like a multiple of himself, like other clones of himself.
*  All right.
*  Now listen, I'm not a prude, okay?
*  I could deal with some sex scenes and some freaky shit.
*  But my thing is this.
*  There's a scene.
*  Now they go, now this, I don't need to see a guy's face in another guy's asshole, even
*  if it's his own body.
*  So multiple man, or this little like version of him in his thing.
*  He's not lying.
*  You know, in the Sauna, right?
*  And I guess this happens sometimes in gay gyms.
*  There's a close up of like a human centipede.
*  It's a human centipede.
*  Is that an inside of an asshole?
*  Oh yeah, I know.
*  He's in this guy's asshole right now.
*  I like it, he's touching his asshole.
*  He's in the guy's asshole right now.
*  No, it's like a hamster.
*  Wait a minute.
*  I know, I noticed this is the real scene in the show.
*  They're trying to normalize this.
*  Exactly.
*  This is a bizarre agenda.
*  This is exactly the scene I'm talking about.
*  This is an asshole.
*  He's inside an asshole and he's naked.
*  Dude, this guy, so now this guy is, they open up this thing and they see the, oh yeah, I
*  hope it was worth it.
*  Was it worth it?
*  And so then he came full size.
*  Got big too fast.
*  It's like Ant-Man.
*  He turned full size and he blew the guy apart.
*  Yeah, that's like Ant-Man inside someone's asshole.
*  Yeah, this is not necessary.
*  Yeah dude, that's what I'm saying.
*  But picture this.
*  Kind of crazy though.
*  Picture, you ever see a human centipede?
*  Let me see that again.
*  That's a crazy way to die.
*  I want to see him explode.
*  So what happens?
*  Does he just decide to get bigger?
*  I think he sneezes in it.
*  Oh he sneezes.
*  Oh he fucks up his, I guess his ability to control it.
*  Oh my god.
*  But the whole show is like this where they do shit like that.
*  But like, there's some good stuff in the show.
*  Yeah, that's gross.
*  The first few seasons was cool this past season.
*  They got woke on me.
*  Dude, that's what I'm saying.
*  I'm trying to explain that to the cops.
*  And then multiple man, he's got pink eye because he had his face in an asshole.
*  So now he's coming back with pink eye.
*  100% someone's trying to normalize things like that.
*  Because that's probably like every bottoms dream is to actually climb inside a guys asshole.
*  I just want to be inside of you.
*  You know, just let it just, just get all up in there.
*  But Matt, I know exactly the thing you're talking about.
*  It got me right out.
*  That's unnecessary.
*  I would tap out after that.
*  I tapped out on The Walking Dead when they killed Glenn with the baseball bat.
*  In Venice.
*  Yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
*  You know what's fucked up though?
*  They actually did that in the comic book.
*  Oh, I'm sure they did.
*  You didn't have to show it to me like that.
*  Yeah, because we like Glenn.
*  That's murder porn.
*  We like Glenn.
*  I loved Glenn.
*  I saw Glenn at the UFC and he looked sad.
*  He looked sad.
*  Because they killed him off with a baseball bat.
*  But did you imagine that's your character, your character for all these years, everybody
*  loves it and they kill him off with a baseball bat and you're like, and then you, no more
*  show.
*  Bye.
*  Bye, we're done with you.
*  The show is like, what the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  Anyway, with that shit.
*  Well, you can't keep doing that.
*  Oh, the people are the monsters.
*  You can't keep doing that forever.
*  It gets boring.
*  Figure it out.
*  Find out who the cunts are.
*  Kill them.
*  What's the start of the community?
*  The shows jumped the ship too, you know, like fucking Cobra Kai.
*  I like that first season.
*  And also, how, why are there still zombies?
*  They walk two miles an hour.
*  You haven't killed a million yet.
*  I know, right?
*  Yeah, how hard is it to figure out how to kill these things?
*  It's so easy.
*  What was fucked?
*  All you need is that lady with the sword and just like every day run out, kill 30 of them.
*  Eventually, yeah.
*  Nobody's going to be left.
*  It's crazy that they still run into zombies.
*  Gee, you haven't killed all the zombies in like five years.
*  That show.
*  I agree.
*  I think there was a spinoff with Daryl Dixon.
*  I didn't even watch.
*  There's a bunch of spinoffs.
*  There's the LA one too.
*  The LA spinoff too.
*  It was pretty good.
*  It was Fear of the Walking Dead.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That might have been the best one.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it was really good.
*  Especially in the beginning.
*  It was really good because it was like no one knows what the fuck is going on, but it
*  gave you like a real sense of like dread and fear.
*  These people are trapped in the middle of this outbreak and the military moves in and
*  no one gives anybody any answers, which is really how it would go.
*  Right.
*  That's what the LA one, Fear of the Walking Dead, is much more realistic.
*  This is how it would go.
*  The guy waking up in the hospital in The Walking Dead, the problem with that scene is 28 days
*  later.
*  That's how it starts.
*  Same exact scene.
*  28 days later, Killian Murphy, also from Peaky Blinders.
*  Right.
*  He wakes up in the hospital and he wakes up, he doesn't know what the fuck happened because
*  he got hit by a car or something like that.
*  Right.
*  That was a great movie, by the way.
*  Was he riding a bike, got hit by a car, I think.
*  So he wakes up, he has no idea what the fuck's going on and then getting out of the hospital,
*  he realizes that the world has ended and there's a zombie apocalypse broken out while he was
*  in a coma.
*  So they just stole the whole thing.
*  Somebody stole it.
*  Well, what came out first?
*  The comic book or the fucking?
*  I don't know.
*  That's a very good question.
*  It's a very good question.
*  What year did The Walking Dead graphic novel come out?
*  It's a real legit question.
*  Thanks, guys.
*  You know those movies?
*  You can't find them on streaming.
*  You can't find 28 days later on streaming.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, because I've never seen it.
*  That's why I don't know.
*  I think you can find 28 weeks later, but 28 days later, I don't think you can find.
*  I think you have to buy, because I just bought it.
*  I ordered it on DVD.
*  I haven't bought a DVD.
*  How do you even have a DVD player?
*  I do.
*  How the fuck do you have a DVD player?
*  They asked me if I wanted one.
*  I said, yeah, I'll take one of them.
*  And I haven't used it ever.
*  I've been in this house for four years.
*  I never used that fucking DVD player, but I'm going to use it for this.
*  You can still get blue rays.
*  Especially, they look really good.
*  Like blue ray, like high resolution.
*  Those DVDs, it's probably as good or better than streaming.
*  I just don't know anybody with a DVD player.
*  That's like VHS.
*  I don't have that.
*  I had that for a long time, though, because I used to get all the Pride videos on VHS.
*  I used to get K-1 videos and all the weird shit from Japan.
*  From a friend of mine.
*  He would send it all on VHS.
*  What year was the graphic novel?
*  I saw a Reddit discussion that they both, so for the record, I want to answer your question.
*  The Walking Dead came out within the same year that the movie came out, but someone
*  noted that they both were taking from another movie that came out in the 60s.
*  What was that movie?
*  The Day of the Triffids?
*  Ooh, The Day of the Triffids.
*  That's a movie, too?
*  That's a zombie movie, too?
*  That's on my next watch.
*  I was trying to look it up when you were asking.
*  Is that a monster movie or a zombie movie?
*  Yeah, it's like zombies or something like that.
*  The Day of the Triffids.
*  What the fuck?
*  What is it?
*  Drainage after being splashed with Triffid poison from a stinger.
*  Thoreen's recovery is told of an unexpected green meteor shower.
*  What?
*  That's some 1976 shit.
*  For the record, I guess 28 Days Later may have, or Start Walking Dead may have taken
*  from...
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, well, 28 Days Later was a lot earlier, right?
*  What year did 28 Days Later come out?
*  That's what I was saying.
*  They came out, it says the comics came out less than a year after 28 Days Later was first
*  in cinemas.
*  Yeah.
*  So 28 Days Later was first.
*  This guy just got into Game of Thrones like 20 years later.
*  Yeah.
*  I just got into a game.
*  I go, dude, the fucking thing's been out.
*  I know.
*  I never had Max.
*  I just got Max.
*  Just so I could watch that shit.
*  So, and the season 2.
*  I like season 2.
*  Dude, it's good.
*  Yeah, it is good.
*  I ain't gonna lie, it is good.
*  It's a real good show.
*  I liked it so much, I told Dean after the first season, I didn't want to wait till the
*  second season, so I got the book and I ended up reading all five books.
*  I don't believe I've ever read five books in my life.
*  I didn't even know Max was like that.
*  Did that good?
*  Oh, it was fucking great.
*  I loved it so much.
*  I did it on my iPad and because of my ADD, I made the font real big so it's like two
*  paragraphs and I'm like, eh, I'm going right through the thing.
*  Otherwise, I'll start looking at a squirrel, I'll look at my pictures.
*  On the real, I didn't even know Matt could read and shit.
*  But I started with comic books.
*  But I loved it so much that I just.
*  Sorry, so why has 28 Days Later been removed from streaming?
*  It says, indeed, Disney lost the rights to the independently financed original film with
*  them now only owning the rights to Searchlight Finance sequel 28 weeks later.
*  So well, who the fuck owns it?
*  And they would, they don't want to put it on Netflix?
*  Why wouldn't they?
*  It's one of the best zombie movies of all time.
*  It is great.
*  It's great because it's when they weren't slow, they get rabid.
*  Oh, they were the scariest.
*  It could be one of those VPN things.
*  It could be another country and maybe you sneak around and.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  That was a great movie.
*  And they're coming out with 28 Years Later.
*  For real?
*  Yeah, they are.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there anybody left?
*  I think that guy, the Peaky Valley guy is left.
*  What kind of life is that?
*  What kind of life is it like?
*  If some fucking Wuhan China lab comes up with some zombie virus and releases it.
*  That sounds crazy, but rabies is real.
*  Yeah.
*  That's exactly what rabies is.
*  It's Kujo.
*  It is, right?
*  It takes animals that are not, that never want to bite people and turns them into an
*  animal that needs to bite you.
*  They run at you.
*  They're not scared of you.
*  Rats will run at you.
*  Foxes, they run at you when they have rabies.
*  I've never thought about that.
*  Rabies is just zombies.
*  It is zombie, because it kills people.
*  Before we figured out how to stop it, and you have to get those shots before you start
*  having symptoms.
*  They have to find out you got bit and then give you those shots.
*  And it has to happen really quickly.
*  Because if you don't, it kills most people.
*  Jesus.
*  Rabies kills something like 99% of the people that get it.
*  What?
*  Yeah, it's an old disease.
*  One of the things they figured out is that if they slow down everything in your body
*  and put you into a medically induced coma, it gives your body the resources to fight
*  it off.
*  Because your body can fight it off, but it can't fight it off as quick as the virus moves
*  forward.
*  It's an old virus, man.
*  It's a weird one.
*  That's crazy.
*  When you think about what that is, it's a crazy old virus that spreads itself by making
*  its host violent.
*  It is rage.
*  So saying that no one would ever do this, these fucking psychopath eggheads that they
*  give these grants to that do this gain of function research shit on viruses, making
*  them more infectious to human beings, do you think they would stop at a coronavirus?
*  Why wouldn't they fuck with rabies?
*  You know who fights like they have rabies?
*  Marab.
*  He does.
*  He does.
*  He does.
*  I used to say that about Liam Harrison.
*  People are making a big thing about, oh, he's got to get him down.
*  He's got to get him down.
*  He didn't get...
*  Listen, he gets him down.
*  He's in trouble, sugar Sean.
*  But look what he did to Jose Aldo.
*  He didn't get him down too much.
*  And look at him up against the cage.
*  All that height, the difference in height, the reach, that's at a disadvantage once he
*  gets a hold of him.
*  So he could beat the shit out of him up against the cage.
*  He doesn't get him down for a round.
*  Now there's a little less pop in Sean's and fucking his punches and strikes.
*  That length is going to be a problem when he closes the distance, Marab.
*  So I got to ask you, because you know Marab better than anybody here, I'm sure.
*  And from that, like when I see him now, like he's just a different animal.
*  Like a complete different character.
*  Has he always been like this type of character?
*  Like making jokes and always been funny and...
*  When he first came to us, the English wasn't great at all.
*  I mean it's not what it is now.
*  He's always been a sweetheart.
*  Just a sweetheart.
*  That's what I thought of him.
*  Yo, imagine having Matt and Ray Longo as your English teachers.
*  Oh no, he's funny.
*  Oh my God.
*  He's always been funny.
*  Come on.
*  And Ray, I love you.
*  You know that.
*  I just did a reality show with you and Ray Longo.
*  Oh my God.
*  Cornering fighters and just traveling around and training fighters.
*  You know how big that show would be?
*  You know what's funny?
*  I just had a moment.
*  I want to thank you by the way.
*  I just did my own, I'm doing once a week, I'm doing my own geek podcast called Geeking
*  Out with Matt Zerathek.
*  You're the one who pushed me to do this.
*  Listen, you are a natural.
*  Thank you.
*  You're a natural for this.
*  It actually, it's out today.
*  And the second episode I did, I did one with my buddy Phoenix Cannavale.
*  She's great.
*  We talked about our worst to best X-Men movies.
*  This is right up my alley.
*  Are you doing this on YouTube too?
*  Yes, on YouTube.
*  It's the Matt Zerathek channel.
*  Yeah, but on everything, Spotify, Apple.
*  It's going to be on Spotify.
*  It is on Spotify.
*  Yeah.
*  And the second, I did two episodes, one with Phoenix about the X-Men movies and the second
*  one was myself and Ray Longo.
*  My studio is nine minutes from Longo's school and we did our top five gangster movies.
*  There's a movie that's on our list that I didn't know this fact until it came out because
*  I don't know why people didn't see this movie.
*  Did you ever see State of Grace?
*  Yes.
*  Sean Penn.
*  A lot of people haven't seen that.
*  Phenomenal.
*  Yeah, we talked about it.
*  I watched it again with my wife before I did the show, just back in my head because I knew
*  it was going to be on the list.
*  And I wondered why so many people didn't see this movie.
*  So fucking The Great Ray Longo brought up a great point.
*  It came out the opening weekend as good, same as Goodfellas, same opening weekend.
*  That's why it was fucking under the radar.
*  You never seen it.
*  I never seen it.
*  I never even heard of it until you just said it right now.
*  It's about like the Westies.
*  Very good movie.
*  Very good movie.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's the second episode of me and Longo.
*  So that just maybe that's a good one to remember.
*  That's a good one to remember.
*  I forgot about that.
*  State of Grace is great.
*  Another one on the list that a lot of people seeing this because Biggie Smalls raps about
*  him is The King of New York.
*  Yeah, great movie.
*  You ever seen The King of New York with Christopher Walken?
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Does Heat count?
*  Is that a mob movie?
*  You know what?
*  I was thinking about putting it in there, but I didn't.
*  I think it's more of a heist.
*  It's a heist movie, but it's organized crime.
*  It is.
*  It is.
*  The guy who got out of jail, it's based on a real dude.
*  The guy who was the De Niro character who got out of jail is based on a real dude.
*  Is he real?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He did a bunch of robberies and then he went to jail for a long ass time and got out and
*  did a bunch more robberies.
*  Was he a mob dude?
*  He was organized crime for sure, but it's like who was he connected to?
*  Was he connected to the mafia?
*  Was he independent organized crime?
*  But he was like super sophisticated.
*  It was a fantastic movie.
*  Phenomenal movie.
*  But does American Gangster count?
*  Right.
*  That probably does.
*  By the way, you gotta put that almost in the title.
*  Also in the title it says gangster.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  That's an honorable mention.
*  That was a great movie.
*  Bro, that's a great movie.
*  That's a fucking great movie.
*  And also based on a real dude.
*  The Heat, the movie, a funny thing about Al Pacino in that movie, he's over the top of it.
*  She's got a great ass!
*  A big ass woman!
*  When I seen him, he spoke about his role in that.
*  What influenced him about playing that character is that the character was chipping off pieces
*  of cocaine like he was a cokehead.
*  And they kind of took that out of the movie, but that's how he was playing it.
*  All coked up.
*  So it kind of explains it.
*  It does.
*  So they didn't show it in the movie, but that was how it was written?
*  He said it was, yes, that he was like chipping off pieces of cocaine.
*  Did they just edit that out of the movie?
*  I have no clue.
*  But he definitely said it in an interview.
*  Was it in the movie?
*  I don't believe so.
*  They did not have him do it in the movie.
*  Imagine you're doing that, you're doing this all coked up character and he's doing coke,
*  and then they cut out all the coked out.
*  He said it, everybody's like, what the fuck, they're all wet.
*  Once he said that.
*  You're playing a drunk, you were gonna remove the alcohol.
*  It made perfect sense though, once he said it.
*  He goes, that's why I chose some of the choices I made for that character.
*  If there was no meth, how much less crime would there be?
*  50%?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  If you think about how many ridiculous crimes get cooked up while they're on meth, literally.
*  Or to get the meth.
*  Right, yeah, yeah.
*  Meth influence.
*  Do you remember that North Hollywood shootout?
*  It was just like the movie Heat.
*  Oh yes, they were in body armor.
*  They had body armor, they had like fucking big giant machine guns and shit.
*  They were literally just walking up the street blasting people.
*  Apparently they were eroded out of their fucking minds.
*  These dudes eroded out of their minds doing coke and they robbed this bank in North Hollywood,
*  and the cops boxed them in.
*  They had a shootout on the street.
*  I was on news radio at the time, we stopped production of the show to watch it on television.
*  Really, everybody was like, what the fuck is going on?
*  How far from you was it?
*  Real close, real close.
*  We were in Studio City, North Hollywood's 15 minutes away, 10 minutes away.
*  Real close.
*  In the middle of the street.
*  You ever see the footage?
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah, the news footage is wild.
*  The footage is crazy, and here's what's crazy.
*  One of the cops shot one of the dudes and then did not call for ambulance.
*  And then people were criticizing him that he let the guy bleed out.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah, I remember these fucking crazy liberals.
*  Because this psychopathic murderer who just robbed a bank was gunning down cops because
*  he let him bleed out and didn't get him to an ambulance at times.
*  Shit.
*  Yo.
*  Exactly.
*  I think we know that guy is guilty.
*  There's no CGI in 1996.
*  Save the taxpayers some money.
*  See if you can find that, Jamie, because it's crazy to watch, man.
*  I find the best footage on it.
*  In the middle of the street, dude.
*  In the middle?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  These guys were having a shootout with cops.
*  This guy's walking down the street.
*  Damn, what was it?
*  Just blasted.
*  It was like a movie.
*  Yeah, like a fucking movie.
*  It did look like a movie.
*  Shooting at cops, dude.
*  And this is just one part of it.
*  Sometimes he was ducking behind cars with giant rifles and shit.
*  I mean, they were just armed to the tits.
*  Oh, they got him there.
*  This is him at the end.
*  So I think at the end, he's probably trying to die.
*  It's a pretty long scene, too, like when the real shit went down.
*  I forgot how it ends.
*  Oh, we got him with another shot.
*  This set keeps going because then the other guy comes.
*  So he's trying to die.
*  He's probably already been shot.
*  This guy's doing a little GTA action now.
*  It went on for a long ass time, too.
*  And this is back when if something happened, they would, we interrupt General Hospital
*  to show you the Hollywood shootout.
*  Hollywood shootout?
*  Bro, this is in the caveman days.
*  I lived in the caveman days.
*  Yo, what year was this?
*  This is like 97.
*  Oh, 97?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Oh, I thought it was.
*  See, I don't even remember this.
*  Yeah, I remember it big time.
*  Yeah, I do, too.
*  Because it was crazy.
*  Because I have a friend, my friend Justin, he's always said, he goes, dude, let me tell
*  you something.
*  Six armed dudes that know what the fuck they're doing could take over a whole city.
*  I was like, really?
*  He goes, cities are so vulnerable.
*  We're so vulnerable.
*  What?
*  Six dudes, six operators really know what they're doing.
*  Could take over a whole city.
*  Guys who used to work for Blackwater.
*  Yeah.
*  Come over.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like fucking surprised.
*  So when you see something like this happen, it's like, how do they keep these fucking
*  crazy people from, you know, we need to do a better job of finding out where the meth
*  is going.
*  I know.
*  You should fucking have a, you know, you're going to trace the illegal aliens, but find
*  out who's bringing in the meth.
*  Who's bringing, where's that fucking meth coming in?
*  I know a lot of people are coming in.
*  Or they just make it, right?
*  They just make it.
*  Yeah, they can make it.
*  Why you need precursors?
*  They try to lock down most of the drugs for it now, like the Sudafed and shit.
*  I mean, you gotta get a license to get that stuff now.
*  That's why these people that are making that, they're not using that.
*  They're getting real chemicals.
*  They're getting the real precursors, but you have to get them from like China.
*  So they're getting them from China, cooking it up in Mexico, bringing it across the board.
*  Wee!
*  The dude with the truck stopper driving all night long.
*  Breaking bad.
*  Breaking bad.
*  Yeah, as I say, Walter White doing that shit.
*  Yeah, great.
*  Another great TV show.
*  I've talked about a thousand times, but there's a book that we just read.
*  It's called Blitzed.
*  Norman Ohr.
*  It's all about the Nazis.
*  They gave them Nazi's meth.
*  Oh yeah, there's that scene of Hitler fucking watching the fucking games.
*  Yeah, but apparently, what they did was they would give it a mess so they could go three
*  days through Poland, so they could just storm through Poland.
*  And so when they did this, no one thought they could get across the whole country in
*  three days.
*  And you really couldn't unless you didn't sleep.
*  So all they did is gave these guys meth.
*  And they gave different doses to different jobs.
*  So if you were in the tanks, they gave you the most meth.
*  You're at the front of the line.
*  Fucker.
*  So you're just like, RAAAAAAA!
*  Just yelling in German and just BOOM!
*  BOOM!
*  You see that tank fucking movie?
*  I was watching it last night since you said that.
*  Brad Pitt.
*  Oh, Fieri.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's called Fieri?
*  That's fucking pretty badass.
*  That's a badass movie.
*  John Bernenthal.
*  That's a badass movie.
*  Bernenthal?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He's a good actor, man.
*  He's a good dude too, man.
*  Very interesting guy.
*  Yeah, he's very smart.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I had him on the podcast.
*  He's a genuine thinker.
*  He really thinks.
*  Sometimes you talk to actors and they're pretending to be a guy that you would want to talk to.
*  That's what it feels like when you talk to them.
*  They're not really there.
*  But John's like, right there.
*  He's also phenomenal in a movie that a lot of people didn't see called Shotcaller.
*  Oh, fuck!
*  Shotcaller with Jamie Lannister.
*  Game of Thrones guy.
*  Yeah, the Game of Thrones guy.
*  That's a fucking great movie.
*  What's it about?
*  Oh, basically, Jamie Lannister is a great actor.
*  I just know him as Jamie Lannister.
*  He's a yuppie guy.
*  He's going out to eat with another couple.
*  He goes through a red light.
*  He gets to a car accident.
*  Next thing you know, he's facing prison time.
*  And he's like, not a guy made for prison.
*  We know about that old Tom Hanks.
*  Not Tom Hanks.
*  Tom Selleck movie, Innocent Man.
*  Yeah.
*  Something kind of like that.
*  But he really did the accident.
*  Next thing you know, he gets to the prison.
*  He doesn't want to be no bitch.
*  And it goes from there.
*  And he becomes a hardcore fucking guy.
*  They call him Money.
*  And that's how he ends up.
*  But he didn't start off like that.
*  And oh man, is it a fucking...
*  You know who's in it?
*  Keith Jardine.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, Keith Jardine's a cellmate in there.
*  He's great in it.
*  Oh, he's a must book for any prison movie.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I don't think he had no time for that.
*  That fucking guy.
*  Yeah, I believe it.
*  He was great in it.
*  Don't laugh, John Rollo.
*  You next.
*  Yeah, you look like you'd be in prison too.
*  Yeah, you could be in that movie easily.
*  You'd be part of that fucking Aryan Hood movie.
*  I remember when Keith Jardine became the president of the United States.
*  Yeah, right?
*  Yeah, that was a...
*  Yeah, no one saw that coming.
*  That was a big win.
*  And then he suffered some of the same losses.
*  Well, like Houston Alexander.
*  Houston Alexander one was crazy.
*  Houston like smoked...
*  Bro, he did him.
*  Chopped him.
*  He did him.
*  He just had a bare knuckle boxing fight recently.
*  Really?
*  Houston Alexander did.
*  I believe so.
*  Dude, he's got to be in his 40s.
*  It was either a bare knuckle boxing fight or a bare knuckle boxing fight.
*  I believe so.
*  And he's got to be in his 50s.
*  And he's got to be in his 50s.
*  Dude, he's got to be in his 50s.
*  Dude, he's got to be in his 50s.
*  He's got to be in his 50s.
*  He's in his 50s.
*  It was either a bare knuckle boxing or maybe like celebrity boxing.
*  I forget, some kind of boxing thing he just did.
*  But Houston Alexander in his prime was terrifying.
*  Yeah, he was.
*  He was terrifying.
*  He had crazy power.
*  Yeah, like if he did bare knuckle when he was younger, he would have been perfect for
*  it.
*  Oh, he's built for it.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a victim of his own success.
*  That's what happened.
*  Look at that.
*  May 19th, 2023, bare knuckle.
*  He won.
*  Man, look at him result.
*  He beat Joey Beltran.
*  Joey Beltran could fight.
*  We got you.
*  Yeah.
*  Jeremy Smith.
*  Damn, look at him.
*  He's still out there fighting.
*  But he always was in phenomenal shape.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that dude was jacked.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  With that Keith Jardine fight, Jardine had him hurt.
*  And so Jardine got a little overzealous and game after him.
*  And Houston Alexander caught him.
*  That was a shocking fight.
*  Keith Jardine was a name.
*  And then this upstart, this guy coming out of nowhere.
*  I think he was a radio DJ.
*  I think he beat, was, Saqqara after that, the Italian.
*  Alessio Saqqara?
*  Yeah.
*  I thought he'd beat him too.
*  And remember that crazy fight with Kimbo too.
*  Yeah, Kimbo.
*  But I think he was a radio DJ at the time.
*  Could you imagine being a radio DJ?
*  Man, you suck, man.
*  Yeah, right?
*  I mean, he was a radio DJ.
*  He was a radio DJ.
*  He was a radio DJ.
*  He was a radio DJ.
*  He was a radio DJ.
*  He was a radio DJ.
*  Yeah, right?
*  He was a radio DJ while he was fucking people up.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  It's like you and the barbershop, Dean Thomas.
*  That's right.
*  They complained about that fade.
*  Nah, ain't no complaining about my fade.
*  You did a nice, you used to hook my head up on her every week when I still had hair.
*  That's how we became friends.
*  Because they brought it on the Ultimate Fighter IV, they brought in some chick.
*  Because they know we, you know, we're not seeing our fiancés or girlfriends or anything.
*  We have no women.
*  We got no porn.
*  We're not jerking off in the same rooms.
*  So fucking, they bring in some girl to do our hair.
*  Code?
*  At least, you know, at least as far as they know I'm not back there.
*  But, uh, so they brought in some stylist and she's not giving me a fade.
*  So I'm like, get the fuck out of here.
*  Dean's like, I got you.
*  I said, I got you, man.
*  You gave me some papers.
*  And you did.
*  You did a nice fade.
*  You know, to look good is to feel good.
*  You're probably the reason why I won that show.
*  You could never repay me for that.
*  You were the best, Dean Thomas.
*  What season are they on now?
*  32?
*  That's crazy.
*  You know what's sad, man?
*  The other day I just did a camera crew from Toronto came down.
*  They're doing a thing called Dark Side of the Cage and they want to interview me about
*  War Machine.
*  And they came out and I did a thing for that.
*  And I, uh, it just depressed me.
*  It just brought me down.
*  Because that was a kid.
*  Did you know him?
*  I had him on the podcast.
*  That's right.
*  When he was on the show, there's some guys that are just evil and there's other guys
*  that I think that if they had the right people around them, they could have made different
*  choices.
*  And that's, he was like a goofy, he had issues.
*  He was emotional.
*  He always felt like the stack was against, cards were stacked against the type of thing.
*  But, but he, but he was still, there was something likable about him on the show when he was
*  on season six of the Ultimate Fighter.
*  He was like a prankster.
*  He did it up a decker and fucking the guy's toilet.
*  He was like a silly guy.
*  I felt that if there was somebody, if he had the right people around him, I think he could
*  have made obviously a lot better choices.
*  But think about that.
*  Like, but that goes for all of us, right?
*  Because we all kind of came from the same shit from back in the day.
*  Right.
*  And then me and Matt, we still in the game.
*  But then look at guys like him and Phil Barone.
*  Well, that's the guy who was, listen, you can have too much, you know, you can have
*  too much bravado.
*  You can have too much crazy and then it'll ruin your life.
*  And there's like every fighter has a certain amount of crazy.
*  And some guys keep their crazy chamed.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Locked up.
*  Locked up in the fucking behind that mask.
*  But some guys, they just can't, they're crazy, burns them down.
*  It burns down everything around them.
*  And then, you know, you got the CTE and CTE comes into play.
*  Then there's a lot of guys that just get real impulsive.
*  They become addicts.
*  They fuck up all relationships.
*  They can't keep their shit together.
*  They're either crying or they're they're angry.
*  Some guys that are just bad eggs.
*  There are guys that are bad eggs, but there are guys for sure that are bad eggs that then get CTE.
*  Oh, I know.
*  There's probably both.
*  Yeah.
*  But like War Machine, the one guy to show up at his trial that be there for him.
*  And again, you show me your friends, you show me who you are.
*  And it was Phil Barone.
*  Now, Phil Barone is not a good guy.
*  I know the guy's from Long Island.
*  Million stories about him.
*  And isn't he in jail right now?
*  Well, that's what I'm saying.
*  Not only did he be there for War Machine, he outdid him.
*  He put his girl in the hospital, beat the shit out of her.
*  And now, you know, Barone's in jail for, you know, allegedly, you know, murder.
*  Yeah.
*  Murder in Mexico.
*  Part of our art, I think.
*  You know, it was like a bad one, too.
*  Oh, beating to death.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And now that guy, I mean, listen, allegedly, allegedly.
*  Yeah, but it's brutal, man.
*  So, you know, these guys come, you know, again, but the back to War Machine.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  It makes me more, like, Phil, I always knew was a piece of shit.
*  But War Machine, I felt, could have been helped.
*  I really do.
*  I mean, what's done is done, but I don't know.
*  It depresses me.
*  Because I thought there was some help.
*  There was some hope.
*  You had him on the show.
*  Didn't you think there was something about it?
*  I never would have imagined that he would have done that.
*  Right?
*  But I would imagine that he would lose his cool if anybody, like, challenged him.
*  A male.
*  A male.
*  I just never thought that he would do that.
*  I mean, to a girl.
*  To a girl.
*  I mean, I was shocked.
*  The whole thing is, it's just, just awful.
*  Every part about it is awful.
*  Depressed the hell out of me.
*  And how many guys that are doing this, like, have also experienced that in their life?
*  Like, seeing their mother been beaten, been beaten by their father, grew up in an abusive household
*  where everybody hits everybody.
*  There's a lot of kids, unfortunately, in this world that grow up with parents beating the shit out of them
*  and beating the shit out of each other.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, if you ever talk to Joe Pfeiffer, man, Joe Pfeiffer, oh my gosh.
*  That's my guy.
*  He was on your podcast.
*  The reason why he's a fucking assassin, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Because that dude's angry.
*  Angry.
*  He's angry.
*  All the time.
*  Angry all the time.
*  And he hits like a fucking neutron bomb.
*  He's terrifying.
*  I was working with him last week when I was with Brady and him.
*  And we were doing elbows, and my wrist still ain't the same right now.
*  Bro, when he banged out Barrio, I was like, Jesus Christ.
*  I mean, with more seasoning, Jack Del...
*  I mean, Jack...
*  Hermansen, yeah.
*  Jack Hermansen fought a beautiful fight.
*  Yeah.
*  He outsmarted him.
*  Outsmarted him, had more time in the game.
*  And Jack's stand-up has gotten a lot better over the years.
*  He used to be just this wicked grappler, but he can...
*  I mean, he held his own on the feet and won the fight mostly with striking, right?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I mean, and pace.
*  And just knowing not to empty the gas tank.
*  But Piper is so scary that he gets everybody out of there so quick.
*  Yeah, Piper is going to be up there with the best of them.
*  I promise you that.
*  I believe you, 100%.
*  He's terrifying.
*  And like a dude like that, he needs a fight like that just to kind of put it in perspective.
*  Yeah, put him in check.
*  He said, all right, I got a lot more to learn.
*  Yeah, you got to learn the gas tank.
*  How many guys don't learn the gas tank?
*  Right.
*  That's what's great about Brady the other day.
*  He knew how to pace himself.
*  He put the foot on the gas.
*  I was more impressed with his stand-up than anything.
*  Stand-up was sharp.
*  It was all his grappling.
*  And I'm thinking, this guy, I texted him right after a fight.
*  That was when I complimented him more.
*  Very sharp.
*  I got to give props to John Marquez out in Philly.
*  John Marquez, we're putting it together.
*  He's been putting in work with them guys.
*  You can tell he's a good student too, man, because every fight you see him.
*  And I think in the Bilal Muhammad fight, early in the fight, he was giving Bilal some trouble
*  standing up.
*  But Bilal just put it, I don't know if Bilal gets nearly the respect he deserves.
*  He's the man.
*  Yeah, Bilal's the man.
*  He's the man.
*  Bro, the way he put it on Leon Edwards, how the fuck do you not give that guy all the props?
*  He handled Sean.
*  He handled Sean.
*  He handled Sean too.
*  He handled Gilbert.
*  He handled Sean.
*  He handled everybody.
*  He stopped Sean standing up.
*  He stopped Sean standing up.
*  And then when you see what he did to Leon, you're like, good lord.
*  It just overwhelmed him.
*  Overwhelming pressure.
*  And on the feet too.
*  On the feet, yeah.
*  On the feet, real fucking dangerous.
*  Never lets you get set.
*  Had Leon making excuses about the time change.
*  Put it that way, yeah.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's a different kind of fight.
*  Yeah, Leon never found his timing ever.
*  And bro, that guy going to Dagestan was like the ultimate move.
*  The ultimate move.
*  You get involved with Kabib.
*  Especially with his kind of style and his work ethic.
*  Like that dude has a work ethic.
*  Made his top control look definitely better.
*  It's incredible.
*  I also think it's good that he didn't get the props.
*  Because it keeps him hungry.
*  It keeps you hungry.
*  It keeps you fucking 100%.
*  I'll show you bitches.
*  He still like that too, man.
*  He's still hungry and still down to earth.
*  He ain't get all high class.
*  No, no, no.
*  Well, he's just begun.
*  So this is a championship run.
*  He proved everybody wrong.
*  He won the title.
*  Tell everybody to fuck you.
*  Even though he doesn't even swear.
*  He says fudge.
*  He'll say like fudge you.
*  What's wrong with you, man?
*  He's supposed to cuss.
*  Crazy.
*  He doesn't cuss.
*  But that guy's just beginning his run.
*  So who knows?
*  But that division.
*  Who do you think they give him next?
*  I think they give him Kamaru.
*  I think they give him Kamaru.
*  I think they give him Kamaru.
*  I think they give him Kamaru.
*  That's what I thought too.
*  That's what I thought.
*  That's the big money fight.
*  It's the smart fight.
*  And I think they owe.
*  But they owe Kamaru for Kamaru taking Hamzah on 10 days notice.
*  And also in a three rounder instead of a five when he won the third.
*  So he's got the L which is if he's going five rounds maybe he doesn't get an L.
*  I think he doesn't get the L if it was five rounds.
*  It looked to me like he was coming on the third.
*  He had to figure him out and also he had to trust his gas tank.
*  The guy trained 10 days.
*  One of the scariest motherfuckers on earth.
*  On earth.
*  He's a gangster.
*  On earth.
*  I say you've got to give it to Kamaru because I think Kamaru earned it.
*  He had to weather that fucking storm of a first round.
*  You're getting off a couch.
*  Even if you're in great shape you have to weather something like that.
*  That can get your endurance down right there.
*  100%.
*  And he had to know how much do I have.
*  How do I manage this?
*  But he did manage it.
*  He didn't get stopped.
*  He didn't get finished.
*  And then he comes on and wins the third round.
*  You've got to go come on man.
*  You all have any more years of Kamaru.
*  He's like 37 now.
*  He doesn't have time to go on another run.
*  Just give him a title shot.
*  He's got to be 37 now.
*  How old is Kamaru?
*  I say give him a shot.
*  I say give him a shot.
*  Shavkat.
*  He's got time.
*  Not only that.
*  Every win he's a legend.
*  Bigger and bigger legend.
*  Bigger and bigger legend.
*  37.
*  See give it to him.
*  Give it to Kamaru.
*  He's got them bad ass knees too man.
*  We can't.
*  Exactly.
*  I send him every time I find something on stem cells I send it to him.
*  Do you?
*  Yeah because they're regenerating cartilage.
*  They're regenerating cartilage.
*  They're regenerating cartilage.
*  They're regenerating cartilage.
*  They're regenerating cartilage.
*  No kidding.
*  I'm thinking about doing that shit for my...
*  I'm starting to feel my shoulders man.
*  You should.
*  I'm thinking about that.
*  How long are you in town for?
*  Tomorrow.
*  What time tomorrow do you leave?
*  In the evening.
*  In the morning.
*  What time in the morning?
*  I think like 7 or something.
*  Oh really?
*  We'll get you in at 530 stem cells.
*  I might be able to get you in this afternoon.
*  You have that shit here?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Let me see.
*  I thought you were going to go to Columbia for that shit.
*  No no no no.
*  Ways to Well can do stuff here.
*  They do different things in Columbia.
*  You know I'm like a big guy.
*  I'm like a big guy.
*  I'm like a big guy.
*  Ways to well can do stuff here. They do different things in Colombia and Colombia what they could do is they can multiply the stem cells
*  So they can take stem cells they do that in siege
*  The CPI down to you wanna that's the place that's and they have a whole arrangement with the UFC
*  They're the partnership with the UFC CPI is incredible. They're in Tijuana. Damn
*  Yeah, my buddy has a spot at home called life med
*  They have a deal with the UFC as well Petrovsky goes there like a bunch of these guys doing that stem cells are absolutely
*  Yeah, cuz I mean listen, I got a new knee and it's holding up great, but I hear stuff with the shoulders
*  You're fucked you can't get soldier surgeries and shit
*  It's gonna take some time it's a complicated joint, but do you do anything to strengthen your shoulders you do any workouts?
*  I mean now I mean I do my push-ups and I hang from my bar
*  Anybody should shit out anybody that I shoulder problems. I have no affiliation with these people get yourself crossover symmetry bands
*  Get yourself these bands they're there they start with like five pounds or something like that
*  I use a 25 pound one
*  It's not a lot of force and I do a series of exercises
*  Just to stabilize my shoulders a whole series of different things that I do
*  Every week no matter what I do these like that thing with the coils back in it is but it's just it's like a bungee cord
*  It's a good cord like, you know
*  Rubber strap that you're pulling on
*  One two different ones have different weights to them so you can start off low
*  But the whole idea is there's a whole chart that comes with it and shows you all the different things and it just
*  Strengthens all the shit that you don't strengthen when you're just lifting weights
*  Okay, if you're just lifting weights, or especially just rolling how often are you really using those shoulder muscles?
*  You're using everything right?
*  So are your shoulder muscles getting a good workout or is your cardiovascular?
*  System and your legs and your biceps and your back that can be a good workout
*  But you're gonna miss some muscle groups
*  You get to miss his muscle groups and the only way to like really strengthen joints
*  I think is exercise and I think you got to do weights and bands and a bunch of shit just to protect your joints
*  That's like that knees over toes guys
*  Yeah talking about to helps to really stabilize that, you know the connective ligaments
*  Yeah, all the stabilizers up and that's the that's the thing everybody neglects because if you go too heavy
*  Your delt takes over and your rotator cuffs not getting it
*  So exactly, you know this kind of this kind of stuff is definitely should be used that knees over toes guy
*  Gotta hold shoulder bulletproofing program to with like light dumbbells. We're doing a bunch of these
*  I love his knee shit. See I gotta do that because holding pads for people. Oh
*  Isn't it crazy how some dudes just have crack just have some extra crack
*  I'm tight Joe Pfeiffer Oh extra crack. Yeah for sure extra crack for sure
*  I wouldn't want to hold paths with that dude. You're gonna get carpal tunnel syndrome
*  Yeah, and that's what happened to me all in one week
*  You had extra crack crack
*  People you would catch people and you would see this like oh no look on their face like when you caught GSP
*  I remember thinking like this because we already knew by then that you could knock people out with one shot
*  Which was so odd for a jiu-jitsu guy
*  So like everybody had to worry about your ground game
*  But they always have to worry about being in the pocket because one of those hammers drops in there
*  You got a real problem on your hand. I'm gonna lie when I fought man
*  I was like ain't let him hit me with that right hand
*  But you you didn't have a background in striking as a child, right?
*  My father's little pants for me I had a wooden dummy in my garage I used to do all
*  If you're doing Wing Chun as a
*  Something to add on that's fun, but the trapping range the crapplings right there anytime I got into a real fight
*  I'd start with a chain punch and I do my double leg so I think there's something to it for transitions
*  I think there's something to having all those moves here think about how many times you see boxers
*  Literally swat a guy's hand down to land a punch
*  But by yourself it shit of court but taekwondo by itself a shit too
*  Exactly all those things by them
*  but I think I knew a dude who was really good at Wing Chun and he was explaining some things to me and
*  What some of the things that he was showing me this there's certain
*  Vulnerabilities if you're inside with someone where they can really easily
*  manipulate your arms back and forth and move your guard around and drop elbows on you like wing Wing Chung and then Muay Thai you see
*  Some of the Muay Thai stuff where guys grab risks and come over here. There's a lot
*  That's a lot of Wing Chung differences it when you look at two Muay Thai guys get into a street fight
*  It'll probably look something like you're watching them in a Muay Thai fight. You put two kung fu masters in there
*  I've never seen
*  Cause it starts like a hip man movie and then they fucking on the floor
*  I go what the? I go that white belt's winning
*  Guys are dropping for ankle ups
*  It's fucking horrendous
*  I've seen a few of those
*  I've seen a few of those
*  But I feel the Weston boxing like Longo got me obviously got them you know I had to learn on the job
*  You know cuz it's different back in the day because everybody
*  Everything started moving when the UFC came out everybody's like oh fuck all the striking
*  So I was like in my mentality
*  I'm like all right
*  I got to just close the distance you can't trade and then I had to relearn like no no no
*  Sometimes you got to be in the fire and you have to learn those mechanics and and whatnot well
*  That's the difference between guys who are pretty good and guys we can champions is like this ability to absorb other skills
*  And then implement them at a world-class level while you're an adult. Yeah, which is crazy
*  It's not easy to do it's great
*  Very hard to do and most guys they like are always gonna be a step behind the guys who started out as a child
*  Oh, it's just natural more natural to ride in a crack speaking of crack
*  Mark Nelligratty says that you have the hardest kick that he's ever held for
*  And that's something say more than that
*  Yeah, they're not not a lot of people might give you a credit for anything he said Joe give him a line if you give him a call
*  I
*  Like Mark Nelligratty on season four we didn't have set coaches
*  He was like an assistant coach, and he gave above and beyond for everybody. Yeah
*  He's a great dude and a great coach to training with him
*  Yeah
*  He shows he showed me all kinds of things that tightened up my technique all kinds of things all kinds of things like just in
*  Transitions like transitional techniques like different things to do off of different kicks and shit. He's still teaching as a school, right?
*  He still has a school. Yeah, what is it called?
*  Sigetoms that's what I was gonna say. Yeah, but yeah, but I do I try to hurt him. You try to hurt those arms. Oh, yeah
*  You know, he was letting us hit the pads take him down hit on the floor like he'd be earned his
*  Cash on fucking ultimate fight. He's a man. Yeah, he's a great coach and you know speaks Thai fluent. Does he really I didn't know that fluently
*  Speaks Thai. Well, yeah, he can go to Thailand just talk to people. No kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  He's gonna we've got a Thai restaurants and he's just
*  Yeah, he does he speaks Thai he fought in Thailand a bunch yeah new dad
*  He's a interesting dude. Very interesting, dude
*  Hey
*  We breaking out the smell insults. Are you scared? I am scared. Wait, you should also what are they?
*  This is the strongest. I know what I mean. Maybe there's some stronger shit fucked up. I don't I'm not aware of but this is a
*  Juju Mufu should give us like a discount code
*  It's called ah, it's just dude. Juju Mufu. Do you know who he is?
*  I've never heard you ever crazy power lifter athlete super athletic
*  I'm easy athletic but built like Bobby lash okay and do full splits over tables
*  It's like doing like so 500 pound overhead. Oh, yeah, bro. He's crazy flexible. Anyway, the thong he's a nut
*  He's a nut. He's like always doing nutty shit for the internet. So the smell assault to get me looking like that
*  No, no, I think you need some other things
*  Take the smelling salts before you lift that way
*  Smelling sauce before you go across the border with 15 pounds
*  So
*  No, no, no, no, no, so again, this is a fresh one the fresh ones are the strongest Jesus
*  This is so strong that I'm gonna open it. It's a sealed bottle
*  There's the bottle sealed on the bag is sealed to god damn my hands are sweaty
*  This

*  That's no Vicks vapor up
*  Oh my god, Raul probably did it this morning before he woke up yo, man, it's been many many years
*  Wow, get in there Rallo. Oh
*  I think I have a shit you're not a cure snoring for sure
*  Yeah, I'm sweating
*  What movie is this from
*  Blade
*  Seeing with this opening scene of any superhero movie of all time. Did you see Deadpool Wolverine? No
*  It cannot fuck with the opening scene in blade when they all turn to vampires and he thought he was gonna fuck Tracy Lord
*  Oh, yeah
*  So he's down there hanging out with Tracy Lords and he doesn't know she's a vampire and she leads him down this basement where he
*  sees bodies hanging from meat hooks
*  So what the fuck is this place and then the sprinkler starts spraying blood and everybody turns into a vampire around him
*  And he's freaking out. He's trying to get out of there and she's like, hey, baby
*  This is a great movie he gets his ass kicked. They're all beating him up and they're about to kill him
*  So as Wesley Snipes back as blade they're gonna have him back as blade
*  Oh
*  He's
*  They should have brought him back as blade right when he got a present
*  Fingers here it is. Here it is. This is a scene. I call shit the daywalker
*  They're like, oh no, come on bro
*  Martial arts slash superhero movie ever than he fucks everybody up of course, that was great
*  So what is what do people do to smelling salts for they do it before they lift?
*  Yeah power lifters that they're gonna take a big lift a lot
*  Oh, just like one before
*  Have a shit in her gym bags and they bring it with them and they're ready to go for something crazy
*  They want to do some big dead lift
*  Yeah, I was about to say that I think it's good for America
*  We have them at the studio or at the comedy club
*  dudes take smell salts for the go on stage
*  Yeah, it's fun. Yes it around the room
*  The stuff we have the
*  Comedy club those not this strong. This is the strongest one. This one fucks you up
*  The other ones you can kind of get in there a little bit. Yeah

*  Yeah
*  You get too close with that one and it'll burn the inside of your head. I like it. I felt that I felt like I felt it in my brain
*  You want to go around to do it around to I feel like that's what around three
*  That's what happens with everybody everybody like they get it and they're like why I was terrible. That was terrible. Let me do it again
*  You know why make me feel like a crack and I do this you got me into the sixes
*  Yeah, I backed off because I was realizing I think I like these things too much
*  Hmm, especially gets the body to hit a little adrenaline. Oh really that does yeah, we're talking about the nicotine doesn't oh no, no, I
*  Like the nicotine stuff. I like them when I'm having conversations. What'd you do to me now? They're good. I don't think it's bad. I
*  Just think you got to be careful like I like to take days off. See if it's freaking me out
*  So far no problems. I'm having fun. It's the trifecta now. I told y'all whatever y'all do today. I'm doing
*  Yeah, I'm good
*  This is dying out if you keep the lid off like you it's dying out already in between uses keep it
*  But I think it's you know, it's probably
*  Jesus how consistent makes your eyes water
*  About to pull a Kaleel around
*  Kaleel I'm sorry. I just want to tell you I'm sorry, but that is gonna be a wild fight
*  Shit, yeah, it's gonna be a wild fight. It's gonna be fan friendly for sure. Yeah, Kaleel is probably
*  Never shot a take down his entire career
*  No, he's never shot a take down in the UFC rough Kaleel hits anybody
*  Yeah, he can knock you out Alex gets hit, you know, I mean it's he does well
*  He puts himself he's got that crazy style man. That's style. That's snake like
*  In the hands kind of hold. Yeah, it's hold his hands right here and just like pop up
*  You've seen him sparring right you've seen some of those videos in his farm like really good boxers man
*  Yeah, he's staying in the pocket with him too. And that style is hard to handle because it's so weird
*  They're used to everything like that one boxer that he was
*  Training with is like, I don't know if he's professional. He's but he's a big heavyweight very skillful
*  But everything was like real traditional right and then you see
*  prayers moving at you like a cobra
*  Like it's so hard to figure out what the fuck he's doing and you're lucky. He's not kicking you, you know
*  He's just punching this dude, but hey good like you said Kaleel if he lands he lands everybody
*  Yeah, for sure. Everybody goes night. Night. That guy's fast as fuck. I know and he fights angry
*  How old is?
*  Prayer they're both about the same age. I believe 34. How old is Khalil? I
*  Think so rare is 35 and I think Khalil is probably in that same range
*  How's Khalil
*  Wow
*  Yeah, so I had no idea was that old 37, but that's like 34 and fighting well
*  It's 37 Amazon warrior year
*  34 speaking a superhero. Yeah, he doesn't he has some damage though some kickboxing fights
*  he you know, he got a true and you know the one with
*  The bad one with Izzy that was a bad one that was a bad ko and that's a weight-drained ko, you know
*  Yeah, definitely ko at 85 and just Izzy caught him with that perfect right hand
*  Well, I asked you because when guys guys did fight like like Roy Jones
*  Amazing but an amazing athlete. He was so much faster than everybody fought with he could keep his hands down
*  Right still never get hit but when he started to slow down
*  Everybody knocked him out. So I'm that's why I asked how old prayer was cuz I'm like maybe when he slows a bit
*  And the hands are down. Yeah, that's what starts to get pushed
*  I think this is my opinion with work with Roy what happened was he went up and he fought John Ruiz and then he went down
*  He won this time. I don't think he was he was not the same
*  I think and I don't know but I would imagine if you want to get really big
*  What do you do there's not a lot of ways to get really big, right?
*  How do you want to how do you go from 168 to 200 pounds? How do you do that?
*  Well, you lift some weights and then you get a little help you guys are friends
*  Then you have to get off of that and then you have to drop
*  25 pounds from your body so your body's fully acclimated to this new frame
*  That's a hard cut support and he looks if you look at the way he looked pre
*  Tarver fight like you if you go back and watch him fight like James Tony when he was in his prime
*  You watch him fight like some of the better fights of his career the Vinnie pazienza fight
*  We didn't get hit with one punch
*  But he was also shredded yeah, he was shredded and he looked like hard like
*  But when you see him after the tarver fight he was way more smooth, I think that cut was hard man
*  I think that cut was hard and then he probably got off whatever he got on
*  Working right and if you don't have a good doctor and you just try to do this with Jim bros
*  Next thing, you know, you're in a shitty Matrix equals didn't have any
*  Johnson one
*  And that was off the tarver fight right and so you see like all of a sudden this dude just can't take a shot anymore
*  And Glenn Johnson who was one of those?
*  Unheralded dangerous dudes they could really kind of beat anybody that crazy clamshell
*  Australia
*  Kyle Nagy did not come out right now, but he shut him out though. He shut him out. Yeah, he's tough
*  Cause I would just throw volume. Yeah. Yeah for sure. Hey, Roy Jones Roy Jones. He was in his face like
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, if you if you fought the Roy Jones that James Tony had a fight then yeah, that's it that's not
*  One of the purest power punchers was Julian Jackson. Oh my god. Yes the Hawk. Oh
*  Oh my god, you know, um
*  Kevin Kevin Hollins coach works what used to work with him real? Yeah, they're like really good friends that guy
*  Bad guy had power power play that play the Terry Norris fight Julian Jackson Terry
*  Yeah, Danny green Danny green. Yeah, you know, I'm gonna use the head real quick
*  Terry Norris and Julie Julian Jackson Terry Norris, right dude, you just do yeah, Julie the Jackson highlights
*  Terrifying well Terry Norris that poor guy. Yeah, he's in real
*  Nobody had more one punch power than Julie. No, no short short punches to just black off. I
*  Used to love him. Yeah, Orland Norris. He's good, too. Oh, they were he has his brother was a heavyweight and he was a 47 remember
*  47 and 54 right but watch this Julian Jackson KO
*  It's so crazy cuz it's like he just shuts him off and he hit he hit and Terry Norris was a killer
*  Oh, this is a prime Terry Norris. This is a prime Terry Norris. This is a dangerous Terry Norris here, but he just catches him
*  Watch this
*  Big okay. So that was the first one. So you heard him with that left hand
*  But he catches him with the right hand and just freezes him. Oh
*  my god
*  I'm gonna get my hair cut like his one punch fighter. I know was just some guys just like to say I'm stalking
*  I would be terrified. You would it I would be terrified if that guy was stalking me like that
*  it's just he knows all he has to do is get you once and
*  Every time he hits you, you know it too cuz you're like, oh shit that uppercut. This is fucking terrifying
*  So he's already softened him up and there it is
*  Oh
*  Man he took two more. He didn't know he took two more. He was out on his feet
*  Bro, and those were wind up ones. The last two he took were wind up ones
*  Julian Jackson was terrified
*  And Gerald McClellan had his number like I felt so bad for him like cuz he got slept so fast in those fights
*  No, Gerald McClellan was a 75 pounder. Oh, they fought twice
*  Gerald McClellan fought Terry Norris Julian Jackson. Oh
*  Oh, that's right. But that's when Julian went up. Yeah. So was Julian a middleweight at this time?
*  I believe so
*  Thing is like I didn't know that cuz there's Gerald McClellan and Julian Jackson were at the same weight class
*  Yeah, they were fighting twice. I was at one of the fights McClellan though was like 175 though, right the MGM
*  McClellan was so dangerous man
*  My first live boxing card I ever went to was in Vegas at the MGM and it was all rematches
*  It was Jesse James Lejhan Azuma Nelson. Yeah, it was I think it was Simon Brown and
*  Vincent Petway, it was Julian Jackson and Gerald McClellan and it was Julio Cesar Chavez and Frankie Randall
*  God what weight is this at? What weight is this at?
*  Because I know they were trying to set up middleweight
*  Crazy so that's
*  That's so that's before well they were talking about a Roy Jones jr. Fight and I think he was really
*  Big time
*  Yeah, cuz Gerald McClellan really struggling to make weight Gerald took his belt and then they rematched and he slept him like and so the Nigel Ben fight
*  That was middleweight as well Nigel Ben man. He uh, that was the one that ended his career
*  That was the one that ended his career
*  Gerald McClellan, yeah, dude
*  He was I mean in my opinion there was a lot of rabid punching and he wound up having a blood clot in the back of his head
*  Well, there's also they there was a nasty headbutt in that fight too, but it's also Nigel Ben came back from that first round
*  Which oh look at that KO. Oh my goodness and in the rematch he sleeps him fast. Oh my goodness
*  What is going on with his hair?
*  It was always
*  What is that?
*  But I mean it's like that and like the little decides you need a lot God Gerald McClellan just coming after you for all terrifying
*  That's it. Yeah, I'm gonna let him count
*  He just had he had his number man beat him both times. Well, he was one of the scariest punchers of all time
*  Yeah, both but he's another guy who tried to empty the gas tank with Nigel Ben that first round and Ben survived
*  Any winds up having that brain bleed?
*  That's that's one of the scariest ones ever man because is this the rematch
*  Okay, let's watch this execution. I remember this. I was at this one
*  This was in Vegas. Yeah, I'm Jim
*  Well once John McClellan knew that he could put it on you
*  It's like his power was just so nuts for that weight class, but I always wanted to know like what does he really weigh?
*  He's like one of those Benavides guys like when you get in there
*  What do you really weigh because he he really struggled with the weight cut and that's one. Oh my god
*  Get some early in this one off dude T and off that shot to the body
*  My goodness, he can't even look up he's not even like giving us chance to get off just getting executed
*  Every shots got murder on it. Oh
*  That left to the body, oh my goodness the power in these fucking punches man just overwhelmed yeah liver shot
*  They're giving them a stand-in eight. Isn't that crazy standing eight count is kind of nuts the stumest rule ever
*  It's kind of nuts your cousin
*  Eight seconds to clear your head and get the way to do it. It really is
*  Well, you remember when shooto used to do standing eight counts. Mm-hmm. Yeah back in the day. Yeah. Yeah
*  What do you think about red cards or yellow? I think they should bring them back
*  Would you bring them back for stalling stalling? Yeah. Yeah, that's probably about the only thing you should bring them back for stalling
*  Like hanging it hanging out too long. Hey, man get to work. I
*  Slid it was a submission and like pride and they did the referee be like, what do you say?
*  Yeah, when someone caught something yeah, what do you guys think of Ortega and Lopez
*  Gonna get him
*  Lopez went through a roller coaster ride his last fight
*  I know imagine that you got three different opponents. You got three different weight classes. Everything's changing
*  Well, you got two different opponents, right?
*  But a bunch of different weight classes, and then Ortega can't make it and so Ortega steps out and then he winds up fighting
*  Danny gay 50k gay on like 40 minutes notice, right?
*  Dan's is chillin as you know, I'm gonna train that like something I didn't know about that, but I was watching
*  DC was actually talking about this and he said that EGAY had been training for five or six weeks
*  Obviously he took the fight on like a two-hour call. They said Lopez had only been training for three weeks
*  Got tired in the fight and everybody's thinking he's got a big gas tank we had to cut weight to
*  Cut weight to 45. Yes. I had three weeks of training weight up and down everywhere
*  And he was able to pull it out. Didn't they fight it? Yeah, there was same day when yeah
*  Yeah, which is crazy and that was just really like no one should be cutting weight kids, right?
*  Like at this point like if you make the fight happen, just let him show up
*  I think what they really should do they really should do is just find out what you fucking actually weigh and just stop fighting
*  It should be looked at the same way steroids are looked at it should be looked at the same way all other kind of cheating
*  Is looked at it's sanctioned cheating. It is
*  Just whatever you weigh just fight there exactly and more options for weight classes
*  Do you think same-day weigh-ins would change it but it would get more guys hurt? I mean they say that because of the dehydration
*  Yeah, I mean this is the reason why McClellan one of the things I say about
*  head injuries and death in boxing
*  The vast majority of them don't take place in heavyweight
*  So the guys who hit the hardest are not the guys who are getting these like horrible brain injuries where they get dead
*  Those are not cutting weight
*  They're not cutting weight and the guys who die a lot like the duck who Kim's like if you look at the guys who die
*  A lot of them never the same after oh my god
*  How could you be you killed a guy right a lot of those guys that are dying or dying in the weight classes where?
*  They cut a lot of weight. Well, I mean you're right
*  Like Shawn Brady and Gilbert Burns over the weekend like they're way Shawn Brady's 170
*  Walk into the cage at 190, right? You just be fighting at one
*  You should be fighting at 190 and this way they both agree to it, you know, you can't get any heavier than 194
*  But you we know what you weigh like let's just make
*  Fuck all this weight cutting. It's just cheating
*  It's and also the the fucking drama of seeing if a guy dehydrated himself enough
*  24 hours before a cage fight is somehow another interesting to people where Daniel Cormier pushing down on that towel
*  Ridiculous John Jones and Daniel Cormier were both fucking killers. Let him eat
*  Fuck all this weighing in you know what you weigh figure out what you weigh when you make the contract
*  Yeah, and then just that's what it is. Yeah, that's what it is
*  That's your way and and be loose about it guys a pound over a pound under who gives a fuck
*  Well, how about don't dehydrate yourself? How about what they did the Mikey Musumichi?
*  Well, I mean he was going up and wait to fight Cade Rotolo
*  so he went up to 170 and they're like a
*  Couple days like a week before they're like no you got to go back down to 135 K
*  Rotolo's out so they're and he's the champion and they treated him like this and they're like you got to go back down and cut
*  30 pounds he gets sick cutting 30 pounds. Well, you know most
*  Belt that's fucked up. Wait a minute
*  Wait for missing weight, wait a minute really? Yes. That's what I'm saying. Like they like one totally fucked him
*  I didn't hear that. Yeah
*  I saw it. I saw an article about it. How can you take his belt when he's in the hospital for trying to do you a favor?
*  Exactly. My point exactly. I was shocked because that's really not what they're supposed to be about
*  How are you gonna make this fucking guy fight after he almost
*  They had a statement or after he's cutting 30 pounds. How are you making him do that? He's cutting 30 pounds in three days
*  What's their statement?
*  One speaks out. Okay, what'd they say after recent events?
*  We feel it is necessary to provide additional context on Mikey Musumichi's withdrawal from the
*  168 Denver card sit your tongue and Musumichi
*  Set of Musumichi Mike was obviously put in a difficult spot when Cade Rotolo withdrew due to injury when that happened
*  We work closely with him and his team on a new opponent
*  Competing at flyweight was something that he personally requested as he felt confident that he could make the hydrated limit of 135 pounds for
*  World title defense. This is not something we pushed to him to do on short notice or would have ever demanded of a one-athlete
*  Given how much we prioritize fighter safety after Mikey failed weight and hydration tests on Thursday
*  he requested an opponent submission grappling contest against
*  Roberto Olivera and we continue to work with him to try to keep him on the card city on tongue
*  Continued on Musumichi
*  He ultimately felt it was his best interest to withdraw from the contest and we are honoring that at this writing is uncertain
*  When Musumichi will return to one or who will compete for the now vacant belt?
*  Musumichi was diagnosed with
*  Phenoume
*  Me dee stinem
*  Pneumomedia stinem a rare condition which air leaks from a part of the lung. Oh Jesus
*  How do you fucking strip a guy when he winds up in the hospital like they didn't fight right exactly
*  That doesn't make any sense like imagine if Alex is fighting Khalil roundtree and in making weight
*  He winds up in the hospital and the fights canceled. He doesn't lose his belt. Well in this organization
*  It does that's great. That's what I'm saying. That's crazy. See another reason why weight cutting should be
*  It's nonsense. It's nonsense. It's terrible
*  They're always gonna fucking do it. Yeah, but you know what man? I think it's a part of the culture that can be eradicated
*  I don't think it's impossible to eradicate it. That's like saying all they can always do steroids
*  Well, you saw it came along and they fixed that right, you know, and now drug-free sport. They fixed it
*  It's like most of these athletes are pretty clean. There might be a few instances of questionable
*  Perhaps a trip to a foreign land
*  But you're right for the most part it is the most part
*  Yeah
*  because we've seen like deteriorations of performance because guys have had to clean up the uber Eam era was the best era
*  When it was just it was an IQ test. I was just looking at pictures of him today versus uber Eam and it's pretty crazy
*  On the way
*  Now he's like he's on a vegan diet and he's all spiritual really yeah Alster's like real thin now
*  Yeah, what is it? He's maybe what 200 pounds? Yeah, he's he's thinner than he was when he was fighting. That's a weird picture
*  It's hard to tell from that picture. That's when I could find he looked bigger than the other ones
*  Well, he means still big they have like side by sides of him then and now
*  It's hard to tell in that picture. He's always gonna be a big guy
*  You know, he's a massive man, but you know when he fought Brock Lesnar, he was just a freak of science
*  Yeah, he was the freakiest of all freaks
*  If you just let that dude juice it up like that that that guy back in the day
*  Yeah, he was the most dangerous because those kickboxing skills were top-notch. How about V tour when he was on?
*  Baby traps up to his you know, you had them turtle shells back the old
*  Robbed us of the real uber him like if uber him could have stayed uber
*  Yeah, could have stayed uber and just continued at 265 when he fought Brock baby, baby, baby
*  Bro them kicks boxing skills his kickboxing skills were super legit
*  I think I was a K1 Grand Prix champion that super legit kickboxing skills and he wasn't a bad grappler
*  He had a good guillotine. Yeah
*  Trials in Europe. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's legit and man that fucking the kickboxing though. Oh
*  Mm-hmm. It's funny how you know you look back on
*  those days like especially the juicy days and you wonder like
*  What would the world look like now if we were under the same sort of protocols?
*  They were they were under then if there was no real to forget about the TRT days cuz that was everybody lost their fucking mind
*  You're allowing guys to juice up right crazy, but when there was just tests at the weigh-ins
*  It's a different thing man. Yeah, that's a different thing. Just testing at the weigh-in. Yeah, no random
*  That's for sure. I've eaten fine
*  That is true it is rough to get hydrated back up though now
*  Like what was the explanation for that
*  Yeah, apparently there's some ways that you can mask you just over flood your system with fluids and it cleans out all the traces
*  of whatever
*  Metabolites be in there. I guess it you know, it's probably a window where it would get back in your urine
*  It's hard to get the hydrate. Yeah, that was kind of my point cuz it kind of takes away from the safety
*  But I guess brother we shouldn't be doing that. They shouldn't be dehydrating themselves
*  I know but but it seems like you know this I actually said this to the guys that bought the UFC
*  When I was talking to Ari about it, I was like dude
*  There's the first thing you should do figure out a way to get rid of the weight classes
*  As they are like whoever is a champion in that keep them as champion
*  Let them defend the belt at what they actually weigh
*  Like you got a big this weight cuttings the most the thing is gonna fuck us more than anything
*  Is just somebody gets really badly hurt because they had a really bad weight cut
*  You know guys have kidney failure for sure and it's just died you lose all the water around your brain
*  I'm gonna wait limit. I mean wait
*  More weight classes you need a weight class. I think you need one every 10 pounds
*  But I think we should be a little bit looser on like what a person weighs
*  I think you should make a contractual obligation to like fight each other you find out what a person way
*  He weighs his natural weight is 175. Do you want to fight him? Your natural weight is 169
*  You're agreed that you can't get any higher than 176. Are you cool with that? Yeah, okay. I'm cool with that
*  It's like total you don't have to think at all about cutting weight at all
*  And so the day before the fight instead of almost dying you're filling yourself up with carbs and nutrients. You're relaxing
*  You're gonna have a better performance. It's better for the sport. It's better for the health of the athletes
*  it's more representation of what a real
*  155 pound guy looks like because you see those guys and they get in there and they're 180 like dracus
*  Yeah, that is not an 185 pound man. He's fucking massive
*  Maybe they need to weigh in the day
*  They're signing a contract to see where both of them are that way right shenanigans
*  He's got a little they need to hydrate you too. They're like you dudes will fuck around sure
*  They'll still cut away
*  So if we have a hydration thing like say if you were gonna compete you you you need to be in shape in your
*  Fighting weight and then we're gonna weigh you in and we're gonna check your water levels. We're gonna check your hydration
*  Okay, this is what you actually weigh you weigh
*  182 pounds in your prime ready to go. Okay, so this is what you guys are contractually obligated to stay in this range
*  Mm-hmm, so you can't get any higher than 183 or 184. He's given like a two pound. Nobody's have to take a shit
*  No one's gonna be saying their real weight to begin with now
*  They fucking hydrate test. Yeah, they test so they show up you say to a guy like look we're gonna show up
*  We're gonna test you at the weight that you're gonna fight at so you can't get any higher than this and we're gonna make sure
*  That you're not dehydrated
*  So we're gonna check you to make sure that you're not fucking around like pretending that you're one hundred and eighty two pounds really
*  200 and you dehydrate yourself for the last four hours
*  Let's find out what you really weigh what they do and like Maryland for like high school wrestling
*  They before the season the kids have to get the electric, you know body composition
*  Yeah, and it sees what they weigh it sees where their body fat percentage is and it says you can't go no lower than this
*  So they basically dictate to them. They should do a little bit more and they should do blood
*  They should do blood hydration levels. They should check your urine. They should I think that would cost a lot for
*  What school systems doing is great, I mean for the UFC they just need to be sure
*  Don't let anybody fuck around like hey showed up at 196 you still want to take the fight like what the fuck it's 182
*  What are we doing?
*  96 the problem is the UFC has the ability to do this. No other organization would have the ability to do that's what I'm saying
*  That's the problem is it and the UFC obviously could do it. I get the P. I like every year. This is what we do
*  No other or like regional level organizations would be able to do it. So it'd be a little tougher
*  Doesn't California do some kind like Andy Foster do some kind of hydration testing there for athletes
*  I think he has a limit on how much you can gain. I think he has a percentage
*  Yeah, North Carolina does that too?
*  They have a but then you just making sure that guys dehydrated because guys are knuckleheads
*  They're gonna dehydrate themselves anyway to have that size advantage
*  Especially got like McClellan who's things gonna take you out in the first round anyway, and they're size bullies
*  Yeah, you should find out what you fucking really weigh and fight at what you really weigh out
*  It shouldn't be the ultimate weight cutting championship. Yeah better for your chin not to be
*  Everything better for the longevity better for the health of your physical body that is your weapon of war for sure
*  Yes for everything recovery performance. There'd be better fights
*  I like the P. I that's pretty that's a good
*  Yeah
*  Look it can be done because if it wasn't and then all sudden people started doing it
*  It would be something people would call out if nobody ever cut weight and then all sudden everybody started cutting weight
*  What the fuck is this shit you're not 170 pounds
*  How are you the 170 pound champion when you weight 200 pounds that's crazy my wife hates that she's
*  That's her biggest peeve with MMA is weight cutting. She's like that's not even fair
*  You know well it is fair because you're both doing it, but it's not right. Yeah
*  stupid for everybody 155 was brutal for me to make and
*  165 that would have been great for me. That's what I'm saying 170
*  I was I was small for once so all you need is 10 pounds every 10 pounds we go 170 goes to 175
*  85 95
*  205 maybe 225
*  And then it's super big as the fucking guy is I don't like this to 65 bullshit
*  Rolla Williams last time you weighed 265
*  Actually right now
*  The biggest well you were
*  305
*  So you'd have to lose a fuck load of weight you'd have to lose 40 fucking pounds. That's crazy
*  Yeah, that's crazy. That's so hard to do like when you got a guy like in Ghana
*  There's a natural 265 which is nuts like he falls right there
*  Like right in the hot zone like a natural shredded 265, but that's what he really weighs
*  Obvious you see it. He's not cutting weight right right right wait, right?
*  What's that wait do they have the same shit in Bellator or PFL? Yeah?
*  I think they don't think they have a super heavyweight
*  Yeah, I think anybody has an active super heavyweight division in MMA that I'm aware of no big organization
*  I don't think PFL has it Japan really was the only place to put on the crazy
*  No, I let a 180 pound guy fight a gorilla
*  Fuck they have Gabby Garcia fight housewives
*  Pseudo took on all kinds of giant
*  Butterbeak crack yeah, yeah, yeah that guy remember that time we had a boxing match against some football player
*  Somebody let some poor football player have a boxing match with butter being it might have been a celebrity boxing match and butter
*  Being knocked him into another dimension. He's a tough man, bro. Yeah
*  What did I used to call him the king of the four round? Yeah?
*  So big is going to 450 fucking pounds
*  So he could go out there and windmill, but what a goddamn nightmare that guy was you couldn't hit anything on him
*  Well, he was like he's he was doing horribly. He's like 150 sweaters on you're not gonna hurt him
*  like a hundred for these sweaters
*  And that other guy looks natural who
*  It's gotta be Japan who is that yeah, who is he fighting there, but he's like kicking this guy
*  Royce also, this is a kickboxing match. Yeah, not
*  When I was at my heaviest that kind of
*  Just type that in that system. Oh, well, it might have been it might be a football player trained MMA
*  Marcus Royster. Oh nice to need the body. He's big. He's big enough
*  But see if you could find there was a boxing match that he had against some
*  some football player dude, dude poor butter being that guy was
*  Couldn't walk couldn't anything but now he's fucked up celebrity boxing. That's probably it. Yeah
*  Page brought it like really did another
*  Brought him back man
*  Shout out the DDP such a positive guy. Yeah, like put him in the house feeding them all that
*  He's feeling but it's such a good you should like it's something to see like he really brought him back butter being couldn't even
*  What a mean verse bad?
*  First big fight
*  This poor dude this poor dude got shot into another dimension. Oh, he looks like he looks like he's getting shot
*  For that fucking step. This is one of them guys that you know, somebody should have told him
*  Like this is a bad idea
*  Well, eventually this fucking crazy-looking dude is gonna catch you
*  We're all these meat bombs gonna hit you right in your porn stash. Yeah, right
*  There's a thing about winning with a porn stash
*  You know, but you get KO'd with a porn stash on people not they don't feel sympathetic to you
*  They should you stupid ass with that mustache
*  See if you can find out where this ends. Yeah butter being right
*  Come on this is a highlight whoever they this is a clickbait on us
*  So does it does he stop him here?
*  You can punch it was just crazy to watch a guy who's only willing to fight four rounds
*  I
*  Was awesome
*  Was 18 there's a place for everything right like like the bare-knuckle thing like we're talking about Mike Perry before
*  Yeah started doing this that that's a perfect spot for that dude
*  He should have told Jake Paul listen, we need to fight but let's do bare-knuckle. Yeah, let's go
*  I'll do this you do that, you know, it's a different thing man. It's a different thing with that guy
*  Looks like Matt always has plenty of strengths. Yeah
*  You got to take that payday. I mean, what did he make out of that fight?
*  He probably made 10 million bucks. Yeah, and Jay Paul's very smart man
*  Like he gets guys that he's he's bigger than
*  Another boxer his size was long fury and he lost Tom Fury good Tommy Fury very good fight very good fight
*  You know, I think he's like any other young up-and-coming boxer
*  It's just everybody dismisses him because he's a youtuber for sure
*  It's easy to dismiss him but I was there when he knocked out Tyron and I was like man I'm done with this kid
*  Another fight in my life man. I was like, you know, he just knocked my boy flat out on his face, man
*  It was I was heartbroken. Well, he has power is real power
*  That's why I like everybody's talking about this Mike Tyson thing. I was like man. They should not be letting this thing happen
*  I really hope he doesn't knock Mike Tyson out
*  To me I'll just be real bummed out to see Mike get killed
*  What other sport are we where we let a 58 year old man compete other than golf right?
*  But you know saying like why are we letting this happen? It's kind of crazy, but he's made for it man
*  Like he's made my guess. Yeah, I mean it's listen. I'm sure he's perfectly capable of knocking him out
*  he is perfectly capable if
*  He's eggs when he should have zagged if Mike can close the distance in a way that he doesn't expect and Mike also has
*  layers upon layers of attacks that are in his
*  Mind he's forgotten more about boxing Jake Paul has ever remembered
*  Yeah, it's just how quickly can it happen because how much gas is a guy also gonna have why how does he feel now?
*  He might have been excited when he said he was wanted to do it
*  But how's he feel now you got months and months and months of this
*  I just want to see something on him mitts. Does he dismiss the does it does he wish he didn't say yes to it?
*  How's his health house is back house, but he seems to be having fun when he's promoting it. Yeah, he seems to be
*  It's probably on mushrooms, bro
*  Like loses he's also almost 60 if he wins fuck man, that's another great
*  He's a monster look at the at the end of the day Mike Tyson's a monster and if you can get that monster to just move
*  In and close the distance and he if he uncorks all boom boom on Jake Paul
*  Jake Paul going to queer Street that will be wild to watch a 58 year old Mike
*  It would be a scenario for the world
*  Someone gets hurt. Yeah, best case scenario for the world is that he knocks Jake Paul?
*  Yeah, best case scenario is Jake Paul realizes immediately
*  He's in there with Mike Tyson that Mike Tyson at least for a round or two first time he gets cracked
*  It's gonna I guarantee it his head's gonna be like oh shit. It's gonna be interesting to see what happens
*  How many rounds is it? I think it's eight eight two minute rounds that are two minutes
*  Yeah, I think they're doing two minute rounds
*  And I think they have her do they have ten ounce gloves or twelve ounce gloves?
*  Jamie thought that of the two minute round. Yeah, I think they're making them have slightly bigger gloves, which he announced 14
*  That's so sparring. Yeah, and it's not sanctioned right? It can't be sanctioned. It's sanctioned. It's sanctioned. How do you sanction that?
*  Texas
*  It's a place you can own a drink
*  My wife was driving home one day she saw a zebra same place has more
*  She was just a zebra loose. I go welcome to Texas baby a zebra. Yeah, you can have a zebra here
*  Some dude zebra got out
*  They got a few tigers here, right?
*  There's more tigers in captivity in Texas in private collections than in all of the wild of earth
*  Yes, that's true
*  Tigers getting loose in people's yards because they fence them in bro
*  Tigers like their tiger tigers real real real tigers
*  Thousands of tigers in private collections in Texas really bro. This is a crazy place. It's a crazy place
*  So tight, but do we?
*  Gotta bail on that. They're also tight with fentanyl tests, which is even crazier escape tiger that had Texas communities on edge finally caught
*  Oh, yeah, that was around Houston
*  Bengal tiger was on loose for nearly a week
*  That's that's Houston that's see got all that oil money down there in Houston and that's where dudes have their own Tigers
*  That's what I like about New York. You just gotta worry about some raccoons and yeah
*  There's a guy in New York that had a fucking tiger in his house in Harlem. What yeah
*  There's a photograph a famous photograph of these cops even find that photo Jamie the the cops are looking through the foot right there
*  Looking through the window. How's guy had a tiger in his fucking apartment? Oh my god
*  Bro, how insane is that photo was the guy in there was he eating? I don't think the guy got killed
*  I think they just found out the guy had a tiger in there and they had to go in and dart him
*  Then they had to drag him out of there and take him to the zoo
*  Yeah, the dude had a 450 pound cat in his fucking apartment
*  How do you clean up after that not well get a big little box of all that things gonna piss everywhere
*  They mark their territory but pissing on things they get a smell
*  Oh, they would have a can't even that guy was just Tigard out. He was all in regular cat yearns bad enough
*  I know tiger Tigers just pissing on your walls
*  I had the people who did the documentary on yesterday that thing was crazy though with that killing himself by accident
*  Crazy anybody first of all that that I mean first of all, you don't find more white trash
*  Chimp crazy
*  Take it to the next level. Yeah, I'm not watching that. I am gonna watch that bro. It's nuts. There's nuts
*  It's fucking nutty man
*  Whoo the people's desire to have these things that could kill them. It's so strange. I'll just watch the new plenty apes movie
*  Is that supposed to be good
*  From what I seen those aren't bad, how's that alien movie? Did you see that the new one? No, I heard it's good
*  Really? Yeah, it's real good. I heard it's scary as fuck
*  I heard it like goes back to like the first alien where they're like hard to find it's scary
*  After a while, they were everywhere and you just shoot him, right? You know, like the best one
*  You couldn't even find that fucker. He's like sneaking around
*  acid blood
*  phenomenal aliens was such a great sequel to alien cuz it was a different take on it and then the space the marae space
*  Marines and
*  Fucking Newton fucking Hicks Hicks was great Hudson was good. Oh Hudson was fucking great Bill Paxson
*  Oh, yeah
*  Over man good movie. It was a totally different kind of movie, right? So you got
*  Ridley Scott does the first alien suspending you got this suspenseful
*  Terrifying thing and people start coming up missing and you know, it's fucking hiding in the ceiling
*  Thinking Tom Everett's gonna be the hero right and then also he gets taken out. You're like, wait, wait, what?
*  Oh, it's gonna be secure. It's a good thing
*  She's the he was the first male or female lead of a monster movie
*  Action movie where you didn't go all they're pushing a woman on me. She's right
*  Yes, yes, you believe that this lady scientist got stuck in this fucking spaceship with a demon. This is great
*  That movie's so good aliens is good, but alien is better no because it's hard to kill
*  Aliens, they're shooting them left and right. They're all over the place in the people in aliens
*  Alien one would have been done in five minutes
*  But in this one they kill so many of them until they get to the mother and then when the mother doesn't kill her when
*  She's wearing the robot suit and like shut the fuck up bitch, but I like what she's like get away from her
*  What was going on in the second one they were prepared for what they were coming up against the thing is there's too much exposed
*  I don't buy it if she's in a robot thing where she's completely encased. Okay, but she's just all out
*  Bitch this is a giant alien. How is that thing? Not gonna fuck it moves way quicker than people
*  How's that not gonna fuck you up instantaneously with your stupid-ass slow robot?
*  I
*  moments in that though that movie when they're like when they barricade themselves in the in the in the in the one room and
*  They're like they have the monitor and they're like did through the wall. That's that's inside the room
*  It can't be inside the room also, and they look up and he put and then you see Hicks
*  He looks he pushes up the tile you see them all crawling in the that was fucking money fucking money. What a great movie
*  It's a great movie. It's just a different kind of movie, you know
*  I was hoping they would have got more into like the engineers like when they did that Prometheus
*  But they were got into those people, but they really it wasn't much of the movie
*  This is good, but the one after Prometheus was better. What was that one? Jamie was the last one with Kenny McBride in it, right?
*  Yes
*  ended fucked up
*  Covenant yeah, it wasn't just a smoolet in that one, too
*  Oh
*  This one's good, please tell me this is another no man. He's in there. He's in the spaceship. He's working the controls. This is uh, oh
*  There's a real good one. This one's fucking good
*  This is this one's really good and again the aliens in this one. They're hard to get a hold of is that Michael Fassbender?
*  Yeah, yes. So these are the things that
*  Spores get inside you from that egg
*  It's a good one man. This is a really good one. Yeah, I did and when these do start shaking when it gets them
*  Mmm, it's fucking great. That's a good one
*  Yeah, but I heard the new one is really good, too
*  I think the new ones really Scott too as well, right and he's doing a new is he doing a new gladiator?
*  Really? Did he do the new god? I don't know. I mean, I know oh, yeah
*  Coming out. Yeah, I'm on the fence with that
*  I'm on the fence with it. Why?
*  Like I don't know is he talking like New York slang Denzel and the fucking thing no man
*  Oh, did people said something about his accent, right? What is the accent that people have an issue with?
*  That's what we hear Denzel. Let's hear his accent
*  Where were you born? I don't know. I never knew a mother nor father
*  You will be my instrument. Why you?
*  Denzel be a regular dude. Yeah, but they have a British accent
*  They always want people when they're speaking another language is translated English those want them to have a British accent
*  Different way yeah, yeah, it's weird it is kind of like this is in India
*  I mean, you know I'm saying no matter where it is
*  They want to have a British accent uses in Rome. This is in Italy's why why would they wow do they talk like this?
*  But there's something about like hearing regular modern English
*  Old-timey movie like no no like you don't buy it. Yeah, you need an accent like Tyrion Lannister
*  English accent
*  That's a good question, I don't think they spoke Latin I don't think these people were speaking Latin
*  Were they in Rome? Yeah, they may have been they were they speaking Italian or they speaking Latin. They would have been speaking Latin
*  Okay, but see here's the question
*  Ask this when Martin Luther was translating the Bible in the 1500s or the 1400s whenever that was
*  That the reason why the Bible was the priests would be the only one that could tell you the Word of God
*  Because they're the only one who could read Latin so no one spoke Latin. No one read that they couldn't read it
*  So these people didn't know what was in the Bible until Martin Luther. He translated into phonetic languages
*  Translated I think German and a couple other languages got it got eventually translated, too
*  So then people could read the Bible for themselves whereas before it was just Latin. So when did Latin die off?
*  When did they stop using Latin? Hmm, cuz Latin's a weird one like you learn it in school, but you're never gonna fucking use it
*  They spoke Latin
*  Like when did Latin go isn't it crazy? So the Roman Empire they spoke a language that's dead. It's a great language
*  Gone for 76 that's probably people stop speaking it but priests probably still knew because if everything was right
*  There it is after the fall of Rome in 476 AD Latin began to die out and distinct local Latin dialects developed Wow
*  So these dialects eventually evolved to modern romance language Italian and Spanish, which is crazy
*  That means those languages are only 500 fucking years old
*  That's not but if you see a movie about it, it was English with an English accent, right? Yeah
*  Crazy that those languages like Italian is only like 500 years old
*  Similarities between Spanish and Italian. Oh, yeah, they all
*  Texas is way bigger than all those places, you know, which is nuts like Europe when you look at America
*  It's basically like Europe, right? But we don't call it different countries, right?
*  But Kentucky is so much different than Los Angeles, you know, it'd be 1,500 years old not 500. Oh
*  That's right
*  20 yeah
*  Either
*  Okay, so I'm sorry 1500 years still languages developing that you would think they're older than that
*  Did you guys ever watch and I watched it more than once I watched it like at least a few times this the series
*  Rome, yeah, I have the box
*  Only two seasons
*  They crammed it into two seasons
*  Budget was high budget was super high at the time and it is a fucking great series
*  It is very polio. Oh, they're badass. Oh my god
*  That guy's real
*  It holds up I never heard anything about it you should watch this where this is named Ray Stevenson
*  Played the Punisher to Ray Stevenson's
*  Put him on and the other guy Lucius is phenomenal. I want to say that Lucius
*  Was tied a base that on a real guy. Well, listen it is it is so great and
*  Even if you go on to YouTube and watch
*  Lucius and Titus just being badass or Titus Puglio being badass is this oh my god
*  Such a great series no shit
*  That's amazing good
*  Just finished the Peaky Blinders. Yeah, you'll go through this
*  Only two seasons and again, I revisit it a lot. Have you been to Rome? No, no me and my wife
*  She's waiting for my stomach to get better
*  Fucking go put a cork up my ass cuz I'm not gonna just go
*  Yeah, why you can and I heard you can eat the food over there and it's not as bad for you
*  Not in there. It's way better. Well, we've got some weird shit going on with our food. That's for sure
*  You can eat pasta over there. You feel normal. No, I definitely feel fine
*  We're gonna go they don't have so good. I don't have poison in their foods over there
*  It's nice families. We you know, Froot Loops in America are different than Froot Loops in fucking Canada
*  Cuz we we put so many different dirty guys
*  Yeah, we allow those funky dyes that are horrible for you and European countries like no, that's just that shit's poison
*  We're like
*  I
*  Be the poison
*  loaded with sugar
*  Loaded with sugar, but we never know when we were kids know you were told to me we were just all it did is rot your
*  Teeth no big deal. Right? That's what it felt like. Yeah, you didn't think was gonna kill you
*  I grew up on that shit. Oh
*  Take frosted freaks and put sugar
*  Yeah
*  Remember those days
*  You get out of bottom and I'm really with sugar and if I had no milk I had kool-aid in there
*  to my sugar water in it, I
*  Remember remember Travis Luthor? Yeah, guys are like too smart. They're all good
*  I don't know about meeting raisins in there and I'm and he's eating fucking Kit Kats. Oh, yeah, he's sugar sugar
*  I got that. I don't think it works like that. I'm not a rock. I'm far from a fucking
*  Nutritionist, but I don't think you know
*  Said there is something to be said for drinking things that have a high sugar content after hard training
*  If there's that's that's fact and you know who used to do that
*  Floyd Mayweather Floyd Mayweather used to be having these crazy workouts
*  He would crack open a Pepsi and people like what the fuck is he doing?
*  He's crazy, but no, he's nice smart
*  Like you would as hard as that guy worked out
*  Your
*  Getting that muscle glycogen in a crazy way that you're really not gonna get any other way like I don't recommend drinking soda
*  I like it. It's fun. I like to drink a soda every now and then a real one
*  But he used to drink it after training. Well, that's what like Paul Felder does like after like a long bike ride
*  Yeah, he would talk about like drinking a soda
*  Yeah
*  the best times they do it or like they say either when you if you wake up just cuz you're
*  Fasted or after a big workout there to save his times
*  Yeah, I mean he's here drinking a coke and you would think like there's no way this guy he treats his body like a
*  Temple, but he does he's smart
*  That guy did it the right way never drank. Yeah ever partied never was out of shape
*  Never got fat would run home from the club at two o'clock in the morning in his jeans
*  Yeah, just fucking getting in work
*  Yeah, he got you see all the mistakes. Yeah, he's like I'm not making any of these. Yeah, he was built different too
*  Smart yes smarter than everybody else. I can't knock everybody out
*  But I can get everybody to want me to get knocked out and so people come to see me get knocked down
*  I beat everybody
*  I mean, he's definitely the greatest defensive fighter of all time
*  If boxing is hit and doesn't get and don't get hit who's better than Floyd zero people
*  Who how many people cracked him in his career? Yeah
*  Yeah, Shane cracked him. I mean enough chop chop the demarcus
*  Corley cracked cracked them once and then
*  Conor McGregor
*  Argentina
*  My Donna
*  Yeah was pretty
*  Not just to down they would carry it around on a necklace
*  My Donna has fully made with his two guys show it Jamie my Donna has
*  Like on a gold necklace a lot of people thought my Donna won the first one
*  But they like that like if he cracked he definitely cracked him at the end of that round and wobbled him and then it
*  Was right at the bell and so then Floyd got back on his bike and started out boxing him
*  But my Donna see there it is. There's his tooth. See there it is. He's got knocked out and he keeps it around
*  That we can count how many times you've been cracked amazing, yeah amazing but also could recover
*  Yeah, for sure recover. He just had a lot of hand injuries
*  How do you find his tooth in that motherfucker? So he's like probably tell this guy
*  In the fight it flies out of his mouth and one of the corner men saw it and grabbed it. Yeah. Yeah, that's great
*  Great. That's hilarious funny. Like we need that. That's second fire here. He
*  Floyd got the rap the the ring bigger and he just destroyed him in the second one cuz he had more room to run the first
*  One my Donna was kept getting him on the ropes getting him on the ropes and beating him up
*  Well, if you're gonna have a rematch with a master technician, he's gonna figure out all your little
*  Callers, so you see how big the ring is and super lack in
*  One FC. I didn't see that. No, what is that? Dude super lack is this?
*  badass Muay Thai fighter and he fought
*  Jonathan Haggerty
*  Who was that? Was that when he hit him with the elbow? Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that
*  Yeah, but I saw an interesting breakdown here it is so how good look at it he caught him with that over top elbow
*  Like real quick in the fight. I think was like 40 seconds. Oh beautiful KO
*  So they had a real good fight in the first fight
*  It was six years ago and Haggerty became the champion and everybody thought you know, like this can be much much different fight
*  But what I saw that was interesting was someone broke down
*  There was a video breakdown of his tells that Haggerty has a certain hop hop and then he goes in
*  And then super like I timed it and he tried it earlier in the round and didn't catch it and in this one
*  Look at this perfect timing gets his head off the center line
*  God perfect elbow
*  This is the thing that I love that one FC is doing
*  I don't love what they did to Mikey moose imagine
*  But what I love what they're doing is they're having world-class
*  Muay Thai fighters and they're putting them in these giant cards were like tens of thousands of people to see it on Amazon
*  Yeah, so millions of people are gonna see it around the world on Amazon and it's on the internet
*  so all these people are gonna be able to see it on YouTube and
*  It's exposing people to these guys that are just like super high-level strikers that you're not gonna hear about
*  200 fights like a rod Tang who would have heard of Rod Tang if it wasn't for one for sure
*  Everybody knows yeah that fucking elbow reminded me. It just brought me back to Wyman verse of mock moon as
*  That fight I think was would inspire Chris Padilla to use the elbow against Ron Zhu over the weekend
*  Really? Yeah and busted his eye wide open. They stopped the fight cuz that's interesting
*  Incredible this is prime
*  Timing on that he was out already man. Why man was a motherfucker dude. He was a motherfucker. Look at this elbow
*  Clean phenomenal
*  Ready bang white man timing. Yeah, Chris. He's fighting on there is soon
*  What is that that's a Madison Square Garden
*  16 whoo, that's a crazy fight. Yeah, I don't see Chris is in South Carolina now
*  I don't see we don't see him so much South Carolina Chris now
*  Wonderboy
*  He's got like his own people with like Brian Barberina
*  No, they got a decent little squad down there from what I hear well, he was throwing kicks in the last fight
*  Yeah, throwing hard kicks that right like I can't watch it. It's crazy
*  I can't watch it, but it seemed like he was trying to prove a point
*  He's such a nut he's such a beast Chris white man that last fight was a bummer though
*  The I poke thing was a real bummer. It kind of made it. Yeah, it took away from it a little
*  You want it? Yeah, it was a bummer. I feel like I keep saying it but I feel like they should cover those fingertips
*  There's no reason why they're exposed doesn't make any sense. Do it like a bad glove cover it like a bad glove
*  I mean, I just don't understand why like how they thought this was gonna solve the problem
*  They were like new gloves and this guy's are still getting poked in the eye
*  Yeah, it's still the same setup
*  Yeah
*  No
*  If you really want like I feel like for if you're gonna have the fingerless ones Trevor witness Trevor Whitman's are the best
*  They're the best they curve down right curve. Yeah hard. Yeah, your hands stay in this position
*  You have to struggle to do this right your hand naturally goes in this position the UFC gloves are still like this
*  Yeah, like how did they think that was gonna be the answer? You got to cover the fingers
*  There's no reason to not cover the fingers like a bad glove
*  Just have a piece of leather that goes over the fingertips. So you have one thing. It's not gonna invade your grappling
*  It's not gonna change your striking. It's not gonna change any piece of elastic in there
*  Yeah, just keep it closed and this way you at least if you get poked in the eye, you're getting a full year thing like this
*  You're not getting something that goes into your eyeball. Yeah, right
*  So have them all covered with something like and have like a ridge over the top of it like a soft foam ridge
*  So even if you're getting poked in the eyes, you're not you're not better than a fair
*  You're not getting an individual thing going deep into your eyeball with a fingernail, which is what people get right now
*  And some get fucking fingernails
*  Dirty ass fingernail in your eye even even if you trim your nails like my nails are trimmed
*  I wouldn't want that in my asshole. Let me look at me today. Imagine if that's in your asshole
*  Yeah, scratch around inside your asshole, right? Well your eyeball is just like the boy's you man. Yeah, that's worse than little ant man
*  Scarred that's where I was going with it. It's like soft tissue in your eyeballs is the scariest soft tissue
*  We're we're allowing fingernails to go in there for no reason you could fix that
*  You really could fix that by just covering the tips of the fingertips
*  I think you should just use Trevor Whitman's glove Trevor. What is the best?
*  You're always gonna have thumbs, you know, you remember Roberto Durant of Davey Moore
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Do you want them to use the Trevor Whitman gloves cuz you feel bad about taking his fucking job what listen I can't
*  So he could work on them gloves so you might as well
*  Whitman has the best gloves. Yeah, he has the best training gloves
*  He has the
*  He's just he uses the best materials like the the foam he uses is very different
*  It's like super high-tech density foam. It feels better when you're hitting things
*  I think it protect people from hand injuries better. Yeah, so they should talk to them. They did
*  Apparently you wanted some crazy amount of money that the UFC wasn't well
*  That's
*  UFC's perspective. I don't know what Trevor I love Trevor, but I'm a big fan of his stuff
*  If it was up to me, I would figure out a way to make that work
*  Yeah for sure, but you know, apparently he wanted my something crazy
*  Nobody dresses better
*  I got to man because like I'm working with y'all, you know, that's Joe Rogan DC
*  You know, I gotta I gotta have my own thing. You don't you have a flare. Yeah your own Dean Thomas flair
*  I got I got to show up somehow
*  Hey, there's some good fights on this car this weekend, you know, I know Bob Mondes is a bad motherfucker
*  He is a bad motherfucker. That's a bad mother. Yeah, that's that's an interesting fight on the undercard. Let's see
*  He's fighting Manuel Torres is also good. Yeah, that's a good fight man. That's a real good fight
*  They that's one of them under the radar fights
*  They put people in here to like the throw most this car sure people like the throw who do man?
*  Towards fight his last fight. He beat he beat the hell out of somebody last night dead
*  Bob Mondes throw some wild shit. Oh
*  Yeah, Chris Duncan. Yeah, he busted Chris Duncan. Yeah. Yeah
*  This is that's gonna be an interesting fight but for me go scroll all the way up to the top Jamie
*  No, no, no the the end of the car
*  I'm very very interested in the rematch of Alexa Grasso and Valentina. Yes me too. I felt like
*  Valentina did enough to get the nod in the second fight did too
*  I felt like she and some judge gave the last round Alexa Grasso 10-8. They had two points, which I thought was kind of
*  Well, you know why right? Yeah, she had her because he had her in the choke
*  Yeah, like he was just kind of biased from the first choke, right?
*  So he thought I was close enough. It was kind of close but it wasn't you know
*  I mean it means something if you're gonna do that
*  You should do that all the time the time someone gets you in a choke and you defend
*  That's a 10-9 already. You already got a 10-9 anything more than that. Now, it's 10-8, you know
*  Like like boxing with knockdowns, right?
*  The scoring is too subjective 10-8 round is more like when Al Jermain had yawn on his back the entire round right threatening
*  You know what? I'm smashing them getting at the end of the big sack doesn't right to point right at 10-8 is a dominant round
*  You like you dominated the whole round and I don't even did they give Al Jermain two point like a time
*  I think he got 10-8 for that
*  I know is poor. I don't know didn't get the respect he deserves after that Calvin K to fight which was a fucking beautiful
*  It was a fight
*  It was a it was a great fight
*  I think Al Joe's just a 45 or who was a bad motherfucker at 35
*  But I think you're gonna see the real Al Joe 45. I think so, too
*  I think he's gonna be old boy in a couple weeks to he's so big man
*  I was only how though I saw him in between fights
*  He's gonna beat Mozart a couple weeks interesting fight high-level grappling
*  Interested very back when he got San Higgins back bro. That was the quickness
*  Oh, yeah, that rear naked choke of his is about as good as it gets in MMA right now these top three
*  Crazy how do you think or take like what happened to a take a last time where he pulled out like something was up with supposedly
*  You got a weight or something. Yeah, real bad. Oh, yeah, he got real real
*  I thought I got real because they made that fight on like I said, it was a three-week notice fight
*  He didn't look good the day of the weigh-ins, you know, I do the interviews with fighters
*  I did an interview with him and he was like he just looked tired
*  Yeah, I think he just I mean he didn't make weight that fight either remember
*  It was a medical with yeah
*  So he missed a weight and then on top of that like they changed the weight class then on top of that
*  He never makes it to the fight. He was sick. It's gonna be a wild fight
*  Diego Lopez is a fucking assassin. Zell Huber is an assassin, too
*  Like on that one I
*  Heard old sahoodo talking about rib of its apparently trains at his gym and this is good. He's very good
*  This is a very fun fight very fun fight. There's a lot of like under the radar fights on this card. I
*  Think it's gonna live up to it
*  I mean they got a lot of hype on the sphere and like the names may not be there
*  But all these guys are bangers
*  Here's the question do they you know how they show like on the big screens you get to see the fights if you're in the
*  Stands like so you could see things that maybe you don't see are they gonna have it on the whole ceiling
*  Looking up and seeing shit, you know
*  So I've been I was at the apex all week last week and like it's so secretive
*  Like everybody I think they should have the fight on the whole ceiling and then everybody would not know where to fuck
*  Yeah, it'd be getting knockouts and people wouldn't even looking at them
*  Yeah, cuz if it's way cooler to only gonna do it once have the shit on this
*  To production trucks like the people like people at home aren't gonna be seeing the whole visual cuz you know, it's produced for that's a very
*  To they hired another director
*  Yeah, so it's like
*  Yeah, like it's just been like crazy smart, which they are
*  They should make some kind of documentary or something about the making of this. Oh, they probably know what I mean
*  And and so people get to try to see what was going on inside of there that weren't able to get tickets
*  There's six mini movies that play about the yeah of combat sports
*  Yeah, that's crazy crazy. They spent 20 million dollars on this fucking place
*  I think what the original budget was 10 and they just went over so
*  Sean O'Malley and marab is a perfect fight for it. Oh, yeah
*  I know that neither one of them is Mexican but let that go for a little bit
*  Mexico they adopted Marab
*  I
*  Skin he fights like a Mexican. He really does. God damn that guy's gas tank is terrifying
*  He's terrifying cuz that's a guy that if you empty out early on Marab, you got real
*  He's got a chin on he survived apparently so he fucking's the Marlin Marlin fight was nuts man
*  Yeah, and it was funny the second half of the round. He got dropped in he beat him to death beat him to death
*  I know he almost stopped
*  The second round happened how it did he just beat he took it out of him in the first round
*  Yeah, but Rob is an animal but my rise was like a front-runner like no other
*  No, you're right first round Henry. So who do I thought Henry? So it was going to sleep. Yeah, right
*  Dude when when Marlin was in his prime when he when he knocked out Aljo with that switch kick
*  Bro, he was terrifying people forgot. Oh good Marlon Marley was good good, but he is too big for the weight class, too
*  He was another guy there's no way that was healthy right he was so big for 35 and just
*  That Mickey Mouse voice to go with
*  Fire plug with that little voice what Marlon had that was so tricky was that left high kick off the front leg
*  He caught a lot of people he did it so slick. It was so fast. Yeah, he was explosive. He was accurate
*  He was well rounded, but he did the gas tank
*  I think maybe from making the weight or whatever it had to do with the psychological aspects to it, too
*  I think there was like something when he was the nail it wasn't as you know, he just didn't stand up
*  He wasn't like Marab like Marab finds a fucking
*  There's a Georgia memory in there some fucking street fight with a goat
*  Some fucking chaotic thing on a mountain that happened in his brain forever, you know
*  You got short on that we say
*  Sean O'Malley says he has no losses
*  He points out that Chito Vera thing that it's a fluke if you look at Marab's record that fight with Frankie size
*  Was a fucking I don't say it often. It's a fucking robbery if you watch that and he was just getting over fucking
*  What do you have?
*  Not in the moon. He had something he had lingering effects of something and he still went through that fight
*  He why don't give a fuck watch that fight. He won that fight and then the other one which would uh
*  Simone Ricky Simone it was controversial because he was in the choke and
*  The red that my round ended and then he was like half in half out and they're like, oh he's out
*  And then so it was a weird. Let's see. They I haven't seen that. Let me see that Ricky Simone Marab
*  I forgot about he's shaking to the end of it and then when it's end of it
*  It's like out but in and out so it's like it was a weird but he made it to the belt
*  Yawn Shao, naan against John way Lee member at the end of the round. She was out cold. Oh, yeah
*  Unconscious they woke her up. Yeah
*  But he won because he was the first guy to wake up
*  Simone gets him in a guillotine and is the very end. Oh my god. That's so nasty. Look how nasty that is
*  It's on that's so tight. It's so tight. He's out. He's out right there. Yeah
*  The arms hang but he doesn't
*  Stop it. He's still shaking. Okay, so he's hanging in there
*  He's hanging in there. But where's the second so if he's not tapping god damn that guy's got willpower, huh for him
*  He's not tapping
*  He's not defending with his arms either this is crazy he's not even defending with his arms. He's just using his neck
*  He's gave him the thumbs up, yeah
*  Ten seconds
*  He's still moving his legs, okay, I mean that's the horn but now he's like
*  He's breathing yeah, what the fuck they stopped the fight no, no, no, no, you can't say he's out there
*  That's what I'm saying. You can't say he's not a rest in peace. Dr. Sherry. That was the team doctor walk and
*  Yeah, that's kind of crazy that's fucked up
*  After the fight was over yeah, if after the round was over that decided he was out
*  Yeah, so I mean so look you could look at his record and say he protested immediately
*  Yeah, it's just laying there with his eyes open and it looked like he was out because he was fucking exhausted. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's like a sigh of relief
*  Look, there's no way he would have known if the guy says it's over and he immediately protest
*  There's no way he could have known to protest if he wasn't awake
*  And who was the ref I don't even recognize him in this so it's like you could look at his record and be like
*  Yo, this guy hasn't lost the fight. Yeah, there's some you know, raps are human
*  That's a lot of one now
*  So it's like a bad one and and if you look at the fight before that, but that's the robbery Frankie size
*  So you could literally look at this guy and say he never lost. I mean if you want to well
*  I think all these moments of adversity just
*  Strengthened his resolve anyway, the guy's a monster now
*  The Henry so Hutto fight was so crazy when he was carrying him
*  Was so crazy when he was carrying Henry so Hutto
*  Yeah kid with his tongue hanging out. I was like this is mad. It was kind of embarrassing
*  I felt bad for Henry. Yeah, he wasn't just doing it to some guy who didn't belong in the cage with him
*  He's doing it to a two-division world champion
*  It was Olympic gold medalist in wrestling and he's carrying around like a pillow and he walks over to Mark Zuckerberg
*  While he's choking him
*  He was having a great old time when he had him in that ten finger guillotine
*  He was gonna get him there with that like that's a nasty choke
*  Yeah, I think he's gonna have his night. I think the craziest moment like that though was when Hamsa picked up the leech
*  Oh
*  He starts fucking him up right in front of Dana doubt that dudes wild
*  For leech though like leech can't get that mean they just feed him to every
*  Who do you just fight?
*  Carlos protest
*  That striking was beautiful
*  He's very very very good that guy's scary where the fuck did he come from
*  Yeah fighting nerds man, they got a great team
*  But this guy he's just a fucking killer man Carlos just knows how to put it on you this need of the body man
*  Was so nasty. Oh
*  See the need of the body before that
*  They didn't have that in that video, but he had him hurt before this but he's just fucking accurate dude, he's all limbs
*  There's some good fighters coming up man these kids that are coming up they come into the cage so much better than guys just five years
*  Go, I'm so much better getting so much help from the UFC prior
*  Right, you know like especially like if you have like the PI behind you like like a Mexico to like sponsor these guys
*  There's so many videos to watch now. Yeah, that's a big factor
*  Because like when you were coming up you had VHS tape. What the fuck you gonna?
*  Nobody got chance to see anything you didn't really get unless you saw them in your gym
*  You didn't get a chance to see like real high-level stuff and now guys they have a standard in their head
*  That's way higher than everybody's standard from 10 15 years true. Yeah, no doubt about that guys just come in so well
*  And plus they start so much younger. Oh, yeah, that's a fact and kids
*  You know the UFC has boosted, you know wrestling in high schools and junior leagues and things
*  So these they're just more complete like they're comp they're growing up now complete martial artists, you know secrets anymore
*  I remember back in the day would be like it's a new move. Don't show anybody
*  The calf kicks only a few years old that's what's not this being city wins whole career without kick kicked in the cap me too
*  Thank God
*  I'm glad that wasn't around
*  I know right that's an Henderson used to throw it
*  He did you start weird but he never had the kind of results of these guys are having it was it's different
*  Where did it come from like this is my time?
*  They've always done it
*  It just wasn't done that often because guys check it never made if they check it and they turn out and you catch it
*  On your foot. I think they do it a lot more in Muay Thai now though because I'm what I
*  Won a lot in glory see it now a lot guys throwing it a lot man, it's so effective
*  Well, you know, it's weird like in karate combat like you can't throw it to the thigh. It has to be a calf kick
*  That's ridiculous. Yeah, it's weird to me. I'm like what?
*  That's really yeah, what do you mean? You can't throw it to the thought you can't it's illegal to kick above the knee
*  Karate combat that's ridiculous sense. What's the point of karate? Yeah, that literally makes no sense
*  Yeah, cuz what about kielkeshin? What about ones where they kick the legs all the time? That's karate, too
*  Not sure why you know take out some of the best karate from karate. Not sure why that's a rule
*  But that's you can ground and pound for like 10 seconds or should you ground a pound until you stop? Oh
*  Yeah, you can ground and pound until you stop and then then break it up leg kick, right?
*  But you can't kick to the side. That seems crazy. Yeah, that doesn't make sense
*  What's your feeling on that side kick to the knee like what Khalil did to Modesta's hate it? No, I don't hate I love
*  You hate it. Yeah, I think it does nothing but damage a fighter like people's oh you can kneebar
*  Well, you can tap to a knee bar. You can't tap to that kick and if I can't lands you're done
*  Can't tap to a head kick either. Yeah, I mean whatever you go to sleep. You go to sleep
*  That's different to me. But some head kicks are probably worse than getting knee kicked
*  You know, I mean Leon Edwards and tomorrow if you ask tomorrow
*  Would you rather take a shot to the knee or that shot to the head? You might take a shot to the knee
*  Like Khalil did I think I'd rather get kicked in my head that one was horrible to watch but like you got to defend it
*  Yeah, you know, it's not like you can't defend it. You got to defend it
*  It's you remember when Darren till started using on everybody. He was like one of the first guys
*  John Jones, of course, he's the guy with it. Yeah, he's so long
*  Yeah, that's a shitty one. It gets I mean you can't really you can't use that like there's no intention
*  No, you definitely can't can't do that in sparring you'd be taking out your imagine
*  I've had guys tell me that they were sparring guys
*  They didn't know and they did shit like that to them sidekicks the knees like what the fuck are we now?
*  It's a real night. You make it a street in a sparring match. The guy was telling me about the ATT
*  They bring in some crazy Russians. They were sidekicking your knees
*  I mean I don't have it they was doing like spinning wheel kicks to the to the head with just hitting you with the heel
*  And I'm like, yo, what are you doing? That's crazy? Yeah, that's crazy
*  That's so hard. That's so if you're in a high-level sparring match with a guy
*  What's like you're getting emotional and then you throw a spinning kick. It's so hard. They like slapping with the foot
*  Well, I'm just like the side, you know
*  You wear shim pads for a reason to protect and but then you're doing a spinning kick where there's no protection
*  Well, that's why gloves are nuts
*  Right because you can knee somebody in the face you can elbow in the face
*  You can shin them in the fucking skull, right? But you're not
*  Spared with the new I mean they came later on like the the the gloves that you could they're not quite they're not the
*  boxing gloves
*  I
*  Always use the 16 ounce gloves cuz I want to be able to fucking throw and I grapple in them
*  But then like you get in I get under the butt you obviously can't make it a grip
*  But then it's that much easier when I can make a grip
*  So like I get in I'd lose it but it would help my endurance and when I'm able to make grips
*  I'm like, ah when they had the new gloves and people are fucking around with them
*  I'm like, yeah, but now we got to just now we're playing I
*  Didn't have the luxury. I'm fucking five six. I have to triple jab in and fight
*  Like I can't play by just I thought the throw so I couldn't throw like like realistically with those little gloves, right?
*  so when I see sometimes there's some people sparring I had one of my girls sparring and and
*  This girl Lauren and she brought in another girl and they were doing it with those gloves. I go look next time
*  It you want me to watch this shit. You're playing right now
*  I can't I'm not gonna be telling you to fucking do certain things and throw certain things if you could be playing
*  It's playing you're playing it's okay to play a crap
*  I like to grapple in them, but we have to fight so I mean, you know put on some bigger I mean
*  We did the same thing
*  Do you think that there's a time in a fighter's career where they don't have to spar?
*  Is there ever a time where they don't have to spar hard?
*  If they clock in enough hours, I guess like max Holloway whoever else like possibly
*  But even Holloway when he's getting ready for Gagey decided to spar you have to you have to
*  Simulate the fight as much as possible because you don't want to feel that for the first time in there
*  So the reason why I'm asking is because like I was watching Izzy's fight with Drakas and
*  The thing about that fight is that it looks like at the end is he's very tired
*  You know and he gets clocked like Drakas catches him with some of those winging punches
*  Which he was getting away from or in the earlier rounds and he catches them rocks them
*  and then he hits him with a couple more right hands against the cage and then
*  immediately gets him in a choke when they goes to the ground and then Izzy taps and
*  I always wonder because that school thought of like the Marberinovich school thought when BJ was in his prime
*  Was those guys were just doing wild plyometrics and cardio and that's it
*  They just like you know how to fight we're gonna give you the most fucking insane
*  gas tank you've ever had in your career and if you can get through this crazy camp of doing box jumps and plyometrics and
*  They'll fuck all those things they were doing with their feet
*  Throwing them with their feet in their hands
*  The system is wild
*  Wild shit and Nick Kurson who I talked about is trained under him
*  They have this philosophy that a fighter like a guy like you or a guy like you you have so many fights
*  You know how to fight you've been there
*  You've done it what you really need to do for this camp because you're getting ready for a fight is not get injured and have a
*  Fucking insane gas tank the flip side of that most recently and it's not the same thing because the guy could be weathered a little bit
*  Who had that philosophy with Tony Ferguson you've got
*  Goggins put him now look dad, but that's Tony Ferguson after Gagey
*  But Goggins put him through a fucking cardio sessions
*  I think Tony Ferguson after Gage he's a different human. Yeah, he's been compromised
*  Goggins, but I don't I mean I don't think he should have been in the corner
*  I mean you got him in the corner yelling from the stand. I'm not shit on Goggins
*  I like all the shit, but he's in the corner going get up Tony
*  It's like it's one of those things where it's like, you know, no shit agree, you know agree look
*  When it comes to willpower and when it comes to like discipline, there's no one like Goggins
*  But that doesn't matter if you mount him and strangle him
*  Yeah, does this matter you all that I fucking never quit you're gonna quit bitch. Yeah
*  What kind of will you have I get behind you and put that in there you're going to sleep
*  That's how it goes you're a human being you you have neck muscles you have veins that provide all that blood to your brain
*  I'm gonna cut that off and if
*  You can't get all that he needs from a guy like that, but you can get something you can get something
*  But Tony at that time was already on a long skid of
*  Multiple losses the Chandler knockout. It's front kicked in the face and an epic KO loss
*  The Gagey fight was horrific and then you got to go before that he blows his fucking knee out backstage
*  He was the boogeyman. We were gonna see the boogeyman versus Khabib. It was the fight everybody was pumped
*  Yeah, and then I'll steps in on super short
*  Raging Al had a great fucking account of himself
*  Fight against
*  Notice for hours could be even his pride. Yeah
*  Five rounds. Yeah, bro
*  I always wonder man if told you person just doesn't step on those wires and we get to see that fight my god
*  How yeah cuz that was Tony Ferguson when he was the fucking boogeyman when everybody was scared of him
*  Yeah, he was beating the fuck out of everybody. Who was the guy that left them wires there? Hopefully they fired that guy
*  He ruined history. There's always gonna be
*  Wires
*  Didn't random in camera fall backstage to right before the fight
*  He fell and hit his head he stepped on some like loose pipe pipe or something went up in the air banged his head
*  Got knocked out bleeding. Yeah, everybody's gonna be guessing but like even when he was in his prime like he fought Kevin Lee
*  Kevin Lee got him down mounted him, but then he triangle them
*  He's a triangle him but Kevin Lee mountain, you know offense to Kevin Lee. It's not like a beam on top of you
*  So, I mean is he ever surviving that you got to remember Kevin Lee maybe didn't
*  Achieve his potential but Kevin Lee chokeout. Yes. Remember that Kevin Lee was a mother
*  He did have his mom
*  Potential yeah when he knocked out what's his face the wrestler Oh Gregor
*  He was a fucking beast man
*  He just was inconsistent and then had a bunch of knee injuries like severe knee injuries
*  And that's the thing like a fighter's window is only open for so long
*  Right, so you got to try to maximize that right do what you can when your window is open, right?
*  If you saw a fade or fight Ryan Bader, you can't you can't right fade or
*  We tend to do that we always do we judge beat
*  That's why I would say BJ because we judge BJ by the end of his career. It was like Tony Ferguson
*  I mean, I think Tony beat that beat BJ's. It's not a good record
*  They have but as far as how many losses in a row. Yeah
*  So these guys got to throw these guys names in fight past the all these young kids and see them in their glory days
*  Cuz that's what you should really watch. Yeah, but it's that's the thing about fighters
*  It's like whatever that window is they say it's nine years at your very best from your contender to your champion
*  Whatever you we don't have to fucking redlining
*  I think it's about five really, you know, I think I think it's shorter than nine
*  I think it's about five years where you're just like in it like you in it. Let's get it right now
*  Yeah, Anderson is prime. Yeah, it's like five years of just destruction and then afterwards just like
*  Also injuries, you know with Anderson injuries was wide man. Yeah, I've been left hook, you know
*  That was a start of it all. Yep. Why men's left foot? Oh, that was crazy crazy
*  Same when he landed at Uriah Hall. Remember? Yep
*  Before Uriah Hall was like the next big thing when he was in the ultimate fighter Chris had fought him in New Jersey
*  Yeah, Lou Naglia bro, he had a long left hook. Mm-hmm. Why men's got that?
*  extra foot
*  It's a good hook man, because the guys don't think it's gonna be able to reach him and then all sudden it's there pop
*  I'm interested to see him in on Eric Honduras. It's gonna be a war. Yeah, cuz Eric's he's game gay Eric is game
*  But remember we fought Khalil and didn't even flinch
*  Real was just blasting his legs talk about being tough enough to take a beating
*  Bro, I asked him about it. I was like, what was I like? Is it every one of them hurt?
*  He just took it yeah
*  So good fights coming up kids some real good fights. Oh fuck. Yeah, I can't wait. I love it
*  I love a Saturday when the fight I hate when there's
*  Just so many fights on every weekend that when there's not one on I'm like, oh, you know what?
*  I'm looking forward to more than any
*  Holloway and to Poria. Yeah
*  The one for me when is that that's October that's Abu Dhabi, right? Yeah, that's the one son
*  That's what he's on. He's sick. That's the one for me cuz I see that fight. I go. I don't fucking know I
*  Love a fight where I don't fucking know
*  I know a lot of people would have counted out get him on the gate. She fight
*  I thought Gage he was gonna beat him insane and now you're giving him a lot of time to prepare and get ready for this
*  fight and
*  Then Homs on Whitaker's that gonna happen
*  This people is that gonna happen, you know if he's not sick again got over that's fucking card though. It's a great card
*  It's a good card
*  Jeff Neil
*  Armin Petrosian and Magomed off. Ooh
*  Yeah, that's some good fights on that car. Yeah, they bust out
*  Anybody that's a great card on that card. Yeah
*  I
*  Mean event is that main event is so unpredictable like
*  Toporia everybody he hits goes night night. I know everybody he hits he's fucking max is hard to hit very max
*  On Max to the chin and he's got a guest that new sneaky spinning back kick while he's stepping away
*  It was working right that might have been a game changer
*  At the end of that first round
*  Change the fight change the fight change the fight and it was a skill that he really didn't use a lot earlier in his career
*  Yeah, no, and he had it all of a sudden dialed in
*  Crazy and it was a hard one to do cuz he's moving away
*  It's like a hop away spin to the face and talk about a hero
*  Fucking ending to that fuck. Oh, you can't I don't think there's another fight that ended
*  You wouldn't believe that if it was in a movie right shut up right
*  Clearly ahead he fucking takes that chance of clearly ahead. Yeah with a guy, you know throws hammers
*  Yeah, you know and he's been dropped in that fight already, right? He got dropped way and
*  Planted. Oh, it's just that stuff of legends. The fact that it's for the BMFL. What a perfect fight for the BMF
*  100%
*  It's crazy cuz like I'm sitting right behind you guys and I'm watching you guys is like natural reactions
*  I get such a natural reaction and I know you guys think a lot of shit and they make memes about you guys
*  But watching you do it in those moments is the best thing ever. You don't even know what's happening
*  Yeah, I think that was the first fight I ever stood up. I got out of my chair. I could
*  I could I literally couldn't take it. I couldn't take I
*  Could I can't be sitting down? I had to stand up
*  Anik to and it doesn't stand up very often either. I don't think I couldn't I couldn't sit down
*  I was like, I can't believe I just saw that I can't believe that was yeah, and then what does it seem?
*  Fucking wild man, that was wild max be giving us some moments
*  Myself and Dean Thomas were there not a lot of people they're alive
*  It was I think it was in Abu Dhabi when you have a catered. He's looking away
*  Gave him the second fight with Volkanovsky
*  Imagine if he wins and then he doesn't go through this skid, you know, and you see all the Calvin cater fight was brutal
*  He changed Calvin's career. Yeah, he changed Calvin catered career in that fight. That was a bad beating. It was a bad
*  And it was kind of should have never talked shit to him
*  And this is the apex right? No, this is Abu Dhabi. Oh, that's right. No, but no audience, right? That's why
*  Look at that. He's not even looking at him and avoiding all the punches. That's the worst
*  But is the other thing about max too is that fucking gas tank that yeah, he doesn't stop
*  He doesn't stop it. It's a weapon man. The volume in the gas tank. It's a weapon
*  It's well that power is legit too
*  And max seems to be even more powerful at 55 than he is at 45
*  So, but my question is does he maintain that when he gets down to 45 like how hard's that cut
*  To kind of time it out right so I think it's gonna help him
*  I hope so. I would not want to see him drained at all. He's fighting Ilya cuz Ilya exposed you
*  You see the video of him hitting in mitts I
*  Saw his even his brother hit like that. Really? I watched his brother hit miss and I was like god damn, bro
*  He hits mitts like a world champion boxer. Yeah
*  I was gonna say we haven't seen the other guy tested Ilya, but then again we did
*  He got a head kick dinged. He came back like a fucking beast
*  He said that's something in the next round. Yeah. Yeah, but Ilya's hands are some of the most impressive hands in the sport
*  No fat in his technique. No wasted movement. Well, then we'll see who's the best boxer. I was getting ready say you're gonna find out
*  This is good Jamie, but there's a video that's like recently on his Instagram
*  That's fucking insane because he's going full clip trying to show off and you get to really like he's working here
*  It's all good. But see if you can find the clip that's on his Instagram page
*  His Instagram has an insane video of him just cracking mitts. We played it on the podcast the other day. Remember?
*  Yeah, that's it right there. Give me some volume so you hear this shit
*  Bro, yeah, that's crispy clean
*  Everything no wasted motion. Here's the thing with Max is Max's movement. Oh, yeah max ain't gonna be there for that
*  Oh, yeah, man. Yeah tall as fuck. Yeah
*  Yeah, and if Max can catch him and hurt him the way Jai Herbert did
*  Mm-hmm max max something sneaky and you know, Max is prepping right? Yeah watching that guy like a hawk
*  Does Volkanoski have anything else on the radar?
*  No, I think they're waiting to see what happens I
*  Mean I personally like to see him rest a little bit anyway
*  I would 100% want to see him rest a lot
*  I think after those two should have to never take a ten days notice fight with Islam
*  Never never never never never don't do it. I don't care how much it's tempting and then immediately three months later
*  He fights to poor you
*  After he gets KO'd with a head kick that seems crazy
*  Shit you may not wish I mean I thought as soon as I saw that fight I was like
*  Are you kidding me? Man?
*  He was probably you know before that he probably felt like I know I felt it before I felt it
*  I've seen what's coming, you know, I don't be grudging for taking that shot
*  I think the second fight was even the bigger mistake because you had just been flatlined and
*  Now you got to cut back down and go back out there on such short notice
*  But no other sport would want a champion to go in there and fight for a title with ten days notice
*  They would never ask me to do that anywhere else
*  Boxing it's never gonna happen in a million years in box for sure never but you know
*  They take advantage of MMA guys because they know we crazy right that's part
*  You have all the fighters are still under your control
*  Under contract so it's a bit of a problem. That's a bit of a problem
*  But also Volkanovsky could he he had the choice
*  Yeah in hindsight was a bad idea but in his mind he's thinking this is an opportunity for me to become a legend
*  Yeah, of course, right sites always 2020
*  Of course, and look that's what Aspin all didn't he won the title, right? Exactly
*  So had that been different for Aspin all we'd have been like, yo, he shouldn't have took that fight exactly
*  Pablo that guy's an animal. Yeah, why is it? How's he fighting Pavlich with fucking what did he have?
*  Like how many days notice that he have it was like seven days seven days notice and a fucked up rib. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  It's a wild sport. You know, it's like sometimes guys step in on short notice and it's exciting and they win
*  you know, so it's like
*  The key is like never get out of shape. Yeah, and I think with Volkanovsky
*  That was probably more
*  You saw physically how he looked for the second
*  Yeah, and he always looks like a tank was dad bod instead of him, you know looking right?
*  I would never take it back in the day to I I need my camp
*  I'm not gonna I would never cuz you peek at the right you should be peeking at the right time
*  100% you say when people like well, you should always be fight ready, but yeah, but that's that's easy
*  I said they've done you could always be in shape
*  But that's not fight shape and you don't know that until you're fucking back into sparring
*  I think if you're always about four weeks out like that's probably yeah, right, right and you get ten days notice
*  You might be able to pull that out and if you maintain a respectable level of cardio
*  Yeah, but what if you're Volk and you're drinking getting cheese not again, not a good guy
*  Then you gotta lose all that fucking weight. Yeah, I can't I used to be a fatty between shit, too
*  I
*  Just stay away from the pizza and pasta for two months. You're like, ah, well, everybody says that they develop an eating disorder
*  Patty yeah, that's bad. He's the bad. That's a real eating disorder
*  He gets huge goes hard. He gained 40 pounds in a week guy
*  Daniel
*  That's gonna be happy when he was retired eventually
*  Butterbean yeah
*  Butterbean with that crazy hair
*  He does it proudly to he don't give a fuck brother Bobby Green fight was a big deal
*  No, that was that was about his yeah, that was a big deal. I didn't the way he did that was beautiful
*  Man, really?
*  I'm a king range. Yeah, and I didn't expect Bobby to shoot but the second he did a patty's got nice jiu-jitsu
*  Yeah, very sharp off his back
*  And the other thing was like you notice how big he looked cuz Bobby's big Bobby's not a small 55 or and realize like damn
*  Like you might underestimate how big Patty is at 55. He's fucking pretty big and those kicks were good
*  He's not he's not a bad fighter. It's Bobby's a very good stand-up fighter for sure Bobby get his legs lit up that quick
*  That was a big deal. I expected to see him get tested in it. He didn't
*  But do you think he's ready for like the top guys now like do you would you put him in there with an arm and
*  Sarukian, you know, I'm saying like I put him in there with the winner
*  More Kano and Saint Denis, oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah
*  I
*  Would love to see him fight more Kano I like what McConnell's been going more with his jiu-jitsu lately
*  Yeah, I got really good. Jitsu. I saw him saying I saw him ball up chase Hooper in a grappling tournament
*  Yeah, oh
*  And how good is that fucking post fight interview? Oh
*  He's funny like this guy's a character
*  Like
*  Well, he figured it out man, you know, some guys figure it out like Colby had to figure it out
*  He did it his way everybody figures it out. You figure out you gotta get out of it what?
*  Once you get into fam, yeah the second he spoke about
*  Leon Edwards dead father. It shows you that he's a he's a fucking piece of shit
*  Kobe you're a fucking piece of shit
*  None of that the I mean you don't talk about poor Ye's wife like come on man
*  Well, that's why it's like I'm fine. You want to fight now
*  That's why it's so interesting that a guy like prayer gets as high as he gets with none of that zero
*  Well, I mean it's proof that you don't need it
*  You don't you don't you don't need to cross that line. Just need to fuck people up. You don't even get speaking
*  Social media presence there like he shows a sense of humor and you know what I mean on social media
*  So I think that endears people to him as well bro and that thing he did when he kicked the soccer ball and then hit it
*  With an arrow. Yeah
*  What would he do? He kicked a soccer ball and then shot it with an arrow so he kicks it
*  He really shoots arrows. He's just fucking around. Oh, no, he's really good man. He's really good
*  That guy's right out of the Amazon. But he does that kind of archery
*  I don't even do that kind of archery. He I do archery with like releases and fucking everything's like this for BAP
*  He nails it and that's before he beat out of Sonia
*  Listen, give me some volume on this because when he screams imagine being the neighbor in hearing this here he hits it
*  Imagine being a neighbor
*  You watch him on pay-per-view like oh Jesus Christ you can't even complain you can't even say
*  They don't need that extra fucking whatever it is
*  Well, he's got the swag with him is just the stoic warrior coming out and shooting an arrow at you and screaming
*  Well, I mean at the end of the day like people are attracted to violence
*  Yeah, and at the end like even Robbie Lawler like people love Robbie never said he hated doing
*  violence did attracted people talking about wars him and both Rory McDonald
*  Him and Carlos Condit
*  Him and Melvin Manhoff
*  Bomb that was crazy. He was kicking Robbie's legs so bad. It was lifting. It was his leg up in the air
*  He's probably having flashbacks of Pete Spratt
*  He was a good striker very good striker
*  What a crazy time this sport has gone through and all these years like this fight was so horrible to watch man
*  These guys were so busted up. I like it look look at Rory's nose. It's gone
*  And then it just
*  Open his lips split open. Yeah his lips hanging off. Yes. This is easy to easily the best fight of all time
*  Certainly in the conversation. Yeah, Robbie
*  She left nicely if he knocked out I forgot who he finished Nico price
*  Yeah, first one he went off to the sunset and he knocked him out without taking a shot. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's so easy to say I want one more after that
*  The ride off but he's gonna be a great coach too
*  And I'm sure he is but he's also a guy like you want that guy to be proud of you. Yeah. Yeah
*  It's Robbie law. Yeah for sure. There's something to that of you getting coached by a guy like that. Look at his face man
*  Stay in school kids
*  You better really know what you want if you're gonna do this for a living yeah, dude
*  And you gotta look across and see that shit, right? Yeah guys got a fucking joker smile
*  I was ready to go to war for the fucking final round
*  What a sick fight. Yeah shit. We've seen some wild fights boys. We're gonna see some wild ones this weekend
*  Yeah, I'm excited. I don't know what's gonna happen in the main event. I know you're partial to marab
*  But I just don't know what's gonna happen. I'm very interested very interested
*  He gets past that first round he's got to keep them in one clench. Yeah, it's gonna be very saying he needs one shot
*  I'm saying marab needs one clench not to end the fighting is enough damage
*  I feel like sugar is a better striker than Marlon and Marlon had marab in trouble and that's what gives me pause on
*  The feet like you can only take so many of those sniper shots from sugar
*  The other thing can he land them and can marab keep keep moving and keep threatening and pressure, you know
*  The argument is there's one guy is gonna win by taking them down and smashing them
*  The other guy's gonna win by knocking them out on the feet and we don't you know
*  We don't know what's gonna play out. It's gonna be interesting. It's gonna be fucking phenomenal
*  The thing that I think yeah that Sean does well like he got Aljo with it is I mean
*  You know Marab is gonna be pressuring because that's how he's gonna he has to beat him
*  Sean took out Aljo backing up. Yeah, you know what I mean
*  Lot of guys fight moving backwards he does have the ability to fight moving backwards. He's also a great game plan
*  Great relationship they study shit they find holes, you know
*  They knew that Aljo has this tendency to get like a little over anxious and charge in and he was ready for that
*  I'm just interested to see if he can capitalize
*  Cuz if he can't if marab can get a hold of him
*  Marab is just a different kind of Wolverine on top of a thing
*  He needs one round mushing them in the fence
*  Just like wear him out like kind of like GSP did with BJ, you know
*  Wear him out a little bit slow him down a little bit and then you can put the pace on him
*  It's gonna be very exciting. Some guys are afraid of extending too much energy on a takedown
*  He's not going to and that same energy you felt in the first it's coming you're gonna feel the fifth
*  That's what we're dealing with
*  Rooting for Marab. I like I like him. I think he's great
*  Might be the most important because what's the difference what you know
*  If you can't get out there and apply and marab's one of them nutty dudes at spars up until the day of the fight, right?
*  He's made it through
*  Ridiculous, I'm like, but he already did five rounds. Why is he going back? It's insane what he does. It's not normal and and
*  and again, I think that
*  If he doesn't get caught with that perfect shot
*  He's a hard guy to put away and he's not gonna stop. He's a little terminator and he also knows this is his big moment
*  Yeah, it's also the pressure is not gonna he's not I've already
*  When he was gonna fight the PDA on PDA on but he had that PDA on fight before that fight got
*  On the table like they were talking about it
*  He told me marab's like he didn't
*  Totally accepted it like he was like there's so much pressure in this fight I he goes
*  You know the history between Georgia and Russia
*  He was this is not just a fight for me if I lose this he was so the pressure was so much
*  Country that's that's one of my proudest thing when he took that fight and the way he handled it
*  He was different in that fight even the lead-up. He's calling him a bitch
*  He's he's dealing with the Russian bully. And so when he won that he that was like that was like the title fight
*  He was a dominant perform. Oh my goodness. That was a wake-up call for everybody in division
*  Like he can do that to yawn. Oh my god. Yawn's a strong motherfucker, man
*  And Rob was able to stand with guys like yawn and things. So he's definitely not
*  He's not definitely not incapable there
*  No, he can fuck you up on the feet too
*  And that's part of the problem of the guy who's trying to take you down all the time
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then these bombs get on your way get off a few
*  But Sean is such a fucking sniper and he's so agile
*  Stances fighting just as good off the left is off the right you can switch stances in the middle of a combination choose angles
*  It's just Kenny keep that fucking animal off of them and they're both extremely
*  Confident yeah, that's that's saying I like when is yeah, I love that shit. Yeah, so exciting. It's
*  It's a real clash of styles so many fucking good fights these days man, what a good time to be a fan, right?
*  We're spoiled. We're so spoiled the most I know I mean boxing's making a little comeback, too
*  I think you know once Gervonta and Ryan Garcia got it on now
*  It seems like they're starting to make some more fights. Well the Saudis
*  Bring in the money come on. They're talking
*  I mean are they really doing Canelo for 20 bucks or something you saw what they were saying on the pay-per-view
*  You know 20 dollars. I don't don't quote me, but the I don't think so the prince who runs that Riyadh stuff said
*  He's gonna make all pay-per-views he did say that cuz he believes that you know make it more
*  Expose it to more people grow to audience. We'd still make money and everybody will be able to watch
*  How many more people would buy it if it's 20 rather than 70 they might make their money
*  That's I mean, it's what he said he was home, but if he said he might even do Canelo for free
*  That people would stop pirating that too they might yeah 70 bucks is a lot. It's like isn't 79
*  It was 20 bucks I wonder I wonder how much I mean it'd be an interesting thing to try yeah, I
*  Didn't know they were gonna start with Canelo although they were starting with better beef, but
*  Even they were talking about doing that for fit like 15, but nobody even knows about them
*  They should know these two I know I mean they're both six six boxers isn't better be of 20 know with 20 knockouts
*  Yeah, yeah, but he's 39. I don't even watch the fucking box and I can't watch it after the MMA
*  I just watched the fights. It's hard for me. I picked my spots. Yeah, I just see Ben Whitaker
*  Did it with who Ben Whitaker? No Ben Whitaker? You know Ben Whitaker? Yeah, that dude who's got that crazy drunken style
*  Yes, big tall light heavyweight. He's got this wild style 90 bucks
*  So much for your 20 all of them
*  It's out there next time you can find
*  Boy oh
*  That's a good deal so you pay for the pay-per-view and then other fights are 20 bucks
*  That's a good deal. Yeah, I think so alright gentlemen. This is a lot of fun. Oh
