# Joe Rogan Experience #2025 - Dave Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up, brother? Good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=14.0s)]
*  Good to be back. Crack a leckon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=16.0s)]
*  Well, just having fun, dude. Great time at Mothership last night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=18.0s)]
*  That was a good time. Yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=21.0s)]
*  That place is always a good time. Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=22.0s)]
*  I can't wait to go back tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=24.0s)]
*  Magical portal. Fun. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=25.0s)]
*  Full of great fucking crowds, too. The crowds were amazing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just incredible. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=30.0s)]
*  Every time I've been there. And I've been there a decent amount now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=31.0s)]
*  Always great crowds. Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=34.0s)]
*  It's a fun place. Build it and they will come. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you sure did. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=38.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=40.0s)]
*  So, we were on our way over here and I texted you that Purgosian thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=43.0s)]
*  Wild. But not unexpected. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=52.0s)]
*  Is he definitely dead? Is he definitely? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't think it's definitely. I think this is what people are reporting. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=56.0s)]
*  I mean, the plane just went down. I wouldn't say definitely yet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=59.0s)]
*  But I think a lot of us did expect after he kind of flirted with a mutiny against Vladimir Putin [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=63.0s)]
*  and then they kind of came to an agreement and he leaves, you're like, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=71.0s)]
*  I don't think that guy is very long to live. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah. Vladimir Putin doesn't seem to me to be the type of guy you can try to overthrow [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=76.0s)]
*  and then go, my bad. I think we're cool. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=81.0s)]
*  What do you think that was all about? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=84.0s)]
*  I don't know. I really don't know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=86.0s)]
*  At first they were spinning it like he was pissed off about the war, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=89.0s)]
*  but that never really seemed to make sense to me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=95.0s)]
*  I think some type of power struggle and he kind of went for it in a pretty major way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=98.0s)]
*  He started destroying equipment and moving his forces toward Moscow [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=104.0s)]
*  and then they reached some agreement and they backed off. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=107.0s)]
*  And now a plane went down. So we'll see. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=112.0s)]
*  We'll see. Yeah, if I was him, I wouldn't be going anywhere by plane. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah, you would think, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=119.0s)]
*  You should take a bus, bro. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, you should take a tank anywhere you go. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=124.0s)]
*  You should be inside a safe riding on a bus. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=128.0s)]
*  What was crazy is when it first went down, so many people in the corporate press were like, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=132.0s)]
*  this is it for Putin. He's done. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=137.0s)]
*  Russia's collapsing because they're doing so bad in the war. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=139.0s)]
*  And all of those narratives seem to be completely disproven. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=142.0s)]
*  Well, what's scary is what happens if Ukraine runs out of troops. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=146.0s)]
*  That's what's terrifying is like, how many more soldiers do they have left? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=151.0s)]
*  How many more people can they force to fight that war? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=156.0s)]
*  Like, what is the truth in terms of what are their losses? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=159.0s)]
*  Because what you hear from people that are the true believers in the leftist movement is that Ukraine is winning and that Russia is doomed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=163.0s)]
*  We must support Ukraine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=173.0s)]
*  And then what you hear from realists, particularly people that have been on the ground like it's a slaughter fest. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=175.0s)]
*  It's horrific. And the ratio of Ukrainian dead to Russian dead is extremely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=182.0s)]
*  I'm balanced. Right. That's what I'm in Russia's favor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=189.0s)]
*  Then Russia's Russia's killing a lot more than they're getting killed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=193.0s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly. It's always hard, like in the fog of war, to know exactly how many people are dying. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=195.0s)]
*  It's usually not till after the fact. And they do the like excess mortality numbers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=200.0s)]
*  And then you kind of figure out like how many people actually died here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=204.0s)]
*  But it does seem I think there's no question that Ukraine is doing better than would have been expected. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=207.0s)]
*  Like, say, in the year 2010, if you had said, OK, Russia's going to invade Ukraine, most people thought they would have folded in a couple of weeks and it would have been over. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=218.0s)]
*  Ukraine has at least put up a fight to this point. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=228.0s)]
*  And I think that that is because of the fact that, number one, NATO was training the Ukrainian military for years ever since 2014, ever since Yanukovych government was overthrown. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=231.0s)]
*  And number two, that we've poured an unlimited amount of resources into the war effort. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=242.0s)]
*  But then that kind of leads to the question of like, wait, so but if Russia still wins at the end of this, which it looks like they're going to short of like U.S. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=248.0s)]
*  intervention, direct intervention, then what did we accomplish here other than just getting way more people slaughtered and drawing the war out way longer to kind of sacrifice Ukraine in an effort to hurt Ukraine? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=258.0s)]
*  Russia. And it's crazy that the same people who support this war supported claiming that they really care about the Ukrainians. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=272.0s)]
*  But if you really cared about them, why would your move be to prolong the conflict and let more of them die? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=279.0s)]
*  Seems so horrible. It's very strange when the left is pro war. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=285.0s)]
*  Very, very strange. And it's almost like this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=291.0s)]
*  This shifting of the polls that sort of seems to have happened politically, where it doesn't matter what the actual facts of what you're supporting are, as long as what you're supporting is endorsed by the ideology. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=296.0s)]
*  Right. And that ideology is this leftist ideology is that, you know, we have to have Ukraine flag in your Twitter bio. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=311.0s)]
*  You have to support you. And regardless of and you're not even looking at the objective data to try to figure out what happened here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=320.0s)]
*  How did this get started? I've never heard anyone other than you and a few other people online even discuss the 2014 coup. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=327.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's interesting because these these the narratives kind of change. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=336.0s)]
*  And one of the things that's interesting about the made on revolution is that and I like I've played the last couple of times we've been here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=341.0s)]
*  We played clips of like what people were saying at the time. And at the time there were several people who were basically admitting what's going on. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=348.0s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, we're stealing Ukraine away from Russia. Ha ha ha. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=355.0s)]
*  Gideon Rose laughing with Stephen Colbert. There's Senator Chris Murphy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=358.0s)]
*  He was one of the guys who was very involved in it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=362.0s)]
*  And he like he went to Ukraine several times during the when the revolution was first starting. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=365.0s)]
*  And but he was kind of the young guy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=370.0s)]
*  Like it was him and John McCain and Victoria Newland and then Chris Murphy was kind of this younger senator. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=373.0s)]
*  And he just said the quiet part out loud on a C-SPAN interview back then where he just went. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=378.0s)]
*  He goes, oh, yeah, it was American policy that overthrew Yanukovych. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=382.0s)]
*  That was our policy that led to him. Without us, he wouldn't have been overthrown. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=386.0s)]
*  And so like but now it's like they would admit it then. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=389.0s)]
*  But now when you talk about it, they're like, oh, no, no, no, that's not helpful to the narrative. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=392.0s)]
*  So don't mention that we were involved in overthrowing a government that was more pro-Russian and putting in a government that was more pro-West because that that complicates this thing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=396.0s)]
*  It's it reminds me of like there were these there were these pieces in the 90s where there was like mainstream media outlets covering the dynamic of Al Qaeda and terrorism. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=406.0s)]
*  And in the Middle East and they would just like bluntly just say like, oh, they they hate us because of our military presence in the Middle East. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=418.0s)]
*  That's his grievance with us. Just like, you know, that's the news. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=425.0s)]
*  That's why Bin Laden hates us. No one had no one was going. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=428.0s)]
*  They hate us because we're free because that just hadn't been said yet. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=432.0s)]
*  You know, and that wasn't until after 9 11. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=436.0s)]
*  But then after 9 11, it was they hate us for our freedom. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=439.0s)]
*  And now if you were to make the point that they hate us for our foreign policy, it's like, well, where did you get that from? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=442.0s)]
*  That's insane. But you all admitted that just only a few years ago. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=447.0s)]
*  You were openly talking about it. And so it's kind of like that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=451.0s)]
*  That narrative doesn't help serve the war party. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=454.0s)]
*  So now that has to be kind of like in the dustbin of history that that never happened. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=457.0s)]
*  The conflict started in 2022 when Vladimir Putin invaded. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=462.0s)]
*  He was totally unprovoked. There was no other reason. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=466.0s)]
*  It's just that he's a mad man. He's bad guy. We're good guy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=469.0s)]
*  That's the conflict. That's like how that's the tunnel vision. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=472.0s)]
*  You're always supposed to think of war throw. And that's rarely, if ever the case. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=475.0s)]
*  It's always more complicated than that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=480.0s)]
*  And then as soon as you start saying that, believe me, from the last two podcasts here, I've heard a lot of people, oh, you're spewing Russian propaganda. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=482.0s)]
*  You're pro Putin because as soon as you start going, well, look, this guy had some legitimate grievances. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=490.0s)]
*  We did a lot to provoke him. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=497.0s)]
*  And that all of a sudden means you're like on their side because you're no longer. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=499.0s)]
*  We're good guys. He's bad guys. I'm like, no, actually, there's a lot of bad guys involved in this conflict. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=503.0s)]
*  Yeah, you were detailing last night. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=508.0s)]
*  It was really interesting with Assan. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=511.0s)]
*  You and I were sitting in the green room and you were detailing the the coup and then the connection between the Bidens, like how this all happened with Hunter. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=514.0s)]
*  Right. Well, so there the company Burisma, who hired Hunter Biden. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=526.0s)]
*  So Joe Biden at the time when he was the vice president under Barack Obama, he was the point man on Ukraine. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=531.0s)]
*  That was like one of his big tasks that he was given by Obama. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=536.0s)]
*  And like Victoria Newland was talking about how Joe Biden would get on the phone to give an attaboy to the protesters who ultimately overthrew Yanukovych. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=539.0s)]
*  He was very intimately involved. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=549.0s)]
*  And this company, Burisma, because Ukraine is a very corrupt country, they've always been, still are. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=551.0s)]
*  This company was like very in bed with the Yanukovych government. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=556.0s)]
*  And then Yanukovych's government's overthrown and there's a new government that comes in. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=560.0s)]
*  And so they were kind of freaking out like, oh, we don't have the government that we're in bed with anymore. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=564.0s)]
*  And so this was their move to kind of instead of bribing the new Ukrainian government, they just went right to the source and bribed, you know, decided, oh, here, we'll put the vice president's son on our board. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=569.0s)]
*  Pay him, give him a huge check. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=583.0s)]
*  And then that kind of like protects us against the threat, perhaps, of this new government cracking down on us because they're not going to want to piss off who the real puppet master is, which is D.C., like as always. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=585.0s)]
*  Because like we're we're the world empire, you know, and that's the thing what's so crazy about the war in Ukraine is hearing all of these people in like the corporate press and the political class talk about how Vladimir Putin's an imperialist and he's a war criminal. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=597.0s)]
*  And you're like, how are you're just the biggest hypocrite in the history of the universe to be someone who supports the American regime and say Vladimir Putin, how dare you invade a sovereign country? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=611.0s)]
*  How dare you violate international law? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=622.0s)]
*  You're killing innocent people, you know? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=624.0s)]
*  I mean, to anyone outside of like the American bubble, that's it's just so absurd on its face that years, you know, we just got done backing the Saudis in a war of genocide in Yemen for eight years. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=626.0s)]
*  Now we're going to turn around and they're all humanitarians now for the poor people of Ukraine. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=638.0s)]
*  It's just like it doesn't pass the basic smell test. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=643.0s)]
*  No, and it's also ignoring the money. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=646.0s)]
*  The money is the scariest thing. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=650.0s)]
*  And then this is something that Trump was like really the first sitting president to discuss. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=652.0s)]
*  And we talked about that Steve Hilton interview where he said there is a military industrial complex and these guys want to go to war. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=658.0s)]
*  And to have a sitting president say that out loud, like, you know, hey, what am I going to do? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=664.0s)]
*  He's just like kind of put it out there. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=670.0s)]
*  But it was it was. Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=672.0s)]
*  But what was crazy about it, too, was he was almost saying it like the way I'd say it on your podcast. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=674.0s)]
*  Like just someone bitching about it who has no real power over it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=679.0s)]
*  You know, he's like, yeah, I don't want to go to war, but all these guys love war. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=682.0s)]
*  So war. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=684.0s)]
*  But you're the commander in chief, dude, like you're supposed to be able to say no. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=686.0s)]
*  Is it that you can't say no to everything and you have to kind of navigate that? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=691.0s)]
*  Like, how does that work? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=695.0s)]
*  I think so. My my read on it is that I think they they kind of boxed Donald Trump in with what he would politically be able to do. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=697.0s)]
*  And I think that's a lot of what the Russia collusion nonsense was all about, because like he was running on let's make a deal with Vladimir Putin. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=707.0s)]
*  Let's be friends with Russia. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=715.0s)]
*  But once the media is saying, oh, you're a Russian spy. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=716.0s)]
*  Well, now you can't really make a deal with Vladimir Putin because then look, proof he was a Russian spy. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=719.0s)]
*  So they kind of boxed him in. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=724.0s)]
*  I think they manipulated him and they lied to him about a lot of the stuff. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=725.0s)]
*  I mean, there was there were articles written about how they had misled him about the number of troops still remaining in Syria when he tried to. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=730.0s)]
*  He wanted to end that war several different times. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=738.0s)]
*  I think that they they it seemed like they really convinced him that Assad had been gassing his own people and that convinced Trump to bomb Syria a couple times. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=742.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly what the conversations were like. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=755.0s)]
*  I do know that if he really wanted to be the guy who was ending all of the wars and he wanted to be the guy who wasn't giving into the military industrial complex, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=759.0s)]
*  it makes no sense for him to have people like Lindsey Graham in his ear. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=768.0s)]
*  It made no sense for him to make Mike Pompeo his secretary of state. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=772.0s)]
*  It made no sense to have these guys like Mattis and all of the like he put it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=775.0s)]
*  He put the war party into all of these positions and then he's like, man, they're undermining me at every turn. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=780.0s)]
*  And you're like, well, yeah, that's you should have put better people in. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=787.0s)]
*  Before you get into office and this is like we were talking about this last night. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=793.0s)]
*  They're like, if you could sit down with Trump, what would be one of the first things you would ask him? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=798.0s)]
*  What I would ask is like, first of all, what did you think it was going to be like and what was it like when you get into office? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=802.0s)]
*  How much research do you need to do on each individual to find out where their ties are? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=810.0s)]
*  And like, how do you know who to put in what position? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=817.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. No, that's a really interesting question. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=821.0s)]
*  And like at what point do you realize, you know, like at what point did Trump figure out like, oh, OK, right. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=823.0s)]
*  These guys are kind of working against me. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=831.0s)]
*  Yeah, like my own deep state is kind of my own intelligence agencies who are supposed to work for me are actually working to undermine me, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=833.0s)]
*  which they clearly are. And many have admitted at this point that they were that I'd be really interested to hear what he has to say. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=841.0s)]
*  Well, there's there's no better evidence than the was it 51 intelligence officials that signed off on the fact that the Hunter Biden laptop was disinformation. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=849.0s)]
*  Yes, I believe, including four former heads of the CIA. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=859.0s)]
*  And there's really it's really something because there's no like demand for accountability for those people. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=863.0s)]
*  Like, hey, explain yourself, you know, like how did you sign off on this blatant election interference? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=868.0s)]
*  You know, and that's it's one of these things like this is why when the Trump supporters who say that they stole the election, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=874.0s)]
*  believe that the election machines were rigged or that there was ballot stuffing, it's like even if they're not right about that, which I don't know. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=884.0s)]
*  I mean, I've never I've never seen compelling evidence that that is the case. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=891.0s)]
*  But it's kind of like I use the example of like if you were like if you're cheating on your wife and then she's like, you know, like you're cheating on her. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=896.0s)]
*  And then she's like, I know Friday when you were out, I know you were cheating on me and you weren't that Friday cheating on her. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=905.0s)]
*  Like, even though she's wrong, she's really right. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=910.0s)]
*  Like, she might be wrong about that specific day, but she knows she knows you're like, like they know this whole thing is illegitimate. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=913.0s)]
*  You know, like you stole it. And and they really did. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=919.0s)]
*  I mean, they suppressed the October bombshell that would have very likely tipped the election in Trump's favor and tried to make it seem again that Russia was stealing our elections, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=923.0s)]
*  which another is another major factor in the whole Russia Ukraine conflict that, first of all, what what an insane provocation of Russia it was for the last six years to have not just people in the corporate world, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=937.0s)]
*  not just people in the corporate press, but like the head, the former head of the CIA, you know, like on TV or every day saying Russia attacked our democracy. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=951.0s)]
*  They they they interfered in our election and were and then also claiming that they were in a partnership with Donald Trump to steal it from Hillary Clinton. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=962.0s)]
*  And senators and congressmen and every media pundit, people from the FBI, the CIA constantly saying on TV that this was an act of war by Russia, that Russia, they would say it's worse than Pearl Harbor, what they did. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=971.0s)]
*  And so if you're from the Russian perspective, you're sitting there and you see the most war hungry country in the world, the country that in the last 20 years has fought seven wars, you know, led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=985.0s)]
*  destroyed nations, and they're out there saying you just committed an act of war against us. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=998.0s)]
*  I mean, like that's that's quite an aggressive posture, particularly when they all knew it was bullshit. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1005.0s)]
*  They all knew from the very beginning. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1011.0s)]
*  And so you had all of that and then they tried to do it again in 2020 claim this was a Russian operation to interfere in the election. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1013.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, all of it was actually a U.S. intelligence agency's operation to interfere in the election just from the other side. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1021.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. It's so crazy that this is not a mainstream narrative and that the news ignores this. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1032.0s)]
*  They also ignore during the debates when Joe Biden was saying that, you know, my son didn't make any money over there and I have nothing to do with my son's business. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1040.0s)]
*  Like, it's all lies. It's all easily proven. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1050.0s)]
*  And there's nothing. Yeah. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1055.0s)]
*  And of course, if Trump, you know, like the moderator doesn't push back during that debate and say, excuse me, Mr. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1057.0s)]
*  Biden, that's just not true. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1065.0s)]
*  Like, we know there's no pushback on that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1066.0s)]
*  They just let him get away with it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1067.0s)]
*  And he gets to stand up there and say, hey, look, all of these intelligence officials, they tell them they're backing up my story that this laptop is Russian disinformation. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1069.0s)]
*  And I don't know exactly what it is now. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1078.0s)]
*  But I remember there were they had like opinion polls on this after the Mueller investigation. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1081.0s)]
*  And it's still an enormously high percentage of Democratic voters believe that Trump and Russia were in Trump and Putin were involved in a conspiracy to steal the election. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1088.0s)]
*  They still believe it to this day because they heard Trump Russia collusion every day nonstop. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1098.0s)]
*  And that is a huge part of why they support this war in Ukraine, because they think we're fighting the country who overthrew our democracy and gave us Donald Trump for four years. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's all just complete bullshit. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1111.0s)]
*  But they believe it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1113.0s)]
*  It's crazy how prevalent it is because people are just headline readers. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1119.0s)]
*  And the mainstream news is completely captured. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1120.0s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, to some degree, I don't I'm sympathetic to people who get, you know, propagandized by this stuff because we do in general in life. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1123.0s)]
*  We outsource the overwhelming majority of knowledge to other people. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1132.0s)]
*  You know, like my like hot water heater broke down and I just hire a guy to replace it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1137.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about hot water heaters, but I just trust. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1144.0s)]
*  I don't know. You know, I don't know. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1147.0s)]
*  So I'll just you do it and let me know. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1149.0s)]
*  You know, we do this all the time with everything. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1150.0s)]
*  And so most people have busy lives. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1152.0s)]
*  They're working. They got kids to take care of. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1154.0s)]
*  They got a family. If the guy in the suit on CNN says it, well, I'm kind of trusting him to be the expert here. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1156.0s)]
*  And he knows. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1161.0s)]
*  And the problem is that like the guy who fixed my water heater, I don't believe is a corrupt lying piece of shit. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1162.0s)]
*  But the people on CNN are. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1169.0s)]
*  And that's the major problem here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1171.0s)]
*  It's like you just you can't trust them. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1173.0s)]
*  And the culture in that building, in that scene and building is all in support of that narrative. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1175.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you can't really buck that, especially if you're a career person. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1181.0s)]
*  You want to stay on the air. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1185.0s)]
*  You want to keep things going. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1186.0s)]
*  Just look what they did to Tucker Carlson, who was the number one guy on television and whatever feathers he ruffled, whatever people he pissed off. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1188.0s)]
*  I don't believe he's openly discussed it yet because he's probably got some sort of a lawsuit going on. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1199.0s)]
*  They removed him because he was a problem. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1204.0s)]
*  The way he was discussing things was a problem. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1208.0s)]
*  Well, it's very interesting that if you know, we've talked about this before when we played clips about CNN talking about you and stuff and like if you listen to like CNN, the way they talk about you or the way they talk about Tucker Carlson, not that you guys are in different worlds, but the way they talk about you two guys is like you're these very controversial figures who say all of these things that are not approved of and these like very confident, very polarizing figures. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1211.0s)]
*  But then you're like, no, they're he's the number one guy in cable news and you're the number one guy in podcasting. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1237.0s)]
*  Like you guys, how are you guys viewed as controversial? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1244.0s)]
*  But like CNN is talking to an audience of like two hundred thousand people and letting you know, you know, people are very skeptical of these guys. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1247.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, they're not. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1254.0s)]
*  These are that these are the most popular figures. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1256.0s)]
*  And it's because people can at least smell that you're not bullshitting them the way these guys are. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1258.0s)]
*  And that was that was always one of the things that I really appreciated about Tucker was that he would break with the Republican Party and have a completely different view from them. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1266.0s)]
*  He would break with everyone else on the network, which is like that's so unheard of today. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1273.0s)]
*  In MSNBC, if you look down the whole lineup at CNN, if you look down the whole lineup, you cannot point to one host who has a drastically different opinion on an issue that matters than the hour before them and the hour before them. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1279.0s)]
*  Right. But if you look at like, you know, the daytime at Fox News where they were on the war in Ukraine versus where Tucker was or where they were on lockdowns versus where Tucker was is night and day difference. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1291.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so of course they removed the one interesting guy. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1301.0s)]
*  Well, he was kind of doing podcasting on TV. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1304.0s)]
*  He had gotten to the point where his show was so huge that he could kind of get away with it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1308.0s)]
*  And he incrementally kept ramping it up to he's like the CIA killed Kennedy. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1314.0s)]
*  Yeah, he started. He started really going for it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1320.0s)]
*  He was going. That was great. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1322.0s)]
*  You need to hear that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1324.0s)]
*  Well, the beautiful thing is now he's just going for it on Twitter. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1325.0s)]
*  And, you know, Elon's like, OK, go ahead. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1328.0s)]
*  And you can see it in him that even even though he was going for it on Fox, you can see the freedom he has like on Twitter where he's like, OK, I'm not pulling any punches now. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1331.0s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1342.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1343.0s)]
*  Well, it's important. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1344.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1345.0s)]
*  And people need to wake the fuck up. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1346.0s)]
*  Well, look, even like with this this Trump thing, man, it's like it's like I was saying how so many people still believe the Russia collusion story, which was all made up, man. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1348.0s)]
*  And you can go like you can go follow this whole thing. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1358.0s)]
*  It was all made up and they knew it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1360.0s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1362.0s)]
*  There's that clip, by the way, before any of this is before Donald Trump ever took office. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1364.0s)]
*  Do you ever see the Chuck Schumer Six Ways to Sunday? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1368.0s)]
*  You were telling me about it last night. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1372.0s)]
*  You were saying we should watch it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1374.0s)]
*  We should we should play this. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1375.0s)]
*  We should play this. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1376.0s)]
*  And let me just let me just preface it briefly to kind of set up what's so amazing about it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1377.0s)]
*  There are these occasional moments where even like I said, the thing where Chris Murphy just happens to blurt out like, oh, yeah, we are policies over through Yanukovych. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1381.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1389.0s)]
*  Like there are these moments where kind of like these rare moments of honesty from the kind of leaders of the regime. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1390.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1396.0s)]
*  And this one comes because Rachel Maddow asks him like an impromptu thing. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1397.0s)]
*  And she says that she leads that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1403.0s)]
*  So but this is just so you know, this is Donald Trump has been elected, but he hasn't he hasn't been he's a president elect here. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1405.0s)]
*  So it's after the election, but he's not president yet. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1412.0s)]
*  So this was about him tweeting something here. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1414.0s)]
*  But he's taking these shots, this antagonism, taunting to the intelligence. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1417.0s)]
*  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1423.0s)]
*  So even for a practical, supposedly hardnosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1428.0s)]
*  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1434.0s)]
*  I don't know. But I from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1437.0s)]
*  So and what happened right before that is that Rachel Maddow goes, she goes, all right, I'm sorry to put you on the spot here, but Donald Trump just tweeted this thing about the intelligence community. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1444.0s)]
*  Any thoughts on that? So it's not like he was prepared for this. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1454.0s)]
*  His the most powerful senator in America, his initial gut reaction was like, well, dude, you're taking on the intelligence. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1457.0s)]
*  I mean, you want to go up against the CIA? You think you're going to win that fight? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1464.0s)]
*  Yeah, like they're going to get you. And this was already after they had already been they were spying on his campaign. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1467.0s)]
*  They had already kind of begun framing him for this whole this whole Russia thing, which was always nonsense. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1473.0s)]
*  And that started with, you know, the Steele dossier and all that stuff. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1478.0s)]
*  And then they were spying on Carter Page, who was like a pretty low level adviser in Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1483.0s)]
*  And the allegation was that the Russians had offered him a huge stake in like one of their biggest energy companies. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1490.0s)]
*  If he could get Donald Trump to remove all of the sanctions that we had at the time on Russia, which on the face of it made no sense, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1499.0s)]
*  because he's like a low level adviser on the campaign. He's not even in the administration. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1509.0s)]
*  Was this based on intercepted emails? No, this was based off the Steele dossier, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1514.0s)]
*  which was opposition research that Hillary Clinton had funded where she hired this British spy to go like dig up dirt on Donald Trump. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1520.0s)]
*  And they put together this whole dossier alleging that he was, you know, he had been in bed with Russia for years. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1529.0s)]
*  He was compromised. It was that the prostitutes were peeing on him and all this like crazy shit. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1537.0s)]
*  And they all knew it was unverified. They all knew it was like and all of it, almost all of it was ended up being disproven. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1542.0s)]
*  But so when they went to Carter, but just to understand like the idea of trying to bribe a low level adviser on a campaign to then somehow take over the administration. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1549.0s)]
*  Once he got it, it'd be like on the level of if someone was like, we're going to bribe the door guy at the mothership to make sure that the Joe Rogan experience only talks about these subjects. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1561.0s)]
*  And you're like, I mean, even though there's a loose connection between you and the guy who works at the mothership, the idea that he would ever then be able to come in and take over the show and control. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1573.0s)]
*  It just made no sense. But we now know that the CIA told the FBI that Carter Page was a good guy, that he was a he was a CIA informant. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1583.0s)]
*  Then they so they told the FBI they're like, no, no, no, he's not a spy. He's one of ours. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1594.0s)]
*  So just lay off. And then the FBI lied about that on the FISA application. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1600.0s)]
*  This was the only guy who went down for the frame job was this one FBI lawyer for misrepresenting what the CIA said. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1607.0s)]
*  But basically he the they said that he was approached by Russians and that he was approached by a group of Russians to see if he would turn and work for them. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1616.0s)]
*  And the CIA were like, yes, he was. And he came right back to us and told us about it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1628.0s)]
*  And then when they were putting in the application for the FISA warrant, the FBI said he was approached by these Russians and the CIA confirmed it. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1634.0s)]
*  So they they said that the CIA confirmed that he was approached by these guys, but they left out the part that the CIA said. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1642.0s)]
*  And he came right back to us and told us about it. So that one guy was the only guy who got charged. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1649.0s)]
*  Did he get so no jail time, but he did get charged. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1654.0s)]
*  Carter Page got no, no, no, the FBI agent who the FBI lawyer who lied on the application. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1657.0s)]
*  Carter Page, they had three FISA court warrants on them. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1662.0s)]
*  They spied on them all up and down, never been charged with anything because he wasn't a spy. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1665.0s)]
*  Right. And there's look that Donald Trump, even now with all these charges, right, he's never been charged with treason. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1669.0s)]
*  He's never been charged with inciting an insurrection because they know they can't get him on those charges. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1677.0s)]
*  So what they're getting him on is all these like novel legal theories. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1684.0s)]
*  Well, it's not very clear that he violated the statute. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1687.0s)]
*  But if we interpret it this way, we could make the argument for the first time ever that this was actually a violation of law. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1690.0s)]
*  It's all like they're grasping at straws. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1697.0s)]
*  And it's very clearly like they've weaponized the legal system against this guy. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1700.0s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that all of these indictments are coming down right now. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1704.0s)]
*  Like, why why was the January 6th thing? Why would any of this be coming down right now? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1709.0s)]
*  All those other people in January 6th, they got charged and arrested immediately. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1714.0s)]
*  We were talking about that Vivek interview, which is very interesting, where this woman on CNN, that same woman that did the town hall thing with Trump. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1718.0s)]
*  What's her name? Caitlin? Yeah, I don't know. I know you're talking about. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1728.0s)]
*  She was trying to get him to discuss certain things in a way that would look preposterous. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1733.0s)]
*  And she was talking about 9-11. And like you said, the government lied to us about 9-11. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1743.0s)]
*  Like what would you think the government was involved in 9-11? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1748.0s)]
*  He's like, no, what I said was that the government lied to us about 9-11 because the Saudis were involved and they knew they were involved. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1752.0s)]
*  And she kind of glossed over that and was saying something until in the lines of don't you think that you saying that the government lied to us about 9-11? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1762.0s)]
*  Supports baseless conspiracy theories, you know, like supports the idea that the government orchestrated like that's the when you want to put on the full tin foil hat with the fucking chin strap. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1772.0s)]
*  You say the government organized and designed 9-11. There was bombs in the building. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1785.0s)]
*  They knew it was all happening. They detonated tower seven like all you got to go full hat. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1792.0s)]
*  And so she's trying to bring him into full conspiracy tin foil hat. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1799.0s)]
*  And he is going, no, that's not what I said. And he said something that's factual. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1803.0s)]
*  And she just sort of like pretended it didn't get said and kept. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1809.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a real fucking issue. They lied about whether or not Saudi Arabia was involved. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1814.0s)]
*  It's one of the biggest scandals in the history of the United States of America. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1821.0s)]
*  It was like the biggest terrorist attack on our soil. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1825.0s)]
*  And the government lied about what had happened and who was involved with it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1828.0s)]
*  And by the way, continued propping up that regime to this day, continued like funding and doing business with the same government that had high level people involved in the attack. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1833.0s)]
*  And they knew it and suppressed that from the American people because it would have been, you know, if you put yourself back in that time, it would have been such an outrage. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1845.0s)]
*  If the Americans had known. And in fact, one of the first things George W. Bush did immediately after 9 11, even when all the flights were grounded, was get high level Saudis out of the country. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1853.0s)]
*  Let's fly them out of the country. And this is all factual. Like this happened. It's not disputed, including members of Bin Laden's family. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The whole thing is so wild. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1871.0s)]
*  And it doesn't get discussed. They keep going back to the company narrative. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1875.0s)]
*  What's the ideological left narrative? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1881.0s)]
*  The left narrative is anybody who questions 9 11 is a nutter and you're a nutter and you're trying to run for president. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1884.0s)]
*  And he does a very good job of she repeats the question. He repeats the answer. She repeats the question. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1890.0s)]
*  He repeats the answer. And she's trying to catch him in this. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1897.0s)]
*  And it's like, see if you can find that. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1901.0s)]
*  So I'm looking it up and what I'm seeing online is that there's the story has turned a little bit that the Atlantic has posted audio from the interview. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1903.0s)]
*  Ah, he was asking for that audio. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1915.0s)]
*  Yes, they released it and it says the Atlantic did not put any words in his mouth. I'm trying to find the audio so we could play it. But it's behind a page. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1917.0s)]
*  So he was saying that they put words in his mouth. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1924.0s)]
*  Yes. So but then what I'm also seeing then in the Daily Beast article is that despite them releasing the audio, it says Rama Swami's campaign somehow declared victory. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1927.0s)]
*  Hmm. So they're saying he's I guess they're saying he said it, but his team is also saying it's still been taken out of context. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1938.0s)]
*  But what are they claiming that he said? I don't I'm trying to find the transcript and I haven't gotten that far. It's behind a paywall again. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1944.0s)]
*  But let's let's listen to his interview on CNN because the things that it's interesting like we'll figure this out. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1950.0s)]
*  Why is it not giving you any volume? Well, it's not the interview yet. It's not. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1964.0s)]
*  What's that? It's just her talking. Oh, oh, I see. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1971.0s)]
*  Actually, and this is just lifting the curtain on how media works again. I asked that reporter to send the recording because it was on the record. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1975.0s)]
*  He refused to do it. But we had a free flowing conversation. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1980.0s)]
*  After our interview, the Atlantic released the audio more than four minutes of it, actually. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1984.0s)]
*  And here is the part with that quote that was in question. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1989.0s)]
*  What is the truth about January 6th? I don't know. We can handle it. Whatever it is, we can handle it. But why is it agents? How many government agents were in the field? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=1995.0s)]
*  You mean like entrapment? Yeah, absolutely. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2003.0s)]
*  Why can the government not be transparent about something that we're using terrorists or the kind of tax abuse by terrorists if we find there are hundreds of our own in the ranks of the day that they were that they were? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2007.0s)]
*  I mean, look, there's a difference between entrapment and the difference between law enforcement agent identifying. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2021.0s)]
*  I think it is legitimate to say how many police, how many federal agents were on the planes that hit between towers? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2026.0s)]
*  Like, I think we want it. Maybe the answer is zero. Probably a zero for all I know, right? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2032.0s)]
*  I think it was anything other than zero. But if we're doing a comprehensive assessment of what happened on 9-11, we have a 9-11 commission. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2036.0s)]
*  Absolutely, that should be an answer the public knows the answer to. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2044.0s)]
*  No, okay, for vague did nothing wrong. There's nothing that's literally nothing wrong with what he said there. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2048.0s)]
*  But that's like we're doing this in comparison to January 6th. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2052.0s)]
*  So we do want to know how many federal agents were involved in January 6th. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2057.0s)]
*  And imagine if there was actually federal agents that were involved on the planes in 9-11. He didn't say there were. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2061.0s)]
*  No, he specifically said zero. I'm sure it was zero. I'm sure we want to know. Right. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2066.0s)]
*  But we'd want to know. And he's saying if you're claiming this was an act of terrorism, just like that was an act of terrorism, then OK, let's have a commission. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2071.0s)]
*  Let's have a report. Let's know how many federal agents there were. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2077.0s)]
*  And so far, I mean, by the way, it's crazy. Does she keep going? Can I hear what her take on that is? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2080.0s)]
*  There's still another minute on this video. Please play the rest of it. OK. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2087.0s)]
*  I want to hear what she has to say about this. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2091.0s)]
*  Herself, he was in fact quoted accurately in an email to CNN after that audio was published. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2095.0s)]
*  His spokesperson said, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2102.0s)]
*  I should note that spokesperson did not explain how he was supposedly taken out of context. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2119.0s)]
*  The reality is that Vivek Ramaswamy is running to be president of the United States. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2125.0s)]
*  He will be on that debate stage tomorrow night. And he says this is a central message to his campaign. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2130.0s)]
*  This campaign is founded on the truth. The truth. We will not back down from the truth. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2136.0s)]
*  We stand for the truth. I'm a patriot who speaks the truth. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2144.0s)]
*  Well, the truth is he did say it. The quote was accurate and it is on tape. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2151.0s)]
*  And yes, this is how the media works. You get quoted for things you say accurately. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2156.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that is still out of context. It's clearly out of context. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2162.0s)]
*  Otherwise, they would have released the entire recording. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2166.0s)]
*  I know. And it's this weird thing where they brag about how like, but you know what? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2168.0s)]
*  The Atlantic did release four minutes of audio. Well, why not just release the whole thing? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2171.0s)]
*  This was after he had said they didn't release it because they hadn't. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2176.0s)]
*  So he's asking for the copy of it. They would not give it to him. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2181.0s)]
*  And then they released this small snippet that is again taken out of context. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2185.0s)]
*  And it's not as if anywhere in there he says, I believe there were federal agents on January 6th. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2190.0s)]
*  He said it's probably zero. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2197.0s)]
*  Well, on 9-11 he said it's probably zero. But he said he's asking the question about January 6th. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2199.0s)]
*  But he never even said, I believe January 6th was an inside job. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2202.0s)]
*  He said like, it seems like entrapment. Like that's kind of what it seems like. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2205.0s)]
*  And we have a right to ask these questions. Yeah, Vivek is a very sharp guy. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2209.0s)]
*  I had him on my podcast. He's a very impressive guy. Very smart. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2214.0s)]
*  And he's just 100% right here. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2219.0s)]
*  Look, Ray, the FBI director, was asked and one of the other top level Justice Department people were both asked [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2222.0s)]
*  when testifying before Congress whether there were any federal agents or assets involved in January 6th. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2231.0s)]
*  And they both said no comment. They both said we cannot talk about ongoing investigations. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2238.0s)]
*  So the only time this was actually asked to high level people, they didn't shoot us a no. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2244.0s)]
*  They didn't say no. Absolutely not. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2250.0s)]
*  Let me take a, let me steel man this. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2252.0s)]
*  Would it be if you were running the FBI and there was something like this march on the Capitol [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2255.0s)]
*  and a bunch of people were saying that the election was rigged and people were storming the Capitol [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2265.0s)]
*  or they're going to be on the lawn outside of the Capitol? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2271.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you want to have federal agents out there? Wouldn't that be a smart thing to do? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2275.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2282.0s)]
*  Because what if they are organizing something that's highly illegal? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2283.0s)]
*  What if there are some fucking real loons that are bringing explosives and dirty bombs? Who fucking knows, right? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2287.0s)]
*  Just imagine the possibilities. Doesn't it seem like that is what they're supposed to do? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2295.0s)]
*  Sure, but you wouldn't have them out there screaming we're going to storm the Capitol. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2303.0s)]
*  Storm the Capitol. So that's where the difference is. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2309.0s)]
*  The question is, did that happen? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2312.0s)]
*  Right. So if there were just like FBI agents embedded in some type of protest to watch out for criminal activity [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2314.0s)]
*  and then if there was some like arrest the person or whatever, that would be reasonable. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2324.0s)]
*  But if they're in there to try to provoke criminal activity, that's a whole different story. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2328.0s)]
*  And if the case was that they were sending the FBI in there because they were worried about violence [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2334.0s)]
*  and they wanted to, then you'd also wonder why was it that the Capitol police didn't get the reinforcements that they had requested? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2339.0s)]
*  And like why is it that there were these other two like explosives that we've still never gotten the answer to? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2345.0s)]
*  There's just a lot of stuff about January 6th that doesn't completely add up. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2352.0s)]
*  And I think Vivek is 1000% right to like say we should be demanding the answers to this. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2356.0s)]
*  That's all. I think that's a completely reasonable take. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2363.0s)]
*  And you know, CNN, they do this thing where as soon as you start like inquiring about these things, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2367.0s)]
*  they try to smear you as like this is, you know, you're some type of conspiracy nut or something like that. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2375.0s)]
*  And the funny thing about it is that like, look, we all know their elites conspire and, you know, intelligence agencies conspire [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2381.0s)]
*  and they've carried out tons of operations throughout the years. We know that. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2390.0s)]
*  So why is it so unreasonable to question whether like what exactly are they doing right now? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2394.0s)]
*  It's not nothing. You know what I mean? It's not just that. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2399.0s)]
*  There's also been cases of clear entrapment that we're all aware of that they got away with. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2402.0s)]
*  And one of the big ones is that 19 year old kid who was talked into detonating a bomb that wasn't even a bomb. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2408.0s)]
*  But I believe it was by the FBI and I believe it was in Dallas. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2415.0s)]
*  Is that where it was from? Do you remember that story? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2418.0s)]
*  I remember the story. Yeah, I don't remember the story. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2420.0s)]
*  But yeah, there's been they took some young sort of delusional guy and they they literally kind of conned him into blowing up this bomb. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2422.0s)]
*  And it wasn't a bomb. They gave him a cell phone. Do this. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2432.0s)]
*  And it's going to do that. It's going to blow up. And he does that. And then they arrest him. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2436.0s)]
*  Yeah. But you you told him to do it. You got him to do it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2439.0s)]
*  You talked him into doing it. There's been dozens of these since 9-11, these kind of entrapment things. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2442.0s)]
*  And then the FBI brags about how they thwarted a terrorist attack. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2447.0s)]
*  But like there was never a terrorist attack. The governor of Michigan. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2450.0s)]
*  That. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That one's bananas. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2453.0s)]
*  And it is it's it's really sad because like the thing with Whitmore, what they end up doing is kind of like luring in these really sad people. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2455.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like the guys like a homeless guy who's a drunk who's living, you know, in an attic somewhere or something like that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2465.0s)]
*  And then they kind of get this guy to go along with it. And he like resists the first three times. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2472.0s)]
*  And he's like, no, I don't want to do anything like that. No, this is crazy. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2477.0s)]
*  And then they keep pushing them and pushing them. And they finally get this guy. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2480.0s)]
*  So they created the the event to begin with. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2483.0s)]
*  There was no threat that this was going to happen until you guys like Lord, this really sad, in most cases, not very bright guys into doing this thing and then arrest them. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2487.0s)]
*  The craziest thing is the numbers. Wasn't it like there was 14 people and 12 of them were in. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2498.0s)]
*  Yeah. The whole thing was basically feds. Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2505.0s)]
*  Feds. And what was the purpose of it? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2508.0s)]
*  The purpose of it was to kind of paint this picture of the anti lockdowners as being these violent threat. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2510.0s)]
*  And so that this would then hurt Donald Trump in his election campaign. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2518.0s)]
*  So it's not just like that they were just doing this. It's like they were doing this with a political like motivation. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2522.0s)]
*  This is what's so like this is the thing that's so creepy and what so many people are waking up to as part of the reason. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2528.0s)]
*  Look, man, this is the reason why that Richmond North Richmond song blew up so big because so many people today. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2534.0s)]
*  And it's kind of what's exciting about the current moment. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2540.0s)]
*  It's also a little bit scary, but that so many people are just kind of waking up to how corrupt this whole thing is. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2544.0s)]
*  You know, you're like, oh, it's all fake. It's all that was. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2550.0s)]
*  Do you remember the one we talked we just mentioned with Tucker Carlson said he had a source that had read all of the Kennedy files. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2554.0s)]
*  This is when he said the CIA killed Kennedy and he goes and then we asked him point blank. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2560.0s)]
*  Was the CIA involved in the assassination of Jack Kennedy? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2564.0s)]
*  And he's and the guy's response was he goes, yes, it's all fake. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2567.0s)]
*  The country isn't what we thought it was. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2572.0s)]
*  I remember just that was like a powerful like just to say it's all fake. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2575.0s)]
*  I think more and more people are waking up to that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2580.0s)]
*  Like these these people on CNN all day, you know, they act so like they have this air of like moral superiority and concern about as well. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2583.0s)]
*  Listen, this could lead to dangerous conspiracy theories. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2595.0s)]
*  This is dangerous for our democracy. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2597.0s)]
*  This is blah, blah, blah. What about these downtrodden people or whatever? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2599.0s)]
*  And then meanwhile, you're like, well, you guys have no interest in finding Epstein's client list. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2603.0s)]
*  Really? Like, how are you not talking about that every day, man? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2609.0s)]
*  Right. Like every day. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2612.0s)]
*  Like you're telling me we found out that there was a ring of like a child rape ring with the most powerful people all involved in it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2614.0s)]
*  And you're not just demanding every day that we get to the bottom of this. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2624.0s)]
*  In fact, we know that that one ABC reporter had the story suppressed when she first broke the Epstein story. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2628.0s)]
*  Right. She was on a hot mic talking about it. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2634.0s)]
*  Yeah. And like so you're like, well, where do you get off? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2636.0s)]
*  Like acting like you're the yeah, this is how the media works. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2639.0s)]
*  You get quoted and then we quote you and then we show you. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2643.0s)]
*  That's how the media works. Like this air of superiority. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2646.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you're like you've been caught red handed on so many different things. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2649.0s)]
*  You you lied us into every freaking war in the last 20 years. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2654.0s)]
*  You you suppressed the Epstein story. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2658.0s)]
*  You bullshitted about the Hunter Biden story. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2660.0s)]
*  You're all now even admitting it. Even they're admitting it now. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2663.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, it turns out there is a whole real corrupt thing to be investigated here about the Bidens. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2665.0s)]
*  It's like but then they still turn around and have this like, well, we're the news and that's what happens. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2670.0s)]
*  And then they're very concerned with, you know, you spreading misinformation or something. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2675.0s)]
*  The Ivermectin thing. Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2679.0s)]
*  The the new one now the CDC or the FDA rather can't stop doctors from approving Ivermectin for covid. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2681.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's this giant wave of covid right now that's happening supposedly. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2691.0s)]
*  Well, according to Alex Jones, he has information that you see that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2697.0s)]
*  Yeah. He said he said he talked to like high level NSA guys. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2702.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. TSA guys who told him that like masks and airports are coming back and that there's going to be a big ramp up in covid. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2706.0s)]
*  And I was really hoping this would fall into the Alex Jones wasn't right category. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2714.0s)]
*  I still am. But it was really weird that after he said that for the next few days, everybody in the corporate press is talking about covid again. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2719.0s)]
*  Not only that, there's a mask mandate that got passed in one college. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2726.0s)]
*  And then Lionsgate passed. They instituted a mask mandate for other employees. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2731.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's just wild. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2737.0s)]
*  I really I have a hard time imagining that they would really try to ramp the covid thing back up. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2739.0s)]
*  Also, all of the all of the science seems to indicate that this new strain is less deadly than even Omicron was. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2744.0s)]
*  And so like, what are we even talking about here? But they're trying to push another round of boosters. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2752.0s)]
*  They're already I saw there was a Pfizer spokesman on CNN the other day. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2756.0s)]
*  This is why you really need to get this this this latest booster. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2762.0s)]
*  And they say, does this booster protect against the newest variant? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2766.0s)]
*  And he said, it looks like it does. It looks like it does. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2769.0s)]
*  OK, it looks like that's that's what you've got for us now. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2774.0s)]
*  Not even this like it's so funny how far it's fallen. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2778.0s)]
*  It's not just like if you take this vaccine, you won't get it and you can't transmit it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2782.0s)]
*  Listen, it's 95 percent effective. It's totally safe and effective. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2786.0s)]
*  It'll definitely. And that now it's just like, looks good. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2790.0s)]
*  Shoot another one, man. What are the effects of taking eight mRNA vaccines in two years? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2794.0s)]
*  I don't know. Looks good. Take it. That's where they're at. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2800.0s)]
*  But there's enough people out there that are just headline readers that are going to listen to that, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2804.0s)]
*  that haven't had these discussions, that don't know this information, that are just going to take it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2809.0s)]
*  Well, yes. But there are some things that are encouraging. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2814.0s)]
*  You know, to me, it's very it's very encouraging how much noise RFK has been making [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2817.0s)]
*  and that he's been like even within the Democratic primary. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2821.0s)]
*  He was polling at like 20 percent in several polls amongst Democratic voters. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2825.0s)]
*  Like, OK, that's something. And if you look at the rate of the vaccination rate, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2829.0s)]
*  it was the initial double jab and the Johnson and Johnson, like when they initially rolled it out, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2835.0s)]
*  they got up to I think somewhere in the neighborhood of like 75 percent of the adult population got it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2840.0s)]
*  This was worth a lot of coercion, you know, not just like people just got it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2845.0s)]
*  It's like a lot of people had their jobs threatened if they didn't get it and had pressure from family and stuff like that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2849.0s)]
*  And then if you look at the boost, the rate, the first booster, it was like half of that. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2855.0s)]
*  And then the next round of boosters, it was like way lower than that. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2861.0s)]
*  So most of the American people maybe did get the original double jab, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2864.0s)]
*  but they have not been buying into this like booster regime of like I have to keep getting more and more. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2869.0s)]
*  Probably got covid too. And they probably got it pretty bad. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2875.0s)]
*  And I was probably quite a few people at least that got it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2880.0s)]
*  I mean, that's this Cleveland Clinic statistics, which are really interesting. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2884.0s)]
*  That's the study they did on the health care workers that show that the more jabs you got, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2888.0s)]
*  the more likely you were to get covid, which is so crazy. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2893.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is really scary. And there's there was a lot of there was a lot of scientific arguments that were made even before that that were like there's a real concern that this is the case. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2897.0s)]
*  Yeah. That, in fact, the vaccine is essentially tricking your natural like your natural response, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2909.0s)]
*  including Hotez said that. And that's one of the things he said while Trump was president, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2916.0s)]
*  which is so fascinating that they can change their ideas about vaccines, depending upon who's the president. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2921.0s)]
*  Before Trump was president, when Trump was president, they were all saying, are you going to take it? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2929.0s)]
*  I'm not going to take it. Biden was saying it. Who knows? Who knows what's in there? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2934.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris was saying it. All of Fauci was saying it could take years. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2938.0s)]
*  And he literally said specifically this, that, you know, actually, sometimes the vaccine can have a reverse effect. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2943.0s)]
*  So it would take years of us studying this before we knew whether this helped or it could actually make it worse. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2948.0s)]
*  They were all saying it. And then as soon as the vaccine, you know, as soon as Trump lost the election, as soon as that the vaccine rollout started again, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2952.0s)]
*  it's just like the thing in Ukraine, you know, it's just like the thing with Al Qaeda. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2962.0s)]
*  Oh, that's that's gone. All that stuff we were admitting five minutes ago. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2965.0s)]
*  You're a crazy person if you say that now, because now there's the new agenda. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2969.0s)]
*  And this is how the propaganda goes from that. I will say, man, I think that if they're if they're going to do this, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2972.0s)]
*  like if they're going to bring back like mask mandates, if businesses are doing this, I I think like the thing that happened with Budweiser or with Bud Light [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2981.0s)]
*  when they put that Dylan Molde on the on the can and they like we need that times 10. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=2991.0s)]
*  Like I completely support people's right to stop drinking Bud Light if they don't like what's on the can. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3000.0s)]
*  You know, you don't have to have a cultural thing forced on you that you don't agree with. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3005.0s)]
*  But like there's got to be some type of response where like if you're bringing back mask mandates, we're boycotting your business. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3008.0s)]
*  Like we're just not we're not fucking with people who are going to try to force this all down our throat again because it's insane. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3014.0s)]
*  And it's like at a certain point, it's got to stop like, dude, first off, the cloth masks don't even work. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3020.0s)]
*  And all the studies indicate that it doesn't even slow the spread or anything. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3026.0s)]
*  And this is just insane. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3030.0s)]
*  Like if you're very sick and you're concerned about covid, then all right, fine. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3033.0s)]
*  You can like kind of isolate yourself, but let the let the rest of people like live a life and go back to all this insanity again. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3039.0s)]
*  It's crazy because it's once people have accepted it and once it's a thing that happened, it can happen again. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3047.0s)]
*  And it seems like they kind of want it to happen again. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3053.0s)]
*  At least some people want it to happen again, regardless of what the information is about the effectiveness of masks, regardless of like the very low fatality rate for this new strain. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3055.0s)]
*  Like regardless of that, they still they want to go back to where we were and they want to be able to say that they did the right thing, that they protected people. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3067.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's so it's so weird how into it a lot of people got with the covid thing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3075.0s)]
*  Like they got into being on lockdown. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3080.0s)]
*  They also got into enforcing other people's, you know, people's like when you have a bunch like one of the things in L.A. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3082.0s)]
*  they were doing, they were turning people in for having parties. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3093.0s)]
*  Remember that? They were like snitches get stitches. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3097.0s)]
*  But in L.A., they get rewards. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3099.0s)]
*  You get rewards. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3101.0s)]
*  They were they were people were forcing other people to comply. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3103.0s)]
*  It's really weird. It's weird how that happens. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3109.0s)]
*  So you like, you know, you get people that act like prison guards, you know, that like they're they're a little special because they can catch you doing the thing that you shouldn't be doing that everybody should be fighting back against. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3112.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's like, you know, you know, there were like the the Milgram experiments where they get people to zap them until they think they're dead because the person in a white coat tells you to keep zapping them and they're screaming in pain. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3126.0s)]
*  And most of the people would just keep doing it even after it looked like they were dead. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3136.0s)]
*  That kind of gave this like image of like, oh, so this is like kind of how authoritarianism works. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3140.0s)]
*  Like there's this authority figure and then people just comply and they just follow it and they just follow orders. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3145.0s)]
*  And like that's there's an element of that, obviously. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3151.0s)]
*  I mean, they demonstrated that in the experiment. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3153.0s)]
*  But then it's like it's almost more like the Stanford prison experiments. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3155.0s)]
*  That's really more the complete picture that like everyone gets into their little role and they actually really enjoy it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3159.0s)]
*  And that's how authoritarian regimes actually like come to be and continue themselves is that it's not just that like, oh, you know, like, you know, Hitler said we're supposed to hate the Jews and I'm not going to say no to him. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3165.0s)]
*  So I guess we got to hate the Jews. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3179.0s)]
*  It's more like those people get really into hating the Jews. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3181.0s)]
*  Yes, those fucking Jews. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3183.0s)]
*  They're the ones who did that. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3184.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3185.0s)]
*  Like it's kind of like that's the real sick thing. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3186.0s)]
*  When your neighbor just little things. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3188.0s)]
*  I remember in like April of 2020 going to visit my mother and being in her apartment building and her like one of the neighbors, this kind of like busybody older lady, like came right up to us and she goes, visiting and without masks. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3190.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3207.0s)]
*  And you're like, lady, like, go back down the hall. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3208.0s)]
*  Like, I'm bringing my kids to see their grandmother and I'm not not doing that because you're weird. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3212.0s)]
*  Like, go away. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3218.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, I didn't say it exactly like that. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3219.0s)]
*  And I said, I think I just said something like, I go, yeah, you don't want to get too close to us. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3221.0s)]
*  You know, like social distance, right? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3225.0s)]
*  Like, OK, but it's it's crazy. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3227.0s)]
*  Like, people would get into that and like somehow you could be demonized for the crime of bringing little kids to see their grandmother. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3229.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3237.0s)]
*  Like, that's something really creepy about that. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3238.0s)]
*  Visiting and without masks. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3240.0s)]
*  I'm going to wear a mask to my mom. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3242.0s)]
*  Also, you're going to have a conversation in the hallway and cite statistics about the effectiveness of masks. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3244.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3249.0s)]
*  Like, what are we going to do here? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3250.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not persuading you. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3251.0s)]
*  So it's just like, yeah, let's distance. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3252.0s)]
*  Stay over there. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3254.0s)]
*  Just such a weird thing that people bought into. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3255.0s)]
*  Has there ever is there any compelling data that masks have an effect? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3258.0s)]
*  They had they had a couple studies that that seemed to indicate it. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3262.0s)]
*  But then when they kind of broke it down, it's like, oh, no, they really manipulated these studies and they left out all of these other areas that kind of showed that it didn't work. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3266.0s)]
*  I don't have I don't remember like right offhand, but there were major studies that indicated that the mask compliance rate and the spread of covid had like no correlation to each other. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3274.0s)]
*  Like, it really didn't matter. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3284.0s)]
*  The outdoor cloth mask thing is just insane. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3286.0s)]
*  It was like you don't transmit covid outside unless you're like right on top of each other. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3290.0s)]
*  And and also and I know it was who was it? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3295.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm blanking on the I'll remember in a second. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3300.0s)]
*  But there was the major study that came out that also showed that there was no correlation in the lockdown in areas that locked down versus areas that didn't lock. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3304.0s)]
*  They just did nothing. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3311.0s)]
*  They had almost no effect whatsoever on the virus because it's like it's an upper respiratory virus. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3313.0s)]
*  It spreads, you know, you kind of can't really stop that from happening. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3318.0s)]
*  And the best thing to fight against it has always been this has now been proven empirically, but would have been easy for anyone to figure out before his natural immunity. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3322.0s)]
*  That's the best. That's the best protection you have is if you can get covid and get over it. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3331.0s)]
*  And they were trying to say that natural immunity was a myth. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3336.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is so wild. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3339.0s)]
*  So wild. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3342.0s)]
*  And it's all and it's clearly stronger than any immunity you get from the vaccine. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3344.0s)]
*  The only debate is over how much stronger it is. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3347.0s)]
*  And I've seen something there was like one Israeli study that showed that it was seventy five times more stronger than the vaccine. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3350.0s)]
*  And then there was one that showed it was like thirty five times. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3355.0s)]
*  But whatever the number is, it's clearly much better for you. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3358.0s)]
*  And you just get to a point where like what was it was like a one percent death rate, I think, on the on the original the original strand of covid. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3362.0s)]
*  And that one percent is obviously largely driven by old sick people. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3371.0s)]
*  That's where most of the death is coming from and what they do with nursing homes. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3376.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. And then they forced they forced positive people in there. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3380.0s)]
*  They forced those people to stay in nursing homes. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3384.0s)]
*  And when they had covid in nursing homes, it spread like wildfire. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3387.0s)]
*  And all these people that were on death's door already wound up dying. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3392.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. And it's like it's crazy because it's only a few years later. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3396.0s)]
*  But this is how this stuff happens. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3399.0s)]
*  You know, even like we were just talking about how like, oh, that old thing that we used to admit, you're not allowed to admit that anymore. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3401.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's almost like you give a pass for all of these things. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3405.0s)]
*  Like, do you remember that? Like, oh, yeah, they just made like they made Cuomo the hero governor. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3409.0s)]
*  Yeah. And every day he's on TV and what he won a fucking Emmy or whatever for it over your amazing TV appearances. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3417.0s)]
*  Yes. And they just try. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3424.0s)]
*  Oh, he's so presidential. Donald Trump is leading. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3426.0s)]
*  He's leading. Then two seconds later, he's out. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3429.0s)]
*  But they let his brother interview him every day on CNN like that they wouldn't even pretend there is a journalistic integrity issue with having the brother of the governor sit down and just congratulate him every day. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3431.0s)]
*  Well, we're in the middle of the biggest crisis. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3445.0s)]
*  That's what you do to like hold power accountable. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3447.0s)]
*  You let him sit down with his brother every day. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3451.0s)]
*  I can't believe even as corrupt as I know, like all the corporate press like institutions are, I can't believe there wasn't someone there who goes, this is too much of the appearance of like we're not even pretending. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3453.0s)]
*  Let's have someone else interview on every let Don Lemon do the Andrew Cuomo stuff, you know? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3466.0s)]
*  Right. I think they thought it was cute that they would talk shit to each other. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3471.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like that was the fun thing that it was like palling around with my brother. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3475.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure it was great for ratings. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3480.0s)]
*  They thought he was going to be the president, man. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3482.0s)]
*  And then for whatever reason, they turned on him. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3485.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's wild watching the the Democrat establishment turn on that guy. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3489.0s)]
*  Because in the beginning of the pandemic, he was. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3496.0s)]
*  What do you think it was? Do you think it was the nursing home statistics? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3499.0s)]
*  No. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3503.0s)]
*  What is it that like where he became a liability? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3504.0s)]
*  Because there was a lot of people that were saying like that guy could be the big guy to challenge Trump. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3507.0s)]
*  I don't think it was the nursing home thing. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3515.0s)]
*  I don't think it was any of his track record on covid because I mean, look, Newsom has a terrible track record on covid. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3517.0s)]
*  But they're they're not like turning on him over that. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3523.0s)]
*  I think it's like pissed off some powerful people behind the scenes. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3526.0s)]
*  Some shit like that happened because it was a concerted effort. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3529.0s)]
*  Like he was being propped up like the next guy. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3531.0s)]
*  And then they were like, we're pulling the floor out from underneath this guy just like that. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3534.0s)]
*  That was it was crazy during covid. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3538.0s)]
*  How many of those things happened were like, you know, they'd go like with very little time in between. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3540.0s)]
*  They'd go from being like, OK, like you can't leave your house. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3546.0s)]
*  They were like demonizing kids who are on the beach, you know, being like, look how reckless these kids are being. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3550.0s)]
*  They're out on the beach with their friends. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3557.0s)]
*  MSNBC like this guy's not wearing a mask, you know, like demonizing anyone who went outside. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3559.0s)]
*  And then it was like, well, if you're protesting for Black Lives Matter, that's totally cool. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3563.0s)]
*  You guys can all do it. Huge groups. Go for it. No problem. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3566.0s)]
*  And I was like, dude, but yesterday you told me to give up my life and like put everything on. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3569.0s)]
*  But now if it's for this cause, it's OK. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3574.0s)]
*  Or like the way they were. We were at 5 p.m. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3576.0s)]
*  Everyone was applauding for the nurses. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3579.0s)]
*  But now if that nurse won't get vaccinated, fire, you know, like screw you. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3581.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, right. Especially hero just became like nurses that already had covid and gotten over it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3585.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's so unscientific. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3591.0s)]
*  Well, all of those nurses had been working throughout the pandemic. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3593.0s)]
*  So they had surely either gotten covid or figured out how to protect themselves from getting covid. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3599.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? There's just no there was no argument that like they must get the vaccine. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3605.0s)]
*  Right. There's a nutty time, man. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3610.0s)]
*  Very. And it still is. It still is. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3613.0s)]
*  I mean, this stuff, this stuff with Trump, you know, he's tomorrow supposed to turn himself in in Georgia. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3615.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure exactly. I was reading about it yesterday. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3622.0s)]
*  And it's not exactly clear, I guess, because the deal hasn't been made. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3626.0s)]
*  But it was something like like a two hundred thousand dollar bond is what they were saying. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3630.0s)]
*  And then it looks like he's going to have to actually go into the jail. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3634.0s)]
*  So they're going to I think they're going to book him. I think that means mugshots, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3638.0s)]
*  which is which is I think something that they're going for. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3641.0s)]
*  I think they like the optics of that a lot. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3645.0s)]
*  Trump has already agreed to a two hundred thousand dollar bond with certain condition, including limits on social media. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3648.0s)]
*  That's a really interesting one. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3654.0s)]
*  Wow. Limits on social media posts about the case. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3656.0s)]
*  But if he violates it, judges may have limited enforcement options. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3659.0s)]
*  That's interesting. So this is this is one thing that's much different than any of the other indictments. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3664.0s)]
*  This is the first time that a judge has said and you know, they can do this crazy stuff that seems wildly unconstitutional [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3670.0s)]
*  and just a very basic violation of liberty is insane to me. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3676.0s)]
*  But they can have like these gag orders, you know, like Roger Stone when he was first charged was not allowed to speak about it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3680.0s)]
*  Like you can't defend yourself publicly. You can't speak about the case. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3686.0s)]
*  And they're allowed to do this. They will throw you in jail if you speak about it. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3689.0s)]
*  It's kind of like this weird system where once they agree, they kind of have the right to keep you in jail until your trial. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3693.0s)]
*  Legally. And so if they release you, they can say, well, these are the conditions and it can kind of be anything, you know. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3699.0s)]
*  But the idea that you could say, well, OK, you can't defend yourself publicly. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3708.0s)]
*  You know, you can't post on truth social or Twitter or whatever about this is such a weird thing. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3715.0s)]
*  If you believe in liberty at all, it's a weird thing because liberty is kind of predicated on the presumption of innocence. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3722.0s)]
*  Like if you're not if you don't have the presumption of innocence, then there's no such thing as freedom. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3728.0s)]
*  I mean, you could say we have freedom. But if I accuse you of something, you're guilty. Right. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3732.0s)]
*  Then you don't have any freedom. So supposedly we're innocent till proven guilty. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3736.0s)]
*  So Trump's innocent of these charges. And yet they can still tell you you're not allowed to post this. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3742.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to say this. But what's particularly interesting in this case is that this just smells a lot like election interference, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3747.0s)]
*  because from the political standpoint, if this is the biggest national story of a presidential race and Joe Biden can say whatever he wants about it or the Democrats can say whatever they want about it. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3754.0s)]
*  But Trump isn't allowed to defend himself. Like he's not allowed to comment on it at all. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3764.0s)]
*  That seems like you're rigging the system. It sounds like the conditions are more about it says intimidating witnesses and stuff like that. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3769.0s)]
*  Yes, that's what they say. They say that what the judge and I don't think we know all the details of this. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3776.0s)]
*  But what the judge says was that you can't you can't post anything that's that would be intimidating about this case. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3781.0s)]
*  But where exactly did they draw those lines is is a question to post on social media reposts on social media of posts made by another individual on social media. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3787.0s)]
*  Go back to the top of that. Listen, the lookouts phrased here as part of the conditions Trump will be prohibited from doing anything a judge could interpret as an effort to intimidate codefendants or witnesses or otherwise obstruct the administration of justice. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3799.0s)]
*  You know what it reminds me of is when when Mueller finally released that report where he basically said they had no evidence of any conspiracy with Russia. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3817.0s)]
*  But then as like a to throw a bone to the establishment to not make them look as bad as it made them look. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3828.0s)]
*  He said, well, well, here's 10 instances where he could have maybe obstructed justice. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3835.0s)]
*  Like he didn't like say he did. But he was like, here's the instances. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3840.0s)]
*  And one of them was and I should you not. You can go read the report. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3843.0s)]
*  One of the 10 instances was that he kept referring to it as a witch hunt. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3846.0s)]
*  So like the fact that he kept saying this is bullshit, like I'm not I'm not involved in a conspiracy with Russia and everybody knows that that was him potentially obstructing the investigation. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3851.0s)]
*  So it's like if you if I say you murdered somebody and you go, that's absolute bullshit. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3865.0s)]
*  I didn't murder anybody. And you're like, you're right. You didn't. But you just obstructed justice. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3869.0s)]
*  Wow. Like how insane is that? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3873.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. You're right. We did make that up about the murder thing. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3875.0s)]
*  But when you said you didn't murder anybody, you know, they said firing Comey was one of them because he fired the FBI, the director of the FBI who was investigating him at the time. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3878.0s)]
*  But then Comey said that he told Trump he wasn't investigating him. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3887.0s)]
*  So now maybe Trump figured that out. But he had told the president he wasn't investigating him even though he was. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3890.0s)]
*  And Trump fired him. Why did Trump specifically fire him? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3896.0s)]
*  You know, I OK. So Comey is the FBI director. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3901.0s)]
*  The first time the first time they meet and Comey was the FBI director under Obama. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3907.0s)]
*  You know, so he was still there. It's not like Trump appointed him. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3913.0s)]
*  He was already the FBI director. So the first time they meet, Comey presents him with the Steele dossier. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3916.0s)]
*  And he goes, you know, just wanted to let you know, we have all of this information and all the stuff, the P the you know, and all that being involved with Russia and all of this. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3923.0s)]
*  And Trump's response to this, at least according to Bob Woodward, was was he goes, take everything you need. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3933.0s)]
*  You have access to all my campaign files, everything. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3943.0s)]
*  If there's any connection to Russia here, I want to know about it as much as you do. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3946.0s)]
*  So investigate me, which he did not have to do, which right away should have really suggested that there was nothing to this. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3950.0s)]
*  But I don't know exactly what the details of that meeting were. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3956.0s)]
*  But to me, what it read like was, you know, like what J. Edgar Hoover was the long time, you know, head of the FBI. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3960.0s)]
*  What he used to do was like so JFK, you know, wins the presidency. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3969.0s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, our of Kate Junior's father, is the is the attorney general. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3976.0s)]
*  He he comes into a meeting with with J. Edgar Hoover and J. Edgar Hoover goes, hey, listen, just want to keep you up to date on some intelligence. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3980.0s)]
*  I have these pictures of all of the chicks who your brother's sleeping with. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3988.0s)]
*  So here you go. Here's just the intelligence. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3992.0s)]
*  Just so you know, I have all of the information about all the affairs he's having. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3994.0s)]
*  And don't worry, I have backups. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=3998.0s)]
*  So anyway, so I don't know who you guys are thinking to tap for FBI director, but I'm thinking I do another time. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4000.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like that kind of deal. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4006.0s)]
*  It's like it's like a soft blackmail. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4008.0s)]
*  And it seems like there was something like that with Comey presenting all of that. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4010.0s)]
*  Like, here, look what I have. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4015.0s)]
*  And I think he kind of tried for the Steele dossier had been released publicly. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4017.0s)]
*  Yes. And so I think he was kind of like, look, here, here's what I have. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4020.0s)]
*  Here's, you know, and like kind of tried to like alpha Donald Trump. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4024.0s)]
*  And I think trying to do that to Donald Trump, like his Trump's knee jerk reaction, he's like, you know what my catchphrase is, right? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4028.0s)]
*  It's like you're fired. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4035.0s)]
*  And like, I don't think he told that to him to his face there, but I think that was ultimately kind of like what got him to fire him. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4036.0s)]
*  And that firing Comey is what set off the whole thing. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4042.0s)]
*  And, you know, but like I said earlier, they had been already investigating them knowing this was bullshit from the very beginning since the campaign. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4047.0s)]
*  And Andrew McCabe, who was the deputy the deputy FBI director at the time. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4054.0s)]
*  So James. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4063.0s)]
*  So after they fired the FBI director, he said this on a 60 minutes interview. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4065.0s)]
*  He said that basically they all sat around all the top people at the Justice Department and they considered invoking the 25th Amendment, which is, you know, getting enough of the cabinet to declare that the president is unfit to serve and removing him. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4072.0s)]
*  And that that's what they wanted to do. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4085.0s)]
*  And he said that they basically realized they couldn't get enough of the cabinet, like they couldn't get enough people to agree to that. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4087.0s)]
*  And so they they settled on Mueller. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4092.0s)]
*  They settled on setting up a special investigator. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4096.0s)]
*  And so that was that's how they got to the whole investigation. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4099.0s)]
*  And how much money did they spend on this? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4103.0s)]
*  Tens of millions. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4106.0s)]
*  I don't remember exactly how much, but it was it was a bit nice chunk. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4107.0s)]
*  But the crazy thing about it, too, is that so Mueller investigates for over two years through the midterm elections. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4111.0s)]
*  And this is the time when all you heard on the news every single day was Trump, Russia collusion, Trump, Russia collusion. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4120.0s)]
*  Let's bring on this next guest who says that Donald Trump may have been a Russian spy since 1986 and all of these different things. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4125.0s)]
*  You know, BuzzFeed publishes the Steele dossier. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4132.0s)]
*  They're all citing it and they're all talking about it. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4135.0s)]
*  And then I don't know if you remember this at the very end, it's like the last month. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4137.0s)]
*  BuzzFeed had these two reporters who ran a story that said that they had been shown proof that Donald Trump instructed Cohen, his attorney, to lie before Congress. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4143.0s)]
*  And this is a clear crime and this is going to lead with indictments of Donald Trump. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4158.0s)]
*  He's going to be walking away in handcuffs. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4162.0s)]
*  The sitting president of the United States of America is about to be indicted. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4164.0s)]
*  And Mueller's team put out a statement and they said that is this is not true. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4167.0s)]
*  That is, we have not found that in our investigation. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4173.0s)]
*  So they were willing at that point toward the very end. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4176.0s)]
*  Yes, this was the Mueller report found that Trump did not direct Michael Cohen to lie. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4179.0s)]
*  But more importantly than that is that they came they came out before the report was out and said, hey, listen, everyone's speculating about this kind of like control expectations because that's not going to happen. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4184.0s)]
*  We didn't find any evidence of that. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4194.0s)]
*  Yet they allowed for two plus years every pundit in the world to speculate about whether the sitting president of the United States had committed high treason. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4196.0s)]
*  And he never came out and said, hey, guys, that's not where our investigation is pointed at all. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4209.0s)]
*  Like, cool it with that. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4215.0s)]
*  He let everybody say that through the midterm elections and just through the first two plus years of Trump's administration. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4217.0s)]
*  Just let that hang over him, even though clearly he never had any evidence pointing in that direction at all, which is insane. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4225.0s)]
*  It's like it was like the biggest story in the history of the United States of America. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4232.0s)]
*  If it was true that the sitting president is actually a Russian agent, right? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4237.0s)]
*  There's nothing bigger than that ever. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4241.0s)]
*  But the actual story is almost as big, which is that the intelligence agencies framed the sitting president for treason and they all got away with it. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4243.0s)]
*  And this is the world we're living in right now. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4258.0s)]
*  This is the real red pill moment. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4260.0s)]
*  It's the rich men north of Richmond. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4263.0s)]
*  I want control. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4266.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4267.0s)]
*  But that's kind of I think on some instinctual level, like that's why this shit that song resonates so much with people. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4268.0s)]
*  I remember you said once I always thought this was like the best way to put it. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4274.0s)]
*  And I believe you were talking about Occupy Wall Street. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4277.0s)]
*  Now, this was years ago when that was going on. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4280.0s)]
*  And you compared them to white blood cells. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4285.0s)]
*  And you go now white blood cells maybe don't exactly understand what virus this is exactly. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4286.0s)]
*  They don't know the science of it. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4291.0s)]
*  But they know like corruption rush. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4293.0s)]
*  It's just like this kind of thing on an instinctual level. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4296.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, I think there was something to that. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4298.0s)]
*  Like with Occupy Wall Street. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4300.0s)]
*  My guess. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4301.0s)]
*  Sure. If you went down there and you talk to the average kid there and asked him like about economics or something, he might give you some ridiculous answer. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4302.0s)]
*  But they knew those big banks being bailed out was corrupted shit. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4309.0s)]
*  You know, and I think there's something about that. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4312.0s)]
*  Like people just know they're like this whole system is bullshit. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4314.0s)]
*  And they're right. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4318.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's bullshit. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4320.0s)]
*  And it's going to remain bullshit. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4321.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4323.0s)]
*  Until the libertarians take over. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4324.0s)]
*  Join the Libertarian Party. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4326.0s)]
*  Mises caucus. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4328.0s)]
*  We're going to get it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4329.0s)]
*  But even if they got into power, what are they going to do about this vast intelligence community and the influence of special interests? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4330.0s)]
*  Well, look, there's it's almost like two separate things. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4341.0s)]
*  OK, so it's like what needs to be done, you know, versus how you get it done. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4344.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4349.0s)]
*  And that's the how you get it done part is much more challenging. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4350.0s)]
*  But it's like I'd say like, you know, like if you were bit by like a venomous snake and like whatever the like antidote or something is like at the top of a really steep hill. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4354.0s)]
*  And you're like, OK, well, the answer is we have to get that and inject it in you. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4366.0s)]
*  But then the real problem becomes like, OK, but how how the hell do we get up this hill? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4370.0s)]
*  So like the answer is that all these agencies need to be abolished. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4374.0s)]
*  The answer is that like you need a drastic reduction in the size and scope of government. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4378.0s)]
*  You need to like abolish all of these three letter organizations and just start over, start over with the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4383.0s)]
*  That would be like that would be about as close to perfect as you could get. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4392.0s)]
*  However, how what you're dealing with is the most powerful entrenched interests in the history of the world. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4396.0s)]
*  The American federal government is the biggest gravy train in the history of the world, the biggest organization in the history of the world by every metric. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4406.0s)]
*  How do you roll that back? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4416.0s)]
*  That is a much that's a much more difficult question. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4418.0s)]
*  And I I think that my guess on this is like the only plausible way to do this is that you need like a mass populist movement. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4422.0s)]
*  You need and it can't be like we got 45 percent of the country who's fed up with this government. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4434.0s)]
*  It's got to be like we got 85 percent of the country and we're all together on all of this. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4440.0s)]
*  And then you need elites like you need the elites who will actually like put their power and influence and wealth behind this kind of, you know, type of movement to try to look. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4444.0s)]
*  I mean, what really has to happen is that and I think to some degree this is what happened with Elon Musk taking over Twitter. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4457.0s)]
*  You know, there's that that type of thing where you have a real elite like a natural elite to somebody who wasn't just like picked didn't just win an election but like built something insane. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4462.0s)]
*  You know, I think at least it seems to me I don't know Elon Musk at all, but it seems to me like he had a real belief that he's like he's like we're going to destroy this country. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4472.0s)]
*  Like if we don't have kind of some type of free speech platform, we're going to we're going to this is going to be our demise. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4484.0s)]
*  But I think you need enough powerful people to realize that like you want to keep this thing together, man, because you're doing great. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4490.0s)]
*  Like this isn't good for you if this whole country falls apart and we're dangerous. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4498.0s)]
*  Like we're getting dangerously close to that point. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4502.0s)]
*  And look, man, when it comes down to it, it's like the the reason why America is the most successful country that's ever existed is because it it was the freest country. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4505.0s)]
*  And that's the beautiful thing. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4517.0s)]
*  Like freedom is not only the most like moral system, but it's also like leads to the most prosperity. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4519.0s)]
*  It leads to the most harmony. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4526.0s)]
*  Like it's what civilized behavior is right. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4527.0s)]
*  Like the essence of civilized behavior is essentially the non-aggression principle, the idea that like you respect people and their property and you don't you know what I mean? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4530.0s)]
*  Like you're not allowed to just be a violent animal. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4539.0s)]
*  You have to be nonviolent and try to persuade people and trade with them. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4542.0s)]
*  That's how that's how civilization is built. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4545.0s)]
*  And America was the best at that. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4547.0s)]
*  You know, we were the best at that restraining government having free markets and the individual liberty. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4549.0s)]
*  And we need to move back toward that or we're going to die. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4554.0s)]
*  But the problem with that is that you're trying to move back toward that against people that have this desire for self-preservation and they have their own jobs and they have their position of power that they don't want to relinquish. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4558.0s)]
*  Because what would they do now? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4577.0s)]
*  What would they what do they do now? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4579.0s)]
*  You take everyone that's in all these intelligence agencies like you're no longer needed. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4580.0s)]
*  But what about the people that are needed? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4583.0s)]
*  And what about the tasks they do that are important? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4585.0s)]
*  What about the legitimate eyes on terrorism? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4587.0s)]
*  What about the legitimate intelligence they're gathering about real dangers to the United States? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4590.0s)]
*  What do you do about that? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4598.0s)]
*  Well, for the first part of it, I you know, I'm like I don't have all the answers to this. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4600.0s)]
*  But I know that like the when the when the Soviet Union fell, there were people I think to this day, but there were like people like communist like government officials who are like still collecting pensions. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4604.0s)]
*  Like they just kind of like paid him off. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4617.0s)]
*  I was like, listen, your services here are no longer needed. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4619.0s)]
*  But, you know, that's like, you know, don't revolt or anything. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4622.0s)]
*  We're not going to kill you. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4625.0s)]
*  We're not putting you on trial. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4626.0s)]
*  But like you're just you're done. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4627.0s)]
*  Take this money and go. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4629.0s)]
*  You know, you know, I would be open to something like that, you know, for some people, I do think others should be criminally prosecuted. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4630.0s)]
*  But I think that there certainly is like a role for like intelligence gathering. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4637.0s)]
*  There certainly has to be a role for national defense. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4644.0s)]
*  Now, I think in an ideal world, it would all be kind of like a voluntary private type system. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4647.0s)]
*  But in practical terms, I think that look like we it's not as if before the CIA was created, that was just like the president was just like, we have no intelligence. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4653.0s)]
*  We're just flying completely blind. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4663.0s)]
*  You know, and like what it was created to be was essentially like a newspaper for the president. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4665.0s)]
*  Like you're supposed to basically deliver. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4671.0s)]
*  Here's the news. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4673.0s)]
*  The president needs to know like the real important news. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4674.0s)]
*  And what it's become is like a paramilitary organization that starts wars and colored revolutions all around the world, lies the American people into conflict, spies on on our political leaders and presidential campaigns and all of this stuff. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4677.0s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, this just became something it wasn't ever supposed to be. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4691.0s)]
*  It was never supposed to be this thing. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4694.0s)]
*  Now. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4696.0s)]
*  And now you're really the guys who are in control. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4697.0s)]
*  And I think since Kennedy, that's kind of the thing. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4700.0s)]
*  That like that's really who's running the show here. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4702.0s)]
*  And you can't go on with that. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4705.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4707.0s)]
*  Like that has to just be scrapped. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4708.0s)]
*  Now, you know, by the way, if anyone from the CIA is listening, I'm no threat to ever actually do. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4710.0s)]
*  So we're totally cool. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4714.0s)]
*  Totally cool. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4716.0s)]
*  But there's certain people in the CIA that agree with you. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4718.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4721.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's people that are very uncomfortable with the way things go. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4723.0s)]
*  People that are real patriots that got into that job because they genuinely want to protect American interests and American people. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4727.0s)]
*  I'm sure there are. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4733.0s)]
*  There are always lots of people like that, almost in any organization. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4735.0s)]
*  You know, it is absolute power corrupts. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4738.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4741.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4742.0s)]
*  It's just this principle that's always existed. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4743.0s)]
*  Well, this is and this is the essence of why, you know, Washington, D.C. being so powerful is such a problem. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4745.0s)]
*  It's like when you have this like kind of concentrated power in D.C., it's power corrupts and absolute power corrupts. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4751.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4757.0s)]
*  It's the old Lord Atkins saying, which really does apply. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4758.0s)]
*  This is essentially why I'm a libertarian and not a leftist is that it's because I don't even on some pure levels. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4760.0s)]
*  I think I have some of the same kind of like I was a left leaning kid before I got obsessed with Ron Paul and all this stuff. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4767.0s)]
*  I think I have some of the same kind of like I was a left leaning kid before I got obsessed with Ron Paul and all this stuff. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4774.0s)]
*  But like I care about helping poor people and I don't think you should be a bigot. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4780.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4785.0s)]
*  Like I have like those kind of leftist impulses. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4786.0s)]
*  But it's just like I feel like most of like progressives and leftists, they they want to have a very powerful government that does those things. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4788.0s)]
*  And my realization is that you can never have this very powerful government without all the corruption that comes along with it. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4798.0s)]
*  Like you kind of essentially want power to not corrupt. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4807.0s)]
*  But it's going to. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4810.0s)]
*  It's just inevitable. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4811.0s)]
*  And you know when you have I mean I don't know even the exact numbers right now. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4812.0s)]
*  I think during covid I think we topped off at seven trillion dollars in total federal spending. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4817.0s)]
*  You have an organization that spends seven trillion dollars. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4823.0s)]
*  It's like that is so much power that of course everybody's going to be fighting for who gets to wield that power. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4827.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4835.0s)]
*  There's kind of it's like the Lord of the Rings thing. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4836.0s)]
*  Like the only answer here is kind of like to throw it away. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4837.0s)]
*  You know it's not that the good guy gets it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4840.0s)]
*  That's not the answer. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4842.0s)]
*  And I think that's kind of the essence of leftism. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4843.0s)]
*  Well what if the good guy could get it and then we use that power to just give everybody health care and stuff. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4845.0s)]
*  You know you're like I am it's a nice idea. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4849.0s)]
*  But let me put that ring on you. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4852.0s)]
*  And I'm not claiming I could wear that ring either. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4855.0s)]
*  I'd become evil too. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4857.0s)]
*  You know that's even like the most the nicest you know like well-meaning democratic socialist type people who some of my like person. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4858.0s)]
*  You know like I like Ben Burgess. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4864.0s)]
*  I think he's a good dude. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4865.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't trust him with that much power. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4867.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4869.0s)]
*  Like I don't there's not one of them who I think would actually be able to wield it. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4870.0s)]
*  Not only that like you're going to have people in your ear and you're going to have people that support your campaign and it's going to have people that you have you've aligned with and you've made certain deals with. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4874.0s)]
*  And it's like look and there's evil people out there in the world. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4890.0s)]
*  And they're going to be attracted to that level of power. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4891.0s)]
*  There's legitimately people out there in the world that will make decisions that will make them money and get people killed and they sleep like a baby. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4892.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4898.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4899.0s)]
*  That's hard for people to accept if you don't do that. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4900.0s)]
*  If that's not your life it's hard for people to accept. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4903.0s)]
*  But that's true. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4906.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4907.0s)]
*  There are predators amongst us. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4908.0s)]
*  And when you're not a predator it is we all do this thing where we project ourselves onto others. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4909.0s)]
*  And I think that's the essence of like how you have empathy. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4915.0s)]
*  You know like you put yourself in their shoes. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4918.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4920.0s)]
*  And think like oh well I wouldn't want that to happen to me so I won't do that to someone else. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4921.0s)]
*  But the flaw in that is that yet you it's very hard for many of us to actually put ourselves in the position of some you know like to think that like oh there's someone else who's kind of like me in some ways but will also like kill children and not lose a wink of sleep over. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4924.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4940.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4941.0s)]
*  And somehow or another feel like it's OK to do. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4944.0s)]
*  Which is very bizarre like very bizarre. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4945.0s)]
*  Very bizarre very bizarre that that's a human characteristic especially if you're not physically experiencing the death and destruction. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4949.0s)]
*  You're doing it. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4956.0s)]
*  Everything's remote. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4957.0s)]
*  And even though you know there's like a tally and you know there's. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4958.0s)]
*  Do you ever. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4961.0s)]
*  Did I ever mention. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4962.0s)]
*  I probably have one of the times I've been on but that Madeline Albright quote when she was interviewed on 60 minutes and there was this UN report. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4964.0s)]
*  This is during the Clinton years. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4972.0s)]
*  And there was a UN report that said that the because at the time like the first Persian Gulf War was over but Bill Clinton had this like massive sanction regime against Iraq and they had a total blockade around the country and made massive bombing campaigns. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4975.0s)]
*  And this is one of the things Osama bin Laden cited in his declaration of war against the US one of his list of grievances. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4988.0s)]
*  And so the UN report said that they believe 500000. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=4995.0s)]
*  Oh yeah it's pretty short you could just play it. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5001.0s)]
*  And Hiroshima. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5004.0s)]
*  Well I'm glad to bring it back a little because I missed her question. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5005.0s)]
*  We have heard that a half a million children have died. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5011.0s)]
*  I mean that's more children than died when and in Hiroshima. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5014.0s)]
*  And you know is the price worth it. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5019.0s)]
*  I think this is a very hard choice that the price we think the price is worth it. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5024.0s)]
*  It's just like a crazy thing to just say like 500000 kids have died is the price worth it. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5030.0s)]
*  Yeah we think so. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5038.0s)]
*  But I mean she did preface it by tough tough choice. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5039.0s)]
*  But yeah yeah we do. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5041.0s)]
*  And this was always kind of like my thing. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5043.0s)]
*  And this is what Ron Paul there's like what I first got introduced to Ron Paul was that moment with Giuliani in 2007 when they were having that debate. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5046.0s)]
*  And his basic argument was just like look if we're at war with these terrorists then we need at least understand what's going on here. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5053.0s)]
*  And like put yourself in their perspective from in their shoes you know. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5062.0s)]
*  How would you feel. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5065.0s)]
*  And like imagine someone was talking like this about your kids. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5066.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5070.0s)]
*  Like we've decided that price is worth it. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5071.0s)]
*  I think my response to that might be like well I've decided this price is worth it now. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5073.0s)]
*  You know like I like and and it and again it's just like the thing with Vladimir Putin it's just like it doesn't mean like obviously that that doesn't mean 9-11 was OK. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5078.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5089.0s)]
*  Like that doesn't mean like terrorism is OK. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5090.0s)]
*  It's OK that they killed innocent people. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5092.0s)]
*  It's just like if you want to understand what's going on here you have to be able to like put yourself in the in the perspective ask yourself the question how would we feel if this was done to us. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5094.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5103.0s)]
*  That's kind of that was my central point with all of the stuff with them with the war in Ukraine. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5104.0s)]
*  So just go like OK you know you're saying Vladimir Putin wasn't provoked but like what if you know what if the Warsaw Pact never dissolved in the USSR was still going. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5108.0s)]
*  And then they moved their military alliance all the way up through Britain and then into Canada you know. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5119.0s)]
*  And then they went over and you know backed a violent coup who overthrew the pro-U.S. government in Canada and put in a pro-Russian government. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5127.0s)]
*  And then we're talking about you know expanding the military alliance more and they started putting weapons in Canada. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5136.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5141.0s)]
*  You'd be like what would we think about that. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5142.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5143.0s)]
*  It's like we'd probably be like whoa this is an act of aggression. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5144.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5146.0s)]
*  This is or this is at least a provocation. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5147.0s)]
*  You know it's like it's like that that always I was always very attracted to Ron Paul's message because of that because it's like this just seems like a very basic thing to understand if you're going to understand what's going on that it's not all you can't only look at things from the perspective of your country. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5149.0s)]
*  I'd like to look at things from the perspective of people outside. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5164.0s)]
*  Well that's the real problem with getting your news from television because these are very nuanced subjects that require a lot of information to really get a full picture of what exactly caused this conflict to jump off in the first place. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5166.0s)]
*  And most people aren't getting that. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5183.0s)]
*  It's just it's a failure of mainstream news. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5185.0s)]
*  But what's cool is like you know we are living in this kind of through this revolution of all of that stuff where I genuinely don't know how much longer the corporate press will even be around if it keeps going in this direction. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5188.0s)]
*  I mean it is really wild and it's been very interesting to see both RFK Junior and Vivek Ramaswamy like on podcasts all over the place like I've had both of them on my podcast. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5202.0s)]
*  You had RFK on here like blew up the Internet. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5214.0s)]
*  It's just interesting that now they're kind of recognizing oh well there's this whole other way that people are getting information and I just I don't know how anyone could argue that just objectively. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5218.0s)]
*  It's so much if the goal is to like tell people your ideas and to educate people about what's going on. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5229.0s)]
*  It's so much better to have like hours long discussion than to go do a seven minute segment on CNN. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5235.0s)]
*  It's kind of ridiculous to ever think you could talk about any like complex idea that way. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5244.0s)]
*  And there's lots of shows like this. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5249.0s)]
*  You know I was I was watching the other day I watched Crystal and Sagar. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5251.0s)]
*  What's their show? It's Breaking Points now right? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5259.0s)]
*  Or is that the old one? No it's Breaking Points. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5261.0s)]
*  They had Chris Matthews on. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5263.0s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5266.0s)]
*  You did see it? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5267.0s)]
*  Yeah let me take a pee break and we'll come back and talk about that because it was pretty wild. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5268.0s)]
*  And we're back. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5272.0s)]
*  So Chris Matthews. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5274.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5277.0s)]
*  On Breaking Points. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5278.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5279.0s)]
*  What was it like to watch? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5280.0s)]
*  It was first off I mean I don't know he seemed like he was drunk. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5281.0s)]
*  He seemed tired. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5285.0s)]
*  Maybe tired I don't know but it's a he's also you know he's got that old Irish thing about him. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5286.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5291.0s)]
*  But it was it was pretty interesting to watch kind of the back and forth and how how defensive he got at points where Crystal was kind of asking questions that many of which I thought were very fair questions. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5292.0s)]
*  I mean I I thought part of what she was saying was insane where she was bragging about how great the government did during covid and all that stuff and I completely disagree with her on that. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5305.0s)]
*  But she was asking like very fair questions. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5313.0s)]
*  And the one that was the most interesting to me was to get a guy like Chris Matthews who was really one of the staples of cable news. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5317.0s)]
*  Throughout this whole kind of you know the last whatever 15 20 years maybe even more than that. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5326.0s)]
*  And to ask him like look you clearly are like a big critic of the populist movements that have arose like he was a big critic of Bernie Sanders a big critic of Donald Trump. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5332.0s)]
*  You know there's like but do you see any failures on on your part that led to this. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5342.0s)]
*  Like do you do you get why people are so upset with the establishment Democrats and Republicans. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5350.0s)]
*  And he seemed to have like no answer to it. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5356.0s)]
*  And that's just it's one of those things where like I think so many people in that game in the corporate press world it's like you know they like whatever they'd be like criticizing you or someone like that. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5359.0s)]
*  And you're like but do you guys ever just sit and like ask yourselves. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5371.0s)]
*  Well why is it that the people abandoned you and went over to this other you know like in this completely other direction. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5375.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you at some point I remember Tucker Carlson said this once I think it was in his book ship of fools but he was like like if your wife leaves you for like a guy you know what I mean like your wife leaves you for some guy like at first. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5384.0s)]
*  Yeah you're like screw her you know or whatever but like at some point you might like reflect on that and go like what happened there. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5397.0s)]
*  Like what did I do that you know like she wanted to leave like you know what I mean like there seems like there's none of that with them. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5406.0s)]
*  And it's it's fairly easy to figure out which is like what we've been talking about. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5413.0s)]
*  It's like oh yeah the system was so incredibly corrupt and it was screwing over regular people. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5418.0s)]
*  Well if you're if you're someone whose business is mainstream news right now especially like cable news you've got to be concerned with the limitations of your platform. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5423.0s)]
*  Because one of the things with people having access to instantaneous video now whether it's YouTube or rumble or whatever it is is like you can instantly get things on your phone and there's no need to be sitting through all these commercials. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5433.0s)]
*  There's no need to be tuning in at a specific time. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5448.0s)]
*  There's no need to have something like unless you have TV or whatever it is a DVR you can't pause it and rewind it. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5451.0s)]
*  You can't stop it to go take a piss like what. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5459.0s)]
*  Yes like why do it that way there's just a superior way. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5462.0s)]
*  What world are you guys living in. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5465.0s)]
*  You're living in a bizarre world where you're using 1990s ideology when it comes to like how you broadcast things and you're interrupting things every five minutes. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5467.0s)]
*  So it's impossible to have an in depth discussion where people aren't under tremendous pressure. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5479.0s)]
*  And also you're having a lot of these discussions. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5486.0s)]
*  You're not even there with them physically. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5490.0s)]
*  You're in remote locations and there's several people talking over each other and everyone's just trying to get a big sound bite. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5492.0s)]
*  And then you cut to commercial and like what did you do. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5499.0s)]
*  And you're just not it. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5502.0s)]
*  And in that environment everything is very shallow. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5504.0s)]
*  Yeah and very kind of like on the surface. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5507.0s)]
*  And so you know it's like well what what led to the rise of Donald Trump as a political figure and it's like racism and Russia or whatever. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5509.0s)]
*  And you're like yeah but that's not come on man like that's not really getting at what happened here. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5517.0s)]
*  Like why is it that this guy's anti establishment message was so popular. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5521.0s)]
*  It resonated so much with tens of millions of Americans. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5526.0s)]
*  And then and I think you can if you just look at just the 21st century alone and you look at kind of like the elites that are in charge of society. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5530.0s)]
*  Every society is going to have elites. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5539.0s)]
*  That's just the way things work. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5541.0s)]
*  You may not like that but that's just the way things work. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5542.0s)]
*  Every sector has elites everything. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5544.0s)]
*  That's how human beings are. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5546.0s)]
*  But what have the elites like given the American people in the 21st century. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5549.0s)]
*  It's like OK well we got like we got 9 11. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5554.0s)]
*  We got we got two 20 year catastrophe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5558.0s)]
*  We got that all culminated in the worst financial crisis in 100 years in 2008. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5566.0s)]
*  You know in response to that. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5574.0s)]
*  So the Federal Reserve another organization that should be abolished but they do a good job of keeping data. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5576.0s)]
*  So they according to the Federal Reserve it was like between 2007 and 2010 the average American lost 40 percent of their net worth 40 percent of their net worth evaporated. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5582.0s)]
*  And if you can just like imagine imagine what it's like if you're like you got you know like you got two kids and you're making like 70 grand a year. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5596.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5609.0s)]
*  Kind of like the average person you lose 40 percent of your net worth. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5610.0s)]
*  You're like I mean it's terrifying. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5615.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5619.0s)]
*  And so and then the response to that from Barack Obama when he got in was what they called the Obama recovery. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5620.0s)]
*  But the Obama recovery was basically created by lowering interest rates to zero and jacking up government spending to the highest levels it had ever been. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5626.0s)]
*  And so they have a recovery on paper. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5635.0s)]
*  But who really benefits from an environment where you have crazy high government spending and zero percent interest rates are well the zero percent interest rates benefit the walls the Wall Street speculators because now everyone's got to speculate in order to make any money on their money. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5638.0s)]
*  You can't just save your money because you're making nothing. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5654.0s)]
*  So you have to kind of gamble it in the Wall Street casino. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5656.0s)]
*  So Wall Street gets filthy rich off this and then the high government spending it's like everyone connected to D.C. made a ton of money. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5659.0s)]
*  So it was great for them. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5667.0s)]
*  But for the Rust Belt it wasn't great. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5668.0s)]
*  That's why that's why so many of those same areas that voted for Obama went for Trump. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5670.0s)]
*  He was talking about bringing their jobs back and like you know what I mean. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5674.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5677.0s)]
*  And it's like you put yourself in the perspective of these people who like I don't know like like his son died in Iraq. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5678.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5685.0s)]
*  Or maybe one of his kids came back a mess from this war that they now admit we never should have fought to begin with. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5686.0s)]
*  It was all bullshit. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5692.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5693.0s)]
*  You're you're you lost your job in 08 and now you have some crappier job than you've ever had before. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5694.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5699.0s)]
*  Maybe you got another kid who's like addicted to opioids or something like that because there's a whole epidemic of that going on. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5700.0s)]
*  And like then this guy came in and told you he cares about you. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5705.0s)]
*  He's going to win for you. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5710.0s)]
*  It's big billionaire motherfucker said I'm going to win. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5711.0s)]
*  Bring your jobs back. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5714.0s)]
*  It's like it's not such a mystery why they went for that guy and why they rejected the entire corporate media who had been basically lying to them for. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5715.0s)]
*  You know for the last 20 years. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5723.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5725.0s)]
*  And then like there was never just like it was almost like Crystal was like asking Chris Matthews do you have a moment. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5726.0s)]
*  Can you think about this at all. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5733.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5735.0s)]
*  And he was just completely like shut off to even like entertaining what failures of the establishment might have led to this new populist moment that we live in today. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5736.0s)]
*  Well they have like a big moment where she was talking about taxing the rich. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5745.0s)]
*  Yeah I think she was wrong about all that stuff. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5749.0s)]
*  Yeah she was she was talking about how you know we during the pandemic certain acts were passed that essentially eliminated childhood famine. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5751.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5763.0s)]
*  Yeah she was making some credit about some she was making some point about the child tax credit or something like that. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5764.0s)]
*  The problem with all that and I think I think crystal ball and a lot of the left wingers are just out to lunch on this stuff is that like listen to the people who are going to be in the [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5770.0s)]
*  during Covid 2020 and 2021 were like the absolute worst years for regular Americans. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5779.0s)]
*  It's not like the government did something that really made everything wonderful. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5788.0s)]
*  It was terrible. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5791.0s)]
*  And in the midst of that what the what the government really did in its response was give crumbs to people while giving trillions to like big corporations and big banks. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5792.0s)]
*  So objectively that's what happened. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5805.0s)]
*  The trillions and trillions of dollars that they spent that year the vast majority of it went to big business. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5807.0s)]
*  So this idea that like that and of course you know she can talk about the the the spending and how like OK you can say the spending well it helped for the people who got the money. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5813.0s)]
*  It's like yes. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5825.0s)]
*  And then they had to feel the inflation from all of that. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5826.0s)]
*  But the childhood tax credit right. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5828.0s)]
*  What was what was the benefit of that. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5830.0s)]
*  There is some tangible benefit of that. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5832.0s)]
*  Oh I 100 percent agree. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5834.0s)]
*  You know listen to any extent that you're giving out tax credits I'm all for that. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5835.0s)]
*  So yeah you know people with kids have you know less money to pay in taxes. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5840.0s)]
*  I think that's great. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5844.0s)]
*  I think the Covid response of anything should have been to you know I'd say abolish the income tax. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5845.0s)]
*  You know there you go. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5854.0s)]
*  If people can't work. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5855.0s)]
*  Well listen I mean that doesn't solve the problem that people can't work but for working people that would give them enormous relief. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5856.0s)]
*  And then you know of course all these other things is like it's a result of the lockdowns that now you've kicked all of these people out of work. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5862.0s)]
*  So now the argument is like well we have to give them something. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5869.0s)]
*  But the real answer there is that we never needed to do the lockdowns to begin with. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5872.0s)]
*  The real problem is that it really reinforces the tin foil hat brigade because then you say they're trying to weaken America and they're doing this on purpose. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5875.0s)]
*  The lockdowns were on purpose. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5883.0s)]
*  The reason why they're doing this is not political. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5885.0s)]
*  It's not for for optics is they're trying to destroy the country by destroying the middle class and destroying small businesses destroying restaurants. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5887.0s)]
*  And then he's just like yeah but maybe I mean I don't blame. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5896.0s)]
*  I blame them for making it look like that's what they're trying to do. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5901.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5905.0s)]
*  It's like you're making it seem like this is a big conspiracy. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5906.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5909.0s)]
*  So maybe stop doing that. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5910.0s)]
*  And then like it won't there won't be so much attraction for conspiracy theorists which I will admit sometimes get pretty nutty and you're like yeah I don't think you can really prove any of that. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5912.0s)]
*  But you I understand why when the government is so corrupt and they lie so much and they screw over average Americans so much it it leads to an environment where conspiracies spread. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5921.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5936.0s)]
*  So and then the other thing is that there are like a lot of really legitimate conspiracies that really are conspiracies. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5937.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5942.0s)]
*  You know I mean it's pretty clear that there was that I mean we have the emails like we know like Fauci conspired to kill the lab leak story like they conspired to kill the Hunter Biden story. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5943.0s)]
*  These are conspiracies. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5954.0s)]
*  And so you know again it's like by you know analogy of like it's like if I heard Sam Harris said recently on a podcast that he said something on he goes and he was being critical of you and RFK I think and Brett Weinstein and he said like he goes well these guys are over here talking about how bad the MRNA vaccine is how bad covid restrictions are but I'm trying to sail where I understand that like we're losing trust in these institutions. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5956.0s)]
*  But we also need institutions that we can trust. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5985.0s)]
*  And my thing is almost it's like the analogy of the if you're cheating on your wife and your wife catches you cheating on her and then you go you know your response is like you know the real problem here is that there's not trust in this marriage and we need a marriage with trust. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=5988.0s)]
*  And it's like yeah yeah no the real problem is that you cheated. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6005.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6009.0s)]
*  The problem is that you lied. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6011.0s)]
*  That's why there's no trust. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6012.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6013.0s)]
*  Like it's not like I'm fine with the the theoretical argument that like we need institutions we can trust like yeah yeah that'd be great. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6014.0s)]
*  That'd be great if during a pandemic there were a bunch of medical experts who could get us accurate information be honest and spread that information around and so sure. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6020.0s)]
*  But the problem isn't that we just don't trust them. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6030.0s)]
*  The problem is that they're lying and we caught them red handed and then that led to a bunch of people going like well how long have they been lying. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6032.0s)]
*  You know they're lying about this when were they honest and then the more you look into it you're like oh shit they were all. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6039.0s)]
*  They've been lying for a really long time. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6043.0s)]
*  And so to turn around and then blame that on the you know the problem here is just that we don't have trust. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6045.0s)]
*  Like no that's actually a solution. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6050.0s)]
*  That's a step in the right direction if you don't trust these motherfuckers. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6052.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6056.0s)]
*  COVID cracked a lot of people. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6058.0s)]
*  Yeah it sure did. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6060.0s)]
*  It really did it exposed people that just it's very unfortunate. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6061.0s)]
*  Trump did a lot too and then COVID really took it to the next level. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6065.0s)]
*  But it's you know it's interesting you learn a lot about who people really are how things really work you know how much it's like a like a stress test. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6070.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6080.0s)]
*  You know I have a bit about this in my new special by the way which was just released yesterday on YouTube. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6081.0s)]
*  Go check it out please. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6088.0s)]
*  But it's like it's like COVID was like a stress test you know like you throw a crisis at something and you see like you see how strong it really is what's the constitution of it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6089.0s)]
*  And it exposed a lot. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6098.0s)]
*  You know we had some weaknesses. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6099.0s)]
*  Yeah exposed a lot in people that they don't want to admit it exposed them because they keep digging themselves deeper and deeper into these holes trying to find ways that they were right. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6101.0s)]
*  And you see a lot of that online you see a lot of that on Twitter. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6111.0s)]
*  Well it's like so many people that are just trying to reinforce what their previous statements regardless of whether or not they're easily disproven now at this point. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6121.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing is when you encounter people who are still hanging on to the arguments that the regime itself has already abandoned. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6123.0s)]
*  You know what I mean like they're not even making that argument anymore. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6132.0s)]
*  Like Fauci is not even saying this and then people will say these things you know. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6134.0s)]
*  I see people still get it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6138.0s)]
*  It's it's only a pandemic of the unvaccinated. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6140.0s)]
*  You know say like like like just regular people like online like Fauci ain't saying that anymore. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6142.0s)]
*  Even he knows like we're abandoned. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6147.0s)]
*  But then people you hear it enough and they and they believe it. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6149.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things with all this stuff. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6152.0s)]
*  It's part of how propaganda works. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6155.0s)]
*  I guess like the big lie type deal that if you just repeat something often enough it does stick with a lot of people. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6157.0s)]
*  Oh there's a there's a certain percentage who it's just like yeah but I heard that a lot. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6163.0s)]
*  So there must be something to it. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6167.0s)]
*  And it's a disturbing amount of smart people smart people that are just unwilling to admit it. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6169.0s)]
*  There's a disturbing amount of smart people smart people that are just unwilling to go outside the boundaries of the ideology. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6175.0s)]
*  There's a thing that you're supposed to say and they say it so you don't get attacked. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6182.0s)]
*  And it just like everybody's like yeah thanks for saying that. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6186.0s)]
*  Yes and then there's also a weird reaction like it's like people get into binary thinking a lot. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6189.0s)]
*  They want to put everything into a neat box. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6194.0s)]
*  Like I remember I tweeted something about the Sam Harris like when he when he had that clip. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6196.0s)]
*  And I just the amount of response I get where people who are agreeing with me but they go they'll say things like they're like this guy is such an idiot. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6203.0s)]
*  And you're like no no no no he's not. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6210.0s)]
*  That's kind of the whole interesting thing here. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6214.0s)]
*  It's like no he's not dumb. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6216.0s)]
*  But he's a really brilliant neuroscientist or whatever a neurologist whatever he is like he ain't dumb. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6218.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6225.0s)]
*  And like that's kind of more fascinating actually. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6226.0s)]
*  It is that you know like wrong and stupid are not synonymous. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6229.0s)]
*  Right. Like there's there are two very different things. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6233.0s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6235.0s)]
*  Michael Mallis has that line where he goes he goes it's much easier to train a smart dog. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6236.0s)]
*  And so like the idea is almost like sometimes even being very intelligent makes you more susceptible to propaganda. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6243.0s)]
*  Like it's easier to kind of like train the intelligent. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6252.0s)]
*  I think the real problem is ego. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6255.0s)]
*  The people don't ever want to admit they were wrong. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6257.0s)]
*  That's a big part. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6259.0s)]
*  We were talking about this last night about the importance of not being married to your ideas. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6260.0s)]
*  Your ideas are not you. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6264.0s)]
*  They're just ideas and that you have to recognize when you're holding on to ideas because you have made this connection that you have said this thing and this thing is a part of you. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6266.0s)]
*  And if you say that this thing is incorrect then you failed. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6279.0s)]
*  You're wrong. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6282.0s)]
*  And you're you're not as good as you. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6283.0s)]
*  So you try to find a way where you were good and you try to find a way where you can kind of manipulate language and maybe even maybe even fucking change the information. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6286.0s)]
*  Like let's imagine if the information was different. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6301.0s)]
*  Let's imagine if 10 percent of the people die. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6302.0s)]
*  Yeah. But they didn't. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6306.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you're if your argument is reduced to like OK you made this point and you were right and I made this point and I was wrong. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6307.0s)]
*  But imagine a situation where your point was wrong. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6314.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6317.0s)]
*  And my point was right. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6318.0s)]
*  How about now. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6319.0s)]
*  Yeah let's not imagine that. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6320.0s)]
*  Let's let's let's just go with what actually happened. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6322.0s)]
*  And you should be apologizing. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6324.0s)]
*  Yeah it's like we could play your imagination game in a few minutes. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6326.0s)]
*  But first let's just talk about like what really happened. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6329.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6331.0s)]
*  And who was right and who was wrong. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6332.0s)]
*  And how are you discounting this 40 percent increase in all cause mortality or whatever the fuck it is. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6333.0s)]
*  What is it now. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6340.0s)]
*  You know it depends upon the statistics that you read. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6341.0s)]
*  But what it's like they're getting that from insurance companies right where they're they're they're trying to make an assessment of like what's going on. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6344.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that are very nervous about this because what is what is the increase in all cause mortality right now. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6353.0s)]
*  I think it's like you know 18 59 or whatever the fuck it is. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6361.0s)]
*  There's some very bizarre. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6365.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6369.0s)]
*  And I heard Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to say well a lot of people are drinking during the pandemic like really. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6370.0s)]
*  Was there another thing that happened to write that may be really crazy. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6376.0s)]
*  Do you imagine if so many people sort of drinking there was a 40 percent increase in all cause mortality. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6380.0s)]
*  Wouldn't there be like shows about alcoholism like ladies and gentlemen like look at what's happening to our country. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6385.0s)]
*  Is a 40 percent. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6392.0s)]
*  Imagine there was no pandemic. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6393.0s)]
*  There's no vaccinations. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6395.0s)]
*  Imagine all of a sudden a 40 percent increase in all cause mortality. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6396.0s)]
*  And then you just kind of casually say well I guess a lot more people are drinking now. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6400.0s)]
*  And you're just not. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6404.0s)]
*  And you're telling me. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6405.0s)]
*  And look I'm not even like ruling out the fact that OK I think alcohol consumption maybe went up during the lockdowns. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6406.0s)]
*  That could be a contributing factor to this. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6411.0s)]
*  But you're telling me the starting point has to be we rule out this brand new like medical intervention. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6413.0s)]
*  You can't look at that. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6421.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6422.0s)]
*  You're telling me that's the starting point is that can't be part of the conversation. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6423.0s)]
*  You're trying to ignore this thing. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6427.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6428.0s)]
*  Imagine if these were just variables in an equation that you were tasked with solving. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6429.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6434.0s)]
*  Why would you ignore this very significant variation. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6435.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6439.0s)]
*  And then the truth is like whatever the whatever the rate of vaccine injury is like whatever whatever that number is. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6440.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not that high. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6450.0s)]
*  It's something. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6451.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6452.0s)]
*  It is clearly something. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6453.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6454.0s)]
*  There are there are all there are clearly have been a large number of people who have been injured by the vaccine. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6455.0s)]
*  And then when you look at that and you go look and you guys your position the entire establishment position was everyone should get it. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6469.0s)]
*  Everyone should get it when there were clearly cases where you really don't have an argument you know like a healthy young person who's already had covid. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6470.0s)]
*  There's just no argument that they should take on whatever that risk is for something that won't even prevent them from getting covid again. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6477.0s)]
*  Right. There's no argument for that. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6483.0s)]
*  But you enforce that on them. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6484.0s)]
*  You know you enforce like I know I knew this this kid who's like in grad school and he got double vaccinated because they were going to kick him out of school if he didn't. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6486.0s)]
*  And then he got covid and then a month later they insisted he get a booster like there's no there is no expert on the planet who can give me a compelling scientific. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6496.0s)]
*  You know reason why that made any sense at all. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6506.0s)]
*  While you were doing anything other than to this 26 year old kid making him take on serious risk. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6509.0s)]
*  Nothing better. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6515.0s)]
*  And you and you insisted on this. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6516.0s)]
*  So now like it's just crazy that you can't even acknowledge that. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6518.0s)]
*  Like yeah we did give people like very in many cases very bad medical advice that had the potential to lead to them being injured. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6531.0s)]
*  And in many cases did. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6532.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6533.0s)]
*  And no accountability. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6534.0s)]
*  And even I mean it was one of the craziest moments of the entire pandemic was when you had Gupta Dr. Gupta from CNN on here. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6535.0s)]
*  Then he goes are you going to get vaccinated and you went no just had covid. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6543.0s)]
*  Why would I get it. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6547.0s)]
*  And he really had no answer. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6548.0s)]
*  And this was during the vaccine passport time when they were trying to force everyone to get it. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6550.0s)]
*  And yet here was the CNN doctor and had no response other to you that you know yeah you got pretty good immunity. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6555.0s)]
*  Maybe get some more with the vaccine. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6562.0s)]
*  You know not only that it was just like he had to admit that the immunity that was imparted by overcoming an infection is better. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6572.0s)]
*  So you didn't get covid I got covid I recovered. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6573.0s)]
*  I'm in a better position than you now. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6576.0s)]
*  And you're telling me to do what you did. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6578.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6580.0s)]
*  Why. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6581.0s)]
*  And that the policy of the vaccine passports is that he can enter a restaurant that you're not allowed to enter. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6582.0s)]
*  When we all agree that you are in a better position than him. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6588.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6591.0s)]
*  How does that make any sense. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6592.0s)]
*  Because I didn't comply and I'm a bad boy. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6593.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6595.0s)]
*  That's basically it. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6596.0s)]
*  That's literally what it is. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6597.0s)]
*  Like you should be a good guy and join our team. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6598.0s)]
*  You know and I had smart people that I respect tell me I should get vaccinated after I got over covid. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6600.0s)]
*  I'm like are you not paying attention to any of this. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6608.0s)]
*  Like what why we why you give me that advice. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6612.0s)]
*  First of all imagine if someone got something and they got sick and they got over it. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6614.0s)]
*  And then saying you can't do it that way. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6620.0s)]
*  You should do it another way. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6622.0s)]
*  And you have to do it our way. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6623.0s)]
*  And you got over it very quickly. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6624.0s)]
*  Very quickly. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6626.0s)]
*  It's not like you were like hospitalized or something. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6627.0s)]
*  Dude I did 10 rounds on the bag six days after I was infected. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6628.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6632.0s)]
*  Ten rounds just to see what it felt like. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6633.0s)]
*  Felt great. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6635.0s)]
*  Felt like zero impact. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6636.0s)]
*  I felt like shit for a day. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6639.0s)]
*  And it's so I mean I know like we've I think we mentioned this before when I was on. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6641.0s)]
*  But like it was one of the episodes that I was on was back in the height of it. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6645.0s)]
*  I don't know like three times ago that I was out here. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6651.0s)]
*  What was the one that went to Fauci responded to you. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6653.0s)]
*  And the thing that they found appalling was that your advice to young people was to be really healthy. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6657.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6663.0s)]
*  That you were like listen get yourself in really good shape like exercise a lot. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6664.0s)]
*  Eat well get a lot of sunlight if you can. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6667.0s)]
*  If you can't take vitamin D. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6669.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6670.0s)]
*  They were upset that I was saying if you're a young person you're like 21 years old or whatever don't do it. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6672.0s)]
*  I don't think you need to do it. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6678.0s)]
*  I would tell them. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6679.0s)]
*  I wouldn't advise you to get the vaccine. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6680.0s)]
*  I'd tell you just be really healthy. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6683.0s)]
*  But that was at the time we actually knew the statistics of how it affected young people. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6684.0s)]
*  And at the same time Fauci was going door to door. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6690.0s)]
*  And what he was telling people was you got to take this vaccine. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6694.0s)]
*  And when they'd give him pushback and say yeah but I heard you can still get covid even after you take the vaccine and he'd say in the unlikely event that you get it it's going to be so mild you won't even know you were sick. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6698.0s)]
*  Just lying to them. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6710.0s)]
*  And that's not like oh he got it wrong. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6711.0s)]
*  There was no scientific evidence to like argue that they never even tested it on transmission. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6713.0s)]
*  When you go over the trials that they did when they first were investigating the efficacy of this drug one of the people in the covid group that got the vaccine died of covid. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6719.0s)]
*  So they knew that. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6732.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6734.0s)]
*  Two people in the placebo group died of covid. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6735.0s)]
*  That's 100 percent. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6741.0s)]
*  That's how they came up with the fact. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6742.0s)]
*  It sounds so crazy and I didn't believe it when R.F.K. Junior was saying it. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6744.0s)]
*  I didn't believe that that was accurate. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6748.0s)]
*  But then he actually sent me the real paperwork and you read it and you go wow that's really what it was. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6750.0s)]
*  There was two people that died in the placebo group. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6757.0s)]
*  One person died in the vaccinated group and two is 100 percent more than one. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6759.0s)]
*  So that's how it's 100 percent effective in stopping death. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6765.0s)]
*  And so I this guy Tom Woods. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6769.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard of Tom Woods before. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6772.0s)]
*  He's a brilliant historian. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6774.0s)]
*  He does a podcast called The Tom Woods Show. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6775.0s)]
*  Great guy. Good friend of mine. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6777.0s)]
*  And he was like one of the loudest anti lockdown voices back when the lockdown started and like put did a great job of like putting together all the data and all the arguments on how this isn't actually working. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6778.0s)]
*  And it's like an insane policy and then was solid on the vaccine and all that all the way through. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6790.0s)]
*  So he told this story. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6795.0s)]
*  It was in like his newsletter that he writes which was very interesting to me kind of like demonstrated the whole like we're trusting the institutions as so he was at. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6797.0s)]
*  I don't know. I think he's in his 50s. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6807.0s)]
*  So he was at a doctor's appointment he said and his doctor was like oh you know because your age or whatever you can get the shingles vaccine now. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6810.0s)]
*  So I'd recommend you get it. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6819.0s)]
*  It's 87 percent effective against shingles. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6820.0s)]
*  And he was basically saying any time before the last three years I would have just gone OK you know I trust I trust my doctor because I say OK sure I don't want to get shingles so I better take this vaccine. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6823.0s)]
*  But now he goes I'm forced to go well how did you come up with this number. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6834.0s)]
*  Is it like the ridiculous way you came up with the covid vaccine number. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6838.0s)]
*  So like no I'm not going to take that because now I have to go and actually look into this and that's kind of I think where a lot of people are like that's where I am. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6841.0s)]
*  Yeah. I would have always assumed that like I don't know if my doctor's telling me this. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6849.0s)]
*  He's done his research. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6854.0s)]
*  He wouldn't just be telling me this without having looked into it. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6855.0s)]
*  He knows better than me about this field. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6858.0s)]
*  So I'll tell you now I never trusted the CDC or you know what I mean. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6859.0s)]
*  Like I always knew government entities were corrupt but I figured my local doctor would kind of like not just recommend something to me. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6863.0s)]
*  And that was a big thing that covid exposed that oh even that guy well and I got an arguments with my kids pediatrician over this. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6870.0s)]
*  I had clearly done more research than he had. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6877.0s)]
*  Like I knew shit that he didn't know and he's recommending this to my kids you know which was insane. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6880.0s)]
*  But that's where like a lot of people are at now. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6887.0s)]
*  Well they're financially incentivized and that's where it got spooky. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6890.0s)]
*  They financially incentivized people to mark deaths as covid deaths. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6894.0s)]
*  They financially incentivized initially people putting up getting them put on ventilators. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6899.0s)]
*  There was a lot of financial incentives that went into this and I also wasn't aware you know embarrassingly so that most hospitals are just private businesses. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6905.0s)]
*  I never thought of it that way. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6916.0s)]
*  I thought of a hospital's got to be like something that's set up entirely to make people better and that's all they care about. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6918.0s)]
*  There's not they're not trying to make money. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6925.0s)]
*  You know and it's not and it's even worse than just like private businesses because they're private businesses in this heavily corrupted regulated field. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6927.0s)]
*  You know so even like down to like certification of need legislation where they're half you kind of have to get approved by other hospitals in order to open a hospital. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6935.0s)]
*  So they like kind of keep their competition out and then they try to like make as much money as they can. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6945.0s)]
*  Yeah it's like it's all very corrupt and very weird. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6951.0s)]
*  He's crazy like you know how it is with like these territories. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6954.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah it's like it's like mafia shit almost like yeah you can't you think you're opening up a hospital here boy I don't think so. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6958.0s)]
*  Take it it's so there's all this shit that just makes the whole thing very corrupt and of course the whole insurance system is very corrupt where it's this like very phony market of prices. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6964.0s)]
*  Yeah where like you're never seeing anything and these prices are marked up super high so like the doctors in the hospitals can make money and the insurance companies get reimbursed but then they charge you in your premiums. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6976.0s)]
*  So you're totally removed from what the costs of things actually are very very corrupt field and it's it's it's insane because it's like yeah you're like dude this you're helping sick people. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6987.0s)]
*  Isn't this like why you went into medicine is like to to help people. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=6999.0s)]
*  It all gets corrupted by money. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7004.0s)]
*  Yeah and power money and power. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7006.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7008.0s)]
*  But the money thing is so spooky. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7009.0s)]
*  Financial incentives to get people to take medication that they might not really need. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7017.0s)]
*  And probably shouldn't take. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7018.0s)]
*  And you know god damn I mean if nothing else I really think it's great that RFK is at least like getting a conversation started on a lot of this stuff because it seems like almost nobody else was going to bring up this stuff. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7019.0s)]
*  You know I one of the things that I thought was really interesting about the the the when you had him on the podcast and that created like a huge you know like storm and then there was the thing with the Hotez guy refusing to come on and debate him when you offered. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7029.0s)]
*  I think the pot was up to like two million dollars or something like that. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7045.0s)]
*  And it's like it's funny how these guys from like the medical establishment who have been wrong about just about everything throughout this pandemic. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7049.0s)]
*  I mean there were I don't know if you saw any of the compilation videos that were made of that Hotez guy going around just like at every phase getting everything wrong throughout this. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7057.0s)]
*  But then still has the nerve to be like this guy's spreading misinformation and it's dangerous and all this refusing to come have a conversation with him. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7064.0s)]
*  But you're like OK so so here's RFK Jr. and he's going look America has the highest rate of chronic illness in the world. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7071.0s)]
*  OK autism spikes through the roof in the last few decades and he's his argument to me sounds that this isn't just that we started diagnosing autism like because 50 percent of autistic kids never develop language. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7082.0s)]
*  We would have known this like we may not have called it the right thing but we would have noticed people who don't develop language you know. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7096.0s)]
*  And so he's going so we have the highest rate of chronic illness in the world. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7102.0s)]
*  We have autism shooting through the charts and he's going look here are some potential culprits for that. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7106.0s)]
*  And so OK if you think that's all crazy like OK but but what is it. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7112.0s)]
*  What is going on here. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7116.0s)]
*  Because in the American political conversation this never comes up. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7118.0s)]
*  Nobody's ever bringing this up. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7122.0s)]
*  I cannot think of a presidential candidate who's ever mentioned once that this is a thing right. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7124.0s)]
*  You know that never comes up on CNN that no one wants to talk about it. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7128.0s)]
*  So like at least he's talking about like that seems by the way I haven't really ever been talking about that. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7132.0s)]
*  I don't know what the answer to any of it is. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7137.0s)]
*  I never even someone should be bringing that up. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7139.0s)]
*  I never even thought it was a possibility until the pandemic until I read his book when I read the real Anthony Fauci I was like wait wait what did they do. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7141.0s)]
*  What did they do during the AIDS crisis. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7153.0s)]
*  Because that's what's important that it's not just about what's happening right now. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7155.0s)]
*  It's about what they did when they pushed AZT through. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7159.0s)]
*  Yeah it's about what they did when they were they were injecting these foster kids with these experimental drugs and they died like that. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7162.0s)]
*  All that stuff is true and it's fucking terrifying. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7171.0s)]
*  And this is why Hotez won't come on. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7175.0s)]
*  This way he won't come on with RFK. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7179.0s)]
*  Because he he knows that this guy can go chapter and verse and he's not like you can kind of push him on defending his claims. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7180.0s)]
*  But then he gets to push you on all this stuff. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7190.0s)]
*  You know and I don't even know Hotez was directly related to that. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7191.0s)]
*  But I know he's in bed with that whole establishment like he got funding from you know what I mean like all the same groups and stuff. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7193.0s)]
*  And like it's like OK so this is this is who you're working with. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7199.0s)]
*  These are the talk talking points that you're parroting. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7203.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7205.0s)]
*  And it's just it's all. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7206.0s)]
*  The guy doesn't take vitamins doesn't exercise eats junk food and he take post pictures of him getting the RSV vaccine. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7207.0s)]
*  It's like OK buddy. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7216.0s)]
*  That's the way to do it. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7218.0s)]
*  He got the RSV vaccine. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7221.0s)]
*  Posted a photo on Twitter. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7222.0s)]
*  But he has it limited now. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7223.0s)]
*  The only people he follows can respond. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7225.0s)]
*  So it's just like he's got this like little echo chamber he's got going on in his tweets now. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7229.0s)]
*  Post me inviting him to have a debate with R.F.K. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7235.0s)]
*  Dude the thing that drove me crazy about that was that then he turned it around and started playing the victim and going you know like Joe Rogan led this this harassment campaign against me and all these people on Twitter all day are like you know like I'm being demonized by this whole group. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7239.0s)]
*  And you sit there and you go like yeah you know as an unvaccinated person I have no idea what that's like. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7256.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7261.0s)]
*  I have no idea what it's like for you to like you know what I'm saying. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7262.0s)]
*  Not only that it's bullshit because he said I had neo-fascist leanings. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7265.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7268.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7269.0s)]
*  He'd been on the podcast twice. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7271.0s)]
*  And I've fucking chatted with the guy like like he knows I'm not a fucking fashion like what are you saying. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7272.0s)]
*  You don't believe that you're saying something you don't really believe and you did it without like mentioning me like with the at mention. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7278.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7285.0s)]
*  And I was like this motherfucker like a neo-fascist leanings. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7286.0s)]
*  You're telling me that the guy who is pushing forced vaccinations on behalf of giant private pharmaceutical companies is calling you a neo-fascist. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7291.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7301.0s)]
*  Do you have any idea what these terms even mean and who's being the fascist here and who's not. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7302.0s)]
*  Well that's why I did it and even then I didn't insult him. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7307.0s)]
*  I'm very careful about that. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7311.0s)]
*  I don't do I don't like to engage in that kind of shit online. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7312.0s)]
*  I don't think it's healthy for anybody. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7317.0s)]
*  Even if I have bad feelings towards a person I don't know I'm not going to insult them like that. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7322.0s)]
*  And there were easy there were easy shots to go after with the guy but it's good. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7323.0s)]
*  I didn't insult him when he was on my podcast he was telling me about his fucking diet. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7326.0s)]
*  I didn't insult him. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7331.0s)]
*  It's like especially when I mean the contrast between me and him physically like someone who really does take care of themselves and then being lectured by someone who doesn't. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7344.0s)]
*  That the only way around that is vaccines. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7345.0s)]
*  There's only one way is this one solution to this problem this very complex problem called the human immune system. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7356.0s)]
*  And 80 percent of the people hospitalized for covid were obese or something like that. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7357.0s)]
*  Something like comorbidities the people that died like some large number like more than 70 percent had four plus comorbidities. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7361.0s)]
*  If I remember correctly it was like something like 50 percent had four comorbidities or more and then like 95 percent had at least one. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7371.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7381.0s)]
*  I mean it was basically like all the almost all the covid deaths were very sick people. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7386.0s)]
*  And so like you would think yeah maybe that should at least be part of the conversation. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7387.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7390.0s)]
*  And by the way for people that like to cherry pick shit here no one is saying covid was nothing. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7391.0s)]
*  No one no people say oh you're saying that coval was nothing and the vaccines were bad. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7398.0s)]
*  Nope. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7404.0s)]
*  Not saying that I never said that. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7405.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is it's really bad for people that are sick already for sure. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7408.0s)]
*  People that have weak immune systems it was really bad. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7414.0s)]
*  But don't pretend that everyone's the same. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7417.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7419.0s)]
*  So I would say that covid if you were covid was a nasty virus and if you were very older and and or very sick you really did not want to get this thing especially the early strains of it. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7420.0s)]
*  You really did not want to get this thing. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7433.0s)]
*  And I think that there is an argument that early on if you were very old and very sick and had never had covid that maybe it did make sense for you. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7436.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7449.0s)]
*  To get the vaccine. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7450.0s)]
*  I think it did make sense. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7451.0s)]
*  You know a lot of people have offered some level of protection initially. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7452.0s)]
*  So there was other things they could have done as well. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7455.0s)]
*  Sure. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7457.0s)]
*  But but just because it makes sense for that one group you cannot extrapolate from that now that it makes sense for every group. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7458.0s)]
*  And the ones that are the most obvious would be like if you're like a young healthy person who's already had covid. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7464.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7469.0s)]
*  Because in that case no it doesn't it just doesn't make sense for you. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7470.0s)]
*  Not only that these same people that are pro vaccine anti doing anything else. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7473.0s)]
*  Where is your outrage about this lab leak. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7479.0s)]
*  Where is your outrage about the source of this thing. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7483.0s)]
*  Why are you upset at the people that are getting sick or the people that choose not to do some sort of experimental medical intervention and choose to try to survive it just with natural immunity and do so. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7487.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7502.0s)]
*  Where is your outrage about the source of this thing which is the whole reason it happened in the first place why people were forced to make these choices to take this experimental vaccine that the whole thing was about this. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7503.0s)]
*  Was about this one virus that got released that clearly seems to have some connection to gain a function research that was funded by Fauci. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7516.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7525.0s)]
*  And funded by the NIH. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7526.0s)]
*  At the very least the lab was clearly funded by subsidiaries of the NIH. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7527.0s)]
*  Clearly. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7532.0s)]
*  But that's that's just factually true. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7533.0s)]
*  The lab was funded by subsidiaries of the NIH and it looks overwhelmingly like that's where it looks like originated. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7534.0s)]
*  It also looks like they tried to cover it up for a very specific reason. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7543.0s)]
*  And they clearly tried to cover it up and Fauci clearly had his guys writing papers about how it couldn't be from the lab that they've all had to kind of retract now because it's like it wasn't actually a scientific argument. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7546.0s)]
*  They just wanted to dead this story. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7556.0s)]
*  And that Fauci was the guy who signed off on the exception that Obama had basically banned gain a function research and that Dr. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7558.0s)]
*  Fauci himself was the one who signed off on you know for the first SARS thing for this being an emergency use. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7568.0s)]
*  And so he had so a lot of blame falls at his feet. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7575.0s)]
*  And then you go like oh this kind of explains in a different way why this guy was so willing to be out there saying no this is the only solution this is the only thing to focus on. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7578.0s)]
*  This is what we have to do. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7588.0s)]
*  It's like oh yeah because you actually have a lot of culpability in this whole thing. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7589.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7594.0s)]
*  It's creepy. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7595.0s)]
*  It just sucks. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7597.0s)]
*  It sucks to be a fucking human being right now having to navigate all this shit like what are these people that aren't you or me and not most people. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7598.0s)]
*  What what the fuck are they doing. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7607.0s)]
*  What the fuck are they doing in every single realm of this conversation. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7610.0s)]
*  What the fuck are they doing. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7615.0s)]
*  Not one group not one person is doing something that's you go oh I like that. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7617.0s)]
*  This is a good step in the right direction. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7626.0s)]
*  The right way to do it like they had to fucking be forced out of the lockdowns. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7627.0s)]
*  It had to be a situation where they were like realized look you can't sustain this forever. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7631.0s)]
*  We have to go back like people kicking and screaming. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7636.0s)]
*  Well meanwhile in some places like Florida and Texas they never did anything. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7640.0s)]
*  They stopped. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7645.0s)]
*  We stopped very quickly. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7646.0s)]
*  Very quickly. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7647.0s)]
*  Few weeks of OK lockdown and OK what's really going on. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7648.0s)]
*  Let's look at the actual data. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7652.0s)]
*  Sweden who didn't do lockdowns had the lowest excess mortality in all of Europe. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7653.0s)]
*  You know there's just like like clearly this that didn't work. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7659.0s)]
*  And yeah dude there's just there's a thing right now again I'll mention again I think this is something that that kind of Richmond north of Richmond like I think this is why that song caught so much fire is like that there's there's a really large group. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7663.0s)]
*  I don't know if we're a majority. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7676.0s)]
*  I think we are a majority of the country but a large enough group that you're talking about like at least like a hundred milkin like people in this country who like just don't want to do this. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7689.0s)]
*  And I mean that in a lot of different ways like we don't want to keep fighting wars everywhere around the world like we're over that why are we always looking for another war to fight. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7690.0s)]
*  Can we have five years with no war. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7698.0s)]
*  Is that like too much to ask. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7700.0s)]
*  Like literally can we just put a few years together where we're not involved in a mass murder campaign somewhere. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7701.0s)]
*  You know we don't want to go back to covid restrictions we don't want to live that way we want to like raise our kids and do what we do and like you know what I mean like enjoy our lives. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7706.0s)]
*  We don't want to like indoctrinate children with this insane gender ideology you know what I mean like we don't want that and there's there's a large percentage of us and yet the it's it's being forced you know like we're being forced to live in this world and for the most part I think it's like most of the people in this group just kind of want their freedom like you know like I don't care so much what other people like if you want to go live a different way. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7714.0s)]
*  That's fine if you guys want to all go do lockdown somewhere fine. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7743.0s)]
*  There's like don't force us into this and at least what I think is the positive out of that is that like there are a lot of people who are really serious about it and I think I think there was something really positive about the Bud Light boycott thing and the target boycott thing where it's like there's got to be we have to have some mechanism by which we can actually do it. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7747.0s)]
*  By which we can actually like give a black eye to one of these powerful organizations who are trying to force something on to you that you don't want you know what I mean and it seems like oh that actually maybe kind of worked a little bit maybe they will back off with that you know what I mean at least in those areas. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7771.0s)]
*  I think that's what people were trying to do that elect Trump. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7790.0s)]
*  That's I think that's what they were trying to do. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7791.0s)]
*  They were trying to say like this is different. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7792.0s)]
*  This is I don't like what you guys do. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7795.0s)]
*  This is different. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7797.0s)]
*  This guy's outside of it. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7798.0s)]
*  He knows how it runs. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7800.0s)]
*  Yeah maybe he's got his own problems but at least he's different. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7801.0s)]
*  He's different than this thing that you're going to keep doing forever and ever and ever. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7804.0s)]
*  And man does he piss you off. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7808.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7809.0s)]
*  And he pisses off the people who you're furious at. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7810.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7812.0s)]
*  And he goes this is a big this is a big black eye for you. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7813.0s)]
*  This is like really like oh man the guy who you told you look so stupid now because you told everyone he couldn't possibly win. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7815.0s)]
*  We had this end of the world podcast in 2016 at the Comedy Store live podcast during the election and then afterwards it was a lot of fun. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7823.0s)]
*  But afterwards we were all in the back bar watching Jake Tapper have to sort of like solemnly declare that Donald Trump looks like he's going to be the president of the United States. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7832.0s)]
*  You know it's and it's not it's it's very clear that they're upset with this which is interesting because like the why isn't the news supposed to be the news. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7845.0s)]
*  Right. Like this is this is winning. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7857.0s)]
*  This is how he won. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7859.0s)]
*  Looks like he won Iowa. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7861.0s)]
*  He won this won that. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7862.0s)]
*  Look he's the new president. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7863.0s)]
*  OK. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7864.0s)]
*  So now we have the new president is Donald Trump. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7865.0s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7867.0s)]
*  It wasn't that it was just like this solemn moment where these people had to eat crow. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7869.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7874.0s)]
*  It's like I there was a lot to that. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7875.0s)]
*  I mean look part of the thing is just that Trump was determined it was determined by the powers that be. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7878.0s)]
*  You know the corporate media the deep state all of the establishment that he was unacceptable. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7884.0s)]
*  And that's not new to Donald Trump. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7889.0s)]
*  There were a lot of candidates who have been determined to be unacceptable. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7891.0s)]
*  Ron Paul was was unacceptable. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7894.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders was unacceptable. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7896.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard was unacceptable. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7898.0s)]
*  And you saw like the machine be weaponized against all of them to keep them out. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7899.0s)]
*  But Trump beat the machine. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7904.0s)]
*  The difference is Trump won. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7905.0s)]
*  I mean there's other differences but but the guy who they determined was not acceptable ended up winning. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7907.0s)]
*  And part of what was so powerful about that is that it kind of destroyed the the illusion of inevitability that I think progressives rely on. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7912.0s)]
*  That you know like progressives will very confidently tell you that you're on the wrong side of history. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7925.0s)]
*  You know which is like a really interesting thing to say if you think about it like you're on the wrong side of history. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7930.0s)]
*  Mean like it's a guarantee that history is moving in my direction and I'm telling you how you will be judged in the future based off how you feel right now. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7936.0s)]
*  And they kind of have good reason to feel that way because they have been kind of moving in the direction that they want to move in. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7946.0s)]
*  But it was just like we just had the first black president and now we will have the first female president. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7951.0s)]
*  And of course you know this throwback bigot male chauvinist Donald Trump could never possibly win. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7957.0s)]
*  Like this is what's going to happen in history now is Hillary Clinton is the next president. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7964.0s)]
*  How are they not happening. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7968.0s)]
*  How are they going to stop him from winning again. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7970.0s)]
*  I they're trying. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7972.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7975.0s)]
*  That's what all these indictments are right now. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7976.0s)]
*  The problem is it has the opposite effect on his base. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7978.0s)]
*  It doesn't make people reluctant. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7983.0s)]
*  It makes people more convinced that there's a conspiracy against him. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7985.0s)]
*  It makes people more convinced that there's corruption that's fighting against him. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7989.0s)]
*  I think personally that Trump was at his most vulnerable within the Republican primary at the very beginning. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=7993.0s)]
*  But he for the first time to me he seemed like he was very out of step with his own base. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8003.0s)]
*  He's sitting there still bragging about Operation Warp Speed and how he saved hundreds of millions of lives by developing the vaccine. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8008.0s)]
*  He was getting booed a few times at his own speeches. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8015.0s)]
*  He just seemed kind of out of touch and it seemed like you know it seemed like the energy of his campaign wasn't 2016 which was Make America Great Again. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8020.0s)]
*  This was like my vengeance tour. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8030.0s)]
*  They screwed me. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8032.0s)]
*  I lost but I really won. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8034.0s)]
*  We're going to I'm going to come back and win again. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8036.0s)]
*  And it seemed to me like that wasn't really connecting. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8038.0s)]
*  And then you know before DeSantis got in the race but it was heavily speculated that he would be getting in the race. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8040.0s)]
*  And you know he was like this guy who has a very good record on covid at least compared to all the other governors just about all the other governors. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8044.0s)]
*  And there just seemed to me like there was an opening there. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8051.0s)]
*  There was like a vulnerability. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8054.0s)]
*  And then they raided his house in Mar-a-Lago. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8056.0s)]
*  And I felt like that that guaranteed Trump frontrunner like that that guaranteed it for him because as soon as they did that it was like oh now it's like it's it's shifted right back to this like look what they're doing to your guy. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8058.0s)]
*  They want to not give you the chance to vote for this guy. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8070.0s)]
*  They're going to weaponize the justice system against this guy because you like them. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8072.0s)]
*  They're not and they're doing it to him because they want to do it to you. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8076.0s)]
*  It kind of gave him like all this energy back. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8079.0s)]
*  And so there's a real dynamic to that where his numbers go up every time a new indictment comes out. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8081.0s)]
*  People aren't buying into it because it's not like you know like it's just so obvious that it's politicized. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8086.0s)]
*  The interesting thing there's an interesting thing about the law like people have this conception of what the law is and then there's the reality of it like people have this conception of like there's a rule written written down on a piece of paper. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8092.0s)]
*  And that's the rule. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8104.0s)]
*  If you break that rule you broke the law. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8106.0s)]
*  If you don't break that rule you didn't break the law. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8107.0s)]
*  But that's not really how it works. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8109.0s)]
*  It's like in the same way like down to the lowest level if you get pulled over by a cop you know there's times where he could give you a ticket or he could let you off with a warning you know and like sometimes it's just how that guy feels. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8111.0s)]
*  Maybe he knew you. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8121.0s)]
*  Maybe he goes oh shit Joe Rogan I'll let you off with a warning. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8123.0s)]
*  You know what I mean like there could be so many different factors. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8125.0s)]
*  Well like just for example okay so James Clapper you know he was the director of national intelligence. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8128.0s)]
*  He was basically the head of the shadow government. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8135.0s)]
*  That's the highest position in the deep state. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8138.0s)]
*  You're that the CIA answers to you. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8141.0s)]
*  You know you oversee the CIA and the NSA and the FBI and all this stuff. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8143.0s)]
*  And he lied to Congress very blatantly like no question about it. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8147.0s)]
*  He was asked point blank. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8153.0s)]
*  Is the NSA involved in any bulk data collection on American citizens said no we're not doing that. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8154.0s)]
*  Then Ed Snowden came out and exposed that he clearly was and he was the DNI like he knew this. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8161.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8166.0s)]
*  He lied to Congress. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8167.0s)]
*  Why isn't he arrested for it. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8168.0s)]
*  It's like because there's no political will to arrest that guy. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8170.0s)]
*  He's of the deep state. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8172.0s)]
*  He's one of the top guys that he's not getting arrested. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8174.0s)]
*  Now Michael Cohen lied to Congress. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8176.0s)]
*  He got a month wrong when he was talking about a deal that he was working on for Trump. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8178.0s)]
*  He said it happened in June but it was really in January or something like that. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8183.0s)]
*  He got charged with that and because they wanted to put pressure on him to get him to flip on Donald Trump which he did. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8187.0s)]
*  So that's it's not like there are crimes that are committed all the time. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8193.0s)]
*  There's just no political will. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8198.0s)]
*  There's no desire to arrest that person. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8199.0s)]
*  And I think the thing that's wild about this with Trump is that if you think of all the crimes that presidents have committed the idea that this is what one of them is actually going to go down for is insane. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8202.0s)]
*  Like Bush instituted torture. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8215.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8217.0s)]
*  Obama murdered American citizens without charges. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8218.0s)]
*  These guys lied us into wars. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8222.0s)]
*  By the way every war is illegal. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8224.0s)]
*  The Supreme law of the land is the Constitution and it says only Congress can declare war. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8226.0s)]
*  The last declared war was World War II. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8231.0s)]
*  Every war since then has been an illegal war. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8234.0s)]
*  Anyone could be arrested for this at any time. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8237.0s)]
*  The legal defense is that they're military actions not wars. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8240.0s)]
*  You know that thing in Vietnam. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8245.0s)]
*  It probably smelled like a war to you but no not a war. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8246.0s)]
*  Korea wasn't a war. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8248.0s)]
*  Iraq wasn't a war. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8249.0s)]
*  Afghanistan Libya Syria Somalia Yemen none of those were wars. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8250.0s)]
*  You know it's anyone if there was any political will any one of these presidents could be arrested for for any number of crimes. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8254.0s)]
*  And yet they're not. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8262.0s)]
*  But yet Trump didn't give back the classified information quickly enough even after they asked him. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8263.0s)]
*  Oh he's got to he's got to be indicted for that. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8269.0s)]
*  Even though other presidents have done pretty much the same thing. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8272.0s)]
*  No he's got to be indicted for that. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8274.0s)]
*  What is the Georgia thing is interesting because he was going to have a press conference where he's going to reveal all the information that proves that he was telling the truth about the Georgia election being rigged. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8275.0s)]
*  Yeah he didn't have the press conference. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8289.0s)]
*  Yes. Well this is a thing that I got to say is a kind of knock on Trump here that you know this is a thing his lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani who just turned himself in into custody today. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8291.0s)]
*  But they they would always say this after 2020. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8303.0s)]
*  We have proof that millions of votes were stolen from Donald Trump and will be releasing this soon and then it just never kind of comes. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8306.0s)]
*  So I don't know what he thinks he's going to tell us about that. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8313.0s)]
*  The issue with the thing in Georgia where I will grant there's like a little bit of a gray area there and I think that look it's there. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8316.0s)]
*  There is a gray area there. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8325.0s)]
*  It's kind of like when they impeach Trump over Ukraine there was like a little bit of a gray area of like what exactly he did. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8326.0s)]
*  It's just that when you look at things of all the crimes that presidents commits the idea that you go after a president for this it's so petty compared to these greater crimes. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8332.0s)]
*  But like he kind of he called the secretary of state in Georgia and was kind of like I need you to find me these votes. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8341.0s)]
*  But he was saying he was like look there's been fraud. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8348.0s)]
*  I know there's been fraud. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8350.0s)]
*  You got to go look for it. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8351.0s)]
*  I don't see any evidence that there's fraud here and he's like find it. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8352.0s)]
*  I know there's fraud. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8355.0s)]
*  You know he was putting pressure on the guy to go look. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8356.0s)]
*  But it's not as if he was telling the guy I need you to commit fraud. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8360.0s)]
*  Right. He wasn't telling him I want you to flip votes or I want you to manipulate something. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8364.0s)]
*  He's like I want you to go find where the fraud is. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8367.0s)]
*  Right. Because I see you'd almost have to prove that he didn't really believe that. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8370.0s)]
*  Right. In order to prove you know because if there was really fraud he has every right to tell the guy to go find it. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8374.0s)]
*  So now so now they're arguing that he did it and in the indictment they argue that he knew it and he was like he knew that there was no fraud but was still trying to get the guy to go find it. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8379.0s)]
*  And the case that they're using to argue that is that he had advisors around him who told him that the election was legit. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8392.0s)]
*  The problem with that is that that doesn't prove at all that Trump believed those guys just because they told him that. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8400.0s)]
*  If there's one thing I'm fairly confident in I believe Donald Trump believes he won the election in 2020. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8406.0s)]
*  Yeah my position has always been we all have to agree that election fraud is not zero percent. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8412.0s)]
*  It's not zero and everyone agrees to that. Do you think there's any election fraud at all. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8421.0s)]
*  Yeah probably at some level there's probably some campaign workers that have a vested interest in one party or another like a lot of these people that are working in these election offices are very biased. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8426.0s)]
*  Right. They're very politically active and they're probably not agnostic in their political beliefs. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8441.0s)]
*  They're probably pretty steadfast in that this is whether it's Republicans or Democrats that this is the guy that I want. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8446.0s)]
*  And if there is a way where you you know you're getting some votes from a particular county that might be blue or a particular county that might be red and you can fuck around and you're some person who really believes you're on the right side of history. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8454.0s)]
*  Especially with like how white hot politics are now at the moment where people who you know hate Donald Trump hate him so much. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8472.0s)]
*  Look at this a sampling of recent election fraud cases from across the United States. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8479.0s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation's election fraud database presents a sampling of recent proven instances of election fraud from across the country. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8484.0s)]
*  Each and every one of these cases in this database represents an instance which in which a public official usually a prosecutor thought it's serious enough to act upon it and each and every one ended in finding that the individual had engaged in wrongdoing in connection with an election hoping to affect its outcome or that the results of an election were sufficiently in question and had to be overturned. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8492.0s)]
*  So look at this. So it says here there's one thousand four hundred and thirty eight proven instances of voter fraud. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8519.0s)]
*  One thousand two hundred and forty criminal convictions forty eight civil penalties one hundred and eight diversion program judicial finding official finding. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8529.0s)]
*  OK so it's showing that there's at least it's not zero. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8540.0s)]
*  Right. And that you could argue in a country as big as ours wouldn't even be that bad if that's all there was. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8544.0s)]
*  But those are just the proven cases. So then you're left to wonder how many people go away. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8551.0s)]
*  Right. How many go unproven. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8555.0s)]
*  And we don't know exactly what that answer is. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8557.0s)]
*  But my thing is more like I think if you zoom out and you just say OK what was the year that was 2020. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8559.0s)]
*  Well OK coming into 2020 Donald Trump is the president. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8567.0s)]
*  He's he's presiding over what is he would describe as a white hot economy where there was very low unemployment. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8572.0s)]
*  There were there were certain tangible things he could point to and say look this has really worked out for the economy. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8583.0s)]
*  Is that because of the policies of the Obama administration about they were coming to fruition or is it because of direct changes that he made. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8590.0s)]
*  So I would say a mix of both. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8598.0s)]
*  But I would argue that it was kind of a bubble economy still and that it was still propped up off very low interest rates and very high government spending and that you can make things look good on charts when things are like that. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8600.0s)]
*  But I would argue that he hadn't really fixed like the major underlying problems in the economy. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8612.0s)]
*  But he did have some pretty significant deregulation in the energy sector. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8618.0s)]
*  He did pass some very significant corporate tax cuts and I think those things were very good for business. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8622.0s)]
*  So kind of a mix of both. But you have that's the starting point of 2020. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8629.0s)]
*  Donald Trump bragging you know he brag about the lowest African-American unemployment the lowest Latino unemployment and how great the economy was and how he's doing all these great things. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8635.0s)]
*  He was poised to have an excellent shot at being reelected. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8644.0s)]
*  And then you have the economy destroyed by government imposition. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8648.0s)]
*  Like even if you think the lockdowns were the right things to do the fact is that through state governors decided we're tanking our economy like we're closing down our economy. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8654.0s)]
*  And then you had a summer full of the biggest riots of my lifetime which were sponsored not only financially where you had big powerful groups paying bail for rioters to get out of jail but also just backed completely backed by the entire economy. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8665.0s)]
*  Completely backed by the entire corporate press. You know this is the voice of the unheard fiery but mostly peaceful just making every excuse for these rioters going on in almost every major city across the country. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8683.0s)]
*  During this whole time anybody who wanted to speak out against this was often censored for doing so if you wanted to speak out against the lockdowns or against Black Lives Matter any of this stuff you might lose social media you might lose your job. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8694.0s)]
*  Mass a bigger censorship campaign than we've really ever had before. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8708.0s)]
*  This is all going on that year and then they announce that we are overhauling the way we do elections. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8712.0s)]
*  And for the first time we're letting everyone vote by mail not just the absentee ballots for like military personnel but everyone can just vote by mail now a way that we were never okay with doing it before because we would have been very concerned about fraud. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8719.0s)]
*  But now we're all going to do that. So in this like revolutionary year we're overhauling how we do everything. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8732.0s)]
*  And then you have the thing with the Hunter Biden laptop story being censored. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8739.0s)]
*  And then the result is that Joe Biden wins the election. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8743.0s)]
*  Given all of those factors there's just no conceivable way that an overwhelming majority of Trump voters weren't going to feel like this thing was stolen. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8747.0s)]
*  Just look at all the fundamentals of what happened that year. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8758.0s)]
*  And even if you really really don't like Donald Trump how could you look at all those fundamentals and not go okay I see where that I'd see where with all of that that was fertile soil for belief that this thing was stolen from them. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8776.0s)]
*  You know. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8777.0s)]
*  It was a pretty crazy thing. And the problem the thing and I think we're past the point of no return on this for better or for worse is that even if you think Donald Trump committed all of these crimes and that it's right for them to bring down all these indictments at least [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8778.0s)]
*  acknowledge that this is it's kind of over for the right half of America to ever believe in this process again because the way they're going to look at this is like oh look you wouldn't give him a fair shot again. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8792.0s)]
*  Like once again you wouldn't just let him have a fair shot. You wouldn't just let the American people vote which is so if you believed in democracy if you believe in this country if you believe in trying to unite us in any way wouldn't it be so obvious at this point like it's not as if every one of the charges. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8804.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is being faced with is like some novel legal theory where they're twisting a statute to try to make him guilty of this crime. It's a very gray area at best. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8820.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you just go look we're going to have a national referendum on this in November. Let the American people decide which side or you know what I mean which side are they on of this and then we could give this democracy thing a shot and see who wins. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8828.0s)]
*  But if you do it like this then basically the entire right half of America now doesn't believe this game is real anymore. They don't really believe they're in a democracy where they get to pick who they want to vote for because they're like no we picked this guy and you screwed him out of it. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8841.0s)]
*  By the way I'm not saying that's a bad thing maybe it's better that they don't believe in the system anymore because the system is bullshit. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8855.0s)]
*  Richmond north of Richmond. That's right. I want total control. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8863.0s)]
*  Great song. It's a great song. It's just bizarre that this conversation doesn't happen more often. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8870.0s)]
*  This this kind of like open laying out of the basic facts of what happened because it's all just narratives. It's all just left wing talking points and right wing talking points and just so much confusion so much noise. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8875.0s)]
*  Yeah and like there's it's weird because everyone does get so dug in. I do think like one of the advantages I have of like at least I think personally of like thinking about all these things is that I'm not on a team like I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8898.0s)]
*  I'm not like I base my basic view is that all these politicians are criminals you know and like and so I'm not like at least I try my best to be like let me understand what's happening here. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8913.0s)]
*  I'm more or less I'm on the side of the American people and against the American political class you know like that's kind of my bias if anything. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8926.0s)]
*  But it's just people get so dug in that they're just going to jump to their points that will shape their narrative. The truth is that look what happened like January 6th say look what's easy to put in the rear view mirror that everybody's kind of forgetting about is that they were boarding up Washington D.C. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8932.0s)]
*  Washington D.C. and not out of concern of Biden winning you know like they were boarding up all the stores in downtown Washington D.C. because they were scared of Trump winning right. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8949.0s)]
*  They were scared people are going to riot and there would have they would have people were celebrating in the streets in New York City that were ready to riot. Yes you know and like so the thing is that there OK January 6 happened when Biden won but a whole bunch of rioting and stuff would have happened if Trump had won. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8960.0s)]
*  The truth is that the country was just at a point that no matter what happened there it it was going to be somewhat ugly. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8976.0s)]
*  If I was if Trump wins in 2024 the way I would I would legitimately think if you looked at how it went down it's almost better for us as the American people to see all the steps that they did to interfere with the public narrative of who he is and the election. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=8985.0s)]
*  Whether it's the Hunter Biden laptop thing or the Russia collusion thing it's almost better for us to see that naked and then also see them push Biden through Biden get in and see what a disaster it is. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9008.0s)]
*  It's I think it's better to see if I was in Trump's camp I would say look this is other than the indictments and all this all the crazy it's actually better this way because now people have a real understanding that at least some of the things that he was saying are accurate. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9023.0s)]
*  The witch hunt thing accurate the the Russia collusion bullshit. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9038.0s)]
*  It's all it's accurate like and no one is admitting that and people see it and they know it and it scares the shit out of them. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9043.0s)]
*  It scares the shit out of them that they just want to continue doing this to us and if they're doing if they did it with a Hunter Biden laptop thing what else what else are they doing it about. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9053.0s)]
*  What about what it's also and I think for for people like us I think it's it's hard to exactly understand because you're also talking about the Donald Trump supporters are are generally speaking not our our demographic exactly like it's there are different type of people you know like we're not like lifelong Republicans conservative. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9061.0s)]
*  You and I are not but although we do get labeled right wing. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9083.0s)]
*  Yeah but that's just bizarre reason that's all just stupid you know what I mean like that's that's ridiculous but like they say like the tea party type people or the conservative Republican type people are different like like I'm like a Jewish kid from Brooklyn New York raised by a single mom. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9086.0s)]
*  I'm just a culturally but a different thing than most of them are and you know and you are like a dip you were raised by like hippies in California right like it's a different thing than went to Boston like you're not like it's just culturally different. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9103.0s)]
*  But these people like the ones who went to the tea party like these conservative Republicans these were the people who like carried around pocket constitutions with them you know what I mean like they really believed in the system in a much different way than than people who have more. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9117.0s)]
*  Of a liberal background ever did you know these were people who like believed in country God law and order you know what I mean like these and for them I think it's a whole different thing to see that these institutions were poisoned against their guy and that they're all corrupt. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9132.0s)]
*  It's truly like whoa this is this is like a devastating thing I think it's disillusioning in a very powerful way that's tough for a lot of us to understand when they see that you're like you're telling me the FBI was framing the president because they loved the FBI they were the biggest defenders of the FBI these are the guys who would stand in line with them as recently as when George W. Bush was president right not like that long ago right you know and so I think a lot of this was. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9150.0s)]
*  It was very it was very revealing for them so I remember it which was I always made me laugh but as thing Sean Hannity said at some point during the Russia gate thing and he goes he goes for the first time in American history the FBI has been politicized. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9180.0s)]
*  Yeah that like that summed up almost the conservative view of it you know what I mean that it's like but this is it yeah actually the entire history of it has been this but okay I'm glad at least you're waking up now to the fact that this wasn't just like oh no these are the good guys you know it's not that simple. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9194.72s)]
*  Isn't it wild too that Hoover was just such a freak yeah he was a freak cross-dressing fucking psychopath. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9215.72s)]
*  But the fuck can. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9222.72s)]
*  Got all the dirt on everybody and did want to have the dirt on him. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9223.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9226.72s)]
*  Because he was dirty. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9227.72s)]
*  And had a lot of that but that's like it's like when you're and also you got a picture of this like being in like you know like the 1930s or 40s or 50s or whatever you know that in his whole reign. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9228.72s)]
*  Like cross dressing back then. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9237.72s)]
*  It was a lot worse than what cross dressing like that's real dirt you know and so if you're doing that. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9239.72s)]
*  Cross dressing now will get you in the Biden administration. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9244.72s)]
*  Oh Christ you're going to guarantee promotion. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9247.72s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's that Sam Britton psycho. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9249.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9251.72s)]
*  But back then it was like so you know right away he was like I need a lot of dirt on everyone else. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9252.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9257.72s)]
*  Because if anyone finds out about this. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9258.72s)]
*  Also there had to be like some guilt aspect that made doing dirty things even more exciting. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9260.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9267.72s)]
*  Because you know that you're like supposedly exposing that and other people but you're guilty of it yourself and you're out there. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9268.72s)]
*  And women's shoes. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9275.72s)]
*  And yeah. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9277.72s)]
*  And also just like you know spying on civil rights leaders. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9278.72s)]
*  And encouraging them to commit suicide. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9282.72s)]
*  The letter that they sent to Martin Luther King. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9284.72s)]
*  And they sent his wife an audio tape right of I think they sent him an audio tape of him like having an affair or something. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9288.72s)]
*  They did some crazy shit. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9294.72s)]
*  Crazy shit. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9295.72s)]
*  But that and it's interesting too that like it because it kind of represents the whole transformation. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9297.72s)]
*  Like in the 20th century there's this real transformation of like what the United States of America's federal government is. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9303.72s)]
*  And J. Edgar Hoover was there for a really interesting part of that with the FBI where they start off as just this like basically there was no [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9310.72s)]
*  constitutional authority for a federal police. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9317.72s)]
*  So they kind of start off as like they're like basically have like a pad of paper and a pen. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9319.72s)]
*  Like you can go around and ask questions. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9324.72s)]
*  They didn't have guns. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9326.72s)]
*  They didn't have arresting power. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9327.72s)]
*  They had like nothing. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9328.72s)]
*  And then by the end of his term it's the fucking FBI. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9329.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9332.72s)]
*  Like what we know today. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9333.72s)]
*  But that's kind of like the story of America. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9334.72s)]
*  It's a very it's a really fascinating story where we start as the smallest most restrained government in the history of the world. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9336.72s)]
*  There's no other experiment like it. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9344.72s)]
*  You know it's like the government is the whole Constitution is basically telling the government what it can't do. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9346.72s)]
*  You know and then like dividing these powers. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9352.72s)]
*  And then we have the Bill of Rights which is like all basically you know Congress can't do this. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9355.72s)]
*  Government can't do this. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9360.72s)]
*  You can't do this. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9361.72s)]
*  You can't do like this the whole thing is basically telling the government what it can't do. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9362.72s)]
*  And so we have this experiment in limited government. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9365.72s)]
*  And if you look at like the period between the end of the Civil War and like 19 let's say let's say 1865 to 1912 you have this period where it's probably the largest experiment in a free market capitalism in human history like the America. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9368.72s)]
*  The federal spending was nothing. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9390.72s)]
*  It was like 2 percent of the national income. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9392.72s)]
*  There you had no income tax had no central bank no federal regulation is just like very free market conditions and it builds up like the richest most powerful government in the history of the world. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9395.72s)]
*  And it's so rich and powerful compared to every other country that then they can kind of get away with like all right well now we go to the progressive era like let's let's have an income tax. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9408.72s)]
*  And they go but and the way the income tax was sold in 1913 1914 1914 I believe was they go well listen this is only going to apply to like the richest people and it'll only be like one or two percent of their income. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9418.72s)]
*  You know we'll just take a little bit from them and help the little guys out. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9430.72s)]
*  That's how it starts and grows and grows and grows and they have the Federal Reserve grows and grows and grows and then you get into World War One and now you have the security apparatus growing and then there's World War Two you know and then it grows and you know there's the depression in between World War One and World War Two. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9432.72s)]
*  And what does that mean well that means we need a new deal we need more government we need more regulation you know then you get into World War Two we create the CIA we create all of a sudden you have like this deep state forming drop two nukes on Japan. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9446.72s)]
*  Now we're the bad motherfuckers we run the world you know what I mean and then just more and more and more you come back home it's like in the 60s they have like the real rise of like the great society the welfare state and just all this shit that would start it as the smallest government ever. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9457.72s)]
*  Just balloons and balloons and balloons and now you have it and it's the biggest government in the history of the world and that's like where we're at now went from this experiment and tiny government to this experiment in the biggest most powerful government in human history. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9472.72s)]
*  And some people think the solution to our problems to expand it. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9485.72s)]
*  All right. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9488.72s)]
*  Wild is so wild wild. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9490.72s)]
*  I'm looking at the J. Edgar Hoover. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9493.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9495.72s)]
*  Cross-dressing thing is it fake. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9496.72s)]
*  It might be fake. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9497.72s)]
*  Really. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9498.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9499.72s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9500.72s)]
*  I'm looking at the movie. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9501.72s)]
*  Ah. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9502.72s)]
*  I'm looking at the movie so it must be real. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9503.72s)]
*  The story came from one person who said she saw him somewhere. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9505.72s)]
*  Wasn't there photos? [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9508.72s)]
*  Nah there's no photos. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9509.72s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9510.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9511.72s)]
*  Was that all? [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9512.72s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9513.72s)]
*  It might be made up. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9514.72s)]
*  It says it might be this lady was trying to sell the story to Esquire for a while and then someone printed it in a biography about him in 1972. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9515.72s)]
*  So how did they put it in the movie? [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9521.72s)]
*  There's a lot of rumors about his relationship I'll say with an aide of his. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9523.72s)]
*  Well he was always single right? [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9529.72s)]
*  But they don't know what was going on with it. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9530.72s)]
*  So he's a very private person. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9531.72s)]
*  This is just like what happens with myth and gossip. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9533.72s)]
*  Someone might want to talk shit about him and it got printed and all of a sudden it's her. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9536.72s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9540.72s)]
*  Well whatever he's spied on MLK and now we're all going to call him a cross-dresser. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9541.72s)]
*  Cross-dressing psychopath. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9544.72s)]
*  This is more fun if he's a cross-dresser. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9546.72s)]
*  It says he went to a restaurant with his friend in a skirt. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9548.72s)]
*  The other guy was in a dress. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9551.72s)]
*  The hostess wouldn't let him in and it almost sounds like that doesn't sound believable to me. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9552.72s)]
*  Yeah I don't buy he went to a restaurant like that. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9555.72s)]
*  That seems sus. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9558.72s)]
*  This said he saw him at a private party at the New York Plaza Hotel. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9559.72s)]
*  It was a big orgy. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9562.72s)]
*  How many of those are real? [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9564.72s)]
*  So we know Epstein's Island is real. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9566.72s)]
*  And I used to think that was fucking insanity. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9569.72s)]
*  Alex Jones was telling me about that over a decade ago. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9572.72s)]
*  They compromise people on this island. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9575.72s)]
*  They get them go there. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9578.72s)]
*  These are the hot girls. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9579.72s)]
*  They look hot but they're 16. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9580.72s)]
*  He was telling me this whole thing. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9583.72s)]
*  I was like what? [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9585.72s)]
*  The thing about Alex Jones is that he'd always have this method of like he throws a lot of shit at the wall. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9586.72s)]
*  They're turning the frogs gay. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9593.72s)]
*  When that one turned out to be right too. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9594.72s)]
*  Or more or less kind of right. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9596.72s)]
*  Maybe trans, whatever the frogs are. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9597.72s)]
*  It's doing something. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9599.72s)]
*  Changing their sex. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9600.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9601.72s)]
*  By the way, the thing is that there's too many people who are like Alex Jones was right. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9602.72s)]
*  And there are a lot of things he was right about. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9607.72s)]
*  But there's also a ton of things he was wrong about. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9609.72s)]
*  That he'd just say with certainty. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9611.72s)]
*  And I have the information. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9613.72s)]
*  I have all this. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9614.72s)]
*  I'm like none of this is true. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9615.72s)]
*  I remember right after 9-11 he was going into this thing about how we're going to get into a nuclear war because Iran already has the nukes. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9616.72s)]
*  And they're going to use them. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9624.72s)]
*  And he had this whole thing about how he goes Iran has nuclear weapons. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9625.72s)]
*  I have the documents to prove this. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9628.72s)]
*  We've got the sources off the record. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9629.72s)]
*  But none of that was right. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9631.72s)]
*  But then there's like the thing that he's right about. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9633.72s)]
*  Like being right about the Epstein Island thing is so fucking crazy. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9636.72s)]
*  So wild. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9640.72s)]
*  So wild. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9641.72s)]
*  But he was also right about Bohemian Grove. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9642.72s)]
*  Yep. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9644.72s)]
*  That's people forget about that. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9645.72s)]
*  I mean he was in Bohemian Grove in like the 90s when they filmed all that. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9647.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9652.72s)]
*  Which is you watch that ceremony like what are you doing? [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9653.72s)]
*  Like what do you guys are dressing up like druids? [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9658.72s)]
*  And you're burning an effigy in front of an owl god. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9661.72s)]
*  And you're speaking on loudspeakers about this owl god Moloch. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9666.72s)]
*  This is really what they do. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9671.72s)]
*  This is what they do. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9672.72s)]
*  That's real. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9673.72s)]
*  And it's like I'm not saying that we're living in this like this biblical world where there is like. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9674.72s)]
*  I'll say it. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9684.72s)]
*  Well I'm not saying that there is a god and a Satan. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9685.72s)]
*  I'm not saying there's not. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9689.72s)]
*  I mean I believe in God. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9691.72s)]
*  But I'm saying they believe they're living in this world and they believe they're like on Team Satan or something like that. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9693.72s)]
*  Because they do. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9699.72s)]
*  It is very bizarre. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9700.72s)]
*  I know these are the type of things that you're not allowed to bring up because oh now you're a nutty conspiracy theorist. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9702.72s)]
*  But we have proof of this happening. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9707.72s)]
*  It's not Bohemian Grove isn't just like we have actual video footage of it. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9709.72s)]
*  We don't know everyone who's there. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9713.72s)]
*  We know Nixon was there and we know he said it was the faggiest thing he's ever seen in his life and he wanted to wash his hands. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9714.72s)]
*  He didn't want to shake people's hands there. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9721.72s)]
*  Like this is all real. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9723.72s)]
*  And it does look like when we played that clip before of Madeline Albright being like yeah the five hundred thousand dead children. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9724.72s)]
*  That's worth it. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9731.72s)]
*  Like the price is worth it. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9732.72s)]
*  It does kind of like you. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9733.72s)]
*  You start to kind of ask these questions where you're like OK so there are these people who are comfortable making decisions that lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9735.72s)]
*  And we know in many cases they're making these decisions based off profit. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9746.72s)]
*  And you're like isn't that Satanic. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9751.72s)]
*  Yeah like so who is that person. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9754.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9756.72s)]
*  Like who the fuck is that person. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9757.72s)]
*  Like they just do that at work and then they clock out and they're just like us or are they clocking out and doing some weird ritual at the Bohemian Grove. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9758.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9764.72s)]
*  And when Andreessen Marc Andreessen was on he brought up this. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9765.72s)]
*  He was the one who brought up the Satanist who was also the rocket scientist right. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9769.72s)]
*  Los Alamos Labs. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9776.72s)]
*  Was that him that brought that up. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9778.72s)]
*  No no it wasn't. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9779.72s)]
*  You know who it was. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9781.72s)]
*  It was the opposite of Marc Andreessen. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9782.72s)]
*  It was Python cowboy. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9787.72s)]
*  But like cowboy the guy who that's what it was. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9792.72s)]
*  Andreessen brought up the nuclear tests about how the videos are weird of the nuclear tests like there's a truck behind this building and then also the truck disappears. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9795.72s)]
*  Like it's very weird or the truck appears like I forget which one. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9806.72s)]
*  But it's like it also like how are they filming this and there's all these conspiracies. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9810.72s)]
*  He wasn't saying it was real. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9814.72s)]
*  He's like the conspiracies are that this is all rigged that it was fake. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9815.72s)]
*  But there was a guy who was they they they were doing this thing where they were moving pythons from this place in Florida. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9819.72s)]
*  And they got to this place and he found he took all this video footage of this elaborate satanic ritual set up that they had down there where they had things written on the wall in Latin and they had a girl's bloody dress and they had a chair that was covered in something red. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9830.72s)]
*  And they were trying to figure out what the fuck was going on and they he wound up getting out of there. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9852.72s)]
*  But then he found out that the history of that lab itself that the guy who founded that lab was an open Satanist Jack Parsons Jack Parsons pull up that those articles about him. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9857.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9871.72s)]
*  We're playing it during the show. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9872.72s)]
*  It's like what. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9874.72s)]
*  So this guy was involved in this nuclear weapons lab and he's also an open Satanist like what. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9875.72s)]
*  Yeah that is fucking strange. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9885.72s)]
*  Would wear the fucking outfits and go to these things and this was in like the 19 was it the 50s. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9888.72s)]
*  And it doesn't make you wonder to some degree you're like are you like is there really a Satan and are you really a part of his thing or is this just some weird game you're playing. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9894.72s)]
*  Yeah. Like look how these fucking people would dress man. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9904.72s)]
*  Look how insane this is. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9907.72s)]
*  Go to that article. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9910.72s)]
*  So the article is so bizarre sex rocket scientists and Satanism meet NASA's real hidden figures. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9913.72s)]
*  Satanism. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9920.72s)]
*  Satanism. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9922.72s)]
*  I mean what. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9926.72s)]
*  And this guy was a part of their program and he was fucking openly in the Church of Satan like look how they would dress. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9929.72s)]
*  It was like walking into a Fellini movie like what the fuck. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9937.72s)]
*  What the fuck man. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9942.72s)]
*  Look at these people. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9945.72s)]
*  These are the people that were responsible for this like Aleister Crowley. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9946.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9950.72s)]
*  Well even like how insane are these fucking people with the Epstein thing was I mean I guess it's not it's not exactly this but you remember the like the pictures the paintings that they found from him. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9951.72s)]
*  There's one with George W. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9962.72s)]
*  Bush was like a little kid and he's playing with the blocks that are in the towers. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9963.72s)]
*  Yeah. And then there's like the was it Bill Clinton in a dress or something like that. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9967.72s)]
*  It's not exactly Satanist shit but it's still just kind of this weird like well the clint is things to me was like clear that like you're you have the president in a fucking dress. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9970.72s)]
*  And we've talked about this is like a little fucking screenshot of me talking about it with Duncan. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9980.72s)]
*  We're like that is to me. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9986.72s)]
*  I got you. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9988.72s)]
*  Yeah I got you bitch. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9989.72s)]
*  And the George W. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9991.72s)]
*  Bush one seems to be kind of like different but a similar like this idiot has no idea what the fuck's going on. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9992.72s)]
*  Exactly. He's got a doofus look and look on his face and but it's the planes in two towers right. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=9998.72s)]
*  I mean that seems to be like a 9 11. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10003.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10005.72s)]
*  And if you were a guy who is supposedly the conspiracy is that he was he was a part of the intelligence agency that he was something. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10006.72s)]
*  Massad or something either massage or CIA or combination of those two. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10015.72s)]
*  If you're that guy you probably get like a real thrill out of having all this dirt on these incredibly important people and then have like pictures them looking stupid in your house. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10019.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10030.72s)]
*  Well you wonder like I don't know. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10031.72s)]
*  There's there's just kind of room to speculate about it but you wonder if there is not there's probably a benefit to having very powerful people who have you have dirt on them right. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10033.72s)]
*  So if you let's say you take something like like pedophilia and that is a thing that I don't know maybe 99 percent of people. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10048.72s)]
*  Want you dead if you are that you know what I mean like it's like the thing that even in prison like you will get like murdered for being that even amongst other violent criminals. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10060.72s)]
*  There's this code that you don't do that and most people who are not violent criminals really you know what I mean like so if you are let's say a pedophile and you know that about someone you own them now and that's kind of what the Jeffrey Epstein's thing seems to be that not even that they were. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10071.72s)]
*  I think in some cases they're tricked into it. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10089.72s)]
*  You know you get like 16 year olds you dial them up so they look like they're in their 20s you that you bring the guy to party with them. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10091.72s)]
*  Sure. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10097.72s)]
*  The next day you're like oh she was 16 I have it on tape and you're going to be voting yes on the legislation next week type deal. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10098.72s)]
*  But you could see where let's say you were very very powerful interests behind the scenes. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10104.72s)]
*  You could see where if there were people who say were pedophiles or who like cheated on their wives or just you had dirt on them where you'd be interested in promoting that person because now you can control them much more easily. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10110.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10123.72s)]
*  And so they just it would you could see where it would maybe come to be that they would kind of like these really sick fucked up people in these positions of power because then they're that much easier to control. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10124.72s)]
*  100 percent. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10135.72s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10136.72s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10137.72s)]
*  You got dirt on them. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10138.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10139.72s)]
*  You know it makes sense. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10140.72s)]
*  And and there but there does seem to be like I mean the this was so weird. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10141.72s)]
*  I forget who who tweeted this. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10146.72s)]
*  I apologize man because I should give you credit because it's such a good tweet. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10149.72s)]
*  But someone said someone tweeted that Pete pizza gate aged better than Russia gate which is just like the best. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10152.72s)]
*  Like it's just so funny when you think about it like that that there was this wild conspiracy theory in 2016 that when the podesta emails got dumped that this one. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10161.72s)]
*  Oh was that was that Malice. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10172.72s)]
*  I don't know if he's the first one. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10175.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10176.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10177.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10178.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10179.72s)]
*  I bet it's credit to the sound. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10180.72s)]
*  That sounds like something Malice would say. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10181.72s)]
*  Malice is the guy. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10182.72s)]
*  But look how nutty this is. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10183.72s)]
*  Ex network investigative journalist pleads guilty to child sex abuse material charges. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10184.72s)]
*  So this is a guy that was an investigative journalist at ABC News who investigated and dismissed pizza gate. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10191.72s)]
*  And meanwhile he was guilty of child sexual abuse material charges. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10198.72s)]
*  So he had child porn. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10204.72s)]
*  Now here's the question. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10206.72s)]
*  Has there ever been a case where someone has purposely put child porn on someone's computer to bust them. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10208.72s)]
*  I'm sure there has. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10217.72s)]
*  I would imagine that that's something they can do. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10220.72s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10223.72s)]
*  Wasn't there like a woman who accused the FBI of threatening to put child porn on someone's computer. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10224.72s)]
*  Wasn't there. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10235.72s)]
*  There's like a recent case of that. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10236.72s)]
*  That is so terrifying. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10239.72s)]
*  That's really terrifying. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10240.72s)]
*  First of all that someone would be in possession of child porn and then put it on your computer. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10241.72s)]
*  And then you're just there like and you're like you know you're in the position of being like I swear it's on my computer but I don't know how I got there. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10248.72s)]
*  Especially if you're someone who is investigating child porn. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10255.72s)]
*  I'm not saying that's the case. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10259.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10260.72s)]
*  He very well might be guilty of it. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10261.72s)]
*  And there are people that are guilty of it. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10263.72s)]
*  And it's a fucking heinous thing that does exist as much as like you and I as regular people especially as parents. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10264.72s)]
*  We don't want to ever admit there's someone out there that literally wants to fuck a baby and wants to film people fucking babies and have guys jack off to it. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10270.72s)]
*  It's like why. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10279.72s)]
*  Yeah that's some dark shit. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10280.72s)]
*  Well it's the only thing that you can possess that's illegal that you could find online. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10282.72s)]
*  Right. Like you could have murder videos. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10288.72s)]
*  Like every fucking day I open up Instagram I'm seeing someone get shot. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10290.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10294.72s)]
*  You see a lot of murder videos on Instagram and I don't know how they do that and how they fucking get away with doing that because it seems to be in violation of the terms of agreements of of of Instagram. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10295.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10310.72s)]
*  It seems like you're not supposed to have murder. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10311.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10313.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10314.72s)]
*  But goddamn I've seen a lot of them. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10315.72s)]
*  And if I download these videos and put them on my hard drive and someone arrests me and they search my hard drive say oh well your videos of people murdered that's fine. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10316.72s)]
*  You know even though it's a crime. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10326.72s)]
*  It's nothing officer I just masturbate to it. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10328.72s)]
*  No problem sir. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10330.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10332.72s)]
*  I like to go. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10333.72s)]
*  I like shotguns to the face. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10334.72s)]
*  That's how I get off. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10335.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10336.72s)]
*  Like they've got no problem with that. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10337.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10338.72s)]
*  But if you are in possession even if you haven't done anything physically to these kids. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10339.72s)]
*  This is what is policy on death videos and it clearly is breaking all of those. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10344.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10349.72s)]
*  I guess they're not. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10350.72s)]
*  Images or videos depict the murder of an unidentifiable individual. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10351.72s)]
*  What if they're unidentifiable? [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10355.72s)]
*  What if they have a bag over their head and you shoot them? [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10356.72s)]
*  Images or videos where a reasonably intelligent and identifiable person is clearly deceased excessively gruesome media that depicts the death of an identifiable. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10359.72s)]
*  It's all identifiable person. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10370.72s)]
*  Images or videos of an identifiable deceased person shared for sadistic purposes. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10372.72s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10379.72s)]
*  That's vague. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10380.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10381.72s)]
*  Including media accompanied by content that laughs at or otherwise mocks the deceased and takes pleasure in the suffering of the deceased. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10382.72s)]
*  That's so bizarre. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10392.72s)]
*  So it's just that just seems like such a step. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10393.72s)]
*  Why don't you just say like no murder videos. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10395.72s)]
*  The loophole could be newsworthy. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10397.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10398.72s)]
*  Newsworthy events. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10399.72s)]
*  OK fine. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10400.72s)]
*  Like the death of George Floyd. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10401.72s)]
*  Like that's a newsworthy event of a murder. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10402.72s)]
*  OK fine. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10404.72s)]
*  Fair enough. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10405.72s)]
*  But they're like why is it like well they're kind of almost like implicitly saying like they're like I mean if you can't identify them and you're you know if you can't identify them and you're not laughing at them have at it. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10406.72s)]
*  I don't understand that though. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10416.72s)]
*  I mean I think there are deaths like you know like Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi or things like that that you got to you should be allowed to see. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10417.72s)]
*  The Gaddafi one's wild. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10425.72s)]
*  It is something. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10426.72s)]
*  It is one of the wilds. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10427.72s)]
*  When you see the look on his face that guy shoves that knife up his ass. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10428.72s)]
*  They're like whoa. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10431.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10432.72s)]
*  And I think there's you know there's something about that too. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10433.72s)]
*  But the craziest thing about the Gaddafi thing and I mean that's the craziest thing. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10437.72s)]
*  But he had totally waved the white flag to America. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10442.72s)]
*  Abandoned his nuclear program gave up all his chemical weapons like was like right after 9 11. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10446.72s)]
*  He was like look I'll help you in any way I can. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10451.72s)]
*  I can't. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10454.72s)]
*  Like I don't want this and I know America's coming to kick some ass around here. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10455.72s)]
*  And he did all that. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10459.72s)]
*  And then they still went in and did that to him. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10461.72s)]
*  So it was a message to like everybody else who we oppose around the world that like you know you cannot you can't trust America. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10465.72s)]
*  You can't work out a deal with America. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10475.72s)]
*  When Joe Biden says things like you know like he's said several times that you know we want regime change in Russia. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10478.72s)]
*  It's like that's what regime change looks like. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10484.72s)]
*  So that's what Vladimir Putin's thinking when he says that's like that's what you'd like. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10487.72s)]
*  And then by the way according to Bill Perry who was Bill Clinton's secretary of state. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10491.72s)]
*  So he says that he said that Vladimir Putin believes that the U.S. has like a program to attempt to assassinate him that like we're actively trying to kill him. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10497.72s)]
*  And I don't know if that's true or not. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10510.72s)]
*  But he said that's what Putin believes. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10512.72s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if that were true. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10513.72s)]
*  Doesn't sound like it's outside the realm of possibility. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10515.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10519.72s)]
*  Seems like they tried it with Castro. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10520.72s)]
*  How many times. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10521.72s)]
*  Yeah many many times. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10522.72s)]
*  And what's the Dom Hussein and with a lot of others it's kind of our M.O. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10524.72s)]
*  And so like you got to like almost see like that's what their concern is is like that they could end up like that. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10527.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10533.72s)]
*  Like and what would you do to avoid ending up anally rave with a knife to death. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10534.72s)]
*  A lot. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10539.72s)]
*  You know like whatever you could. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10540.72s)]
*  Yeah you're really backing someone into a corner. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10542.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10545.72s)]
*  Especially a superpower with nuclear weapons especially if they can prove that you're actually involved in all this shit that he's saying you're involved with. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10546.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10553.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10554.72s)]
*  Not good. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10555.72s)]
*  Not good. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10556.72s)]
*  So gross. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10557.72s)]
*  It's so scary. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10558.72s)]
*  And you know that's the one thing I'll say the thing Trump said. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10559.72s)]
*  I remember you were talking about this with Duncan too but when Trump said that I want the dying to stop you know what I mean. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10564.72s)]
*  Somehow that's controversial. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10569.72s)]
*  But like but the the we should do you want Ukraine to win this war. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10570.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10575.72s)]
*  Like what. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10576.72s)]
*  And I was like what does it even mean. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10577.72s)]
*  It's like what do you you know and then there'll be people who are like arguing like well we should stop. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10578.72s)]
*  The war can't stop until all of the territory is restored because we can never like reward the aggressor in this company. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10582.72s)]
*  And you're like dude like so people got to keep dying because you have a point to make about Crimea being ruled by Kiev rather than Moscow. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10590.72s)]
*  There's also people that were like applauding that progrosha was closing in on Moscow. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10599.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10604.72s)]
*  Do you think that he's better. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10605.72s)]
*  Well the I know what he does. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10607.72s)]
*  Do you know what he does. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10610.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10612.72s)]
*  No he was the head of. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10613.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10614.72s)]
*  Like I mean the idea that let's say after all of this let's say Russia like what seems to be the the best case scenario that the establishment is claiming. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10615.72s)]
*  So let's say Russia is utterly humiliated in Ukraine. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10625.72s)]
*  There's a devastating victory for Ukraine. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10629.72s)]
*  Ukraine takes back all of the territory. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10631.72s)]
*  It's all of it. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10634.72s)]
*  They get Crimea back. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10635.72s)]
*  You know they're just they get the entire territory back. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10636.72s)]
*  And then Vladimir Putin is overthrown. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10639.72s)]
*  So do you think that in this most like humiliating of moments for Russia and knowing the like the political realities in Russia what would you say is more likely that will rise up in Vladimir Putin's place. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10641.72s)]
*  Will it be a Jeffersonian Republican liberal who now says we're going to institute a bill of rights. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10654.72s)]
*  You know something like that. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10661.72s)]
*  Or do you think it's more likely going to be probably some someone substantially to the right of Vladimir Putin who will be even more of an authoritarian. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10663.72s)]
*  You know like it's like it's kind of obvious which one is more likely. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10673.72s)]
*  And that never seems to be anything we think about when it comes to war unless they believe they could do what they did in Ukraine. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10677.72s)]
*  Well what to overthrow the government and put a government and that's more friendly than. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10684.72s)]
*  Yeah I mean they've they've tried to do this before. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10688.72s)]
*  That was the other thing that you were talking about that recording where they were openly discussing the various individuals. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10691.72s)]
*  Yeah there's was it was it the John Kerry one or the one with ISIS in Syria or the one in Ukraine with a Victorian crane. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10697.72s)]
*  They had the Victoria Newland phone call where she's she's talking about the phone call states but Victoria Newland and Jeffrey Piot. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10704.72s)]
*  It was it was leaked presumably by the Russians. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10711.72s)]
*  We don't really know in in early 2014 and it's right around. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10715.72s)]
*  I think it was leaked like it was right around when right when Yanukovych fled and the new government took over and was immediately recognized by the U.S. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10721.72s)]
*  And she's she it starts with her and Jeffrey Piot who's an ambassador and they're like we're in play. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10731.72s)]
*  OK like it's happening and then they're all like she's talking about who should be in the new government and who should be out of the new government. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10739.72s)]
*  And then they're talking about how we're going to make this thing stick. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10746.72s)]
*  This guy doesn't have the experience. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10749.72s)]
*  Yats has to be in Klitschko has to be out like going through all the people and all the players who should be in the new government and who shouldn't. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10751.72s)]
*  And then she says that Joe Biden's going to call call them to give them an attaboy to congratulate them for doing it. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10757.72s)]
*  And you know the whole. And look there are people who argue and I've heard this argument I don't think there's really any evidence for it. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10764.72s)]
*  But people argue that that she wasn't talking about overthrowing Yanukovych. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10770.72s)]
*  She was talking about making a deal with Yanukovych or say but I'll just say this. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10774.72s)]
*  The one of the top neocons was over meddling in this country and all the people who she wanted in government got in and all the people who she wanted out of government got out. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10779.72s)]
*  That's a coincidence. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10788.72s)]
*  And you know you can't draw conclusions. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10789.72s)]
*  Yes. So by the way she is Robert Kagan. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10794.72s)]
*  This is she's his wife Victoria Newland and she he was the guy who like I believe he was the founder of the project for a new American century. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10797.72s)]
*  He was at least one of the signatures like one of the signatories of it. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10806.72s)]
*  But he like he was like head neocon guy and this is his wife. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10810.72s)]
*  This is and their whole project since the 90s was to remake the Middle East fight multiple wars overthrow Saddam Hussein. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10814.72s)]
*  Also they want a regime changing around. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10821.72s)]
*  They haven't gotten that one yet and they wanted to expand NATO all the way to Ukraine. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10823.72s)]
*  That was their whole like mission. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10827.72s)]
*  And so his wife just happens to be over there. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10829.72s)]
*  She's handing out water and food to the protesters. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10832.72s)]
*  She's in the crowd given out food and cookies to the protesters. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10835.72s)]
*  John McCain's going over there speaking with neo-Nazi groups and shit telling them your fights our fight. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10841.72s)]
*  The Russians are going to lose you know all this shit. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10846.72s)]
*  And that was all it was it was all part of a big plan which these neocons have said forever that their vision was always that like essentially what Gideon Rose said that you steal Robin away from Batman that with Ukraine Russia is a European power. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10849.72s)]
*  But without Ukraine they're an isolated you know like an isolated nation. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10864.72s)]
*  And Vladimir Putin was always pretty damn clear that Ukraine was his red line. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10869.72s)]
*  Our own CIA director. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10874.72s)]
*  We read the memo last time we were here the yet means yet memo. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10876.72s)]
*  Our own CIA director wrote back to Condoleezza Rice when she was secretary of state and told her and said this is his red line. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10879.72s)]
*  Don't fuck with Ukraine. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10886.72s)]
*  Don't try. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10888.72s)]
*  He's like this is we have our only warm water port here. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10889.72s)]
*  We have strategic interests here and we cannot have your military alliance on our border in this in this border. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10891.72s)]
*  And he's made this is the brightest of all red lines and the CIA director current when he was the ambassador to Russia he said this is the brightest of all red lines not just for Vladimir Putin but for the entire Russian political establishment. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10897.72s)]
*  Even his sharpest liberal critics agree with him on this that Ukraine is the red line. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10910.72s)]
*  And then two months after that they announced Ukraine's coming into NATO and then just more intervention in Ukraine all the way through. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10915.72s)]
*  And eventually he went OK you crossed it. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10921.72s)]
*  Now I'm fucking now I'm breaking it. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10924.72s)]
*  This is a funny thing because in the video we say Gideon Rose goes when you remember the part where he says oh we want to distract him with the Olympics here's here's a shiny medal and we'll just take a country away from you and that whole thing. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10926.72s)]
*  And at one point Stephen Colbert goes well what could Vladimir Putin do like could he intervene and Gideon Rose goes yes yes. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10936.72s)]
*  And I think he says something like he could throw over the chessboard you know like he could and he did eventually. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10944.72s)]
*  You know they fucking pushed him and pushed him and eventually he did. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10950.72s)]
*  I wonder what their ultimate plan is. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10953.72s)]
*  How do they think this is going to play behind closed doors and all the fucking walls are checked for bugs. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10957.72s)]
*  You know what do they say. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10967.72s)]
*  My guess would be that that they are I think the attitude is what Zbigniew Brzezinski said the strategy was in Afghanistan in 1979 that it was to when we were trying to lure the Soviet Union into fighting the war in Afghanistan that what he said it was to give them their own Vietnam. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10969.72s)]
*  Like we basically saw what Vietnam did to us and let's give them one of those. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10993.72s)]
*  Let's lure them into a fucking quagmire that breaks their back. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=10998.72s)]
*  And from their point of view they were successful in that that that's what defeated the Soviet Union was their their war in Afghanistan. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11003.72s)]
*  And now after getting out of our own 20 year war in Afghanistan you know and seeing what that's done to our country. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11010.72s)]
*  I think this is what I think. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11017.72s)]
*  I think they were attempting to lure Vladimir Putin into this war. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11019.72s)]
*  I think that's why they were they they kept crossing his red lines every single time. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11022.72s)]
*  I think they wanted to provoke him into doing this because they want him to they want to break Russia. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11026.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11032.72s)]
*  Game of Thrones. [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11036.72s)]
*  Yeah it's some wild shit dude. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11037.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11039.72s)]
*  How do you have time to research all this stuff. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11040.72s)]
*  Well and just have all this information available. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11044.72s)]
*  An instant recall. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11048.72s)]
*  I mean I don't know. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11050.72s)]
*  I just you know I've I was very lucky from the time I got obsessed with politics in 2007 when I found Ron Paul. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11051.72s)]
*  And at the time I didn't really have any I just my whole life was just stand up comedy and being obsessed with this shit. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11060.72s)]
*  So that was all like that's all I did. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11066.72s)]
*  And now and I fell down the rabbit hole. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11068.72s)]
*  I found a lot of really great people. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11072.72s)]
*  So I think I'm very lucky that I found the right people starting with Ron Paul who I think is the greatest living American hero the Thomas Jefferson of our time. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11074.72s)]
*  But then I found like all these great people like I found like Peter Schiff and Tom Woods Scott Horton the best antiwar voice in the country all the guys at antiwar.com. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11081.72s)]
*  So I read them all the time and I just kind of like kept finding all these really great voices the whole Mises Institute M.I.S.E.S. dot org. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11092.72s)]
*  And so I got obsessed with that for a long time. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11100.72s)]
*  And then it just it's just like I don't know it's just like my calling to follow this shit like it's like I'm so passionate about following it and knowing what's going on. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11102.72s)]
*  And I do a show I do my podcast three days a week and I'm always talking about whatever the latest thing is. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11110.72s)]
*  So I'm always kind of on top of it and I have good sources. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11115.72s)]
*  And yeah so I remember by the way I'll say this quickly you really you really inspired me. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11118.72s)]
*  I remember when I was first starting so I was like I started comedy in like 2005 2006 something like that. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11126.72s)]
*  And then in 2007 2008 I fell into this rabbit hole and then I just started being like obsessed with you know reading about like Austrian economics and military history and all this shit. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11133.72s)]
*  And I remember like I was really self-conscious about it. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11143.72s)]
*  I was like I was like this makes no sense. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11146.72s)]
*  Like what am I doing. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11149.72s)]
*  I'm like pursuing standup comedy and then I'm spending every night until four in the morning just like obsessively reading about this shit that has nothing to do with my comedy career. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11150.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11158.72s)]
*  And I remember just like being like what am I like I'm wait I'm not I'm like failing it coming I'm not doing very good I'm broke and like I'm working on this thing that isn't clearly going it doesn't like really make sense. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11159.72s)]
*  And I was like and I was a big fan of yours already because I was you know a huge UFC fan already. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11170.72s)]
*  And then you know just like from the comedy scene like I knew you from ONA shows and stuff like that. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11178.72s)]
*  And I remember first it was watching Talking Monkeys in Space which is still one of my favorite comedy specials ever. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11183.72s)]
*  And I think that was it 2009 2008 something like that. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11191.72s)]
*  So that was like that seeing that was the first time that I was like because I kind of wanted to take some of these ideas into stand up. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11195.72s)]
*  But I thought they were like a little I was like I don't know. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11201.72s)]
*  I don't want to get like preachy with it or anything like that. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11203.72s)]
*  But then I saw you in that special and you really you had like these long very deep bits about you know like the fucking pyramids and what man was like 10,000 years ago. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11205.72s)]
*  But it was still all punched up and stand up comedy like you weren't just preaching you were like that. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11214.72s)]
*  And I was like oh yeah I think that's fucking I think I could do that. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11218.72s)]
*  You know what I mean like talk about the shit I want to talk about and still keep it funny. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11221.72s)]
*  And then just your I remember thinking about it and I was like you know even though it makes no sense on paper that I'm just the dude who's really into fucking the history of the Russia Ukraine conflict. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11224.72s)]
*  And then we're going to go do stand up comedy shows. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11237.72s)]
*  Like even though that makes no sense I was like yeah but like your career on paper made no sense. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11239.72s)]
*  But it's just who you are. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11244.72s)]
*  If you had ever said to someone like 20 years ago or you were like OK I got it all figured out. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11246.72s)]
*  You know like you had some agent who's like all right well if you want to be a stand up comedian you got to be an actor or you got to write or you got to do this and do these auditions and you're like well I'm just going to like commentate on cage fights and then I'm going to do an internet radio show. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11251.72s)]
*  But I'll be like really big in like the fitness community and the hallucinogenic community like they're all really going to like me like the psychedelics of that like putting it all kind of sounds like wait what. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11263.72s)]
*  But the answer is like that's just who you are. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11273.72s)]
*  So it made sense to just be you. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11275.72s)]
*  You do your thing. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11277.72s)]
*  As I don't know that's kind of like what I've at a certain point kind of like seeing your example I was like yeah I'm just going to do this because this is me and this is really what I'm interested in. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11279.72s)]
*  So like I don't know I like doing stand up comedy and I like talking shit about all this. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11288.72s)]
*  You can't fault the agents for not having a vision. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11292.72s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11295.72s)]
*  Especially if something that didn't exist before. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11296.72s)]
*  But they just don't get the new realm that we exist in. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11298.72s)]
*  You know for people like this they're craving authenticity. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11302.72s)]
*  You know and you are authentically interested in these things. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11307.72s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are out there talking about politics. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11311.72s)]
*  They just view that as a means to get on the air. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11313.72s)]
*  You can smell a grifter. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11316.72s)]
*  You know you can sniff them out. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11317.72s)]
*  You know and that term gets thrown around a lot sometimes unfairly. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11319.72s)]
*  But I'm just saying you can sniff when people are like oh no like he really believes what he's saying. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11322.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11327.72s)]
*  And then you're like oh this guy knows he can play to this audience. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11328.72s)]
*  I can play to the you know like which you know I don't have that skill set. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11330.72s)]
*  I'd probably make a lot more money if I did. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11336.72s)]
*  Yeah. Just pick a team. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11338.72s)]
*  It would fuck you up. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11340.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11341.72s)]
*  It fucks a lot of them up. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11342.72s)]
*  No no I wouldn't be able to do it. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11343.72s)]
*  It clouds their reasoning and you always look at everything through a filter of bullshit. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11344.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11350.72s)]
*  There's certain people that just you know what they're doing. [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11351.72s)]
*  You know they're grifting. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11354.72s)]
*  And they're prone to be exposed. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11355.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11358.72s)]
*  Because when you're bullshitting people you can be exposed for that. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11359.72s)]
*  Yeah especially it's like. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11362.72s)]
*  But it's so tempting you know so tempting for people. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11364.72s)]
*  Makes sense. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11368.72s)]
*  Like if they think that this is the they lick their finger and this is where the wind's blowing. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11369.72s)]
*  Well you see it in. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11373.72s)]
*  And by the way if I'm not like naming and thinking of anyone specific here so I think I'm like trash. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11375.72s)]
*  But you know there's these people that like go from like they're like well I used to be on the right and now I'm on the left. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11380.72s)]
*  I used to be on the left and now I'm on the right. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11385.72s)]
*  And you almost realize that like I'm not even saying like that necessarily. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11387.72s)]
*  They're doing that for these reasons but you realize that let's say you're like it's so valuable to the other side if you're the person who's switched. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11391.72s)]
*  Because then you're like but I'm saying it's like oh look even this left guy sees how crazy the left is. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11398.72s)]
*  So now he's over here. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11404.72s)]
*  So if you're like let's say like in the top 80 political commentators on the left but then you make the switch you move up to like the top 10 on the right. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11405.72s)]
*  So you just immediately know you're like oh this is a huge jump. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11414.72s)]
*  If I do this and you know that's one of the things is is tough is you have to like there there are perverse incentives in this game. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11417.72s)]
*  You got to always kind of be conscious of that. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11427.72s)]
*  I don't want to just be telling my audience what they want to hear. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11429.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11432.72s)]
*  Yes sometimes I got to like say something that might even piss off my audience. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11433.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11436.72s)]
*  That like you and you got to like you got to be really aware of that because even incentives can fuck with you even if you're not aware of that. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11437.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11443.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11444.72s)]
*  Just don't listen to him. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11445.72s)]
*  That's probably that's probably the best way. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11446.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11448.72s)]
*  I mean you have an internal compass. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11449.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11451.72s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah for sure. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11452.72s)]
*  We all do. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11453.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11454.72s)]
*  And you're going to make mistakes. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11455.72s)]
*  We're all going to make mistakes. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11456.72s)]
*  But as long as you're following that internal compass I think people will understand. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11457.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11461.72s)]
*  They'll know what you're doing. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11462.72s)]
*  And you know the fact that you are authentic and this is that's what's so interesting about it. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11463.72s)]
*  Because you really are deeply deeply invested in this stuff. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11469.72s)]
*  It's not like a thing that you've kind of like oh I want to have this debate about this so I'm going to look at it. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11473.72s)]
*  Oh this is what I've learned. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11479.72s)]
*  No you've you've got this stuff internalized. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11480.72s)]
*  I just do. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11483.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11484.72s)]
*  I mean it's like sometimes I'll talk to people and like like people say sometimes like dude I don't know how you like you like like read all about and focus on all this political stuff dude like it just drives me crazy. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11485.72s)]
*  I just don't pay attention at all. [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11494.72s)]
*  And I like I have no argument to that. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11495.72s)]
*  Like no response like hey yeah I get it. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11497.72s)]
*  I completely get that if you just don't. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11499.72s)]
*  It's just to me I just I find it all so interesting. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11501.72s)]
*  I just like I don't know dude I just like I want to know. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11505.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11508.72s)]
*  And I understand what frustrates me is that there's a limit. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11509.72s)]
*  I know I'll never know all of it. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11512.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11513.72s)]
*  Like that's frustrating to me because don't you just want to know don't you really want to know everything about how you're doing. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11514.72s)]
*  And what really happened with Nixon. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11519.72s)]
*  I mean I know I guess it's kind of the official story but it's definitely more than the official stories like what really happened. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11520.72s)]
*  It's always why do you guys really decide we're going to fucking get this guy out. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11526.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11530.72s)]
*  And like and all the shit even the stuff you were talking about with Trump of like that'd be the most interesting thing to ask him. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11531.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11536.72s)]
*  What is really happy you know like what was this like. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11537.72s)]
*  Tell me about this. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11540.72s)]
*  Imagine what it's like. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11541.72s)]
*  I mean I think it's like this is like the most interesting thing to ask him. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11542.72s)]
*  Tell me about this. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11546.72s)]
*  Imagine what it's like just getting in there and also when you're not supposed to get in there and you realize the roles conspiring against you and even you didn't think you would. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11547.72s)]
*  And now you're like oh shit. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11556.72s)]
*  Oh boy. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11558.72s)]
*  I think he did think he was going to win. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11559.72s)]
*  Yeah maybe he did. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11561.72s)]
*  He did. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11562.72s)]
*  No one else around him I don't think that maybe one or two people. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11563.72s)]
*  I don't know Melania thought I don't think I thought she thought I thought she was like sure I'll come do this campaign thing and then I'll go back to being a socialite in New York City. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11565.72s)]
*  She was like oh what. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11573.72s)]
*  Oh man. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11575.72s)]
*  Yeah I was reading this story. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11576.72s)]
*  I didn't read the story. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11579.72s)]
*  I read the headline and it was about Melania's reaction to Trump getting indicted and it was like her reaction seems to be sucks deep sucks to be you. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11580.72s)]
*  Like you don't even have an interview with her. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11593.72s)]
*  Yeah you're just like this is just like a narrative that you just want to promote. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11598.72s)]
*  I mean maybe you're just doing it for clickbait. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11602.72s)]
*  Maybe you're just a journalist who just thinks this is a good fucking angle to take. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11604.72s)]
*  What are they going to do deny it. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11608.72s)]
*  It's also like and like maybe that's even right. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11609.72s)]
*  But what a weird thing to even pretend to write about like can you imagine anyone writing a story about like how your wife feels about something you did. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11612.72s)]
*  You'd be like you don't have any idea how my wife feels about this. [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11620.72s)]
*  Like how would you know especially criminal indictments. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11623.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11627.72s)]
*  And that her take is sucks to be you. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11628.72s)]
*  It's like really. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11630.72s)]
*  They do have a kid together. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11631.72s)]
*  It's like not that old. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11633.72s)]
*  All right. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11634.72s)]
*  Like you're the teenager or something like that. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11635.72s)]
*  Like I don't know. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11636.72s)]
*  It seems like it'd be a weird attitude. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11637.72s)]
*  Are you sure that's the take. [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11639.72s)]
*  How can you like just openly say that. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11641.72s)]
*  Did you get a source like is your rumors like what is what are you saying. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11644.72s)]
*  What are you saying. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11652.72s)]
*  Do you know for sure that's how she feels. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11653.72s)]
*  And even like if you had a source like on that how could you ever like write that article like you had some source like what is it a chick who's a friend of hers says this how reliable is that ever ever how reliable ever is some someone's girlfriend going this is how she feels about her husband like maybe. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11655.72s)]
*  So maybe she did say it for funsies. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11671.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11673.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11674.72s)]

*  I'll just go fucking shop. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11682.72s)]
*  Well she's I mean my guess is she doesn't want to be back in the White House again. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11686.72s)]
*  No doesn't seem like she enjoyed it. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11690.72s)]
*  She's without a doubt the hottest first lady of all time. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11693.72s)]
*  Wasn't Kennedy's Kennedy's wife was she's pretty good looking checkers a very beautiful woman. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11698.72s)]
*  But this lady's hot. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11704.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11705.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11706.72s)]
*  She's hot. [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11707.72s)]
*  I think Kennedy is professionally. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11708.72s)]
*  Yes. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11710.72s)]
*  But she. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11711.72s)]
*  What is how old was where the Kennedy is when they were I think they were much. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11713.72s)]
*  I don't know how old is she. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11718.72s)]
*  She's a lot younger than Trump. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11719.72s)]
*  She's younger than Trump. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11720.72s)]
*  She's probably in her 40s. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11722.72s)]
*  Or is like when Kennedy was in office he was in his 40s. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11723.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11729.72s)]
*  Maybe. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11730.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11731.72s)]
*  I guess that's not an interesting that we think about that is so young now. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11732.72s)]
*  It's there's something. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11735.72s)]
*  He was 34 when he died. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11736.72s)]
*  She was 34. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11738.72s)]
*  OK. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11739.72s)]
*  She was. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11740.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11741.72s)]
*  She was young. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11742.72s)]
*  And she was young. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11743.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11744.72s)]
*  How old was he. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11745.72s)]
*  I'm guessing early 40s 46. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11746.72s)]
*  I don't like 42. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11747.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11748.72s)]
*  How old was he when he died. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11749.72s)]
*  Had to be at least 35 or 37. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11752.72s)]
*  35 or 37. [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11757.72s)]
*  Well he was 30. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11758.72s)]
*  You had to be 35 when you got in and he died in 62. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11759.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11763.72s)]
*  I can't do the math on my head. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11764.72s)]
*  1917 to 63. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11767.72s)]
*  It's 46. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11769.72s)]
*  46. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11770.72s)]
*  46. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11771.72s)]
*  You nailed it Joe. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11772.72s)]
*  So Vivek is 37 which is very young. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11773.72s)]
*  He's right up against the boundary. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11778.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11781.72s)]
*  I don't like. [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11782.72s)]
*  Interesting boundary. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11783.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11784.72s)]
*  Especially now where you go there's something weird about like I'm 40. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11785.72s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11786.72s)]
*  I'm like I want president younger than me. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11787.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11789.72s)]
*  I'm like listen young man. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11790.72s)]
*  But he's so brilliant. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11791.72s)]
*  He's a very impressive guy. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11792.72s)]
*  I think there's a really weird dynamic that I do not completely understand. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11793.72s)]
*  But there's something about the boomer class of politicians who like never passed the torch. [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11800.72s)]
*  Like when I was a kid like in the we had these politicians like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11807.72s)]
*  and Mitch McConnell and like it's all the same people. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11813.72s)]
*  They like Joe Biden like all these guys were in and it's like they never wanted to give [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11816.72s)]
*  up power. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11820.72s)]
*  Have you seen Dianne Feinstein. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11821.72s)]
*  I mean it's like yo lady give it up man. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11822.72s)]
*  Well the thing is like they just won't. [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11827.72s)]
*  Her staff doesn't want her to give it up because then they're all out of jobs. [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11829.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11832.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11833.72s)]
*  So there's how many people working in that organization. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11834.72s)]
*  Several but but still the fact that none of them ever seem to like be willing to pass [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11837.72s)]
*  the torch it's a very and percentage of. [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11842.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11846.72s)]
*  Wow. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11847.72s)]
*  I mean look at that. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11848.72s)]
*  Isn't that insane. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11849.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11850.72s)]
*  And so from 1980 it takes a dip and then it goes skyrocketing. [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11851.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11855.72s)]
*  That is really something. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11856.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11857.72s)]
*  And so and you know even like with the presidency's you know it's like I guess Barack Obama is [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11858.72s)]
*  the exception where he kind of got past the torch although he had to wrestle it away. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11865.72s)]
*  Like it wasn't like they were just like lining up for him. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11869.72s)]
*  It was he had to kind of steal it away from Hillary Clinton. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11872.72s)]
*  But then like they even think that like Hillary Clinton was running for president in 2016 [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11876.72s)]
*  when your husband was running in 1992. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11880.72s)]
*  Like it's 30 years later. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11884.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11887.72s)]
*  What are you doing like running still like you're right. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11888.72s)]
*  You know there's just something about it and I do think there's there's a big problem with [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11890.72s)]
*  it that I think there's like this kind of this boomer mentality about America and especially [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11895.72s)]
*  because these politicians are so like insulated and they're it they live in such a bubble. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11902.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11908.72s)]
*  Like they're not living like regular people. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11909.72s)]
*  They're living these crazy lives and it's almost like they still have this. [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11910.72s)]
*  I think they still suffer from not having adjusted to where America actually is today [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11914.72s)]
*  first where they have it in their kind of post World War Two mind where they're kind [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11919.72s)]
*  of like yeah listen we said you know we said Vladimir Putin can invade and that's that. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11924.72s)]
*  We'll go show him he can't do that. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11930.72s)]
*  And you're like oh OK well he did. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11931.72s)]
*  That's still not working. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11933.72s)]
*  And guess what. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11934.72s)]
*  You're not like so clearly this powerful country. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11935.72s)]
*  You're a country that's 30 trillion plus in debt and like actually you have a lot of signs [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11937.72s)]
*  of like societal decay you know like maybe like you know and it's just I do think we'd [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11942.72s)]
*  be better off with like a younger generation having some influence in this. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11948.72s)]
*  So I like I like a lot of things about the vague. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11953.72s)]
*  I like a lot. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11956.72s)]
*  I like a lot. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11957.72s)]
*  I like a lot of things about R.F.K. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11958.72s)]
*  But he doesn't have a chance to beat Trump right. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11959.72s)]
*  Do you think he has a chance to be the vice president. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11961.72s)]
*  Yeah I think for sure. [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11964.72s)]
*  I think for sure he has a chance at that or some other big because I kind of rather see [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11965.72s)]
*  him get like some other more substantive position in in Trump's cabinet rather than just vice [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11969.72s)]
*  president like I'd rather him like I'd rather him be like the head of like you know something [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11974.72s)]
*  like really like unwind something in the deep state or something you know like I don't know [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11979.72s)]
*  what position exactly would be right for him. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11983.72s)]
*  But I think he's definitely got a shot of being you know it's he has not been attacking [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11985.72s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11989.72s)]
*  Donald Trump has not been attacking him. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11990.72s)]
*  He's kind of defending Donald Trump and so that and Trump's been nothing but complimentary [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11991.72s)]
*  toward him. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11995.72s)]
*  He's in an interesting position where I I have a very tough time seeing how Donald Trump [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=11996.72s)]
*  is allowed to be back in. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12002.72s)]
*  Like it seems to me like they'll do whatever they have to do. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12005.72s)]
*  But how far can they go. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12007.72s)]
*  That's the question. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12009.72s)]
*  That's the question. [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12010.72s)]
*  While still maintaining what is well the most people's eyes at democracy like how well they [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12011.72s)]
*  seem to not be that concerned about maintaining that. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12017.72s)]
*  I mean the furthest they can go is a limo ride in Dallas. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12019.72s)]
*  And you know short of that they can they can you know perhaps they can get a jury to convict [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12024.72s)]
*  and he's looking at 20 years and the deal is either you go to jail for 20 years or you [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12031.72s)]
*  agree to not run for president or something like that. [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12036.72s)]
*  I mean I don't know exactly how they can do it. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12039.72s)]
*  But the vac is in this interesting position where DeSantis his campaign is really tanked [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12042.72s)]
*  and not turned into what anyone thought it might turn into. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12051.72s)]
*  And so now he's just kind of sitting there in the background while Trump is dealing with [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12054.72s)]
*  all these indictments in the system being turned against him and Trump is is wrecking [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12060.22s)]
*  DeSantis. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12065.72s)]
*  He's not taking any blows but he's just kind of there. [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12066.72s)]
*  You know I think it's still a long shot for him to win. [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12069.72s)]
*  I don't know exactly how that would happen but it's it's interesting. [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12072.72s)]
*  He's run a really good campaign so far. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12076.72s)]
*  He's got a lot of good stuff to say. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12078.72s)]
*  I mean he said the other day they asked him who should be the Fed chairman and he said [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12079.72s)]
*  maybe Ron Paul or Rand Paul someone from that family. [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12084.72s)]
*  And you know I'm like watching him like are you just talking to me right now dude. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12088.72s)]
*  Are you just trying to get me to vote for you. [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12092.72s)]
*  Who else is this appealing to because I'm way on board. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12095.72s)]
*  So I like that a lot. [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12097.72s)]
*  I love that he's great on the Ukraine war. [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12099.72s)]
*  I love that R.F.K. [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12102.72s)]
*  Jr. is great on that. [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12104.72s)]
*  Yeah great on that R.F.K. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12106.72s)]
*  Jr. I think is a lot better on China. [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12108.72s)]
*  I think the vacs a little bit too hawkish on China. [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12110.72s)]
*  I don't like that stuff he was talking about with like drone bombing Mexican cartels and [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12113.72s)]
*  all that shit. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12117.72s)]
*  It's like someone. [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12118.72s)]
*  Yes I was so five years with no war. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12120.72s)]
*  You know like just enough of that. [[03:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12122.72s)]
*  But in general I think he is more on the antiwar side. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12124.72s)]
*  It's also just really smart and he's younger and he seems to like really believe in like [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12127.72s)]
*  reducing the size of the deep state and reducing the size of the administrative state. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12132.72s)]
*  And that's like that's really nice because we could really use that. [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12137.72s)]
*  He seems to believe he has a plan for how he can get it done. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12142.72s)]
*  He got very specific with me when he was on my show about like what statutes he would use to [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12145.72s)]
*  like fire people in these bureaucrat positions and how the president has the legal authority [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12149.72s)]
*  to do all of it. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12153.72s)]
*  You know I don't know if that would actually work or not but at least he's tall at least got a plan. [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12154.72s)]
*  He sounds like a president. [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12160.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12161.72s)]
*  Well he's all he's just a very impressive guy. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12162.72s)]
*  And what is the guy. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12164.72s)]
*  You know he built like a gigantic company. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12165.72s)]
*  He's like 37 years old. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12168.72s)]
*  I think he's worth a ton of money. [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12169.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12170.72s)]
*  Which I somehow people think is a negative thing but I just think is very impressive. [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12171.72s)]
*  You know. [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12174.72s)]
*  Very impressive. [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12175.72s)]
*  And he's very impressive in every realm. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12176.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12177.72s)]
*  Every aspect of what he says and even how he defends criticism. [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12178.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12183.72s)]
*  Well this is one of the things that I think is also like just really attractive to me about Robert Kennedy Jr. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12184.72s)]
*  and about Vivek. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12190.72s)]
*  Obviously they have some different views on different things but that you're just like when when you talk to R.F.K. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12192.72s)]
*  Jr. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12199.72s)]
*  about a topic you get this impression that he's read a book about it. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12200.72s)]
*  Oftentimes you get the impression he's read several books about it. [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12207.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12209.72s)]
*  And you get that impression with with Vivek also when you talk to Joe Biden you're not. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12210.72s)]
*  I'm not that I've actually had a conversation with him but when you hear him talk you're not convinced that he even knows what he's talking about. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12217.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12222.72s)]
*  And when you hear Donald Trump talk about something it always kind of seems like he saw a show about it. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12223.72s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12227.72s)]
*  Like it just seems like he watched something. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12229.72s)]
*  He sized up what his view was. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12231.72s)]
*  And then he kind of made it. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12233.72s)]
*  But I just I don't think it's too much to expect that like the president of the United States of America ought to be like a somewhat deep thinker. [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12234.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12242.72s)]
*  You know it would be nice. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12243.72s)]
*  That seems reasonable. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12244.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12245.72s)]
*  Like you and that you know I mean OK you could say that about Obama. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12246.72s)]
*  Obama seemed like he had read stuff. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12251.72s)]
*  You know aside from him there's there's Clinton. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12253.72s)]
*  Yeah yeah Clinton. [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12256.72s)]
*  Very smart very smart guy. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12257.72s)]
*  But I just it would like after you know kind of where we've been going lately it would kind of be nice to see someone like who's who's smart and a thinker. [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12259.72s)]
*  It would be Dave Smith you're the fucking man. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esV5aeHv57w&t=12267.72s)]
