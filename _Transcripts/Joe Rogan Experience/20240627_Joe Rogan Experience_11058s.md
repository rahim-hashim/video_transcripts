# Joe Rogan Experience #1950 - Derek Wolfe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6.0s)]
*  So, first of all, that's a fucking hell of a ring, sir. Look at that, that's the real deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=12.0s)]
*  I always want to see what one of those... Holy shit, look at the size of his finger! [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=18.0s)]
*  My thumb slides up like nothing! That's hilarious. If you don't think Vikings were real... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=23.0s)]
*  Size 18. That's hilarious. That is so fucking big, dude. What's your thumb? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=29.0s)]
*  I don't know. Your thumb's like a fucking broomstick. That's ridiculous. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=35.0s)]
*  Fucking giant thumb. How big were you in high school? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=39.0s)]
*  My senior year I was like 6'5", 280 pounds. I wrestled heavyweight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Wow. Did you ever think about doing MMA? Yeah. Did you? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=51.0s)]
*  I started boxing with Henry Hoof down in South Florida with the Black Zillions. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=55.0s)]
*  I love those guys. Back in 2011, 2012 when I first got into the league. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=60.0s)]
*  I was training for the Combine and I was like, man, I'm really into this MMA stuff. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=65.0s)]
*  I just started doing it. Sparring with, just like wrestling with Overeem a little bit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=70.0s)]
*  I wrestled with him, keep him against the cage. Just drop to a single, bring him down. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=76.0s)]
*  He was like, you wrestle? I was like, yeah, I wrestle, man. I know what I'm doing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Then when I moved to Colorado, full-time training, because I used to go to South Florida to train. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=86.0s)]
*  I stopped that once I got married. I had to step in that. I moved to Trevor Whitman's gym. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=91.0s)]
*  That's a great gym too. Yeah. Trevor was like, hey, you should really think about maybe fighting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=99.0s)]
*  Because it's like you're 290 pounds and you're moving like this. Imagine a 265. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=106.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, I'm not doing that. It's just not worth it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Is it not worth it? I know you retired from football and you're still in the prime of your life. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=115.0s)]
*  Did you retire because of injuries? Did you decide that you had enough? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a combination of all that. I had double hip surgeries. I tore the labrums off the bone. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=127.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. My NFL, the injuries I had while I was in the NFL were just out of control. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=132.0s)]
*  In 2013, I bruised my spinal cord. I was paralyzed for three hours and then I played two weeks later. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=138.0s)]
*  Oh my God. How? It was miserable. Every time I got touched, my arms would go numb. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=144.0s)]
*  I'm a defensive lineman, so my head's getting hit every play. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=150.0s)]
*  Holy shit. What was the play that made your spine get bruised? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=153.0s)]
*  I was playing on the end of the line on the right side and I was playing a cut block. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=157.0s)]
*  Somebody tried to cut my legs out, so I'm sprawled out to play the cut block. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Then the fullback hit me on top of the head. I was awake. It didn't knock me out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=165.0s)]
*  It felt like when you're sitting on a shitter for too long, get up. Exactly how my whole body felt from the nose down. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=170.0s)]
*  Oh my God. You must have been terrified. I was scared. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=176.0s)]
*  When I could feel them touching my toes a couple hours after it happened, I was in the hospital. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=179.0s)]
*  That's when I just started making jokes and stuff because I knew something in my head just said, you're going to be fine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=185.0s)]
*  I just had a feeling. I had no choice. I was a young kid, 22 years old, 23 years old. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=190.0s)]
*  Wow. Then 12 weeks later, I was playing good football still somehow. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=195.0s)]
*  12 weeks later, I had a seizure, like a bad seizure. It almost killed me. I was in a coma for 36 hours. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=199.0s)]
*  Did the seizure come out of a play or did it...? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=208.0s)]
*  No, it was because I wasn't getting fresh blood to my brain because there was a bruise on that spinal right at the base of my brain stem. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=212.0s)]
*  It never healed. I didn't let it heal. Two weeks isn't going to heal a bruise. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=219.0s)]
*  Holy shit. It never healed. I wasn't getting fresh blood to my brain. I was running on pure adrenaline. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=224.0s)]
*  How did they clear you to play two weeks later? They told me it was a stinger. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=229.0s)]
*  Oh God. They said it's just a stinger. You're fine. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=233.0s)]
*  They said, you know when you have a big warehouse and you flip the lights off, they come right off. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=237.0s)]
*  But when you turn them on, it takes a while for them to come back on. That's what they told me happened. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=242.0s)]
*  They're comparing you to a warehouse. You're like, hey motherfucker, I'm a human. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=245.0s)]
*  That's when I realized, man, I was like, they don't care about us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=249.0s)]
*  No, there's another guy waiting to take your spot. That's what's so crazy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=251.0s)]
*  That's why you have to play. That's why guys play hurt and play banged up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=254.0s)]
*  How much time did you get to train before you went and played two weeks later? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=259.0s)]
*  I just went straight into practice the next week. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Wow. The next week. So one week after you're paralyzed, you're in practice. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=267.0s)]
*  They tried to keep me in the hospital after the game. I was like, when's the plane leaving? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=272.0s)]
*  They were like, they're getting ready to go to the plane right now. It's a preseason game. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=278.0s)]
*  I was like, okay, well I'm getting on that plane then. So I had them take me from the hospital to the plane. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=281.0s)]
*  The doctors wanted to keep you in the hospital. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah, doctors wanted me to stay, but the team doctors were like, you're good. We can go. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=288.0s)]
*  Team doctors are savages. Oh my God. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=292.0s)]
*  Well, they did the x-rays and the MRIs right away. We went straight to the ER. I was on a stretcher. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=298.0s)]
*  Into an ambulance. They had to bring the ambulance on the field. I couldn't move. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=305.0s)]
*  I was just stuck in the ground. It was like I was melted. I couldn't move at all. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=308.0s)]
*  All my muscles were just, it was the weirdest feeling, man. Like I said, I was feeling better, but I think I just tricked my brain into thinking, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=313.0s)]
*  I was in survival mode. I've been in survival mode since the day I came out of the womb, man. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=321.0s)]
*  I'm just always surviving. Just trying to survive through whatever it is that's going on. It's like I disassociate from it and just make it through. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=325.0s)]
*  That's a great skill to have if you want to play professional football, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=335.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know if you saw what Deion Sanders just said about what he's looking for in a quarterback. He wants two-parent home. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=337.0s)]
*  It's a two-parent home, but 3.5 GPA. And he wants the complete opposite for a defense lineman. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=344.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. He's like, I want, it's either football or prison pretty much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=350.0s)]
*  What? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=354.0s)]
*  Type of motherfucker is what he wants. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=356.0s)]
*  But if you think about the position and you think about what you guys have to do, it kind of makes sense. You have to be fucking barbaric. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. It is a fucking war in there. You got two, I mean, the way that the size of these offensive linemen now, I mean, they're fucking 350 pounds and there's two of them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=364.0s)]
*  And they're trying to move you every fucking play. Oh my God. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=375.0s)]
*  And you better, if you play pussy, you're going to get fucked. That's what I always say. You go out there playing pussy, you're going to get fucked. That's just the way it goes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=378.0s)]
*  What is the average lifetime of a career in the NFL? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=386.0s)]
*  Two and a half years. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=390.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=392.0s)]
*  Because at that third year you get vested. So vested means you get pension and all the benefits that come with that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=393.0s)]
*  And most guys don't get there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=401.0s)]
*  And most guys don't get there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=403.0s)]
*  You know, we talk about it with fighting all the time that a real elite athlete in his prime has like nine years. You got like, that's the consensus is there's like nine years at peak performance and then it's just too much. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=405.0s)]
*  The wheels fall off, the injuries stack up, you know, the time and training. And then sometimes it's enthusiasm to guys lose that fire that made them a savage in the beginning. But football is even worse. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=416.0s)]
*  I mean, it's even shorter time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=430.0s)]
*  Well, it's shorter, but your earnings, right? Your earnings, you don't get to that. You're on a rookie contract for your first four years. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=432.0s)]
*  So you get drafted and you're on that rookie contract. You make pretty much slotted out the money. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=439.0s)]
*  You know, if you're not a top 10 pick in the draft, then you're not really making life changing money, you know. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=445.0s)]
*  I had $7 when I got drafted though. I didn't even have a bank account. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=450.0s)]
*  I didn't have shit. I was just a fucking poor ass kid from Ohio. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=455.0s)]
*  I went to Cincinnati and I lived with Travis and Jason Kelsey. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=461.0s)]
*  We all lived in the same house. I don't know if you know who those guys are, but Travis is like best tight end in the history of the NFL now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=465.0s)]
*  Jason's going to be the best center, both Hall of Famers. Just played against each other in the Super Bowl. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=473.0s)]
*  And then our quarterback went up to Canada, won two Grey Cups. So we got four Super Bowls and two Grey Cups in that house. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=478.0s)]
*  And we were fuck ups. We were fucking idiots. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=485.0s)]
*  But again, don't you kind of want that from, I want football players to be a little reckless. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=490.0s)]
*  They have to be. I don't want a fucking Boy Scout. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=495.0s)]
*  Exactly. When John Jones kept getting into trouble and people were like, you believe what John Jones did? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=499.0s)]
*  I'm like, John Jones is a wild motherfucker. That's why he's the greatest of all time. You need an element of psycho in there. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=504.0s)]
*  You have to be fucked up. You do. It's just the way it goes. You've got to be a little fucked up to do it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=511.0s)]
*  Is that true with all of them? You've been around the greats. You've been around some amazing players. Is that true with all of them? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=516.0s)]
*  No. No. Most D linemen, interior defensive linemen though, they're fucked up. They are. They're just fucking different. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=522.0s)]
*  Aaron Donald is a different motherfucker. He's going to go down as the best defensive tackle to ever do it. But he's fucking wild. He's crazy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=530.0s)]
*  He tries to kill people out there. He came in with that? Or do you think that also developed over the course of his career? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=538.0s)]
*  I think it develops over your life. I don't know his life story or anything, but most of us have been through some shit. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=544.0s)]
*  You can kind of see it when you meet a guy. He's just fucking different. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=549.0s)]
*  Then you meet a guy. I have Peyton Manning, a good friend of mine now. We were teammates for four years. We won a Super Bowl together. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=555.0s)]
*  He still lives in Denver, so we see each other all the time. But Peyton was the complete opposite. He controlled the room. Everything he did was dialed in. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=563.0s)]
*  He was so professional. He came to work dressed professionally. Defensive linemen, we're coming in fucking slides and fucking shorts and t-shirts and shit. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=573.0s)]
*  He'd show up buttoned up with a briefcase. We're going to the weight room. That's where we're going. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=584.0s)]
*  It was just a different vibe. DeMarcus Ware, such a professional. Everything about him was professional. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=594.0s)]
*  But the great D linemen that are interior guys, they're usually fucked up. John Randall, you've heard of him? This guy fucking slept on a dirt floor growing up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=603.0s)]
*  Do you think he's not a little fucked up? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=613.0s)]
*  Then there's the sport itself, which is just the amount of impacts you guys are taking on a regular basis. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=616.0s)]
*  Every day you're getting hit in the fucking forehead. Every single day. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=623.0s)]
*  When someone talks to you about fighting in MMA, you're probably like, I've done enough. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=627.0s)]
*  I don't want to get kicked in the elbow and the head, punched. No. If I was going to do anything, it was going to be boxing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=632.0s)]
*  The Klitschko was still the champ. Trevor was like, you can quote him on this. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=637.0s)]
*  He was like, we could talk a bunch of shit and fucking get the word out there. Get you a couple amateur fights. Get you winning a couple fights. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=647.0s)]
*  He's like, in two years we'll be fighting for a hundred million. That's what he told me. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=653.0s)]
*  Trevor's a wild dude, but he's also a genius. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=658.0s)]
*  He took my pass rush game to another level. I was good at figuring out angles from wrestling on people, but he took it to another level. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=662.0s)]
*  Like taking my levels down. I could bring my level up and get it back down and come out of there with power. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=671.0s)]
*  I was just creating angles on guys and doing shit they'd never seen. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=677.0s)]
*  Is that from footwork drills? Yeah, doing footwork. It's all footwork. Everything is footwork. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=681.0s)]
*  It starts with your feet first and your hands will follow. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=686.0s)]
*  He would have me switch jabs and shit like that. I would use that shit on the field. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=688.0s)]
*  I would switch my feet last second and then cross body. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=694.0s)]
*  Then be able to lower my level and be able to accelerate out of that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=698.0s)]
*  It just took my fucking pass rush to another level. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=702.0s)]
*  That makes sense. If you learn new skills like that. You know Vasily Lomachenko, the boxer? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=705.0s)]
*  His dad made him do Ukrainian dance for two years. Made him stop boxing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=712.0s)]
*  He's like, look, you're going to be an amazing boxer, but what I really want you to concentrate on is your feet. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=719.0s)]
*  Now if you watch him fight, have you ever seen him fight? See if you can find a Lomachenko highlight. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=724.0s)]
*  His footwork is insane. He's standing in front of a guy and then he'll switch and throw a jab and circle off to his left. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=729.0s)]
*  Catch him again and circle off to his right. The guy does not know where the fuck he is. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=736.0s)]
*  How are you supposed to play chess against that? It's a dance out there. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=742.0s)]
*  He's such a wizard, man. His footwork came about from all the stepping. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=747.0s)]
*  The fact that he can just stand, look at that. These angles are insane. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=754.0s)]
*  Then he lights off punches. He's the most beautiful of any guy I've ever seen in terms of footwork. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=760.0s)]
*  Because you're really watching him dance. Because of the dance background, his footwork looks beautiful. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=765.0s)]
*  My God, who fucking moves like him? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=772.0s)]
*  The guys just put their hands up. They're like, fuck, I don't know what's coming. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=776.0s)]
*  He's really not a lightweight. He fought T. Fimo Lopez in the lost. He's fighting these bigger guys, but he's really like a 130-pounder. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=779.0s)]
*  That's his real weight class. If there was big money fights at that weight class and he didn't have to keep going up, he's a motherfucker, dude. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=786.0s)]
*  He probably wouldn't be beat. That's the thing. It's all from footwork. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=794.0s)]
*  That's where it all starts, man. It's your base. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=798.0s)]
*  What the fuck were we talking about? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=802.0s)]
*  We were just talking about skills that you picked up training with Trevor. You don't want to fight. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=805.0s)]
*  I just didn't want to do it because I didn't want to get hit in the fucking head anymore. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=809.0s)]
*  Smart. When it came to be stopping with the NFL, when I was like, I'm done. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=812.0s)]
*  I played eight years in Denver, which was awesome. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Then I dislocated my elbow bad going into a contract year in 2019. I was having my best season of my career. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=821.0s)]
*  Year eight, balling out, about to get another payday. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=828.0s)]
*  It was like a dead play. The whistle didn't get blown. A couple guys jumped off sides. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=832.0s)]
*  The whistle gets blown halfway through the play. Half the fucking field is moving at full speed and half the field's not. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=838.0s)]
*  It's a fourth of an inch of play, so I try to make the fucking tackle. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=844.0s)]
*  I slow up and I end up slipping and falling. I'm going to get up and our 330-pound nose tackle goes to the dike. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=848.0s)]
*  He's running straight at me and his fucking shin hits me right in the elbow and it goes to the ground. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=854.0s)]
*  Dislocated all the way to the fucking ground. I'd never been in so much pain. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=859.0s)]
*  It hurt so fucking bad. It made me want to throw up. I was throwing up in my mouth. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=864.0s)]
*  I was grabbing at it and trying to put it back in. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=868.0s)]
*  In 2016 I did that with my right elbow. It came out and I put it right back in. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=870.0s)]
*  It just kept going. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=875.0s)]
*  I mean, your fingers get popped out all the time. You just put them in and go. There's no time to fuck around. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=877.0s)]
*  I was trying to get it to go in and I could just feel it grinding on the bone, grinding against each other. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=884.0s)]
*  It was making me fucking ill. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=890.0s)]
*  Then they took me in the locker room and I was fucking pissed because I knew it was going to cost me a bunch of money. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=892.0s)]
*  That elbow deal was going to cost me. I knew it. It probably cost me $20 million. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=897.0s)]
*  Fucking pissed. My own teammate, he didn't mean to. It's not his fault. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=901.0s)]
*  It was on a dead fucking play. I was losing my shit. I fucking slammed my helmet. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=905.0s)]
*  I was like, these motherfuckers. I was blaming the refs. Blaming everybody. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=909.0s)]
*  Fucking refs. I'm going to sue the fucking refs. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=913.0s)]
*  My turn. You know, think. Here's the other thing. Before games I was taking micro doses. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=916.0s)]
*  I'm micro dosed and I'm at full... [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=923.0s)]
*  You're taking mushrooms? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=925.0s)]
*  Yes. Before games. I'm taking mushrooms. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=927.0s)]
*  That's the viking in you. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=930.0s)]
*  I'm fucking taking mushrooms and fucking Adderall. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=932.0s)]
*  Wow. Oh my God. What a combination. What is that like? Mushrooms and Adderall. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=934.0s)]
*  Dude, the fucking focus is out of control. Before games I would get myself pissed off. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=940.0s)]
*  I would start thinking about my childhood. The shit that I went through as a kid. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=947.0s)]
*  And they would fucking get me in this rage mode. It was like this crazy controlled rage. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=950.0s)]
*  So Adderall, mushrooms, and childhood rage. All together in a 280 pound savage. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=955.0s)]
*  Well, I was like 300 pounds then. I was like 20 pounds heavier than I am now when I was playing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=962.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Just fucking such a meathead. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=968.0s)]
*  Saying wild crazy shit to quarterbacks. I told a guy I was going to fucking eat his kids. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=972.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=977.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=979.0s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=981.0s)]
*  He didn't say shit. I played against this guy twice a year for eight years. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=983.0s)]
*  That was in year four that that happened. So four years straight he never said another word to me. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=988.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=992.0s)]
*  He was like this guy is a fucking sicko. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=994.0s)]
*  Once I got married and had kids and stuff though, I was like cool to not saying shit like that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=996.0s)]
*  But that's what you do man. It's a fucking head game. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1001.0s)]
*  It's a head game. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1004.0s)]

*  We were on a duck hunt together and I was telling him this. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1175.0s)]

*  I was like I was raised on Kid Rock. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1185.0s)]

*  Mike Tyson. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  Those are the motherfuckers I looked up to. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1193.0s)]
*  I didn't have any any other like role model in my life that I could look up to. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1195.0s)]
*  So I had to look up to those guys in a way they just didn't give a fuck. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  And I was like that's what I'm going to do. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1203.0s)]
*  So when you were growing up was your mom around. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1205.0s)]
*  My mom was an alcoholic and struggle with drugs and she doesn't know who my dad is. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1208.0s)]
*  Like has no idea. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  You think by now like this motherfucker would just pop up right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1218.0s)]
*  But no like nobody fucking knows who it is. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1220.0s)]
*  Because she would go on these month long blackouts. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1221.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1224.0s)]
*  And just be fucking blacked out for a month. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  And you know she was abused as a child too. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  You know she was sexually abused and stuff. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  So she just kind of didn't break that cycle right. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1232.0s)]
*  Didn't break the chain. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  Then my stepdad was abusive. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1237.0s)]
*  You know he would fucking you know beat the shit out of me. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1239.0s)]
*  You know that he would beat the shit out of me. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1241.0s)]
*  Like for fun. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  Like that's what if he was in a bad mood and I had my fucking mouth open even looking at him. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1245.0s)]
*  He'd fucking pop my mouth and fucking throw me on the ground you know. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  Kick me in the stomach and shit. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1251.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1253.0s)]
*  Like you fucking pussy you know get up. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1255.0s)]
*  You know that's just the way he treated me. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1257.0s)]
*  But I got to get out of that. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1259.0s)]
*  I got out of that situation and broke that cycle. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1261.0s)]
*  But like when people are like you're fucked up. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  I'm like well what do you think. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen when you fucking treat a kid like that. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1267.0s)]
*  You know my mother didn't really show me. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1269.0s)]
*  I don't know what unconditional love felt like until I had a daughter. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1271.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1273.0s)]
*  I didn't know what that felt like. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  It was so life changing for me to have a daughter and to feel what that feels like. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1276.0s)]
*  That unconditional no matter what I'll love you. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1282.0s)]
*  Because I didn't know what that felt like. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1285.0s)]
*  Never had it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1287.0s)]
*  So it was. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1289.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1291.0s)]
*  It was intense. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1293.0s)]
*  My childhood was fucking intense. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1295.0s)]
*  You know like even you know being in relationships my wife is so patient with me because like my idea of intimacy was you know my mom. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1297.0s)]
*  I slept in the attic you know in this tiny little fucking house. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1301.0s)]
*  And we lived on all these. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1304.0s)]
*  I went to seven different elementary schools. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1306.0s)]
*  We were always getting fucking booted out of the house. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  But when I was like really developing going through puberty like what I heard was them fist fighting each other throwing each other through walls and then fucking 10 minutes later. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1310.0s)]
*  Like that's what my idea of intimacy was. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1317.0s)]
*  So like I had to like reprogram my brain. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1319.0s)]
*  How did you do that. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1321.0s)]
*  Did a bunch of treatments like you ever heard of EMDR. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1323.0s)]
*  No. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1326.0s)]
*  So it's like you believe in past lives. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  I don't not believe. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  I think there's a certain amount of undeniable genetic memory that people have. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1331.0s)]
*  I think that's probably where things like a phidiophobia and arachnophobia come from fear of snakes and spiders because I think that a lot of that probably comes from there's a memory of you either watching someone die from it or you getting bit and surviving and it gets through the DNA and it gets to people today. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1337.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1354.0s)]
*  Because there's certain people that they for no reason they'll see a snake and they just fucking freeze whereas other people see a snake and it's just like oh stay the fuck away from that. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1355.0s)]
*  But it doesn't have that same visceral reaction the same fear. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1364.0s)]
*  There's things that people know like you know to be scared of big teeth and scary things. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1367.0s)]
*  And that's why kids are scared of monsters right. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1372.0s)]
*  Because we grew we evolved around big cats and things were eating us and wolves. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1375.0s)]
*  Yeah saber toothed tigers and shit. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  Yeah that's I think prehistoric animals. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  Because those memories are in our DNA. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1385.0s)]
*  So I have a feeling we have no idea what kind of information is stored that passes on from your genes. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1387.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1394.0s)]
*  Like one of the things I've noticed about my kids is they have very specific talents that I have very specific and also that like some other members of my family have like my uncle's an amazing artist. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1395.0s)]
*  I'm always like how much of that is genetic like where's that coming from. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1406.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1409.0s)]
*  Like where's this a bit like my youngest daughter is fucking incredible. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1410.0s)]
*  Her artworks amazing. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1412.0s)]
*  I watch a drawing I'm like Jesus Christ. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  She's 12. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1417.0s)]
*  How are you so good. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1418.0s)]
*  But she's like there's there's something I think that kids get from their parents and maybe that is what past lives are. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  And maybe when someone has a seance or some shit and you know they someone they tell a story about a past life. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1427.0s)]
*  Maybe that's in there somewhere like deep deep in that in a DNA file system. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  Yeah it's all I mean we could get down the rabbit hole here but it's you know that DNA code. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1439.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1446.0s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1447.0s)]
*  We don't know what's in there. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  It's in with animals right. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  Like I got a dog. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1451.0s)]
*  He's a golden retriever sweetest dog in the world. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  But like if that dog sees shit outside he rolls around in it like he knows to roll around like I don't know what the fuck kind of instinct that is. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  But that's like in his system. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1465.0s)]
*  It's a very specific thing. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  You know if he if he sees a squirrel he's it's it's on bitch. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  Like I'm here to kill squirrels. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1472.0s)]
*  You know it's on squirrels and birds like that he wants to chase them. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1473.0s)]
*  Most for him it's squirrels. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1477.0s)]
*  He's a fucking squirrel killer. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  But well that's probably I mean that's the rodents like small rodents and shit with what wolves were eating back. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1480.0s)]
*  It must be taken down like this is my daughter has a chihuahua. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  She has this little tiny chihuahua whippet mix. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  He's the shit. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1492.0s)]
*  His name is Snoop. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  He's this tiny little fella. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1494.0s)]
*  And him and Marshall are like best friends. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  Like that's a rat. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1498.0s)]
*  Like the size of a rat. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  Like how come you want to kill the squirrels but that that little dude is your buddy. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  Because he knows. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  Yeah it's crazy. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  Like it's the same thing. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1506.0s)]
*  It's the same thing with like big dogs and babies right. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  They just are soft around. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1510.0s)]
*  They go slow. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1512.0s)]
*  Because think about that when wolves first started coming into little fucking nomad camps right. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  They were feeding them and they would keep them safe from the other wolves. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1519.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1522.0s)]
*  It was the first fucking thing they learned was don't touch the fucking kids. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1523.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1527.0s)]
*  Or you get fucking killed. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1529.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1530.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  So they didn't touch. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1532.0s)]
*  They were soft and easy with the kids. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1533.0s)]
*  Especially animals with floppy ears. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  The ones with the floppy ears they think that that wolves their ears droop to sort of show [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  submissiveness and that's how wolves when they transition and became dogs over time [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  they've developed like Labrador ears. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1545.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  That's so fucking crazy. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  They're so close to us in a way because they're the same thing but they look so different. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  You know like you could take like a Great Dane and if you could figure out the logistics [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1557.0s)]
*  that could fuck a little poodle. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1564.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  And then it would make a dog. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  Like how is that how are those the same animals? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1569.0s)]
*  You know and when you see. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1570.0s)]
*  The lab created dogs that they have now man it's wild. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1574.0s)]
*  But you see someone like Shaquille O'Neal and then you see like Tina Fey. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  They could have kids. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1579.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  Like the size difference the way they look is so different but we're a lot like domesticated [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  animals in that way. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1587.0s)]
*  I guess it makes sense right because humans all came out of Africa and they traveled all [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1588.0s)]
*  over the world they had to adapt all these different climates and that's what caused [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1592.0s)]
*  all those the physical changes in people. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  Have you read the book Species? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1597.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1599.0s)]
*  That fucking book changed my life. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  Very very interesting right. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  When you see here the history of us. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1603.0s)]
*  It's fucking wild that there were seven different species. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1605.0s)]
*  They think there's more now. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1607.0s)]
*  They think there's more. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  They keep finding one. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1609.0s)]
*  They found a new one recently. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1610.0s)]
*  They found some DNA of a recent human species that is different than anyone that they found [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  before. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1619.0s)]
*  And how old did they think that was? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1620.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1622.0s)]
*  I don't quite remember but I know they're they're in the neighborhood of there's some [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1623.0s)]
*  of these people that were that used to be humans that were around when modern humans [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1628.0s)]
*  were around. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  We're the final product. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1636.0s)]
*  Are we though? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1637.0s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm saying. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1638.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1639.0s)]
*  We killed off all the fucking other ones right. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1640.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1641.0s)]
*  Like you were talking last night about how you have Neanderthal on you right. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1642.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  And it's crazy to think that like imagine like seeing like an ape and be like yeah I'm gonna [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  have sex with that you know. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  Well I think people were. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  I think we're everybody was pretty close back then. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  I mean I think when you're dealing with like Neanderthal mating with Homo sapiens. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1651.0s)]
*  Yeah they didn't look so much different. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1652.0s)]
*  It wasn't like a gorilla. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1653.0s)]

*  Yeah, and you feel alive. I'm glad you brought this up because I was talking about this on another podcast couple weeks ago [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1718.72s)]
*  And I'm just trying to get my thoughts here and how I explained it [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1724.0s)]
*  Sports were sports were invented by dudes [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1727.78s)]
*  Practicing to hunt yeah, like they're like how can we fucking get ready to go hunt or practicing war? Yeah, we're practicing war [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1731.08s)]
*  We're practicing hunting like that's what they that's where sports come from so that's why there's like this deep [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1737.92s)]
*  Spiritual connection between battle and sports yeah and hunting it's all kind of it all kind of goes together [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1744.24s)]
*  It was a great transition for me to get into bow hunting [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1750.1200000000001s)]
*  I was already I bow hunted when I was a kid too, but that was kind of like my escape [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1752.52s)]
*  You know football and bow hunting were my escape as a kid [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1756.68s)]
*  That's where I was I just stayed in the woods man because if not I was just a loose fucking cannon [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1758.68s)]

*  It's not fucking crazy. Has that ever happened before since no there was one time [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1949.8s)]

*  Because I felt like I had found the roots, you know of like the trauma [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1959.64s)]
*  Wow, so I fucking like I wonder if that's in there man [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1963.96s)]
*  So that means I was like this is I know that the mind like I know that your mind your mind is the most [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1968.36s)]
*  Powerful tool you have so I know that it can play tricks on you, too [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1972.9799999999998s)]
*  And like I watch movies and shit so like I was like this shit could have just came from a movie, right? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1976.6399999999999s)]
*  So I was like, let me do some DNA fucking [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  Scandinavian all the way through of course [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=1983.8799999999999s)]

*  Just [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2002.68s)]
*  You know people will dismiss that they'll dismiss it as imagination and dreams and stuff [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2003.76s)]
*  But I just wonder how much you care you carry. Oh, yeah, obviously some information is transmitted [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2008.34s)]
*  It's transferred from your genes into your children. There's some that's it. Oh, yeah, some of it is from them learning being around [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2014.6s)]
*  How do you think they know how to work a fucking phone at three years old already? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2020.6s)]
*  They know how to fucking swipe it and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2023.84s)]
*  Like it's like they just know I think that's just easy for those young pliable minds to learn [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  You don't think they don't think shit that I don't know you don't think that that's passed down at all [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2031.8s)]
*  I don't know [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2035.7s)]
*  I think the technology stuff like why are some people good with fucking computers and like dude I get a computer and I want [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  to snap it in half [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2041.8799999999999s)]
*  I [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2045.52s)]
*  Think some of it is probably passed down through the parents [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2046.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean they think like musical talent like oftentimes it's but then you gotta go [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2049.36s)]
*  Well, they probably grew up in a musical household, too [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2054.76s)]
*  They're probably contributed to it [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2056.8s)]
*  But what you're you're talking about is something way more intense and it makes me wonder [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  I mean when people do have those past live dreams or I always wonder if that's bullshit like there's always some little kid that can [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2063.04s)]
*  Speak German that you can tell you a story or they grew up and during the war and you're like what? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2069.84s)]
*  Like you're four. Yeah, like there's a few of those but I never know if those are real stories [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2074.1800000000003s)]
*  Have you ever read any of those that are like very compelling? I've looked into this heavy one time [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2079.36s)]
*  There's a guy's a doctor us an actual person out of college [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2084.1600000000003s)]
*  It's been studying as many cases he could find about this and I can't remember his name. I can look him up [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2088.48s)]
*  He's got the info and what does he say? I think he says it is accurate, but there's levels to it. There's different [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2094.1200000000003s)]
*  Parts people remember you can't force the chip to child to go through it [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2100.78s)]
*  You kind of just have to like let them say what they remember [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2104.92s)]
*  You start asking things that freaks him out sometimes they start crying [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2107.16s)]
*  But there's one I remember hearing he was remembering stuff about this guy this World War two pilots [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2110.16s)]
*  Friends that he had he remember he like almost named the ship [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2115.6s)]
*  I think they were on whoa this guy like he died in a plane crash [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2118.4s)]
*  He was shot down he was having all these memories of it, but they went too far with it [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2121.16s)]
*  I think is also what happened. He's like, I don't know what you're talking about now. Oh wow [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2125.0s)]
*  So there's levels to it too, but I always wonder because I always wondered [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2128.4s)]
*  Like how much is trans it makes sense if these [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2133.9s)]
*  Beings want to evolve and learn that you should have the lessons of the people from the past [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2138.38s)]
*  They should be inside of you in some sort of a way [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2143.34s)]
*  There's some sort of knowledge that gets transferred to children. It just makes sense right then that's the case [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2145.62s)]
*  You're gonna have the most traumatic memories are gonna be burned in there mm-hmm [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2151.38s)]
*  Because you it's it's and then like even the ones that you experience in life [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2157.5s)]
*  If you bury those in your subconscious yeah right so like when you're I think it's what from this is the doctor doctor [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2161.3s)]
*  Stevenson [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2167.78s)]
*  The studies are still going on division of perceptual studies at Virginia. I think is where most of the research has been happening Wow [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2168.98s)]
*  Lot of a lot of [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2177.3s)]
*  Lot of studies have gotten into it some people are bullshitting obviously for sure [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2179.1000000000004s)]
*  But there are many cases of people that seem to be not bullshitting [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2183.42s)]
*  That's that visions a lot of stuff [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2188.14s)]
*  various types of extra sensory perceptions such as telepathy apparitions and deathbed visions after death communications or [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2191.7s)]
*  ADCs poltergeists [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2199.58s)]
*  experiences of persons who come close to death and survive usually called near-death experiences out-of-body experiences and [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2201.58s)]
*  Children's memories of previous lives wow [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2209.9s)]
*  That's why when you get a real scientist that study and shit like that [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2213.54s)]
*  Yeah, cuz you gotta wonder like it's so easy to dismiss those things so easy to dismiss it [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2216.62s)]
*  But the human mind and it's just ability to acquire information and store it in there and did [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2222.54s)]
*  To be able to remember things like all that is weird enough as it is [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2228.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's that weird that those memories are transferred to children [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2232.14s)]
*  No, I'm gonna make sense to me it does what the fuck do I know yeah? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2235.7799999999997s)]
*  Well you have that you have a memory that's pretty fucking intense that completely makes sense when you look at you yeah [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2239.06s)]
*  So I just fully embraced it man. I got fucking Odin tattooed all over me [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2245.58s)]
*  Oh nice big Odin the big fucking Raven with the Odin sign on my chest and shit like I just [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2249.3s)]
*  Viking full went on went into it man and didn't embraced it [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2254.78s)]
*  So it's giving me like a lot of peace just kind of like knowing where you can't know where I come from right mm-hmm [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2258.12s)]
*  Because I didn't know what that I don't know anything [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2263.66s)]
*  You imagine being alive during the Viking time oh fucking savage [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2266.06s)]
*  You imagine those we're gonna go rape and pillage we're gonna like that's not what I think about it [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2270.62s)]

*  That was like yeah [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2463.2400000000002s)]
*  793 to [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2465.92s)]
*  1066 CE the period during the Middle Ages when the Norsemen known as the Vikings undertook large-scale ratings [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2468.0800000000004s)]
*  colonizing conquest [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2475.1200000000003s)]

*  Yeah, it has to be you know that's almost gotten lost. It's it's there man. It's fucking they say giants [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2500.24s)]
*  You know I believe that there was Giants walking the earth at one point. There's probably fucking [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2507.16s)]
*  Eight foot tall nine foot tall motherfuckers. They say they were like 20 20 30 feet tall [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2511.64s)]
*  Because didn't they find a femur bone it says the average Viking was [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2516.46s)]
*  Eight to ten centimeters three to four inches shorter than we are today [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2520.54s)]
*  the skeletons that are that archaeologists have found revealed that a man around [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2525.38s)]
*  172 centimeters tall five foot six and a woman had an average height of five foot one [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2530.26s)]
*  Yeah, but that's the just the people that they killed yeah, those are the ones that died those are the skeletons. Yeah [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2535.1800000000003s)]
*  Everybody else died in a fire on a boat. Yeah, if you were a fucking [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2541.34s)]
*  Yeah, if you were like if you had to die those are the ones that just didn't die with their sword in their hand [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2545.98s)]
*  Yeah, they just found them stomp to death. Yeah [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2550.02s)]
*  That's that when they talk about the average it's funny so they killed a bunch of five foot six dudes [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2555.98s)]
*  Like the amount of five foot six dudes they got stomp to death is pretty high. We think they were all pretty short [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2563.5800000000004s)]
*  This obviously that can't be true because the stories of them all being these giant savages [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2568.98s)]
*  And then you have the guys in Iceland you got guys like you obviously they were giant [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2577.22s)]
*  Yeah, it seems obvious that the ones who were like at the front of the boats the guys were raiding. They were giant people [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2581.58s)]
*  Yeah, and I think I think that uh I [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2587.46s)]
*  Think that like the the water was so much different back then that glacier milk that glacier water [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2591.38s)]
*  Eating fucking muskox and fucking Irish elk remember the Irish [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2596.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they're eating shit like that. Yeah [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2601.78s)]
*  So like they were eating just they were just like meat leaves and berries high protein and murder tons [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2604.42s)]
*  Yeah, and mushrooms and mushrooms there and they did they used to do like ayahuasca. Those Vikings are like really into that [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2609.96s)]
*  Well, I know they were in the mushrooms right there [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2616.26s)]
*  Yeah, they would take mushrooms before they would go on that was in the the show too [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2618.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the show was great because there was no real good guys like the people that they were storming the castle and kill them [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2622.7999999999997s)]
*  They were cunts too. Yeah, so it's like you didn't really mind that they were getting murdered [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2628.24s)]
*  Well, everybody was fucked up back then right like everybody was fucking evil [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2632.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you had fucking kings that just owned all the land and would be like nope. You can't eat anything off this land [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2635.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna starve. That's the real Robin Hood story. Yeah, Robin Hood was really about was hunting. Yep. Yeah [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2641.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2647.56s)]
*  That's not that it's not no when you think about how long like it's just a little blip a tiny little blip [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2650.24s)]
*  It's just a fucking blip [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2656.88s)]
*  Do you ever pay attention to guys like Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson and these guys that think that there was a huge reset of? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2657.92s)]
*  Civilization I've heard about the reset but I talk more about that [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2666.0s)]
*  They think that there was natural disasters probably comet impacts around 11,800 years ago [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2671.12s)]
*  Reset civilization and probably knocked us back into the Stone Age. Yeah, and that it makes sense if you think about [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2677.1200000000003s)]
*  the like when you're talking like a thousand years ago with the Vikings and [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2684.0s)]
*  2,000 years ago with the Romans and just how savage and barbaric people were but yet thousands of years before that [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2688.1600000000003s)]
*  They built the pyramids like how they do that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2695.04s)]
*  Well if something happened that like wiped everyone out back down to like just pure savage people to just scratch and claw and stay alive [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2697.2400000000002s)]
*  And then they rebuilt civilization, but you would have the echoes of that [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2704.6s)]
*  Barbarism just running through cultures and that's what we have [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2709.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2713.52s)]
*  And that's really when you see the Vikings when you when you think about the Mongols you think about the horrific shit that people did [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2713.8399999999997s)]
*  to each other just a couple thousand years ago and then a few thousand years before that you have this [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2721.06s)]
*  immensely sophisticated [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2726.08s)]
*  civilization in Africa that's building giant stone structures and perfect geometry like [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2727.68s)]
*  What happened what the fuck yeah has to be has to make sense. I totally believe in that [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2733.6s)]
*  This is what's the documentary called? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2739.16s)]
*  Well, the Graham Hancock's is what there's a natural catastrophe. Yeah, yeah [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2741.7999999999997s)]
*  Apocalypse ancient terrible. He said natural natural catastrophe ancient apocalypse ancient apocalypse and Graham's is [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2747.68s)]
*  I think I believe it's seven pieces seven. How many parts is it? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2755.2s)]
*  It's at least four, but it's all [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2759.8399999999997s)]
*  I watched it. It's amazing. It's fucking great. It's amazing. And this is what he's pointing out and archaeologists are very [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2762.04s)]
*  Hesitant to get on board with it because they've been lecturing this different narrative for so long [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2769.2400000000002s)]
*  And they've been writing books and you know, I mean they don't want to say they were wrong [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2773.88s)]
*  But it looks like they were wrong [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2777.8s)]
*  It looks like the idea of the start of civilization being around six thousand years ago is a restart of civilization [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2779.52s)]
*  Yeah, so has to be yeah makes sense because when they're finding these structures like go Beckley tepe [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2785.56s)]
*  Turkey and and a lot of the ones they believe in Egypt. Have you been to Egypt? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2791.88s)]
*  No, I haven't been there yet. Dude, I heard it's I climbed to the center of the Great Pyramid [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2795.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, fucking wild energy in there. Okay, man fucking vibrating like [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2799.1200000000003s)]
*  Really? It's fucking you feel it. Yeah, or is it just like you feel it? You come on out cuz you're there [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2804.6400000000003s)]
*  No, you can almost hear it. Really? It's like this weird energy in there. Yeah [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2809.0s)]
*  It doesn't feel like it doesn't put off like a bad vibranium. It just feels like electric in there [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2813.56s)]
*  Hmm. It's like what is this a fucking power station? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2818.2000000000003s)]
*  What is it? I don't know. It's a they say it's a tomb. Yeah, but that's not real. That can't be real [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2821.24s)]
*  I don't think that's real because I would they spend so they wouldn't spend that much fucking time and manpower. I [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2826.7599999999998s)]

*  That would be the number one spot ability. I gotta say I gotta see what were you guys doing? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2894.04s)]
*  Like how'd you do this? Well, then show me how you wonder rock. Yeah. Well, I think there was water flowing through that area [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2897.96s)]
*  Well, there definitely was the Nile rivers there well the Nile yeah [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2903.64s)]
*  But I'm talking about right next to the pyramid like why do you think that because there's no fucking way if you ever there's no way [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2906.8399999999997s)]
*  They move that shit through sand. Yeah, they're like, oh they rolled them on logs motherfucker [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2913.24s)]
*  That's saying those logs just gonna sink into the sand. Well, it wasn't necessarily sand back then [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2916.7999999999997s)]
*  See, this is the crazy thing about the that area is that? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2921.6s)]
*  where there where there's [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2926.6s)]
*  Like the Sahara Desert used to be vast Greenlands [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2929.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2932.64s)]
*  it used to be like a jungle and it receded and became a jar it became this what we see now all the sand and [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2932.88s)]
*  Egypt in the early days like 9000 BC. I believe that it they had it was a rainforest [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2939.88s)]
*  Yeah, so like that same area where now it's just sand and dry. It was like torrential downpours all the time [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2946.88s)]
*  That's one of the ways Pangea, right? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2954.08s)]
*  When we had just one continent it was just a tropical [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2956.12s)]
*  Things a giant giant island. That was a long-ass time ago. Yeah, this is not that long ago [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2960.44s)]
*  But this when they're talking about the dates of the pyramids one of the first [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2966.2999999999997s)]
*  Pieces of evidence that they discovered was there's a guy named. Dr. Robert shock out of Boston University [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2971.2s)]
*  He's a geologist and he was examining the temple the Sphinx and he was like this is [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2977.52s)]
*  Water erosion it's like there's thousands of years of rainfall that's caused this erosion and all the other [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2983.32s)]
*  Archaeologists like there's no way this is impossible because the last time it rained in the Nile Valley was like [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2989.2000000000003s)]
*  9000 BC [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2994.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's really nuts. So that means it was thousands of years of rainfall before that [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=2996.6400000000003s)]
*  So that means these things have to be [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3001.0s)]
*  12,000 15,000 years old 20,000 years old [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3003.5200000000004s)]

*  Yeah, granite and marble and fucking fuck it. They used to have gold capped on the cap on the top [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3047.6000000000004s)]
*  Like it's smooth limestone. It's [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3053.88s)]
*  perfectly fucking smooth [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3056.76s)]

*  What was there before them if you want to if you don't believe that cities are built on top of cities go to fucking [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3071.02s)]
*  Europe, right? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3075.12s)]
*  You know and look and see how every fucking city is built on another one [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3075.86s)]
*  Yeah, where they came in and then fucking knocked their shit down and built right on top of you [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3079.5s)]
*  Yeah, they find that in Mexico City, too. Yeah, they're always digging around they find like Aztec stuff and they have to stop [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3083.06s)]
*  Yeah, fuck man. And what was before that? Right? What was before that? Like when did they start? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3088.7s)]
*  When did civilization actually start was it 30,000 years ago? Like when when was it? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3094.2599999999998s)]
*  Thousand yeah, well they keep predating modern humans too. They used to think or they keep moving the date rather [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3099.1s)]
*  They used to think modern humans were like fifty thousand a hundred thousand years old now. They're getting close to like a million [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3105.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of time to learn shit. I mean think about the difference between a hundred thousand and a million [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3110.14s)]
*  Yeah, we'll think about the difference between the Viking times and now yeah, not that long not that long like that [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3115.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, electricity changed a lot of shit too. Yeah, once electricity in the internet [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3121.98s)]

*  it's like every time some new thing happens everything moves much much faster and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3132.78s)]
*  So who knows what the fuck they figured out back then they I think they had some completely different technology [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3138.14s)]
*  That's what I think. I think it was wiped out when the Comets hit I think yeah, I think whatever hammered by those fucking [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3142.98s)]
*  There's real evidence for it to like real core sample evidence of the earth [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3150.78s)]
*  It shows that the earth got hit during that period of time so it's a it's a very valid theory, but it's one that's mainstream [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3154.86s)]
*  They don't want to embrace it because they've been teaching in a different way for so long [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3163.38s)]
*  Well think about like Atlantis right mm-hmm like that was like the downfall of Atlantis right was when those fucking comments it and [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3166.76s)]

*  Mm-hmm where it's fucking like a volcano erupted and just wiped the whole civilization out. Yep froze people froze them have you on there? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3176.2200000000003s)]

*  And just a few miles away like oh, why are we here? What why did we build a city right here by volcano? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3189.7s)]
*  Oh, I was there's an there's a thing on Netflix about natural disasters now [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3197.1s)]

*  Yeah, my I killed my first white tail with a bow and I was just about 13 [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3485.06s)]
*  So that's when I and my stepdad would he was he'd like to hunt to every now and then you know he was into it [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3490.2999999999997s)]
*  But he would just take me in the woods once a year and fucking sit me under a tree [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3495.5s)]
*  Don't fucking move alright, and I'd sit there and freeze [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3498.7799999999997s)]
*  And he'd go, but I got you know just sitting there. You'd see fucking deer come close [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3502.2999999999997s)]

*  Yeah, I didn't really like enjoy shooting him with a gun so I just like [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3508.38s)]
*  Once I got a bow in my hand I was like oh a full-blown addict like right away [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3512.3799999999997s)]
*  It's such a different experience isn't it yeah? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3516.22s)]
*  There's something primal about it. Yeah, it taps into some strange area of your brain and [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3519.04s)]
*  Because it's silent too like it's like such a because you're sneaking up you have to be quiet [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3525.06s)]
*  There's no boom yeah, the boom is like Cam Hanson's always said that that the boom of the gun [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3531.18s)]
*  Just always felt out of place to him [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3536.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, like you're in the wilderness everything's peaceful and beautiful and natural and primal and then boom [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3538.46s)]
*  And I have nothing against rifle hunters man like there's there's a need for all that shit [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3546.06s)]
*  But did I just the bow hunting the snap of the bow mm-hmm like that? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3550.02s)]
*  And then you the whack of the duck and the pop of the lungs popping also the skill involved in the archery [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3553.98s)]
*  You have to practice so much you have to practice so much [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3559.58s)]
*  It has to be a part of you you have to just like in your mind [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3562.3s)]
*  Just like yeah, you anchor that I use a nose button so when I anchor that nose button [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3565.5400000000004s)]
*  It's like everything is you know like that mountain lion hunt [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3570.2200000000003s)]
*  Did I that was the one of the most physically demanding things I've ever done really so how did this come about? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3573.5s)]
*  This is a mountain lion that was killing people's dogs. Yeah, well no [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3578.6200000000003s)]
*  That's the thing it's not there was in that area [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3582.1800000000003s)]
*  Dogs get fucking killed by mountain lions all the time in Colorado in general like it happens all the time like up in Boulder [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3585.3s)]
*  They took a cat from they took a lion from Boulder and moved it out to like, Netherlands [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3591.38s)]
*  You lived up in Boulder, so you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, the Netherlands area my dog are killed by a mountain lion, right? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3594.94s)]
*  I oh yeah, I heard this story [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3598.82s)]
*  Yeah, so they moved this lion instead of like killing the lion [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3600.46s)]
*  Which is what they should have done because once it's used to eating that kind of food [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3603.54s)]
*  It's not going back to chasing deer and shit now [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3606.14s)]
*  It's gonna go take the easy meal and kill the little dogs right of course well [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3608.44s)]
*  They took that lion and moved it out to Netherlands it killed 15 dogs in 30 days [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3611.94s)]
*  And then they had to kill it so you have to manage that population [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3616.2200000000003s)]
*  But what happened was Alex is out? He's actually sitting out there right now Alex called me [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3619.8s)]
*  Hey, we got a fresh snow you want to come up and you know drive up here and hunt a lion [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3623.02s)]
*  I said yeah, let's go [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3626.78s)]
*  So I grabbed my bow and drove up there. You know four in the morning, and we just started driving around trying to cut tracks with [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3628.34s)]
*  the hounds [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3634.26s)]
*  So we're you know we're driving driving [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3635.54s)]
*  Find a couple smaller tracks, and then we find this big track coming across across the road like oh, that's a big fucking lion [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3637.94s)]
*  So we get out and look at check it out. He had a fucking mule deer [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3645.3s)]
*  Just he just killed this mule deer. He was like steaming still under the tree [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3648.26s)]
*  He had ripped it you could see its guts all hanging out because it was eating it and shit [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3652.6000000000004s)]
*  These fucking things are crazy [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3655.98s)]
*  This giant mule deer four by four full grown under this tree [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3658.0200000000004s)]
*  And then we look and we see it going back and forth from this porch [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3661.48s)]
*  So it's going from this guy's porch that were to this to this kill going back and forth [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3665.46s)]
*  That's where it was denned up was under that fucking porch [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3670.46s)]
*  We didn't see it under there [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3672.84s)]
*  But you can see that that's where he was sleeping like that's where he was fucking hanging out because it was easy kill [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3673.78s)]
*  And for him he had dogs and fucking deer and literally any whatever he wanted that because it's there's a lot of public [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3678.12s)]
*  Hiking trails that go right up through there. Oh [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3685.56s)]
*  So and this is like a dude ranch right so and we knocked on the door and the guy didn't answer [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3687.8399999999997s)]
*  So we were like fuck so we called a bunch of different landowners around the area trying to neighbors and shit [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3693.44s)]
*  and we then we started hearing stories about oh yeah last year this lion killed a dog and [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3698.3599999999997s)]
*  He's been hurt. There's a there's one that's harassing my dogs now this woman said [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3702.96s)]

*  She's like cuz there's like three or four of them running around here [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3708.98s)]
*  And there's like sheep herds and deer herds and elk herds all through there, so it's like prime lion country [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3711.46s)]
*  They have all the food they could want but when you have one big alpha [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3716.2999999999997s)]
*  He's gonna. He literally like hoards all the food and kills kittens [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3720.62s)]
*  He'll kill kittens to like make sure he gets the food so killing a big Tom is what you want [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3724.8999999999996s)]
*  That's what you want to go after big full mature Tom because it's good for the the lion population is good for the deer popular [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3730.8599999999997s)]
*  it's good for just conservation in general and [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3736.74s)]
*  In this case it was good for the neighbors because he was being he was living imagine a 220 pound [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=3739.18s)]

*  It just always a dream that I would always dreamed about so when I put my hands on that elk man like nothing compares to that like [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4521.06s)]
*  Nothing nothing that I've done in my life [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4527.3s)]
*  Like physically done compares to that that's incredible [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4529.42s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm hooked. I'm hooked on it, and then I went oh so right after I shot that mule deer up there [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4533.700000000001s)]
*  I went straight down to fucking saw wash, Colorado and shot this 400 pound giant fork buck [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4538.280000000001s)]
*  Giant like a 200 inch frame [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4544.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow he only had a family had forks and his fucking bases were like couldn't get my hands around him and he weighed 400 pounds [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4547.24s)]
*  400 pound deal dear if the processor that I took him to thought it was a fucking cow elk wow he was like [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4554.04s)]
*  This is a mule deer. I said yeah. He's like holy shit. You know he's like this might be a state record [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4559.64s)]
*  it was like I don't care about records and shit like that, but [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4564.58s)]
*  You know honey is it's so [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4568.2s)]
*  It's I mean you could say it's primal, but you are using a compound bow with cams [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  And you have a site that's geared up exactly for the range of your arrows, but there's something about it [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4575.96s)]
*  That's it taps into this [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4581.72s)]
*  Ancient DNA it does something where it you know when people would hunt back in the day [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4583.92s)]
*  That's how they stayed alive right and there's a thrill. There's like a human reward [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4590.58s)]
*  Involved in in collecting wild game. That's not like anything else [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4595.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I think eventually I'll get into that stick bow hunting a little more [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4599.28s)]
*  But I'm not gonna just fucking grab a stick bow and got in the woods and be a dummy and shoot just wound animals [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4603.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I want to be fucking dialed in on that shit [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4608.8s)]
*  And I like my compound because I could fucking shoot him at you know 90 yards if I have to it's also [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4611.820000000001s)]
*  It's more effective in terms of like the penetration is so much more kinetic force to it. You could kill him much easier [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4616.7s)]
*  I have a 33 inch draw. I'm pulling 80 pounds. I could send a fucking butter knife through it [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4623.18s)]
*  Yeah, and it's gonna penetrate do you use fixed heads or mechanicals both? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4627.62s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on what I'm hunting right so like I like using these sever broadheads that those are great those I love them [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4632.14s)]
*  Yeah, but uh and I like them mostly cuz I could practice with them mm-hmm [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4638.46s)]
*  That's why I usually don't like those mechanicals because I can't practice with what I'm gonna actually be hunting with right because you've you know [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4643.54s)]
*  You fuck them up when you do that mm-hmm shooting them into targets and shit [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4649.1s)]
*  But these things you can just like consistently shoot that thing and it's perfect [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4652.02s)]
*  Yeah, they have it set up where there's a little screw you can tighten it down [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4655.34s)]
*  Doesn't the the blades don't extend yeah, those are really effective too because they move around bone [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4658.860000000001s)]
*  Right you know because of the pivot system that they've developed yeah it teeters and it's only two that come out right [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4665.34s)]
*  They start topping they come out like this and they're fucking kind of long right mm-hmm and it teeters like this [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4671.1s)]
*  And it's to me. That's fucking genius. It's genius. Yeah, those are some of my favorite [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4676.46s)]
*  Mechanicals, but I really you slip it in right behind that shoulder sometimes [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4681.9800000000005s)]
*  You'll catch the shoulder or a rib or something you know and instead of it like stopping it [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4685.42s)]
*  It just kind of slides by it. You know does this you know maximum damage when it gets in there and [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4689.54s)]
*  Altive like that elk you know I shot him at 42 yards [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4695.22s)]
*  Right behind the shoulder, and he was only like 80 yards on the other side of the hill [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4697.9400000000005s)]
*  And he didn't have like this violent miserable death. He died quick. You know yeah [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4701.22s)]
*  That's the only time they've died like that every other time they die like that. It's from wolves and cats [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4705.92s)]
*  They get eaten asshole first or they freeze to death or they freeze yeah, yeah imagine that [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=4711.7s)]

*  Yeah, and they they nip at their legs and take their hamstrings out. Yeah [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5322.42s)]
*  That's like somebody slicing your fucking Achilles tendon and watching you crawl [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5326.86s)]
*  Yeah [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5330.54s)]
*  Eating your eating asshole first and they're so smart [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5331.54s)]
*  Like the way they do it is so interesting because there's some kind of communication like different wolves know their jobs [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5335.02s)]
*  They'll chase them into a pack of other ones that are waiting. They'll you know, they'll bottleneck them. They're so smart [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5341.22s)]
*  I was watching the one they had they lost an elk, right? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5346.98s)]
*  They didn't get it and the other wolves were like throwing shade at the wolf that like took him off the trail [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5349.98s)]
*  They were like throwing shade at him like they were fucking snipping at him and fucking looking at him weird like whoa [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5356.66s)]
*  He like had to hang in the back of the pack for like, you know a little bit like it was fucking wild man [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5362.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're so social. That's well think about when they have an alpha [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5366.98s)]
*  They'll kill they try to kill like the other out the other ones that are trying to be the alpha [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5369.7s)]
*  They'll just all attack him at the same time and he has to fight them all off [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5373.139999999999s)]
*  Think about that shit and you're all living together sleeping in the woods. Yeah [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5377.299999999999s)]
*  Like fighting over bitches [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5381.419999999999s)]
*  Literally bitches [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5383.7s)]
*  Out there in the snow, it's wild to think about like I'm glad they're out there though [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5390.5s)]
*  Yeah, I really am like I don't like the idea of eradicating wolves [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5394.98s)]
*  but I just wish that they would have a real understanding of managing assess yeah, there's a necessity to it and these these [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5398.099999999999s)]
*  Animal groups animal rights groups. They don't they don't think that way at all and they they I get their perspective, too [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5406.22s)]
*  They just want these animals to thrive and they want us to leave them alone and they want them to exist peacefully like [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5413.58s)]
*  California's model seems to [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5419.34s)]
*  Ultimately be the eradication of hunting eventually and just have animals working out amongst themselves. Yeah, which is [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5421.26s)]
*  You know, it's I hate that idea. It's a weird idea because in some ways it's been effective with deer [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5428.780000000001s)]
*  Like if you think about it the deer population in California like all around Los Angeles is so low [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5435.22s)]
*  like I used to live in the the valley which is like [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5440.66s)]
*  30 minutes outside of LA and there was occasionally see a couple of deer here or there but it's because there's cats everywhere [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5443.62s)]
*  Yeah, they'll kill one a week. Yeah one or two a week. Yes. The populations are pretty fucking low. Whereas out here in Texas a [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5450.22s)]
*  Mountain lion is basically a coyote. You just fucking shoot him. Yeah, there's no [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5457.38s)]
*  Restrictions they're thought of as like varmints. Yeah, so if you see a mountain lion in your yard, you just blow them away [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5461.9400000000005s)]
*  So there's deer everywhere out here like it's totally different experience like everywhere I go there's deer and I'm like [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5467.18s)]
*  Oh, this is what California would be like if they manage their alliance. There would be deer everywhere. Yeah, I mean it's it's like prime deer country [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5473.5s)]
*  That's what deer want to live is that kind of shit, you know? Yeah, but so well in Colorado in Colorado [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5479.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I know that the mountain lion is like the only big cat on the planet that's thriving [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5485.06s)]
*  Right, they're all doing pretty good, but the mountain lions are like they're fucking thriving [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5490.42s)]
*  Yeah, and especially North America. So and that is that is in part [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5494.099999999999s)]
*  It's not just because of what California does but it like in Colorado every unit has a quota [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5498.099999999999s)]
*  on how many lions based on all their scientific numbers that they fucking pull out and I mean these guys are in the field these [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5503.54s)]
*  CPW guys are out in the field giving information and [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5509.339999999999s)]
*  Lion numbers they have collared collared lions [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5512.54s)]
*  They keep them they have game trail cameras that they watch them on [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5514.799999999999s)]
*  So they know everything they need to know about them [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5517.66s)]
*  So they know what kind of numbers that they have and how many need to be taken out to keep everything balanced in the area [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5519.96s)]
*  So humans and animals can all live together in the area, right? Like shit's gonna happen [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5526.74s)]
*  That's just the way it goes like somebody's gonna get attacked sometimes by a lion like that's what happens when you live up there. Yeah, right [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5531.44s)]
*  But you should you should still be allowed to hunt them [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5538.14s)]
*  So you have to take an exam you take an exam to get the license [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5540.26s)]
*  They make you take an exam online to even get the license [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5543.68s)]
*  So you you learn everything you can about lions about their gender and how do you identify a male lion? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5546.160000000001s)]
*  And what does this spot it's like a little black spot that that you can see that it shows that it's a male [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5551.26s)]
*  You know, where's the spot that on the back here like on their legs? No, it's like [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5556.54s)]
*  Where the dick in their gooch? Yeah, like they gooch [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5561.04s)]
*  It's a spot they like that's the identifier like that's a fucking he's got a dick, you know, right [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5564.52s)]
*  So I didn't know that though going into this I learned something, you know, just just do it just taking this exam and [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5569.5599999999995s)]
*  Then you buy your license and then you have to as soon as you kill the lion [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5576.639999999999s)]
*  You have to check that fucker in right away or else they'll fucking ding you and you don't want to get dinged by the CPW [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5579.88s)]
*  Because they'll fucking stick like a five-year ban on your license, you know [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5584.5199999999995s)]
*  Mm-hmm, so they'll they'll find any reason to get you then the meat has to be processed for human consumption [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5587.48s)]
*  They come and they take a minute. You have to when I say check it in it's not just call them [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5592.8s)]
*  They got to come and look at the line they came and weighed the Cape and meat and that's what that's what was 173 [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5596.24s)]
*  That's where I got that number. I didn't fucking care about weighing it, you know [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5601.92s)]
*  But you have to take the meat and make it ready for human consumption [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5606.5599999999995s)]
*  You can't like discard any of it has to all be used [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5609.639999999999s)]
*  Which is wild because up in Wyoming. They don't they don't give a shit. They're just like if you kill a bear [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5612.8s)]
*  They don't care. Yeah, that's a lot of the places that hunt bears like that [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5617.26s)]
*  Did you know that in the early days the pioneers preferred bear and they they use bear for meat and deer were just for [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5621.04s)]
*  Hides well, they use their fat. They used to use the fat for everything too. Yeah. Yeah, so I think I don't know [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5626.2s)]
*  Have you had bear? Yeah, you like it. It's good. I think it's pretty good. It's not a lion [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5632.34s)]
*  No, the rivets are cooked. I haven't had lion but the rivets will cook it for you. Like Jen Jen's a master chef [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5636.22s)]
*  Okay, she's good. I guess you're not supposed to call him a chef unless they run a kitchen. We found that out recently [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5641.64s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah chef is like the person who runs the kitchen a cook is [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5646.08s)]
*  Actually cooking it but she's she's fantastic at it [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5650.36s)]
*  She when we're up there she cooked a roast and it was a bear roast and she slow cooked it in the Traeger [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5653.52s)]
*  For like 16 hours. It was insane. It was so good. I mean you could put a turd on that fucking [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5659.76s)]
*  I use that Traeger for everything. They're great. It's so convenient too. It's so easy to do you do it on your dump some pellets and fuck [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5666.2s)]
*  Easy, you know what I started doing out here though. I started using an offset smoker. What's that? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5672.68s)]
*  You know like those old-school Texas like Terry black style smokers like where you start the fire [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5677.3s)]
*  You're sorry over here with logs and the smoke filters into the the main chamber and you cook your meat and that oh my god [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5682.820000000001s)]
*  It's it even better. It's so good. It's so smoky [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5689.12s)]
*  It's like it in part real hardwood look Traeger is amazing because it is real hardwood and but it's pellets and it's super convenient [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5692.5s)]
*  And you can there's a setting called super smoke or if you use that which is great. It gives more smoke flavor [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5699.78s)]
*  But there's nothing really like actual logs right there's nothing really like actual hard work on it [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5705.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, this is what I have. What's this company out here in Texas called send tech smokers [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5710.86s)]
*  that was a [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5715.98s)]
*  First time I cooked baby back ribs [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5717.42s)]
*  so there's like a fire off in the side and you close the lid on that thing and [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5719.0599999999995s)]
*  It's amazing and you you could [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5723.3s)]
*  It's easy to maintain and everything fuck yeah, it's so easy [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5727.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's not hard at all like I thought it'd be real complicated to maintain the temperature [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5731.179999999999s)]
*  But you just got to give it some time. So what happens is I start off, you know, like, ah, there we go [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5735.12s)]
*  Okay, send tech smokers. So I start off like an hour now. He's a great guy, too [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5739.82s)]
*  He's got a very cool Instagram page. You can see his work [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5744.54s)]
*  So I'll start off the cook a couple hours before I'm thinking about cooking so I get everything dialed in [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5747.179999999999s)]
*  I know like where the baffle should be I get it up to you know, like 250 ish and it's amazing for reverse searing [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5753.62s)]
*  Steaks and elk meat too. Well, I'll take it and that's [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5760.9s)]
*  So that's the it's got a charcoal grill on it on the side of it as well [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5766.58s)]
*  So once it's done smoking then I do it with high heat and I just sear the outside after it's done [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5770.46s)]
*  I got it. I need one of these. Yeah. Well if you're in Texas, it's it's like Texas tradition offset smokers [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5776.0199999999995s)]
*  But what would you say your favorite meat is? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5783.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's my favorite. It's my it's my favorite [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5786.9s)]

*  But man elk hunting is the best elk my favorite eating elk is the best. I killed a Neil guy recently [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5793.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's very interesting. I heard they're pretty good eating really good really good. I still prefer elk but just [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5801.38s)]
*  It's tough to hunt those things. They're so tough to kill. Yeah, this is what's crazy [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5809.54s)]
*  They evolve around tigers, yeah, and they're a big elk size animal and [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5814.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so I hit this animal perfect it was a perfect shot at like 52 yards clean pass through [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5820.3s)]
*  Like broadside quartering away. Wow. I mean, I'm like I said like I have my pin on them [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5828.9400000000005s)]
*  Perfect release the arrow I hear the WAP hit him and then he takes off like there's nothing wrong with him [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5835.42s)]

*  I'm like, holy shit that I did I hit it bad like like you start all these then we found the arrow the arrows 30 [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5852.14s)]
*  Yards past his body past where he was standing when he got hit fully covered in blood [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5858.38s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, this is a this arrow looks like a dead animal. We have to find this guy [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5863.66s)]
*  You got air bubbles in the blood yeah, he's fucked but they don't bleed there's no blood trail. Oh, they're a different animal [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5868.34s)]
*  They're so different the guys are saying we never find blood even when they shoot him with rifles. They don't find blood Wow [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5875.16s)]
*  They're their their skin is so tough and there's something about evolving around tigers [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5880.62s)]

*  Hole it went through here out here right past the front shoulder double lunged him [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5892.1s)]
*  He ran 130 yards full clip before he died [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5897.0s)]
*  Probably only took a couple of seconds for him to run 130. Yeah, he was there but we never found any blood [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5900.04s)]
*  We had to like grid the area until we found them. That's fucking wild man [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5904.96s)]
*  There the guy told me that when they hunt them [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5908.48s)]
*  They'll have the the client with a rifle so the client will shoot it [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5911.8s)]
*  But the guide will have one of the one round in the chamber ready to go [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5916.14s)]
*  Yeah, cuz when it takes off running they don't want to lose it [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5919.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm like because they'll lose it in that big mesquite brush that shit is fucking miserable [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5921.6s)]

*  like if you have a bad shot at all like if you have a [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5983.24s)]
*  Questionable shot on an elk you could hang back and trail them and usually you can get another shot in them [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5987.56s)]
*  Or he's gonna die. Yeah, but with the Neil guy they run so fast and so I mean [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5992.94s)]
*  I never saw an animal move that fast after I got hit with a perfect arrow [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=5997.06s)]
*  It was just cuz you hit an elk perfect like [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6000.08s)]
*  They stop there's the elk are like super clumsy too [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6003.4800000000005s)]

*  I want to try to get him to like stand up when I don't have full draw [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6064.799999999999s)]
*  I'm up there like antagonizing him trying to get a fucking stand. That's not necessary [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6073.08s)]
*  That's one thing they have it imported down here in Texas. It's like they have everything else here, you know elk is not [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6077.36s)]
*  It's not a tagged animal here. It's not a managed animal like it is in Colorado and everywhere else [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6084.16s)]
*  It's not a bunch of them in a high fence at high fences [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6089.5199999999995s)]
*  Not even in high fences even in low fences like they just have elk out here and it's almost like an invasive animal [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6091.68s)]
*  Really? It's so weird because you can hunt elk 365 days a year in Texas [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6097.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, you can always harvest the meat. Yeah, I see Ted Nugent always talking about [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6103.04s)]
*  Texas yeah, Texas elk. Well the Texas wildlife model is very different because it's mostly private land out here [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6107.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's 90% right? Yeah [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6114.56s)]
*  And there's most of the animals like when you have these big private ranches a good percentage of them are from other countries [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6116.12s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of Indian animals a lot of African animals and it's amazing to see like the place that was out of [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6122.24s)]

*  Yeah [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6154.48s)]
*  There's more tigers in captivity in Texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6155.0s)]
*  That's I mean that that's almost scary [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6161.56s)]
*  What happens if these? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6164.96s)]
*  There's thousands of tigers in Texas thousands thousands of tigers Bengal tigers [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6167.16s)]
*  All kinds of tigers all kinds like they got everything what kind of tiger you need? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6172.76s)]
*  You just have to drive like real deep into the ranch [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6182.320000000001s)]
*  Well the size of these fucking ranches here are insane right like [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6188.92s)]
*  30,000 acres [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6194.04s)]

*  Unbelievable, it's so much fun to go up there. Yeah, it's just just to drive around this you're gonna own a ranch [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6231.68s)]
*  That's where you own one. Yeah, Wyoming, Montana like that kind of shit like damn. That's what I've been trying [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6236.28s)]
*  I've been looking for I have a place in Fairplay, Colorado [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6243.0s)]
*  So it's like South Park just south of Breckenridge, you know, I'm talking about right and I bordered million acres of National Forest [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6245.28s)]
*  I have 70 acres to myself, but the rest is National Forest [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6250.72s)]
*  Oh wow, and it's like it gets pretty Western when we get out there [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6254.12s)]
*  You just go back there start walking you start coming across lion tracks and bear tracks and that's my favorite hunting term when things get Western [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6257.68s)]
*  Yeah [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6265.04s)]
*  Yeah, you want it. That's what you're looking for. I'm looking for an adventure man [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6265.76s)]
*  I wanted I don't want to just step out of my truck and be like all [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6268.84s)]
*  Swap and then get back in the truck and leave now, of course. Yeah, that's not what I'm looking for man. That's why [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6271.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, it's crazy to me because you probably buy a lot of lot of land under tags, right? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6277.96s)]
*  Yeah, so that's how I do it like I'm because I'm building points right now [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6281.599999999999s)]
*  So I still put in and apply for that stuff, but I can afford it [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6285.599999999999s)]
*  So I just buy the tags, you know, but some of these fucking tags like the Western Hun Expo [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6288.84s)]
*  This guy bought a fucking deer tag for seven hundred and twenty five thousand dollars [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6294.88s)]
*  Where is it Arizona Arizona statewide gov tag for mule deer? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6298.88s)]
*  So he knows he's gonna kill it, you know, he's but all that money goes towards conservation it's all yeah [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6303.68s)]
*  So he writes off a model. It's an amazing model [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6308.78s)]
*  the the tag model in the Pittman Robertson Act and what they've done with, you know, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6311.88s)]
*  The percentage of all sales of goods of hunting gear and outdoor gear all goes to conservation [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6316.68s)]
*  It's an amazing model. Yeah, a lot of people aren't aware of that [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6322.5199999999995s)]
*  But that the vast majority of the money that goes towards animal conservation in this country comes from people buying bullets [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6325.639999999999s)]
*  People buying rifles and bows. That's where the money comes from. Yeah. Well, did you see in Colorado? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6332.66s)]
*  They're trying to get rid of the over-the-counter elk tag [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6337.3s)]
*  Why? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6339.42s)]
*  because [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6340.900000000001s)]
*  In-state hunters are pissed off about these out-of-staters being able to get the same, you know [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6342.9800000000005s)]
*  Getting to hunt the same areas as they do [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6348.22s)]
*  Because with that point most people don't understand how those points I didn't even understand until I started really getting into it [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6350.22s)]
*  About how hard it is to actually draw tags and coveted areas takes years [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6356.14s)]
*  It might be a light once-in-a-lifetime opportunity sure for most of these areas. Yeah, like my where my cabin is [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6360.02s)]
*  I have to wait six years to hunt it. It's a six-point draw [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6364.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow, it might take nine years, you know [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6368.42s)]
*  And this I want because I you can't get a landowner tag unless you have 160,000 or 160 continuous acres [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6371.02s)]
*  Mmm, so like I'm just I'm just half of that, right? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6376.3s)]
*  So I need double this to get even a even one tag and there's elk everywhere like in September [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6379.740000000001s)]
*  They're just ripping bugles all through the backyard. Wow, that's gotta be wild. It's pretty cool. Just sit on your porch [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=6384.9400000000005s)]

*  I have routines in the patterns more than just the actual activities [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=7202.74s)]
*  It varies just on the time of the year and also my physical state [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=7206.76s)]

*  So I don't really have a real set thing [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=7222.84s)]

*  And then they send it to another country while we got fucking literal people that fought and almost died and gave their life up [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8029.360000000001s)]
*  But basically for our country and they're fucking sleeping in a tent with mental illness problems and no therapy no counseling [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8035.68s)]

*  You know, they're like, well you got a vote this way in that way [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8054.639999999999s)]
*  It's like you could do all that voting but the lobbyists are what are doing all the fucking shady shit in the back [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8056.639999999999s)]

*  This is all at a level that regular voting doesn't stop doesn't stop [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8066.88s)]
*  I mean unless you get some very headstrong [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8071.839999999999s)]
*  Politician like some JFK type dude who puts a stop to everything they did to him exactly and they just admitted it and people are [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8076.12s)]
*  Like well, whatever sort of admitted it. Yeah, I mean, it's a slow trickle. It's like they're admitting that kovat was a lab leak [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8082.16s)]
*  It's like this slow trickle. Yeah, they give it to you slowly [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8088.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's it's a smart strategy instead of all at once saying we were wrong you slowly say it seems we were wrong [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8092.0s)]
*  There's a low probability that we were wrong [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8099.839999999999s)]
*  There's a [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8102.36s)]
*  Reasonable probability that we were wrong and then it just keeps getting more and more. Yeah, we were wrong. It's the same with the vaccine [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8103.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna be this it's the same with a lot of things man [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8109.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and these narratives that get pushed on mainstream media or it's it's shocking how they don't feel bad for what they do [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8112.18s)]
*  It's shocking. It's shocking because these people are all like evil narcissist motherfuckers [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8119.4s)]
*  Like I don't even know if they're evil. I think they're captured. I think they're captured by [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8125.92s)]
*  Institution that revolves around advertising revenue and that's heavily sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and all sorts of other corporations [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8132.6s)]
*  Was sponsored by Pfizer. I know how about that the devil dance that that did do did at the Grammys and it says brought to you by [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8139.76s)]
*  Pfizer dude, like you just showed the devil and a bunch and you're basically saying you sponsor the devil [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8146.5599999999995s)]
*  Like what I'm not even a religious person. I'm not like a person who's like into the devil, but I see that I'm like this [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8153.88s)]
*  If you if you want to drive conspiracy theorists nuts [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8160.88s)]
*  This is how especially Christians like Christians who don't want this like tubby, dude [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8165.04s)]
*  Wearing a fucking devil outfit dancing around Tim Dillon said he looks like a plumber [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8170.96s)]
*  He looks can you pull it can you pull it up done that on purpose? Can you pull that up? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8174.8s)]
*  Decided to play that Pfizer the piece after that knowing what everyone would get their no panties in a bunch [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8179.160000000001s)]
*  Well, I think Pfizer was probably already sponsoring it, but they had to know that that graphic was gonna go over [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8184.0s)]
*  They didn't they were not an official sponsor of the event [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8190.64s)]
*  But they did sponsor the broadcast and they didn't get to say what when that piece went. Oh, I didn't mean Pfizer [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8193.92s)]
*  I mean the people that put together the broadcast they knew that that ad was gonna go up [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8199.08s)]
*  That's right. I'm like whoever is in control of running those pieces at the end was like that's probably this if someone's really funny [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8202.6s)]
*  They'll be saying that's very funny. Yeah, I mean I could have done that [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8208.36s)]
*  It's also a very good strategy in terms of getting people to make that video go viral and for that dude [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=8212.32s)]

*  They're doing a big bare-knuckle card. Have you seen this? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9767.32s)]
*  Luke Rockhold is fighting Mike Perry [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9771.4s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit and Chad who's Chad Mendes fighting? He's fighting someone really good, too [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9774.84s)]
*  Pull it up it's on my Instagram. No, it's not it's on Luke Rockhold's Instagram [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9783.0s)]
*  It's a wild wild card [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9788.039999999999s)]
*  It's like they're getting like real MMA stars like Luke Rockhold's a star like having a rock hold [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9790.519999999999s)]
*  Chad's a star. Yes, dudes. That's right. He's fighting Eddie Alvarez. That's right. Whoo. That's crazy [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9797.199999999999s)]
*  That's a crazy fight also Ben Rothwell, but Mike Perry and Luke Rockhold that is [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9804.8s)]
*  The money's like in these fights must be giving them big money because Luke Rockhold makes a lot of money in the UFC [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9811.119999999999s)]
*  But he said it was way more than he made in the UFC [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9816.14s)]
*  So I assume Luke Rockhold makes a lot of money in the UFC. I shouldn't say that [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9818.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how much he actually gets paid. I'm sure it's a it was the champion [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9822.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know at one point time mean Luke Rockhold in his prime was a motherfucker. I know he was fucking good [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9825.72s)]
*  He's fun to watch too, it's kind of interesting seeing [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9832.2s)]
*  This is dope. Oh my god [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9836.48s)]
*  Oh, I know they've given they've they've given conversations to him or they've had conversations with him [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9838.48s)]
*  I should say so has Bellator so has a lot of these who would fight him bare-knuckles [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9845.08s)]
*  Some person wants to get punched [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9850.76s)]
*  Knuckles it's gotta be somebody if they come up with enough money. There's dudes out there that would do it [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9854.16s)]
*  That I mean did the fighting bare-knuckle your face is gonna get fucked up like your face gets fucked up [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9858.84s)]
*  They have gnarly cuts a [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9863.48s)]
*  Lot of the scars and shit all over the fall all over the face. You're getting cut a lot [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9865.76s)]
*  It's just that bone but my thought was like that's how MMA should be [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9870.92s)]
*  MMA really shouldn't have gloves on I think so too [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9876.12s)]
*  You you're really having it you have a false sense of confidence what you could do with your fists because this is not really [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9879.56s)]
*  Designed for punching things no design for grabbing things grabbing [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9884.64s)]
*  Yeah, elbows are way better for striking and knees and kicks are way better for striking, but your hands break so easy [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9888.34s)]
*  But when you wrap them up in gloves and then put a foam pad over then you could throw [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9895.359999999999s)]
*  It's weird because it's the only thing in your whole weapons arsenal that you're you're allowed to cover up with padding and make more effective [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9902.039999999999s)]
*  You don't do that with your elbows [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9909.96s)]
*  You don't do that with your knees [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9911.720000000001s)]
*  With your elbows like if you're gonna try to protect somebody yeah [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9913.960000000001s)]
*  But that's the wrapping of your hands and everything that's protect your own fists [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9917.16s)]
*  It protects your own fists, but it does allow you to hit harder too because you could be more indiscriminate with your punches [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9920.720000000001s)]
*  I think it these that didn't the cage fighting start without mm-hmm. They started without them and then yeah zero weight classes, too [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9926.2s)]
*  Yep, that was fucking wild. Yeah, you got the clip of the little dude with the fucking giant [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9932.56s)]
*  Which little one of the first fights that they ever had seen I don't think was it hoist [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9937.4s)]
*  Who did he fight? [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9941.68s)]
*  It wasn't a guy in a gi though. No this there was a lot of those mismatches in terms of size wise [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9943.32s)]
*  There's Keith Hackney. He fought a manual Yarborough a manual Yarborough was a sumo wrestler who was like [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9948.960000000001s)]
*  fucking 350 400 pounds mean how big is a manual yeah, and then 200 versus 600 600 [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9955.800000000001s)]
*  Well, they they lied a little bit, but Keith Hackney was probably about 200 so Keith Hackney's I believe he's a karate guy [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9962.0s)]
*  That's him came out [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9969.12s)]
*  That's Keith Hackney and the size difference is fucking crazy when you see it when they're actually going after each other [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9970.24s)]
*  So manual Yarborough is walking towards them look how small Keith Hackney is yeah [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9976.68s)]
*  He's so much smaller, but he hit him with like basically like a bitch slap Wow [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9980.6s)]
*  Wow oh [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9986.52s)]
*  Shit, it's crazy. I mean imagine that guy being on top of you. That's a big slip up right there [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9988.16s)]
*  Yeah, he fucked up, so he give it he gets back up to his feet and he cracks him again and again [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9992.52s)]
*  You don't want to lose to a guy that's that much smaller than you [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=9998.880000000001s)]
*  But how much time can a manual do this oh right through the cage right through the cage see but manuals already exhausted [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10001.44s)]
*  To be that fat I mean he's so overweight [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10008.12s)]
*  There's no way he can maintain this is wild Keith Hackney. Just has to kind of survive past that first 30 seconds I [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10011.76s)]
*  Mean I don't even know what kind of training a manual did for this he might have just he was a he was a sumo guy [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10018.52s)]
*  I [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10023.6s)]
*  Think he's just walking him down and gum yeah, it does look like he's chewing oh you seem to hit him right [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10025.04s)]
*  He's chewing gum. Yeah, is that his mouthpiece or is it gum? He's chewing gum. It seems like gum [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10029.56s)]
*  smallest mouthpiece of all time [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10035.4s)]
*  Keith Hackney had another fight where he fought this guy Joe son and Joe son got him in a headlock and [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10038.08s)]
*  Keith Hackney punched him in the balls over and over again. Oh he drops him with the punches. That's it [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10044.32s)]
*  That is crazy, it's crazy to watch that's why I mean there's a reason why he's hitting him with his fist like that [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10051.12s)]
*  Because it hurts to fucking punch somebody in the head [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10055.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he's breaking his hand for sure here if not for sure it's definitely a high probability like that those punches [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10058.2s)]
*  He's doing like ridge hands [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10064.84s)]
*  Like see he just looked at his hand like holy shit. I don't know if they stopped her if they kept yet. They stopped it [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10067.640000000001s)]

*  But the early days those days were just it was a different world like no one knew what worked or what didn't work [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jDb81-S2RQ&t=10081.880000000001s)]
