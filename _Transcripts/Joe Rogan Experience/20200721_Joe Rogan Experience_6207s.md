# Joe Rogan Experience #1511 - Oliver Stone
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOrOYUxzX3o)
*  Alright, here we go.
*  Thank you very much for being here.
*  I'm a really big fan, so this is an honor for me.
*  I'm really, really excited.
*  I'm really excited about your book.
*  I'm really excited about just your films, the Untold History in the United States, which
*  I think is fantastic.
*  I mean, that's one of my favorite things that you've ever done and so thorough and so interesting.
*  But the book, first of all, look how good you look in there on the cover there.
*  That's an old shot.
*  You young handsome bastard.
*  Look at you.
*  Looking good there.
*  What year is that from?
*  It was 1968, November.
*  I'd just come off the last mission in Vietnam.
*  Wow.
*  It was on a hilltop.
*  We got stuck in the rain in the Aisho Valley.
*  It was the first cavalry and we really, the helicopters couldn't get in for 11 days.
*  It was awful.
*  Wow.
*  We had leeches everywhere and the enemy, we didn't know where they were, but we felt that
*  they were going to close in.
*  But it was too wet ultimately for them to close in, but they knew we were there.
*  So we were praying.
*  The whole time was kind of nerve wracking because it was my last few days, you understand.
*  I was supposed to get out of there when Diros left the country.
*  I was due out.
*  I had volunteered for an extra three months in order to get out of the army three months
*  sooner.
*  Wow.
*  In other words, normally you had to serve, if a two-year deal, you had to serve six months
*  on the back side of it.
*  So I didn't want to do that because I was going nuts with the rules and the regulations
*  and I'd gotten into some trouble with that.
*  So I extended in combat for another three months and that ended up in this mission.
*  How much did your time serving impact your directing?
*  You've had these life experiences as someone who's just a filmmaker they really can't
*  draw upon.
*  You've had actual combat experience.
*  You're making movies about combat.
*  That has to be a gigantic advantage or at least it adds layers to it that are almost
*  impossible to recreate for someone who's just trying to imagine what it's like.
*  That was very important when we did Platoon.
*  I was trying to get the exact distances and the amount of firepower is not as intense,
*  generally speaking, as the movies make it.
*  That's the problem because the movies have so much to show.
*  They bring the enemy much closer.
*  They condense things and they amplify as much as possible.
*  Now I did that too here and there so I'm guilty too but I think overall it's way overdone
*  and the newer stuff that's come out since 2001 with the patriotic stuff and heavily
*  militaristic stuff is way off.
*  People don't die that way like in the type of films like Mark Wahlberg made or those
*  kind of films.
*  They're just way overdone.
*  In what way?
*  What was the name of the film?
*  Lone Survivor?
*  Yeah.
*  Was that the name of it?
*  Yeah.
*  They get dropped off, whatever, in ten guys and they manage to kill how many Taliban for
*  each guy.
*  How much of that was based on, I mean it's all about Marcus Luttrell's life.
*  I haven't had a chance to talk to Marcus.
*  I'm friends with him but I don't know how much of it.
*  They monkey with everything.
*  It was way overdone.
*  What I've heard and what's been reported is that they got trapped right away.
*  It was pretty quick.
*  The ambush went on and they got the shit kicked out of themselves.
*  I can't be, I don't remember exactly the details but he did get away and some people did scam
*  but it doesn't look like it does in the movie where everyone's a hero.
*  That is a problem and that's one of the things that I really loved about Platoon.
*  Everyone wasn't a hero.
*  I mean the Tom Baringer character.
*  Yeah he existed.
*  It's in the book.
*  It's based on a guy called Sergeant, well I called him Sergeant Barnes but he had a,
*  I wouldn't use his real name, real guy.
*  Getting shot in the face.
*  Was scarred, distorted, kind of handsome like that.
*  He was a serious guy and he knew what he was doing.
*  He was the leader of the Platoon.
*  See I made clear that the leaders of the Platoon were not really the lieutenants.
*  They were the Platoon Sergeant and the Squad Sargeants and they were very important in
*  our lives.
*  So I rarely saw officers.
*  I was in the jungle.
*  You deal with what's right in front of you.
*  So the Sergeant was crucial.
*  Barnes is a crucial character.
*  So is the other character, Sergeant Elias played by Willem Dafoe.
*  He was in another unit that I had combined four different units.
*  I was in three combat units.
*  I combined them into one unit, one platoon for this movie purposes.
*  So the Willem Dafoe character was also based on a real person.
*  Yes he was.
*  He was based on a guy I knew in the Lerps, Long Range Recon Patrol, who was a great guy.
*  He was in Apache, kind of an Apache, Mexican mix.
*  I'm not quite sure what he was because I didn't get to know him that well but I admired him
*  because he had that life grace of a guy who fought a lot, had been around.
*  He'd been in before.
*  He was on a second tour and very much a beloved figure.
*  He was killed after I left the unit.
*  He was killed about a month later in a friendly fire accident.
*  Now friendly fire is, we talk about it in the book quite a bit, because it's also underestimated.
*  The Pentagon cuts it all out, especially in the movies that come from the Pentagon approval.
*  They don't like to emphasize how difficult, how often, I would say 15 to 20 percent of
*  our casualties in that war were friendly fire.
*  Now that's not just ground fire.
*  When you get into a jungle situation, you're close to people, you don't really know where
*  you're shooting sometimes.
*  You don't know where the incoming fire is coming from.
*  So it's quite a mess.
*  It's chaotic.
*  People screaming, shouting, noise, confusion and a lot of fear.
*  That was highlighted for us when the Pat Tillman incident happened.
*  Very important one.
*  Pat Tillman, who is this spectacular athlete, decided to postpone his NFL career and go
*  over and serve and was killed in friendly fire.
*  And it wasn't really reported that way for a while.
*  That's absolutely correct, which is the point is that they don't, they really don't want
*  the parents to know what's really going on.
*  So imagine if imagine 15, maybe 20 percent are dying from that friendly fire.
*  This is not just ground fire.
*  This is, of course, bombing and certainly artillery fire, because that is often misplaced.
*  It's not that easy to get the coordinates down in a tense situation where you can hit
*  your where artillery 20 miles away, 40 miles away has to hit.
*  You have to hit the spot.
*  When you're making a movie like Platoon, and this is in many much much of it is based on
*  your actual real life experience.
*  How much preparation is involved?
*  And how much how much is it different than when you're making another movie?
*  Because this is something that's intensely personal to you, obviously.
*  How much preparation?
*  Well, I got I got a great combat advisor.
*  He'd been there as a Marine.
*  They all die.
*  He came in out of the blue and he was a real lifer type.
*  So he remembered all the details of uniforms and fire and the and the firepower.
*  I mean, it's it's it took a lot of details to put this together.
*  But the preparation was I'd been doing it for 10 years.
*  I started the picture in 1976.
*  I wrote it.
*  I wrote it.
*  It wasn't made.
*  It was rejected by the by the powers it be.
*  The first time and then it was it was considered great, great script, but too real, you know,
*  too realistic a bummer, a downer.
*  If you remember back in the 70s and Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter.
*  Yeah, those were big films and mythic, beautiful films, but they were not realistic.
*  Then they had Sylvester Stallone do his Rambo series where he goes back and fights the war
*  again.
*  Does those drive you crazy?
*  Yeah.
*  Although the first one was pretty good.
*  But the first one was different.
*  They're playing up the, you know, the whole sympathy card, the pity card.
*  I don't buy that.
*  You know, there's a lot of that veteran feeling that, you know, it's we were we were we were
*  beaten.
*  We had our hands tied behind our backs and we couldn't win and that kind of thing.
*  Believe me, it was a badly conceived war with a lot of misinformation.
*  I go on in the book and talk about the lies that were spread by the military, the propaganda
*  that we're winning the whole time.
*  They were using the body counts, heavy body counts.
*  We'd say, well, if we're killing so much, so many of them, they're not going to be that
*  many left.
*  And but on the other hand, as the years went on, more and more of them kept appearing.
*  So they the Vietnamese were indestructible in a way.
*  They were like ants.
*  They were they were fighting for their independence, for their land.
*  And it was their country.
*  And they never gave up ever.
*  You could have nuked them.
*  That's what Curtis LeMay at one point suggested.
*  You could have dropped a nuclear bomb.
*  It wouldn't have done it wouldn't have made the difference.
*  Thank God they didn't.
*  But America went to extremes to win that war with poisoning.
*  The bombing, the bombing of not only Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia was intense, intense, bigger,
*  bigger by far than World War Two for this crazy war.
*  Well, it also it set a precedent for our lack of trust in the military, a lack of trust
*  in the government that guides the military, particularly in how they deal with the veterans
*  that are dealing with things like Agent Orange or, you know, people that have come back that
*  were sick, where they denied that this was part of the problem.
*  Sure.
*  We didn't even have PTSD.
*  We didn't know what that was.
*  But it started to prop up when I got back.
*  And I talk about it here a bit about PTSD, which I'd never heard of.
*  But I think we all had it.
*  What did they call it back then?
*  Shell shocked?
*  I guess so.
*  But it wasn't it was not a diagnosis, diagnosable.
*  It was not an ailment that you could officially catalog.
*  Because if you did, the army would be admitting to a huge amount of insurance problems and
*  all kinds of medical problems that they would have to cover.
*  So it was, you know, it was something that there was no word for it.
*  But frankly, to get back to the issue of the original question was the platoon was rejected
*  on for these two.
*  It almost came to be again in 1983, fell apart again.
*  And it's a heartbreaking story.
*  It's in the book.
*  And it's resurrected.
*  I mean, I forget about it.
*  I just put it in the closet after those movies came out.
*  And I said, they don't want to know about Vietnam in this country.
*  They really forget it.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  Fine. I live with it.
*  I was moving on with my career.
*  I had Midnight Express.
*  I had Scarface.
*  I was I had other things in mind.
*  But Michael Cimino, who had directed Dear Hunter, told me he wanted to produce it with
*  me as the writer, as a director, and that we would we would resurrect it because he
*  said Vietnam's coming back.
*  I said, that's nonsense.
*  I don't think it's going to come back.
*  He said, look at Stanley Kubrick's pictures.
*  He's going to make a picture.
*  It's called Full Metal Jacket.
*  And it took three years or two years for him to make it.
*  But the fact that he made it certainly gave us some impetus to make.
*  We made it very low budget.
*  And by the way, it was made by the same company as made Salvador my previous film.
*  They made him I made him back to back in Mexico and the Philippines back to back financed
*  very low budget by Hemdale, a British company led by a gentleman named John Daly, who I
*  might who was my mentor.
*  I much credit him in the book.
*  So we were nothing film out of nowhere.
*  I mean, we were the bottom.
*  I mean, we're in the Philippines and making a film that nobody really knew much about.
*  And at the bottom, we were struggling to get it made.
*  And there was a weather problems.
*  There was all kinds of logistical problems.
*  But we'd been through hell on Salvador, as I describe in the book in Mexico.
*  So we were a unit by this time.
*  We got used to the difficulties of making low budget films.
*  In between the time you wrote it and the time it actually got done, was there ever any
*  effort by the studios to try to water it down or to try to doctor it up?
*  And sure.
*  No, that went on quite a bit.
*  Everyone read the script at one point or another.
*  Everyone rejected it.
*  So when it finally almost got made with Chimino in 1983, we thought we were in.
*  We thought we'd get it made now.
*  But the resistance to it at the very end with the MGM was supposed to be the distributor.
*  And Henry Kissinger was on the board of directors, along with the Hague, Alexander
*  Hague. You remember him?
*  Military guy, Secretary of State.
*  Very bad tempered.
*  They were both on the board.
*  And whether they went to that board, I don't know.
*  But that's what the story they cover their ass by telling me, we can't make this movie.
*  We can't distribute this movie because the board would be against it.
*  Now, sometimes they say they tell you that without checking.
*  But in this case, I don't know.
*  So as a result, the film fell apart again.
*  This was a heartbreak.
*  Did you ever think like maybe I can move it a little bit or change it a little bit or
*  would you just step fast?
*  The Pentagon said to me, forget it.
*  We're not going to help you at all.
*  And this thing is completely distorted.
*  They were upset as hell about the fragging.
*  I mean, that's to say, you know what fragging is?
*  Yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of that towards the end.
*  It started in 67, 8, but there was more and more discontent when Lyndon
*  Johnson pulled out of the presidency in March of 68.
*  That was a big moment.
*  I think all the sold everyone kind of knew that this thing was not going to work out.
*  And who wanted to be the last guy to get killed in Vietnam?
*  Right. And so I think 69, 70.
*  We're more and more fractions, more fraction fractious.
*  And there was more and more incidents.
*  At one point, there was a Pentagon document that came out.
*  I've seen it. It said this situation in the army is getting so poor, so bad.
*  The morale is so low that it's a bit it resembles beginning to resemble the French
*  mutinies in 1970 in the World War one.
*  That was a big concern of the Pentagon.
*  They knew the thing was not going to work.
*  It was cracking from within.
*  So we gave more and more, let's say more and more credit to the Vietnamese, South
*  Vietnamese and saying that they were going to take our place.
*  We're going to put more money. We put a fortune into them.
*  South Vietnamese Army, like we're doing now with the Afghan Army.
*  It's interesting when you look back, what year did platoon come out?
*  80. We finally made it out in 86.
*  86 December. When when you really think about it, you're only talking you're not
*  talking about that much distance distance between that movie coming out and the
*  Vietnam War ending.
*  I mean, in terms of how we look at the world now, I mean, if we look at it's 2020,
*  if we look at 2000, that doesn't seem like 2003.
*  That doesn't seem that long ago.
*  But that's kind of the timeline you're looking at.
*  And so, you know, in a lot of ways, it was probably very fresh in a lot of people's
*  eyes, particularly people in the Pentagon.
*  It was quite something when it came out.
*  It was, you know, it was it was like a bomb went off.
*  I mean, it went around the world, first of all, it wasn't just America.
*  This film played everywhere and was, I guess, a shock at the time because it was more
*  realistic than any war field that they had seen.
*  And of course, it was dirty.
*  It got, you know, I mean, it was that we had drug use in it, which was, you know,
*  description of the division.
*  There was a division in the army.
*  We were we were draftees, many of us.
*  So it wasn't all volunteer, you know, and it wasn't all like gung ho at all.
*  It was a split.
*  And I just I just I showed the split as much as I could.
*  I would be in the I joined the camp with the people who I would say were anti
*  authoritarian.
*  I wouldn't say they were anti war because we didn't have anything like that going on.
*  It was just the army sucks.
*  The man sucks.
*  You know, a lot of the black troops knew this.
*  So there was a lot of dissension with the black troops, too, because when Martin
*  Luther King got killed in April of 68, that had that had a negative impact over
*  there. So there was a lot going on in the country.
*  People were seeing it, feeling it.
*  And new troops were coming in all the time from the country draftees.
*  So we were, you know, you get a feeling for what's going on.
*  Did the movie did the movie feel different to you than anything else you've ever done
*  in terms of your obligation?
*  Because I really do think that that was the most realistic at that point, for sure.
*  War movie ever made and the one that left people with the most conflicted feelings
*  and just this this feeling of as much as you can relate in a film with notable actors,
*  you you you showed the horrors of war in a way that I don't think had ever been
*  portrayed before in a film.
*  Well, we got the details right.
*  I mean, when you see a dead body and you see it being lifted into a helicopter, that's
*  really looks like a dead man.
*  And the pain of death.
*  I mean, you feel the danger.
*  It's it's never what you think it's going to be.
*  It's always comes up in another way.
*  It's like sloppy sometimes.
*  And battle.
*  And that's what I don't like about a lot of the movies.
*  Battle is often just confusion, breaking down.
*  Things don't work.
*  It's like Mike Tyson said, you know, your plan goes out the window and you get hit in
*  the face. It's that's the way it goes.
*  Never play.
*  See, the Americans had a methodical way of doing it.
*  We go into the jungle.
*  We send the little guys into the jungle.
*  They meet resistance, pull back bomb artillery, do anything, take minimum casualties.
*  That's not what the Marines did, but that's what the Army's idea was.
*  And that it works to a degree, but it eradicates the whole.
*  The bombing is is very sloppy.
*  And not only do you have friendly fire, but you have a lot of civilians killed, too.
*  Imagine when you finish your final cut of that movie and it got really, that had to
*  be a very strange, almost like you're releasing a child.
*  You're you.
*  I mean, it was it had to have been so much more personal and so much so much more
*  significant. I'd been through so much.
*  I really I didn't I didn't think it was good.
*  I thought it was a good movie. I thought it was a good script.
*  And I didn't think I didn't expect anything.
*  I had just done Salvador, which was about a dirty civil war down in the in the Central
*  America, in which America again, supported some pretty bad guys, some death squads.
*  And I showed that. And that picture had not done very well because it had been
*  America had been very little in no interest really in the Central American issues of
*  the 1980s. Remember the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua?
*  There was a lot of turmoil in Guatemala, turmoil in Honduras, where I went down there
*  to research Salvador.
*  What I saw in Honduras was the beginning of another Vietnam.
*  That's one of the reasons I really committed to Salvadorous heavily.
*  When I saw the troops, the American troops, now there are women, men and women
*  young in uniform, many of them National Guard troops, reserves.
*  They were there building up for this.
*  I think it was pretty clear that Reagan was going to attack Nicaragua in some way.
*  But it never happened because of a fortuitous accident when the
*  CIA got busted for flying a cargo cargo over Nicaragua.
*  And it was a huge scandal that led to the Iran contra unraveling with Reagan.
*  So Reagan was unable to do what he wanted to do in in Nicaragua.
*  Although we had mined the port, we'd done everything possible supporting the
*  Contras. All that pissed me off.
*  In other words, it was like 20 years after the war, 15 years after the war.
*  Here I am back in Central America.
*  I'm seeing the same thing. Young guys like me in a country, you know, just
*  believing what they're hearing from their superiors.
*  So you felt like this obligation to not just release Salvador, but also release
*  platoon as in platoon, your experiences showing what the Vietnam War was really
*  like and with Salvador saying, hey, this is happening again.
*  Yeah, I did him simultaneously, except I didn't really believe I didn't believe
*  platoon was going to work.
*  Yeah, come out. So I didn't have much faith in it.
*  Well, when it did come out, how much of a surprise was it when it was a giant hit?
*  Well, I knew that in the moment.
*  Put it this way, the shooting was you could tell from the young people, the
*  actors and the their enthusiasm for this.
*  There was a hunger to me.
*  They were so delight delighted to become soldiers for the purposes of the movie.
*  We trained them on a 24 hour basis for two weeks and it was it worked.
*  I wanted them to get no sleep.
*  And Dale Dye helped me with that.
*  We put them in a training situation, but a real one, I mean, where you don't sleep
*  and you you basically pulling sentry duty all night.
*  Kind of you have you split your duty with Foxholes, three guys and Dale would
*  stage attacks and stuff in the middle of the night.
*  Really? So they were nervous and they were they were tired beyond belief, which is
*  good. That's where you want them.
*  So how did how did you plan this out?
*  So when you were when you were about to start filming, you had it in your head.
*  We have to make this more realistic.
*  What's the best way to do it?
*  And then from the beginning, we're going to be the way I cast it.
*  I wanted I wanted young people as much as possible in the in the roles, people who
*  were fresh, who didn't look like they'd done other movies.
*  Right. And types.
*  They were based on everybody I knew in my plethora of people from the south, a lot
*  of people from the south, the people from the Midwest, a lot of inner city people,
*  from Chicago, especially St.
*  Louis, New Orleans.
*  And, you know, Californians, I try to mix it all up.
*  But the whole idea from the beginning was that we're going to make this with our
*  little bit of money, we're going to make this as realistic as we could.
*  So we planned it that way.
*  And the camp worked.
*  We got the full cooperation of the Philippine Army and some shitty helicopters that
*  they had, but very dangerous ones.
*  But at least that was it was a start.
*  Had that ever been done before?
*  The camp, the idea of having them live like soldiers?
*  I don't think so, because that had bothered me a lot.
*  Maybe in the old days, but I don't I don't know one.
*  No. What made you fall on that?
*  Like, why was that?
*  Well, I'd lived it. I'd lived it.
*  So I wanted them to above all, I wanted them to be tired, irritable.
*  It gives you a sense of what it's like.
*  You know, there's bugs.
*  There's heat. It's it's a jungle.
*  And. How did they respond to that?
*  At first, they were a lot of bitching.
*  There was a sag SAG, the SAG unions, and you have to have 12 hour turnarounds.
*  So a few of them quit.
*  Really? Yeah. Wow.
*  And we replaced them because I had a long list waiting list of people
*  that I'd seen over the years.
*  Wow. Actually, Charlie Sheen was the
*  younger brother of Emilio Estes, who was my first choice to play it in 1983.
*  And after the movie went peeled back to 86,
*  Emilio had gotten older and I went with Charlie, who came of age
*  about that time was my age when I was over there.
*  Oh, wow. So he was 19, 20.
*  So, you know, that's what I wanted.
*  Those faces, once you get the faces, you can train them. And
*  and
*  Berenger and DeFoe were the oldest and that helped enormously.
*  They were this, you know, anchors of the operation.
*  When the film was this gigantic success, did that
*  how did that feel to you?
*  Did that validate this idea that you had and it shocked me.
*  It shocked me. I mean, for years has been rejected.
*  Ten years, you know, I mean, I was sick of it.
*  I was saying, I'm not going to make this movie because it's going to go wrong.
*  I didn't think it was possible.
*  But because of this, you know, Kubrick picture and the support
*  of the English company, John Daly, they they wanted to make it.
*  This is news for me because all my life I'm fighting to make
*  a movie against somebody's wishes.
*  All of a sudden, I got some people on my side.
*  That's a big that's a big difference.
*  And the enthusiasm of the cast and Dale Dye and all these great people
*  and my cameraman, everybody, they loved it. And
*  we made it and frankly, we finished it.
*  We did it on budget 50 was 50 days.
*  We went 54 days, but that was we had the money in the in the in the
*  that 10 percent contingency.
*  We finished it in 54 days and it was tough.
*  And we got out of there just in time because the ponsoons came.
*  And in the editing right away, you could feel that people
*  were reacting to it in a different way.
*  We edited. There was no
*  we we we edited a little bit, but, you know, we played with it,
*  playing with it. You massage it.
*  But right away, I would say from the first screening on, you could tell.
*  People were responding saying this is real.
*  This is I've never seen this. This is real.
*  So it it took care of itself in a way.
*  I mean, they didn't put much money in the distributing company was
*  Orion Pictures, which existed.
*  They they put they said, well, give it a quality release.
*  A few theaters at Christmas in 86.
*  And it opened huge first day in New York.
*  There was a line of veterans, young, young veterans who looked young.
*  I mean, not World War Two veterans, young veterans.
*  They were around the block at the Lowes Aster.
*  And I wasn't there, but people told me that they were they went in quietly.
*  There was a mute mute and they sat to the film and
*  very little talk, very little anything, not a lot of the gung ho stuff you hear.
*  And at the end of it, they were quiet.
*  And some of them wouldn't get up out of their seats.
*  Quite a few of them were sitting there still in their seats.
*  You know, some were crying.
*  It took off.
*  And then it took off like I can't.
*  I've never you know, it's a phenomenon you rarely see in the world.
*  This is like the top third highest grossing film in America that year.
*  And it was.
*  It was a blockbuster because no children are allowed in, you know,
*  and you don't have much of a woman's audience at first.
*  So you don't figure on these things, you know.
*  It it took off and kept going.
*  And then the women started to come in the third week
*  as it was getting more and more talked about.
*  There was no stopping it.
*  And even when you went to places like Paris or London,
*  you know, people cared. It was unbelievable.
*  Well, it was a masterpiece.
*  And is it is that your finest moment in your proudest moment
*  you feel like as a filmmaker?
*  Well, it's one of the highlights of my life.
*  And it it's the climax of this book.
*  The 10 chapters here lead up to that, because
*  my story starts in 76.
*  I'm in New York, I'm broke, depressed, written 12 screenplays.
*  Nothing's happened.
*  I've come close a few times.
*  Nothing's going on.
*  And my marriage is ended.
*  My first marriage and looks I haven't
*  accomplished in my life the things that matter.
*  So at the age of 30, you kind of wake up.
*  You say, you know, what can I do? My grandmother dies.
*  I talk to her. I go and talk to her on her deathbed.
*  She's she's dead.
*  But in France, they let them.
*  My mother was French, you say.
*  They laid they laid them out.
*  And I was talking to her.
*  And I think it's a very moving scene where he communicates with her.
*  Because she loved him.
*  And his own family life was quite disturbing in many ways.
*  It was for him a traumatic divorce between his mother and father.
*  And he goes into he goes into this.
*  What happened in it's about a family, too.
*  It's about how a family life can break apart.
*  You can become a child of divorce.
*  So his life kind of falls apart.
*  And he goes out, you know, and he goes to Vietnam as a teacher.
*  Then he goes, joins a merchant Marine.
*  There's all kinds of things that happen.
*  Comes back to school, goes back to Yale University, drops out again.
*  He writes a book, writes his first book about his experiences.
*  I did this before back in 1966.
*  I was 19 years old.
*  Didn't work out.
*  It was rejected.
*  It was ultimately published about 1997.
*  It's called A Child's Night Dream.
*  So I was a writer from the beginning, I think, before I was a director.
*  And when that was rejected, I just said, fuck it, you know,
*  I'm too I'm too full of myself, I'm too much of a narcissist.
*  You know, I can't write about myself.
*  So I joined the army and volunteered for combat and for Vietnam.
*  I didn't want to miss it.
*  You know, I wanted to see it right away for the experience.
*  No, I wanted to get to the bottom of the barrel.
*  I wanted to see what what this country was about.
*  I, you know, I was I was inquisitive.
*  I was I wanted to know what life was about.
*  I mean, I'd grown up relatively sheltered, you know,
*  I went to my father made a living on Wall Street.
*  He was a Republican.
*  Eisenhower supporter, he was a lieutenant colonel in World War
*  Two, where he met my mother.
*  I mean, he was a
*  strong Republican and all his life.
*  And I grew up in that ethic.
*  But it really it's something that when I went to Vietnam,
*  he had never been in combat.
*  But when I saw what I saw over there,
*  coming from a sheltered existence relatively, it was shattered.
*  The look of the glass was shattered.
*  It was just I wasn't like I couldn't take my father's word for it
*  anymore on anything.
*  So I had to learn for myself. That's why.
*  What was different from your father's perceptions of what
*  what it was like?
*  He supported the war like many, many people did for several years until
*  he got older.
*  And then he came around one day and he said, you know, I think it's
*  I think you're right.
*  I think it was it's a futile thing because
*  the whole idea of the Cold War, he began to question it at the age of
*  70, about 65.
*  He said, you know what?
*  What difference does it make?
*  This domino bullshit?
*  He said, you know, the Russians have a sub off Long Island.
*  You know, they can they can nuke us from anywhere.
*  It doesn't make sense to play this
*  zero sum game of fighting for land, fighting for one country or another,
*  intervening in other countries.
*  He began to question everything.
*  So and I was, too.
*  I didn't change.
*  I know you're going to go to later in my life, but basically I didn't
*  change until I went to this trip in Honduras, which I just told you about
*  with my friend Richard Boyle for Salvador in 1985.
*  I went down there and what I saw in Central America confirmed
*  that we were doing it again.
*  We were going into these countries.
*  We didn't know what the fuck they were about.
*  We didn't. And we were fighting these in most cases, the interests
*  of most of the people, the majority of the people.
*  They had a revolution in Nicaragua because it was so corrupt.
*  Major revolution in 1979.
*  And the the we've been opposed to that new regime ever since.
*  So when you first when you entered into the army, when you signed up,
*  did you did you have clarity about this?
*  Did you would you just have this idea in your head that you needed to find out?
*  No, what it was like?
*  No, no, I had no clarity.
*  I was I wanted to get out of New York.
*  I want to get away from my the whole.
*  My parents were divorced.
*  My father, I want to get away from my father.
*  I want to get away from everything I knew.
*  I didn't like Yale University.
*  I was in the class with George Bush.
*  You know, I come from that generation of Donald Trump, George Bush,
*  Bill Clinton, the same generation.
*  But I don't identify with those people because maybe they
*  they didn't have that sense of service at all.
*  I did. I had a sense of patriotism.
*  But I think call it.
*  I really think it was misplaced, but I felt that I owe my country something.
*  They can't work just for myself.
*  The reason why I keep going back to this, it's so significant
*  that you had that moment in your life when you were involved in Vietnam
*  and you were in combat duty because all of your films,
*  although there are these big commercial successes, they all have a message.
*  I mean, Midnight Express, even Scarface.
*  There's there's a message in these films that's based on real
*  live scenarios that took place that a lot of people are unaware of.
*  You know, a lot of people got their education about Cuba
*  releasing prisoners to America based on Scarface.
*  And that's how a lot of people found out about that.
*  That's too bad, because I wish we had more
*  more study of what's going on in the world, more contemporary studies.
*  Well, that's, again, what I really loved about the untold history of the United States.
*  It's a fantastic piece that you put together.
*  One another check and slap on that chair right there.
*  Yeah. Excuse me. No worries.
*  But that's something that's really flavored your life,
*  is that your your work is not just commercial.
*  You don't you don't just put out these commercial success movies.
*  And they are. But they are commercially successful.
*  But you balance it with a message, whether it's JFK
*  or whether it's platoon, all of them.
*  There's something to them that resonates with people.
*  In answer to your question about whether I was clear, no, I wasn't clear.
*  I was here's what I was held at the time.
*  I said, look, I've been I wrote this book.
*  It didn't work. I spent two years putting that together.
*  My whole life's on there.
*  It's not of interest to a publisher.
*  So therefore, I'm going to go into this army and I'm going to go to this war.
*  And I'm going to let at that time, I was a good Christian.
*  I'm going to let God sort this out.
*  And he'll decide.
*  In other words, I put it that's how you felt in some way.
*  Yeah. So if I'm not meant to come back, I won't.
*  Wow. And I went under those conditions.
*  So, you know, you have to realize that a lot of people at 19 are suicidal in nature.
*  Yeah. And we know this from the facts now.
*  And now they were talking about it.
*  You know, it's in this country in America, we have a
*  surfeit of of suicide among 1920s, 21s.
*  And it's sad. But that's where I was.
*  So spiritually desolate.
*  And frankly, it got cleared up over there in the sense that I came out
*  very grateful to be alive, having seen a lot of death.
*  I had been wounded twice and I got in the Bronze Star and done 30,
*  30 or more helicopter missions.
*  It seemed quite a fair share of combat, which I describe in the book.
*  I came back.
*  Alienated and numb, I didn't come back as a protester,
*  but confused.
*  How did you feel about fighting with my father?
*  Oh, fighting with your father? Sure.
*  Of course. I gave him LSD one time.
*  I did. I'm perfect. Did he know? Yeah.
*  Didn't he know you were giving?
*  You know, I'd give it to him, but he knew that he was on something.
*  How did you do that?
*  We just live in his coffee.
*  No, it is scotch. Ah, even better.
*  How much? Quite a bit.
*  He was strong.
*  He handled it.
*  He drank he drank whiskey every day of his life.
*  So, yeah, he was a tough guy, but he was great.
*  He was like swaying to the music and. Oh, wow.
*  I mean, sex fantasy. Wow.
*  Did you tell him about it afterwards?
*  No, actually, we took.
*  But over the years, we he knew I kind of after a while,
*  he figured it out, I guess.
*  I was a long haired, wild kid. Right. Right.
*  Talking black talk to him.
*  Did you feel like you had to do it?
*  Because like you knew what kind of an impact it would have on him.
*  Then open some doors fighting with him.
*  No, we were fighting about the war, fighting about everything.
*  Like, I just didn't like his ideas and wanted to destroy his mindset.
*  Oh, wow. His mindset was, OK, we this Vietnam is a mess.
*  But his mindset was, but we can learn from it.
*  We can get armaments.
*  We're going to build up our knowledge for the next war.
*  That was his thinking. Right.
*  See, he came out of that generation of World War Two.
*  He was his father was wiped out in twenty nine.
*  And his first job was as a floor walker.
*  He didn't have anything.
*  He worked his way up on Wall Street, a very hard worker.
*  Research in the back offices.
*  So when the war was the war,
*  Second World War was the highlight of his life, he says.
*  He comes back from the war and America faced this problem.
*  You know, what are we going to do with all these men?
*  And now we've got the women working.
*  How are we going to employ all these people?
*  Everybody seemed to be scared of another depression.
*  They thought we're going back into that.
*  So there was this militarized economy that we had and they kept going.
*  It basically kept going and built up by 19.
*  We it ended in 45 by 1950, 51.
*  We're back in Korea where we were building up again.
*  So the whole concept of an enemy was important to the American economy.
*  And the Soviet Union, of course, fit the bill,
*  although they were our ally in World War Two and did most of the fighting.
*  They became our our biggest enemy right away, right away.
*  There was no hesitation about it.
*  It was often a political decision, you know, to have an enemy,
*  to create fear and to keep the militarized economy that we have.
*  And it got Eisenhower talked about it.
*  He was the one who built it up the most.
*  But we're getting ahead of ourselves.
*  No, no, no, we're not.
*  I mean, it's fine.
*  But my father came from that generation and
*  he believed firmly that Russia was really invading our country,
*  threatening it.
*  They were in our schools. They were in our state department.
*  I mean, he wasn't Joe McCarthy, but there was a lot of that mentality.
*  Nixon was like that.
*  You know, Hoover was pushing it.
*  And I grew up terrified.
*  I grew up terrified.
*  Dad, why? Why?
*  Why? Why? Why do we let the Russians do that?
*  That kind of mentality of being besieged.
*  And so my father and I fought a lot, as you can imagine,
*  because, you know, I got kicked out.
*  He'd take me to a restaurant.
*  I'd have an American tie that was made of American flag.
*  Right. And the restaurant owner would kick me out because, you know,
*  I thought it was disrespectful.
*  He'd been ex-marine.
*  That's interesting.
*  You can have an American flag anything now and you're respectful.
*  That's weird. Like you get an American flag hat or a T-shirt.
*  And come on, this was a different world.
*  This is still the height of the, you know, still the 70s.
*  The older people were were offended by that.
*  Yeah, that's it. It's interesting how that shifted.
*  Right. Like now, the more American flags, the better on everything.
*  Socks, underwear, whatever you want.
*  Nothing is respectable.
*  Yeah, it's different.
*  It's so yeah, it's really weird.
*  It's kind of been bastardized.
*  What was it like coming back and seeing the protest, though,
*  and seeing these people that were your age,
*  that were angry at people like you who had had been over there?
*  I didn't have any horror stories.
*  I didn't see that, you know, baby killer.
*  That's been exaggerated, I think, by people looking for,
*  you know, looking for revenge.
*  I mean, someone yelling baby killer at the soldiers.
*  Right. I mean, I think there was discomfort.
*  I went back to New York society, which was I didn't have any veteran friends
*  in New York.
*  My friends went back to small towns in Tennessee and Kentucky and Georgia
*  and inner Chicago.
*  So I never I didn't see them until I made platoon.
*  And
*  well, I think the problem was it was indifference.
*  People didn't care.
*  They didn't give a shit.
*  I mean, most people were making money.
*  It was the 60s.
*  Men, people were getting jobs.
*  There was all kinds of new liberating ideas.
*  The world was on fire.
*  And I think people were thinking about Vietnam was an afterthought
*  unless you were directly involved with a relative,
*  at least in New York, very little.
*  Occasionally, people would wonder why.
*  Why did you go over there?
*  You know, like I was an outcast.
*  Why did you waste your time?
*  Get ahead. Make some money.
*  It was the Donald Trump was was the Donald Trump generation.
*  You know, that kind of a feeling. Make money.
*  There's a thing about your films, though, that I think like you keep
*  getting back to this, but because you did go over there,
*  it's almost like in your films, like you have something you have to tell people.
*  But you have it's like you have to give them medicine,
*  but you got to give it to them in sugar.
*  I don't think of it that way.
*  I wanted to I take thorny subjects.
*  Yeah. But they're entertaining to because I want to know what happens next.
*  Like you, I think you have an interest in.
*  So even political matters can be fascinating.
*  Yes. Who else would do Nixon's life?
*  Right. I mean, come on.
*  He was not the most popular guy.
*  No, he's a man. For me, it was a challenge. Yeah.
*  Same thing with the JFK murder.
*  I mean, it was so, so gnarly.
*  That one's extra complex, right?
*  Because you took some liberties there to try to move the plot along.
*  Yeah. But liberties in the spirit of the of the I didn't violate the truth.
*  Right. So in this, I mean, I had to combine characters and so forth.
*  That is a complex story.
*  The story of JFK's assassination is very complex because I can learn
*  a lot from a person in what their opinion is.
*  Like, what do you think happened?
*  Well, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
*  I you get these very specific character types
*  where these people have these predetermined patterns that they plug into.
*  And the Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone is one of the weirder ones.
*  Yeah, sure. That is one of the weirdest arguments.
*  And when I talk to them about the magic bullet, you know, like, and they go,
*  well, that's actually been proven that that can happen.
*  I mean, that drives me nuts. Yeah, sure.
*  Because I'm a guy who shoots guns.
*  I'm a hunter.
*  And I know what happens when bullets hit bones.
*  It doesn't ever come out like that ever.
*  And also, I think, you know, it was a hell of a shot.
*  Well, hell of a shot can happen.
*  I don't think it's that bad of a I don't think it's that big of a deal.
*  I think that's overstated.
*  There's many things that are overstated.
*  One of the things that's overstated is the scope was off.
*  You know, people always say, well, scope was off.
*  Well, fucking anything can knock a scope off.
*  You can drop a gun in the evidence room and the scope's off.
*  That's that's nonsense.
*  That's people don't understand guns.
*  But the bullet hitting those two people and finding its way on the Connelly's
*  gurney magically with very little distortion, the bullet at all is straight up
*  horseshit. And the fact that that that still gets touted as being,
*  well, this is actually how it could have happened.
*  And weird things happen with bullets.
*  Sure. Weird things happen with bullets.
*  But one weird thing that never happens with bullets is when they hit bone and
*  shatter bone, they always distort.
*  Always. Yeah, I'm making it.
*  I've made a documentary. It's almost finished about we went back to the case
*  again, taking all the information from the assassination records review board
*  that came out of the film.
*  They passed an act, the JFK Act.
*  Congress did. It was amazing.
*  And they allowed the board to exist for five years and they went through a lot of
*  detail. They weren't out to prove anything, but they were.
*  They found a lot of little detail that we put into this documentary,
*  which I think you'll love. I'm sure I'll love it.
*  Goes into into C399, the bullet, but also goes into so much else
*  on the autopsy that's screwed up.
*  The two autopsies, the one in Bethesda and also the one in Dallas.
*  There was none in Dallas.
*  Well, they they they did.
*  Yeah, they did.
*  They did examinations.
*  Yeah. Of what happened to him in examinations in Dallas.
*  Everybody saw a huge gaping wound in the rear right of Mr.
*  Kennedy's head. Yeah.
*  And that was covered up.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, there was there was also the reason why they needed to make that
*  magic bullet work.
*  The guy who got hit under the underpass, it was just.
*  Oh, I know you're I could see your enthusiasm.
*  Oh, deep. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And also, you know, come on.
*  I mean, if you're an infantryman, it's a you can't fire three shots like that.
*  Why are you not firing at him when he's coming towards you?
*  If you're serious.
*  It's very unlikely, but possible.
*  I mean, it can be done.
*  The shot can be done, but that's one of the least ridiculous things about that
*  story is whether or not one person could have pulled off those shots.
*  I don't think it'd be done.
*  I think the world's best marksman couldn't do it.
*  I remember reading something about that.
*  No, it's a hard shot.
*  It's a hard shot.
*  But hard shots can be made.
*  Hard shots. Three shots in that time period, depending upon how much he trained
*  for it, depending on I mean, I know some people that are spectacular marksmen
*  that can do some ridiculous shit and do it so fast.
*  He was he wasn't.
*  But he was also trained.
*  And if you depending upon how much training he did between his time
*  in the service and his time actually getting ready to shoot Kennedy,
*  you can get a lot better.
*  I don't know how much training he did.
*  I mean, you could take someone who's three years ago, a terrible shot.
*  And then they kill someone.
*  Well, he couldn't have done it.
*  He's a terrible shot. Look, three years ago, he was a terrible shot.
*  Well, if that guy was training that time.
*  Well, I don't think the rifle.
*  Look, it can be done.
*  But again, whether it's likely or not, that could be debated.
*  But it's the least ridiculous thing about that story.
*  Well, wait till you see the documentary.
*  I can't wait. We we go.
*  I think we pretty much prove that there's no chain of evidence on
*  on the rifle either.
*  Oh, no, I'm sure. I'm sure.
*  Did you read David Lifton's book, Best Evidence?
*  Years ago. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's what got me into the Kennedy assassination.
*  Somebody gave it to me.
*  A friend of mine, a musician friend of mine when I was on the road.
*  And I read it, unfortunately, all day
*  right before my standup comedy shows that night.
*  And I was so depressed.
*  I didn't think anything was funny.
*  And I went on stage. I had a terrible show.
*  And then I had to shake myself out of it for the second show
*  because I was bummed out.
*  I was like, I had never considered it before.
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, they killed the president.
*  And they covered it up.
*  Yeah. And we're paying for it to this day, because I think Mr.
*  Kennedy was one of the really on the road to being a great president.
*  I think he did a lot of great things that people don't even know.
*  And we put that in the documentary.
*  What he was actually doing in Africa.
*  People don't know what he was doing around the world in Asia,
*  in Cuba, obviously, South America, what his plans were.
*  People don't understand that it was a big divide between Lyndon Johnson,
*  who he he was about to get rid of him as vice president for the next election.
*  It was a big divide in thinking between Kennedy and Johnson.
*  Kennedy was without doubt pulling out of the war.
*  There was a directive.
*  We bring it up in the from the
*  SECDEF conference in Hawaii from earlier that year.
*  He was pulling out. He made that very clear.
*  Well, there was also the Northwoods document, which is really crazy.
*  Yeah, shocking when you actually because this is not speculation
*  or any kind of conspiracy theory.
*  This is all from the Freedom of Information Act signed by the joint
*  chiefs of staff.
*  They were going to blow up a jet airliner and blame it on the Cubans.
*  They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay.
*  They're going to do all this to get us to go to war with Cuba.
*  And it was it's it's stunning that this this is an this is an actual plan
*  by the United States government vetoed by Kennedy.
*  Wasn't there a plan also to fly a plane into a building?
*  I don't know if there was.
*  There was a plan to blow up a drone jetliner.
*  They were going to take a jetliner, fly it and blow it up in the sky and
*  and, you know, attribute all these deaths to that.
*  That came about actually.
*  The Northwoods came about as a result of the movie, because that was what they
*  was found by the Assassination Records Review Board.
*  Really? Yeah. Wow.
*  It's one of many documents that come out.
*  That's why it's important for my safe space.
*  Peace of mind to finish this thing.
*  It's kind of like, OK, this is the end.
*  I have to just put down the evidence because I couldn't do it in a film.
*  Right. That's what I was going to get to.
*  Like, what is it like when you have this passion for this story?
*  And this is a critical story in the history of the United States.
*  And a clear piece of it's a clear historical record of an assassination
*  of a president and most likely whether who I mean, I don't know.
*  Who do you think was behind it?
*  I think I'm not going to, you know, get sued because they're all dead.
*  But I think that Alan Dulles has to be looked at a lot closer.
*  And I think he was no longer in the CIA,
*  but he had a tremendous amount of influence.
*  And I think he needed some organized, very organized, top people to help him.
*  So I think it could have been a group of people that were involved
*  and maybe involving
*  certain people in the Pentagon, too, because there was an awful lot of
*  strange things that happened.
*  He certainly had some ideas that didn't jive well with the people that were in power.
*  Dulles was fired by Kennedy.
*  Let's call it, call it spade to spade, which had never been done.
*  This was a shock to the American way of government.
*  I mean, we come from a pro military system and here was Kennedy questioning it.
*  And then, you know, when after he was killed, I mean, it was insane
*  for Lyndon Johnson to appoint him to the Warren Commission,
*  where he managed to control pretty much the hearings and who who was heard,
*  who was right and what the CIA was delivering to the was a joke.
*  It was transparent. A joke.
*  There's a couple of things that are Joe Arlen Specter being the guy
*  who comes up with the magic bullet theory is another joke. Yeah.
*  There's there's a lot of that.
*  That's just very disturbing.
*  It's one of those things where you go over that subject
*  and you just leave in this state of discomfort and unease.
*  And it's very hard to relax afterwards.
*  But you're way too sure.
*  I can't wait. I love. Look, I like I said, I love the untold history
*  of the United States, and I think you do a great service
*  with that that series where you you illustrate in a way that's both entertaining
*  and very thorough.
*  All the pieces that were moving and all the things that took place.
*  I really we really worked on.
*  I had a professor of history.
*  Peter Kuznick worked with me five years.
*  We spent on it. Wow. We wrote it.
*  It was really a nonprofit kind of enterprise, but I really had to do it.
*  It's amazing.
*  And I don't think it gets nearly the credit that it deserves.
*  A lot of people like it, though. It's great. I love it.
*  It's available on Netflix. Yes. Yes.
*  When you're doing.
*  Can I take a pee? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We can break. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No worries. Good.
*  Thank you. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
*  The so we're back.
*  Yeah, you're asking me about we're back.
*  You're asking me about, you know, why,
*  why I get attracted to these kind of subjects.
*  And they don't seem attractive on the surface.
*  But when the more you get into them, the more they can be exciting.
*  So I am a dramatist at heart.
*  Really, that is my what I do best, which is to dramatize situations,
*  take something and bring it to life.
*  So take take it.
*  The Kennedy murder was extremely challenging.
*  And I knew it could work.
*  I felt like it could work. And it was a surprise.
*  Yeah, like platoon.
*  I mean, basically, how can you take this war is boring.
*  There's a lot of details.
*  I was in four different units, you know, time.
*  Not much happens. And then suddenly things happen.
*  It's not that easy to make it happen in a movie time, movie space.
*  So I took two different sergeants from two different units.
*  And I imagine what would they be like if they were in the same unit?
*  They would they would clash.
*  One would be the law and order guy.
*  I said, well, you know, guy who believed in what he was doing and fought it viciously.
*  And the other guy is the guy who was an anti who was a rebel, who was like
*  a bit like my own character.
*  My father was much of a law and order guy.
*  My mother was very much a rebel.
*  And I kind of put that into this conflict because I saw it in every platoon.
*  There was people who were like doing marijuana.
*  People who are doing alcohol.
*  You know, there was that split kind of.
*  And a lot of the black guys I hung out with were doing
*  marijuana and they were doing music.
*  The music was unbelievable.
*  But they had a different kind of music than the oaky music.
*  So it was all the split in these platoons.
*  I saw it constantly.
*  Black, white and country, city sensibilities.
*  Also, a very important point is that I found over time that the law and order guys
*  often were the most racist in terms of coming down on the Vietnamese civilians.
*  Because we know we had we did jungle duty, but we also did a lot of civilian villages.
*  Search and destroy search and whatever.
*  Search search them.
*  We find stores and weapons this that they not necessarily they were cooperating,
*  but sometimes they were forced to.
*  But a lot of guys screwed with them, you know, didn't like the Vietnamese at all,
*  which was not the black problem.
*  That was, you know, that was more of a it was a white problem.
*  So I felt there was a lot of that going on and.
*  I couldn't that was not my thing, and I just really didn't like what I saw.
*  It's a lot of cowardice, too.
*  Can only imagine.
*  And that's a shock education.
*  I mean, you talk about like a no escape, just thrust into this
*  completely volatile, chaotic world and then introduced to a bunch of different people
*  that you weren't around.
*  And then when I got out, I got thrown into jail.
*  It's in the book, too.
*  What for? For federal smuggling marijuana coming back from Mexico.
*  How much did you have?
*  A few just an ounce or two.
*  Really? That's it.
*  Federal smuggling for an ounce.
*  I'd taken some Vietnamese grass home.
*  Oh, yeah. But I never went home.
*  I just went right to Mexico.
*  So it was a few days later.
*  I was in the jail. Wow.
*  Call my father.
*  I said, hey, Dad, you know, I'm in trouble.
*  He said, why haven't you called me?
*  Where have you been for that?
*  We knew you got out two weeks ago at Fort Lewis.
*  And I said, well, I said, Dad, I'm you want to hear where I'm at?
*  You know, blah, blah, blah.
*  And he got me out.
*  He got me out with some money. Wow.
*  Without it, I would have been sunk into that prison.
*  It was awful.
*  Prison was filled with blacks and Latinos.
*  I mean, there were five thousand people in there for two thousand beds.
*  That was the beginning of the drug war.
*  Nixon was had been elected, but had not yet declared that war on drugs.
*  But it was filled.
*  Oh, most of them were nonviolent crimes, you see. Yeah.
*  And I saw that that side of America coming out.
*  So we have a lot of law and order types here.
*  Yes. Well, that law and order stuff was instituted when they passed
*  that sweeping psychedelics acts of 1970.
*  Oh, God. Yeah.
*  Well, they would.
*  What they were trying to do is they were trying to squash the civil rights movement.
*  That's a big part of what they were trying to do.
*  They were trying to make everything incredibly illegal, schedule one
*  so that they could have a reason to infiltrate these groups
*  and start arresting people and break the groups up.
*  That's absolutely correct. Yeah.
*  And J. Edgar Hoover was still around, unfortunately.
*  He was a lot of influence on this.
*  Marijuana had been the devil's drug.
*  What a fascinating character he was.
*  Yeah. Just, you know, they never got him yet on movies.
*  No, no, God.
*  Almost impossible to really get.
*  I really wish there was more.
*  I mean, real personal footage of all the crazy shit that he was actually into.
*  Yeah. We get an understanding of how nuts it was that this guy
*  was in charge of spying on people.
*  And Lyndon Johnson, you have to ask, you know,
*  did Lyndon Johnson really believe the bullshit he was talking about?
*  The black civil rights movement had a communist basis
*  that communism was supporting it.
*  I mean, that was very much Hoover's thesis. Yeah.
*  Well, that was a great way to get people motivated
*  to see your side of things back then, you know, yeah.
*  During the whole Cold War scare and the Red Scare, it's like communism
*  being a motivating factor for any group. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So when you put together JFK,
*  you have this film that is about this incredibly important subject,
*  but yet you want to make it interesting and you want to make it a great film.
*  And you succeeded in doing that.
*  But what is what is that like doing that balancing act of having
*  so much information to tell? Yeah.
*  Like that story is so complex.
*  So three hours and 10, 12 minutes.
*  And I got it through the system, which is unbelievable.
*  I'll tell you how later.
*  But at the time, I was I needed the protagonist
*  and the protagonist and who was the guy, you know? Yeah.
*  The only person who ever brought any kind of charges publicly was Jim Garrison.
*  Yes. In New Orleans, he was a district attorney.
*  And I read his book.
*  He wrote two books and I actually got to know him. And
*  he was a man who, like 20 years after he did this and went through hell,
*  came back to it and wrote another book.
*  And that's the book I bought.
*  In other words, he was devoted to this subject like you are.
*  He believed a lot more than me.
*  He was he'd been a patriot in World War Two and he served in Korea.
*  He'd been he'd been
*  sheep. I mean, he'd been called every name in the book.
*  He but he as a patriot, he firmly believed that Mr.
*  Kennedy was killed
*  by these intelligence forces and he went after it.
*  And in those days, you just couldn't do it.
*  You couldn't prove a covert operation. Right.
*  He got killed by the press, killed.
*  And that's we've now we've found out a lot more about why what was going on.
*  We know a lot more facts about how the media
*  went after him with bullshit, a lot of bullshit accusations
*  and made him look as bad as possible.
*  Well, Kevin Costner did an amazing job of playing him in your movie, too.
*  He was the basis of that.
*  Once you get a costner in the middle of it, then you can start to move.
*  You've got an interesting central character.
*  Then you bring in all these crazies that you read.
*  You read about people like Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau,
*  all the lunatics around New Orleans, Dallas involved in the war against Cuba.
*  Yeah. And you get the and then so I wanted then I wanted a Lee Harvey Oswald
*  character, which is to tell a little bit of his story.
*  So I had two stories, Garrison and Oswald.
*  I got to know Marina.
*  I didn't, you know, the track to a lot of the Oswald story.
*  Not enough of it, but there's more now.
*  But it's he seems to have been definitely in the employ of the CIA
*  when he went to Russia the first time and when he came back again,
*  he was there's too much evidence of it.
*  Yeah. We want to bring that out, too. But
*  that story becomes and then the third story would be the Dealey Plaza,
*  the actual assassination.
*  So Garrison is not there.
*  He has to go back into the past to to find this out. Right.
*  So, yes, that threat, that whole Dallas section is part of the
*  is part of the structure. It starts the movie.
*  But it also we go back to it at the right time.
*  And at the climax, we go back to it for the final time, the way
*  the way it probably happened.
*  See, so then that's three stories.
*  And then the fourth story, if you want to know the truth,
*  and my thinking at that time was a Donald Sutherland.
*  Yes, he comes into the movie at the halfway point
*  and he gives Garrison a lot of new information
*  because Garrison thinks he was dealing on a local level.
*  He thinks he's dealing with something that's in New Orleans.
*  He's not sure what beyond it.
*  So he and now says it's a much bigger story,
*  which sends Costner into the last act going to Dallas.
*  And it's too much for the Costner character.
*  He, you know, he's blown away by it.
*  He knows he's up against forces and much larger than he ever thought.
*  And this trial, who was the what was the motivation
*  for the Donald Sutherland character?
*  Fletcher Prouty, he was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force.
*  He was the focal officer between the CIA and the Pentagon.
*  An old timer, World War Two, did a lot of service
*  and he was in charge of basically providing the CIA
*  with military equipment for covert operations.
*  He worked in Tibet.
*  He worked on a lot of the operations in the 50s and the late 40s.
*  We had operations going on in Ukraine,
*  Ukraine, at China, Tibet.
*  He was he trained Tibetans in the Colorado Mountains and many stories.
*  He's written several books.
*  You should he was a he was a keen observer
*  of the differences that were going on.
*  He knew Dallas used to brief him
*  and told me stories about then everything changed after Kennedy was killed.
*  So you got you got to meet him. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah. I hung out with him.
*  He had Garrison, too.
*  I mean, both of these were authentic men and.
*  Fletcher described, you know, the difference after November 63.
*  He felt it right away. He left the Pentagon a year later.
*  It was over.
*  There was something that changed in the country.
*  And sure enough, we were in Vietnam faster than you can imagine.
*  The combat troops.
*  Yeah. Another crazy character in that whole
*  that the whole historical record is Jack Ruby.
*  Oh, yeah. He's a he's a very strange one.
*  And I just read a book called Chaos by Tom O'Neill.
*  It's about the CIA and Manson in the 60s.
*  Oh, yeah. I know the book.
*  Yeah, it's very interesting.
*  But Ruby is in that book as well, because Ruby was actually visited by
*  I forget his name, Jolly, something Jolly.
*  What's his name? Jolly West. Jolly West. Thank you.
*  Who was the central character in MKUltra,
*  who they believe was involved in these various.
*  Yeah, that's a plastic cell.
*  Now it comes off.
*  Well, don't worry about it.
*  I'm listening.
*  But he was a central character in the CIA's use of LSD
*  during the whole Operation Midnight Climax in San Francisco.
*  And they ran a free clinic in Haight-Ashbury that's connected to Manson
*  where they were giving people LSD and running studies on him.
*  Yeah. And he went to visit Ruby in prison.
*  And Ruby, who had shown no psychological trauma or distress
*  after he left, was a mess, curled up in a fetal position on the ground
*  and was thinking they were burning Jews in the streets and literally
*  was in a psychotic state.
*  And they think they dosed him up while he was in jail.
*  He seems to be the mob connection to this thing.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  You can put your arm back.
*  Yeah. It's a no.
*  Ruby's his contacts alone.
*  He goes back many years to the 40s.
*  He was quite a he was mobbed up completely.
*  Didn't want to do it. He was forced into doing it.
*  Why do you think he was forced? What do you think it was?
*  I think he was scared.
*  About what?
*  Well, I have never followed that in depth because, you know,
*  people say that organized crime killed him.
*  I don't believe that because they didn't have the power to pull this thing off.
*  I think that they they're an element to it.
*  Yeah. You wanted somebody to rub out Oswald.
*  Probably Oswald was intended to die there on that day.
*  You see, there's a lot of things that point in that direction,
*  but he didn't and he couldn't be allowed to go.
*  It's crazy that they got Jack Ruby to do it.
*  I mean, they they killed off that everything that Oswald said in that station.
*  Police station is gone. Yeah.
*  It's hearsay.
*  But what he said in the corridor outside, it's very interesting.
*  And we know that Ruby was there.
*  So Ruby, I think, was pushed into this thing because they had to make it.
*  It was a quick operation. We got to get to him.
*  You know, and it's really crazy.
*  The story plays out 12 years later when on the Geraldo Rivera show,
*  Dick Gregory brings a subprudence film and introduces it to the American public.
*  Yeah. And then they get the chance to see Kennedy's head going back into the left.
*  Yeah. And everybody's like, what?
*  Yeah, that's disgusting story.
*  But, you know, the on the on the on the Ruby affair.
*  And don't forget that he also he was urgently asking the Warren Commission
*  to get me to Washington. I want to talk to you.
*  What he knew he didn't know everything.
*  I don't think anyone knew everything.
*  He knew his part of it.
*  So the whole idea was, how can you get cancer out of the blue like that?
*  So suddenly. Yeah. So suddenly and die so quickly.
*  Now there again, there's a lot of cancer experimentation going on at this point
*  in the 60s. You mentioned doctors and the MLK cancer, too.
*  There was a huge, huge
*  experiment. There was a doctor in New Orleans.
*  I forgot his name, but working on it.
*  And David Ferry was one of these people who knew him.
*  Ferry had a lot of mice and he was operating on his mind.
*  He was using his mice's cancer,
*  feeding them huge doses of cancer.
*  The idea was that they said they were going to kill Castro with it,
*  you know, inject Castro with a needle and kill him
*  because they'd make it so strong.
*  And they're getting this cancer to play.
*  They're building up through these mice and a cancer that was so powerful
*  that could kill.
*  I mean, I heard everything on this film, but there seems to be truth to this.
*  Do you feel like you're going to put it to bed with this documentary in your
*  in your mind? Like you can.
*  It's the best we can do.
*  I mean, Jim DiEugenio working with me, he's he's followed this thing like
*  he's a fifth generation researcher and he's very, very up to date.
*  But when is this coming out?
*  It's I don't know yet.
*  I don't know if we can get it out. We're going to try.
*  Now, when like Scarface is another movie, like we're saying that
*  that is the introduction for a lot of people.
*  A lot of people, especially outside of Miami, really just didn't understand
*  how crazy things had gotten there.
*  And I have a good friend of mine who is an ophthalmologist
*  who did his residency in Miami, and he would tell me stories like
*  he was there in the 80s when all the crazy shit was happening.
*  And just he was like, it was a war zone.
*  You would just everybody was you just everybody coming in was shot.
*  People were all coked up and all these overdoses.
*  And well, that's I think there's a lot of sensationalism in that.
*  You know, America likes war.
*  They like they like to play up the machine guns and all that.
*  That was 1930 Chicago Time magazine went out of its way to sensationalize it.
*  And I was there. I saw, you know, it wasn't wild that way.
*  And the sense of shooting in the streets would happen rarely, but they happened.
*  People would be gunned down.
*  Families were killed.
*  Drunk dealers went after families of each other.
*  So yeah, there was a lot of that kind of internecine warfare.
*  Well, my friend saw it because he was in the ER, you know, so.
*  Oh, I see. Yeah.
*  He's doing his residency there.
*  So he was seeing it.
*  I think in any American city, there's a lot of shootings every week.
*  That's true. You know, especially right now, right?
*  But definitely there was a new element.
*  It was the Colombian element.
*  And the marialitos came in, some of them Cubans who were
*  gangster element out of Cuba. Yeah.
*  And it got bloody when the the Colombians were not playing around.
*  So there was a lot of cut throats. They used to.
*  They used to shivato's.
*  Colombian necktie. Yeah, that's right.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  When I was there, I heard about a couple of these guys.
*  It was interesting because I was working both sides of the case.
*  I was trying to get to know the the crime element as well as more than.
*  So I knew all the lawyers and I went over to Bimini one day to
*  to to get some real information about them because they couldn't.
*  In the US, they were scared to talk.
*  So I located through a defense lawyer,
*  a couple of some guys in in Bimini and went down there and I met with them.
*  And they were talking because Bimini was another kind of world.
*  There was the government was on the take there, I think.
*  And they had a lot of speedboats going out of there every night at the hotel
*  towards the Bimini is very close to Miami.
*  And I was doing coke at that time and I got with my wife.
*  She was my cover.
*  And I, you know, and I told Hollywood screenwriter,
*  he wants to talk to you, did midnight express.
*  They like that, you know, they want to know about the business.
*  But then in the middle of this, we're all coked up in the hotel.
*  You know, the way conversation goes and I drop a name just like that.
*  You know, a guy I talked to.
*  Well, he'd been a defense lawyer when I talked to him.
*  But in the past, he'd been a prosecutor,
*  because prosecutors often flip to defense attorneys to make more money.
*  So when I mentioned that name, two of these three guys got really uptight
*  and they walked, they excused themselves, went in the bathroom.
*  When I said I fucked up, I knew I'd fucked up.
*  And I didn't know it was going to come out of that bathroom.
*  You know, if they thought I was some kind of cop, some kind of under informer,
*  because they did, they hated that prosecutor that put them on,
*  what put one of them away.
*  So a few minutes went by there and it was pretty hairy.
*  But I think I was paranoid about it because they came out
*  and they didn't have guns in their hands, but they they cut the meeting off.
*  And, you know, I went back to my room.
*  They were staying in the same hotel all night.
*  I was tense because I, you know, I knew they could come and get me.
*  It was their hotel. They owned them. They owned the island. Right.
*  But it was nerve wracking.
*  And I got out of there first thing in the morning.
*  The whole point is you say the wrong word sometimes.
*  And you're dead.
*  That's the that's the kind of tension I wanted for this movie.
*  I put it into the scene early in the picture where Mr.
*  Pacino Alco goes in to make a pick up, make a trade.
*  And he says, you know, he senses something's off in this meeting.
*  And he becomes that blood, blood bath with the dismemberment.
*  You remember? Yes.
*  And the chainsaw, the chainsaw.
*  Yeah. Yeah, I was going to bring that scene up.
*  Yeah, there was a chainsaw murder at one point.
*  There's something about the way you film that was so excellent
*  because it was obviously gory and disgusting, but you didn't have to show it.
*  I didn't direct it. I wrote it. Right.
*  Brian De Palma did a great job directing it. Grand opera.
*  No, that's right. He did an amazing job. That's right.
*  You when you are talking about someone who is in that world,
*  when you when you're trying to make a film about a guy
*  who is in that world, who is not a good guy,
*  you're your main guy, Al Pacino's Tony Montana is a bad guy.
*  He's the hero. It's a very strange movie.
*  Well, yeah, it is because he is a hero because he's free in a way.
*  He's a free man. That's where people liked it.
*  White people did not like that movie when it came out.
*  I was disappointed at first.
*  There was a blacks and the Latinos in the inner cities that went and they loved it.
*  And also people, white people who were doing some drugs, they went.
*  That was the kind of audience we had. We were a bad boy movie.
*  So the movie didn't do as well as they'd hoped because it cost a lot of money.
*  It went three months over budget. It was a very tedious shoot.
*  I was there the whole time.
*  But over time, the film garnered a reputation
*  and made money for the big money for us.
*  Become this iconic drug war movie.
*  I mean, it's it's the movie for gangsters.
*  It was just bold. Yeah.
*  In fact, wherever I go in the world, I mean, I pretty much people.
*  You wrote Scarface, you know, I can I got into Salvador.
*  I got into the fascist party that way.
*  So we did some research.
*  Yeah, they thought we could hone us when you're writing about a movie
*  or you're writing about a guy like Tony Montana.
*  How do you you you did you walk this fine line of
*  telling telling the story accurately,
*  but actually making him likable in some strange way?
*  Well, he's not a hypocrite, you see.
*  He tells the truth, as he says, even when I lie.
*  He's a he's a man who's free unto himself.
*  And I think that's what worked because the people around him are so corrupt.
*  I mean, the cops are corrupt in Miami.
*  The the system, the the bureaucracy that pressed down on.
*  By the way, I mean, let's be honest.
*  Let's talk about the drug war.
*  I mean, this is an invention that's come about.
*  That's a disaster.
*  It's a bureaucracy of enormous billions of dollars are being wasted
*  on fighting drugs with this super DEA.
*  And now they ice and all that, whatever they want.
*  We always create wars.
*  We call a war on drugs, war on poverty, war on this war on that.
*  We make that's a problem.
*  We make too much of a bureaucracy.
*  I noticed this in Vietnam.
*  It bothered to shout at me because we were sending five people,
*  noncombat people over there for one every combat person.
*  We had an infrastructure.
*  Las Vegas of the of the of material.
*  We had PXs.
*  We had everything we wanted.
*  They sent cars over there.
*  A lot of this stuff was, you know, sold on the black market in the end by
*  by master sergeants making a buck on the side.
*  You know, there was a lot of shit going on crime stuff.
*  And the Vietnamese were benefiting from it.
*  They loved the Americans.
*  Of course, they loved us.
*  It's the same thing.
*  If you understand it, it goes on and on and on.
*  It's like we create these super bureaucracies around events.
*  So what happened in the war on drugs is the same thing.
*  And then I think that Pacino is a hero because in a way
*  he sees it all he sees it's it's all bullshit.
*  And he he calls it out.
*  And I think people I think a lot of people just picked up on it.
*  They knew the war on drugs was a lie.
*  Yeah. Well, most people today at least have a sense that it's not going well.
*  You know, back then, they thought, how many countries,
*  how many countries have we pissed off?
*  How many countries have we told, hey, you got to do it this way?
*  We're coming down there.
*  We're going to bust you.
*  Speaking of Geraldo, did you ever see the footage where Geraldo was in Afghanistan
*  and he's walking through the poppy fields that are being protected by US troops?
*  Yeah, sure. And it's on Fox News.
*  So he's trying to do this weird propaganda job of explaining why
*  in order to get these poppy farmers to give us information about the Taliban,
*  we have to somehow or another protect their crops.
*  So we've got American soldiers.
*  It's a crazy story.
*  Well, then you find out that spectacular growth of heroin, like heroin,
*  the just heroin sales and heroin use worldwide went up in an amazing manner.
*  Yeah. This was going on, by the way, in the 1980s when we were
*  when the we were supporting the Mujahideen against the Russians.
*  Yeah. That's when it started.
*  They were they were fighting for the poppy fields.
*  Yeah. We're talking about billions of dollars here.
*  Billions. Yeah. And it's not like some of these drug dealers.
*  We don't even know their names, but they're well known in the Pakistani Afghani world.
*  Yeah. Some of them are unbelievably rich.
*  But it's so transparent.
*  The poppy fields being guarded by U.S. troops.
*  And that's a new one.
*  And them talking about it openly on Fox News and some, well, don't worry, folks.
*  This is why they have to do this.
*  Like it's it's it's one of the weirdest parts of the war.
*  Yeah. As was Dan Rather doing his stand up
*  at the beginning of the war about how we were fighting the the awful Russians.
*  They got us going on that.
*  I mean, you didn't see that clip. When was that?
*  Early in the war. Yeah.
*  He was he was brought the flag to Afghanistan, you know, making heroes out of them.
*  Actually, the guys we support that we gave the most money was to Hector
*  Huckmuth here, who is a drug dealer.
*  We gave him the most amount of aid.
*  Huckmuth here, he's like the killer killer warlord.
*  It's so strange.
*  It's such it's so strange how history repeats itself in different forms.
*  Just over and over and over.
*  In Vietnam, there was a whole in Laos, there was a whole poppy growth. Yeah.
*  And shipping, there was CIA shipping out Air America.
*  I remember that movie. Mm hmm. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There was a I was had a guy on
*  who was in denial of this.
*  And I showed him the CIA drug plane that crashed in Mexico with several tons
*  of cocaine in it just a few years ago.
*  I'm like, this is a plane that had been to Guantanamo Bay multiple times.
*  This is still going on.
*  All that shit that happened with
*  Barry Seals and you're talking about Iran contra.
*  Yeah. I mean, that stuff's still going on.
*  That's an ugly story.
*  Yes. Very ugly.
*  Yeah. The Barry Seale movie was OK.
*  Other top they got a piece of it. Yeah.
*  But it was uglier than that.
*  Yeah. We were basically
*  Reagan was selling arms to Iran, taking the cash and splitting it with the Contras.
*  Yeah. The Contras were one of the most brutal,
*  brutal groups, terrorist groups in Nicaragua trying to.
*  They were killing civilians, blowing up farms,
*  scaring people, and we supported them.
*  We just wanted a lot of bad guys everywhere in the world.
*  You have a very comprehensive knowledge of history.
*  And is this one of the reasons why you decided to make that documentary
*  series, The Untold History of the United States, because, I mean,
*  you obviously get some of it out in your films, but did you just feel like?
*  Well, yeah, I've done a lot of films about subjects around it.
*  So at a certain point in my life, I said, I really like to know more
*  about American history because something's weird here.
*  And I think I went to school kind of back to school.
*  I never studied.
*  I never got a college degree in normal subject matter like history or mathematics.
*  I got a film school degree.
*  So I had to.
*  I thought I knew things, but I learned a lot with going back
*  and learning by with historians who were throwing out all the myths for me
*  about American history.
*  And I made that film with just five years.
*  It took. We had to rewrite it, rewrite it, rewrite it.
*  It was complicated.
*  We started with the Philippines because that was the beginning
*  of overseas imperialism.
*  And we walked.
*  We worked our way up through the through the Obama administration from 1898 to 2013.
*  It's amazing series.
*  It goes too fast, if anything.
*  Yeah. But I think people could watch it two times without and learn
*  each chapter is revealing stuff.
*  People don't know about how this country really got off.
*  I don't know. I mean, it got off.
*  Maybe it got off on the wrong start with earlier.
*  But, you know, it really got off the
*  bent in its in its purposes.
*  And assuming we're the good guy, assuming, you know, this exceptionalism
*  that we have, that we're somehow
*  motivated in a different way than other countries.
*  Yeah, that's the that's the the way we excuse it. Right.
*  We're we're the number one superpower.
*  We do awful things, but better us than them.
*  There's no excuse for that.
*  No excuse. And it doesn't hold up to history.
*  And it won't hold up to God either. Yeah.
*  When you're making a series like that, is it difficult to edit it down to?
*  Oh, yeah. A palatable sort of version.
*  I feel like it's I feel like it moves fast.
*  You know, you can't accuse that series of boredom.
*  If anything, it just has to because there's decades to cover.
*  But I'm so proud of that.
*  I think I'm glad you mentioned it's one of frankly,
*  it's one of my achievements of my life.
*  It's stands up there with JFK for me and Platoon.
*  Now, when you've done so much, I mean, you've had this amazing career
*  between writing and directing and putting together all these incredible films.
*  What what motivates you now?
*  Like what what gets you going when you're trying to make a new project?
*  Well, this book is a lot of work.
*  I memoir is this chance to rediscover.
*  I went was going so fast at times between films that I didn't have that
*  leisure time to think about what I'd done.
*  And I think by reliving it, each film,
*  each film for me is important by reliving it.
*  I'd rediscover a lot.
*  I thought a lot about the Vietnam War, for example,
*  and came to a lot of the conclusions that I put here that
*  and I wouldn't have been so cogent before.
*  Also, I realize that I'm a fundamentally flawed character.
*  I mean, I understand this for really understand
*  that the contradiction in myself between my my parents, my fundamental nature,
*  which is you have to do that with yourself.
*  You have to look at who you are.
*  My mom, being who she was, my dad being
*  I mentioned earlier, the writer director side, there are two different people.
*  You can't be the same person when you do it.
*  Writing is very much an inner inner loneliness solitude.
*  My father was like that.
*  And directing is very much
*  being external, being
*  warm, being inviting and working with people and collaborating.
*  It's a wholly other totally different exercise of your mind.
*  And those two, I think I think I'm double double minded, I say in the book.
*  And I think that's a good thing.
*  Do you prefer to do both?
*  Do you prefer to write the film and and direct it?
*  Or how much how much satisfaction do you get out of just writing a film
*  like Scarface or writing a film like Platoon and directing it?
*  I think for me, it was the both.
*  I mean, that's why I wanted to direct.
*  I went to film school for that.
*  So the writing I'd always been doing naturally and directing is what I wanted to do.
*  Then I then don't forget editing.
*  There's editing process.
*  So I worked very closely with my editors.
*  And then there's the whole process of selling the film, which is another
*  another category completely called marketing.
*  It's a crazy fucking business.
*  It's hard.
*  You know, I've done 20 of them and they're killers.
*  Twenty films and eight documentary, nine documentaries.
*  And what am I going to do now?
*  I don't know. I think there's another book in me.
*  That's for sure. Yeah, absolutely.
*  Because this is ends in 1986.
*  The story is not over.
*  It takes another it takes another turn.
*  As to films, documentaries satisfy me.
*  Do I need to make another film only if I really needed to?
*  Was the last film you did Snowden?
*  2016. Oh, you interviewed.
*  Yes. Yeah, we talked about that.
*  I like that. Yeah.
*  You let you you you understood his.
*  You understood his point of view.
*  It's a crazy story for our times that that.
*  That this man is persecuted, this guy who I think is a hero.
*  He's exposed things that are unconstitutional,
*  things that no one signed off on.
*  He exposed that there's this widespread surveillance
*  of law abiding citizens who've done absolutely nothing wrong
*  in this data collection.
*  And the fact that this man is hiding in Russia is to me crazy.
*  And I mean, I don't know.
*  I don't even know if at this point in time, anybody could pardon him.
*  But it's stunning to me that no one has.
*  It's stunning to me that Obama didn't.
*  It's stunning to me.
*  I mean, he pardoned Chelsea Manning.
*  God damn pardon Snowden.
*  Yeah, but Obama, he went after the whistleblowers.
*  Yeah. With a ferocity that was crazy.
*  Using the Espionage Act from 1917.
*  I mean, it's it was really ugly.
*  And he was zealous.
*  I mean, he he was actually like he did more damage than Bush in many ways overseas.
*  Oh, it's very counter to his image.
*  I mean, if you look at the hope and change website, do you remember that?
*  There was a whole thing about empowering whistleblowers to come out and tell their story.
*  Oh, geez. They had to delete that.
*  I supported him at the beginning.
*  Boy, seemed perfect.
*  I mean, he's a statesman.
*  He's a brilliant speaker.
*  It seems like an amazing guy.
*  But whatever the fuck happens when you get in that office,
*  you can't change things.
*  You know, I mean, it seems to be every president since Jack Kennedy.
*  You see, Kennedy tried on a fundamental level.
*  He wanted to change the CIA.
*  He wanted to change the Cold War.
*  It seems like you can't get off that path in this country.
*  You can't. It seems very hard.
*  No one's been able to do it so far.
*  When you see a story like the Jeffrey Epstein story.
*  Yeah. Which is playing out right now.
*  Oh, boy. You should talk to my son.
*  That is one of the craziest fucking stories of our time,
*  because it's a conspiracy theorist wet dream.
*  And no one would have ever believed there's an island
*  where a guy brings prominent scientists,
*  celebrities and politicians to fuck underage girls.
*  They film them all and use it to somehow or another blackmail them or.
*  They film. They film them, apparently, according to Glene Maxwell.
*  There's tapes, you know.
*  I mean, there's so much to this story.
*  That's so crazy. Something. Oh, for sure.
*  So that's going to be the next the next mystery.
*  Well, the next mystery is how they're going to kill her.
*  That's that's the next mystery.
*  I mean, how long is it going to last?
*  I mean, there's supposed to the whole trial doesn't take place for a year.
*  That's a lot of time.
*  And that tombs you feel that was a murder from outside for Epstein.
*  When? Yes, 100 percent.
*  Yeah. The guy's on suicide watch.
*  The film doesn't work.
*  The surveillance cameras don't work.
*  And Michael Baden, the forensic scientist, reviews the autopsy.
*  And he's like, this man was strangled.
*  Look at the the break in the bone of the neck that's consistent with strangulation.
*  Look at the position in which he was choked, like which which part of the neck
*  that's not consistent with hanging.
*  Oh, there's all the factors point to the fact that the guy was killed.
*  And then the fact that, I mean, the guy's on suicide watch.
*  And, you know, how how how is it possible that this guy was one of the most
*  important witnesses in a case against a gigantic number of very powerful people
*  just winds up committing suicide?
*  Whoops. No worries. Sorry.
*  Well, if I am staying away from that, frankly, it's such a mess.
*  It's a mess. It's a mess.
*  But that's one that I would think would intrigue you.
*  I mean, if at the end of all this, when the pieces all fall into place,
*  is that something you would think about covering for a film?
*  Well, if I had to write it, I had to get very interested in the subject matter.
*  It seems it doesn't.
*  You know, I mean, it's I don't know what it's about.
*  I mean, if if it's really what they say and there's all these world leaders
*  and blah, blah, blah, I mean, it just doesn't really lead anywhere.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  I mean, the world is a much more important place is
*  world, a sense of world peace.
*  And this is the most important issue, peace in our time.
*  And we are building up nuclear weapons
*  at an incredible rate under this guy, Trump.
*  And it's a huge it's a return to the worst of the Cold War.
*  And that scares me. That's an issue I would like to.
*  I think if I were to get involved again in another movie,
*  if not a documentary, would be that one.
*  About the accumulation of arms and the building up towards
*  and the and the the madness of of our leaders,
*  Democrat and Republican, constantly pushing for more sanctions,
*  more pressure on our perceived enemies, China, Russia,
*  North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Venezuela.
*  I mean, it's just why?
*  Why are we doing this?
*  We don't have to.
*  The world could be a much more peaceful place.
*  If we take our foot off the pedal.
*  Is there anybody that has stood out in recent memory
*  as a politician that gave you some hope?
*  Kennedy. Oh, boy, we got to go back to 63.
*  Obama. Well, I was there.
*  I mean, Obama gave me hope.
*  Yeah. And I was hoping for Clinton, too. Mm hmm.
*  It just doesn't seem to be in the cards.
*  In other words, the office is not as important as you make it out to be.
*  I think there is a system in place
*  that's a system that Eisenhower quite well described as the military industrial.
*  Yeah. It's a corporate complex that drives money, profit, greed.
*  That speech is so amazing.
*  That speech that he gave on upon leaving office.
*  It was a warning. Yes.
*  He knew that he knew that he'd fucked up.
*  He said, I leave my successor a legacy of ashes.
*  This is famous quote. Mm hmm.
*  Eisenhower did not horrible things.
*  He started intervening much more in other countries than ever.
*  He appointed John Foster Dulles, who was a psycho, in my opinion,
*  as his secretary of state, just like Pompeo now.
*  Mike Pompeo and Alan Dulles at the CIA.
*  They were brothers.
*  But anyway, Eisenhower knew.
*  I think he felt bad about what he what he'd seen happen over those eight years.
*  I do. And I think Kennedy was a great hope because it was a new man, new generation.
*  He changed to Kennedy in office.
*  How so? He moved more and more to the left as he as he as he stayed in office.
*  Mm hmm. He saw the problems.
*  He couldn't believe what he saw.
*  He saw the lies that he was lied to a lot.
*  The Bay of Pigs was the first one.
*  But he was lied to about a lot of other things we get into.
*  It's the great mystery, right?
*  Like what happens to a candidate
*  once once they win the presidency and once they're in office?
*  Like, what is the process?
*  And well, that's where you have to have courage.
*  And that's where Obama really failed.
*  I mean, when he appointed Hillary Clinton as the secretary of state, you knew it was over.
*  I mean, he have to make decisions and you have to
*  you have to go in a new way if you're going to be there.
*  And it's just so
*  it's such a become such a bureaucratized office
*  that it's almost impossible to appoint a thousand people when you come in
*  to work with you that are going to be on your side.
*  But as a guy who's a storyteller,
*  this is one of the great stories of our time is how impossible it is to to be a president.
*  I think it's very hard, very hard.
*  But you need guts.
*  You need guts. And if you have guts, it makes a difference.
*  Remember, Kennedy had been in war.
*  He saved people.
*  He was a hero in that in in the Pacific.
*  Yes. Those are the kind of guts you need. Right.
*  When you put together the Snowden movie,
*  what what was your aim?
*  Like what were you trying to get out of that film?
*  I knew it was important story because surveillance had never imagined surveillance at this level.
*  I realized that it could be with this new technology we had that it could be everywhere.
*  I mean, beyond my imagination, beyond anybody's imagination.
*  And when I did the movie, it was to reveal what he revealed,
*  which was shocking in its implications.
*  We went even further.
*  We showed how the control of information,
*  the use of information can destabilize many regimes.
*  And they went after regime change, became the new the new modus operandi for the United States.
*  It was OK to change regimes.
*  We're good at it.
*  And the way we did it with a soft power, subtle.
*  What happened in Brazil a couple of years ago, typical,
*  you know, the whole forcing out the president of Lula, getting rid of the Dilma,
*  bringing in this wellness.
*  Other guy came in from the right.
*  But essentially, Brazil was completely changed, completely changed.
*  They're still working at it in Venezuela.
*  They got they worked in Bolivia.
*  They got they got rid of the guy illegally.
*  Honduras, Libya, Libya, Libya.
*  That's the most spectacular failure, right?
*  Well, that was one of one.
*  It's a failed state now.
*  But it was, you know, but that comes down to our policy in the Middle East. Yeah.
*  When you make a film like that,
*  how hard is it to put together?
*  I mean, the Stodin film is so disturbing because it's it's current, right?
*  We're dealing with things that are happening right now.
*  How hard is it to put it down and make it this dramatic piece
*  that's going to be enjoyed? It was hard. It was hard.
*  You have to judge that for yourself. I like the movie.
*  I think it's a it's a it's tense and keeps the keeps the tension throughout the movie.
*  Uh,
*  like, of course, I got to know Stodin very well.
*  I went to Moscow several times and met with him. Oh, really? Yeah.
*  How does that get arranged? Well,
*  does the bandana over your eyes? No,
*  I've done that too. But that was have you?
*  Yeah, that was a terrorist groups in the Middle East.
*  But what was that for?
*  That was for a persona non grata.
*  It was a documentary I did about in 2003,
*  2004 about the leader of the PLO.
*  Whoa. Arafat. Yeah, I got to know. Yeah. I did an interview with him.
*  Wow. What was that like?
*  I was more I didn't because of my connections,
*  I had more contact with the Israeli side. I was in Ramallah.
*  So I mean, I was talking to Netanyahu before he was prime minister.
*  I was talking to the leader, the ex prime minister, the prime minister,
*  all that. And then I went to Ramallah, which was a capital of the PLO there.
*  And actually I was there the day the Israelis,
*  the day before the Israelis came in and knocked out that knocked out the lights
*  and they isolated Arafat and the Ramallah.
*  We got out at the last second actually, but we were seen Ramallah.
*  We were seeing Arafat and showing his side of the equation,
*  showing what he was thinking. So part of that,
*  part of that I went to see a terrorist group.
*  They became quite famous later than they're well known.
*  They were young guys and they had their masks and I went at midnight.
*  I was more scared of the Israelis than them because the Israelis could be
*  tracking with their all their, they have all this equipment, you know,
*  bull the out of us when we're in there. I was, that's what I'm scared of.
*  So the Israelis were dangerous.
*  You thought the Israelis would do that knowing that you were a filmmaker?
*  I don't know what they're thinking. You know, no, I mean, I'm not sure they,
*  they knew what we were doing.
*  We saw they saw people going into a underground bunker with people with masks
*  and who knows what they thinking. They have great reconnaissance.
*  So you have to be careful when you fight them.
*  And so they requested that you wear a mask when they transport,
*  no, not the Israelis, but I mean, they transported me. Yes.
*  But when I got there, I took it off.
*  Did you, but that decision was not a tough decision to make to let them
*  drive you around with a mask on? No, I was very anxious to meet them.
*  They were, they were, they call them terrorists, but you know,
*  who's a terrorist these days?
*  You know, we can bomb other countries to death and call ourselves the good guys,
*  but we kill a lot of civilians around the world with our bombing.
*  This that that's true,
*  but this message that you have that you, you,
*  you're not just a guy who makes movies,
*  but you're a guy who makes movies and also a guy who's very outspoken about all
*  of these issues in the world.
*  Do those two get in the way of each other sometimes? Of course. Yeah.
*  There was people that think sometimes my outspokenness overshadows my work.
*  It might be true for them, but.
*  Well, they try to label you both ways too, which is very fascinating to me.
*  The world is complicated and I, uh,
*  I did speak out and some people think that's, they say,
*  I'm a filmmaker stick to being that, but you know, it's very hard if you care,
*  you know this.
*  Well, it's, it's very important that you don't.
*  And I'm glad that you have the courage to not stick to that. I mean,
*  I think it's when, when someone, please go ahead.
*  Snowden Snowden that we couldn't get support for it. We w it was financed,
*  ultimately from France and Germany and Italy.
*  And we got some, some small money at the end from the U S with a small
*  distributor. I mean, this is the biggest story.
*  One of the biggest stories of our time and we couldn't get support from any of
*  the studios. We went to all of them. Well, people are terrified of it.
*  It's that tells you a lot about what a mess we're in.
*  We don't even have the guts to, to talk about stuff. We shut up.
*  We censor ourselves. We self censor. Yeah.
*  And the, I don't, in the 1980s on 90s, I probably could have gotten it financed,
*  but not now.
*  Well, it's such a tense time and that,
*  that issue is so polarizing and I don't understand how it isn't.
*  I don't understand how it doesn't have universal support by American
*  citizens. The, the, the, this story needs to be told. I mean,
*  even when he was discussed as a podcast guest,
*  a lot of people were saying you should really stay away from that.
*  They don't understand. They think he's some kind of Russian agent. It's crazy.
*  You know, he's very, been very clear about it.
*  Well, he's, it's very clear when you listen to all of the interviews with him.
*  And then when I got a chance to talk to him myself, he is who he says he is.
*  Exactly. A boy scout. Yeah. I mean,
*  he has a story and it's a spectacular one and it's a,
*  it's one of the most important historical moments of our time that we recognize
*  that this overwhelming surveillance state has,
*  has existed without us even knowing it.
*  And cyber warfare too, it raises the whole issue of who's doing what to who.
*  We were very quick to say they're doing that to us, China, Russia, this, that,
*  they're doing this, steel, blah, blah, blah, blah. What are we doing? Yeah.
*  You know, you've had difficulties in making films,
*  but is there ever a film that you wanted to make that you never could? Yeah,
*  sure. What is that? Several.
*  Me lie. Me life. I got very close.
*  We were about two, three weeks away from shooting it in 2007 in Thailand and some
*  of it in Vietnam. I've been to me lie and Vietnam.
*  Great story because the massacre is unknown. They don't know. We don't,
*  people don't know the real story. It was investigated that massacre.
*  You've heard of it, right? I've heard 500 civilians were shot down in cold
*  blood. Baby's mother, everybody,
*  old people shot and not one enemy bullet was fired.
*  Not one. And we've heard all the obfuscations of that.
*  The whole thing was, you know, basically a misplanned operation because of
*  basically CIA was guiding the war and they were torturing to death.
*  Some no torturing, some poor soul who gave them information that was faulty.
*  Happens all the time, right? Torture works, right?
*  Torture doesn't work. And as a result, that the operation,
*  they were told that there was NBA in that village. They were not there.
*  So the guys went in thinking they should kill.
*  Did you write a screenplay for this?
*  No, someone else did and I was about to direct it and it was a,
*  it almost happened. It just ran into the fiscal crisis of 2008.
*  But that's not an excuse. Nobody wanted to make it.
*  Have you thought about trying again? I did. No, no go.
*  I also tried to make the Martin Luther King story years ago.
*  Many years I worked on it. Martin Luther King's a great story,
*  but it's a too tough a story to tell. I mean,
*  I think there's a lot portion of the black community that's really kind of
*  treats him like a saint martyr,
*  whereas this is more of a human man and his fault, you know,
*  his failings in this and that, but he's a hero in this, but you know,
*  his relationship with women is fascinating and we were into that whole aspect of
*  it. And what happened with that? It just never got together. Never.
*  It might be a good time to revisit that now. No,
*  it's I think it's a black filmmaker could revisit it.
*  It's definitely moved into that direction. I've also tried.
*  I tried for many years to do a Vita and I wrote a script for that,
*  but if another director made it.
*  How far down the road had you gotten with the Martin Luther King story?
*  Twice. I went, yeah, I wrote a, I,
*  me and someone else wrote a whole script. I think it's very good,
*  but gone, you know, you can't,
*  so many films get planned and not made for every film you do this like five,
*  five abortion.
*  Damn. That seems like a great one though. Yeah. I mean,
*  he's such a, an incredible and important character.
*  Boy does the world need a Martin Luther King Jr. Right now.
*  Yeah. Well things are changing all the time.
*  But listen, Oliver,
*  I've taken up a lot of your time and I really, really appreciate you being here.
*  Your book is called Chasing the Light. It's your memoir up until 1986.
*  I really hope you make another one because you have had one of the most
*  interesting and spectacular lives and show business.
*  You're a bad motherfucker. I appreciate you.
*  Thank you, Joe. I really enjoyed today. I, I, uh,
*  I, uh, I'm sorry. I didn't know I was, if this is a clean copy,
*  I can give it to you, I guess. Okay. What do you look, what you mean?
*  I was looking for. I had some writing in. No, that's my, I have to send you one.
*  I have one. I have one at home. I'm good. But thank you.
*  Thanks for everything. Appreciate you. Thank you. Bye everybody.
