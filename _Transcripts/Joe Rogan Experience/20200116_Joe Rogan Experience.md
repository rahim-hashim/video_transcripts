# Joe Rogan Experience #1412 - Jimmy Dore
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amx14K9N5CY)
*  Here we go
*  Good hello, Jimmy hi Joe. What's going on buddy? Good to see you. Good to see you too happening
*  well, we were just talking about the
*  The Air Force admitting that their pilots had seen UFOs and you were telling me you interviewed one of those
*  Yes, I interviewed commander Fravor and he was saying that this this chocolate is be my favorite
*  Come on. It's with an R. Fray. Oh favor flavor
*  Okay, he was talking to me and he was one of the guys that actually went to what is the word?
*  they do when they scramble and go to try to
*  Figure out what the fuck something is but they they monitored this thing. They saw it with their eyes
*  They saw it with their equipment. It was actively jamming the radar whatever this thing was
*  It was shaped like a tic-tac and it moved so fast. You couldn't track it with the human eye
*  They said it went from I think they said some some impossible number like
*  60,000 feet down to 200 feet in less than a second like whatever you could track, you know
*  A radar is a blip blip blip blip. They don't know how fast it actually went
*  They just know it went this insane distance in less than a second less than a radar jump
*  Like you and it would it would data had observed them in that area
*  Without his knowledge like other Air Force pilots had observed them and then had you know
*  Brought it up to the top of the food chain
*  But it wasn't something that got distributed to everybody until he saw it when he saw it
*  he was like what in the fuck am I looking at here and they're like we have we've been seeing these things and
*  This thing with no active propulsion system that you could recognize there was nothing around no fire coming out of it
*  And it would just just disappear just take off at insane race to speed and
*  actively jamming the radar
*  So when I covered this on my show, I said now I've heard
*  Reports that pilots see this stuff all the time, but they never confirmed it and my question was
*  Why now why would the Air Force be confirming that they saw UFOs now?
*  Because again like they've been there have been reports that pilots have seen this stuff forever. I'm not saying it didn't happen
*  I'm saying why are they admitting it happened now?
*  And then of course you see in this last defense budget they put in money for a space force
*  I think the money for the space force though is not because China is able to
*  Whatever they can do to make sure we want to spend more money. That's what they'll do. Hey, we saw UFO
*  Hey China. Hey, look over there. We got to spend more money
*  But Fravor I guarantee you isn't in that no no I guarantee you saw no no they're just now
*  But before they would say that's not true they the Air Force would go we don't acknowledge that now they're gonna acknowledge it
*  Right, you're probably right. There's probably something to that that it's just about
*  budgets and
*  Just I want to I don't want to be that cynical when it comes to something like that
*  Really? That's cynical. I want to think that come on. That's not cynical. That's two plus two it is you're right
*  But it's also cynical that the only reason why they're telling us is because of it's both things. Yeah, okay
*  It is two-point I mean look at this a hundred percent is well how they do it if they need some sort of justification for
*  Expanding their reach or expanding their budget they come up with some threat. Well, this is this Joe
*  I this is what I keep telling people and no one
*  Seems to think this is a big deal
*  but you know the
*  Democrats and the mainstream news have spent the last three years telling everybody that Trump is a man churning candidate
*  He's a traitor to our country who's and working under the behest of Vladimir Putin
*  And while they're impeaching him they're voting to give them an extra hundred thirty one billion dollars to go bomb anybody he wants
*  And if he's bombing at the behest of Vladimir Putin, why would you give them an extra hundred thirty one billion dollars?
*  Now, let me tell you how much a hundred thirty one billion dollars is Joe, please do
*  Well, twenty billion dollars without homelessness and homelessness. Yeah
*  Is that real though? That's that's that's the figure we get to that in a moment, but that's let's just let's just say it's twenty
*  Let's just say it's twenty billion a year a year not just once but every year you'd have to spend twenty billion
*  Okay, guess what? They're spending an extra hundred and thirty one billion since Trump took office
*  Every year going forward on bomb hundred and thirty one billion. You'd so everybody just college 110 billion. We'd have no homeless people
*  Yes, if they took that money and put it towards it
*  That's a lot. So somebody told me the difference between a million and a billion
*  So I read this so the I don't know maybe you want to fact-check make sure I'm not full of shit again, but
*  So like a million seconds would be like 11 days
*  But a billion seconds is like 33 years. Yeah something like that. I'm not sure if though but it's close
*  Yeah, so that's a hundred and thirty one billion dollars could do a lot of good things
*  You know, we could half our military budget and still we'd still be spending more more than any other country
*  Now, why do you think that they would do that? Why do you think while they're impeaching him?
*  they would also approve this incredible budget increase for military because
*  They're owned right by the military industrial complex
*  That's why because they you know, that's the defense secretaries could just came right from Raytheon, right?
*  The guy before the secretary of state came right from Exxon. I mean, come on that that's the beauty of Trump is like
*  You don't have to figure it out
*  It's right there
*  They asked him the other day about you know, his criticisms of how he's handling he goes, you know
*  We're where they said I didn't pull out of Syria and I did but I left troops for the oil
*  They're just there to guard the oil and it's like he just says it
*  So which a proves he's the funniest president we've ever had. Oh for sure. Oh, no doubt. No doubt
*  No doubt. I thought George Bush was funny this guy he's
*  Intentionally and unintentionally the funniest president you've ever had like the other day he was doing a signing
*  Last so in 2019 was the hundred centenaries a hundred year anniversary the centennial anniversary of women getting the right to vote women's suffrage
*  So he was signing a thing commemorating it the hundred year they're gonna have a coin and
*  As he said he goes, you know, I heard they've been working on getting this done for a long time
*  I wonder why it finally happened now because the centennials now dummy you
*  Why didn't a hundred years happen faster?
*  And he's sitting around going well we get stuff done. That's why I have it and they're all looking I'm like, okay, mr. President
*  But he straight faces it. It's hilarious. Do you think he's on speed and somebody? Oh, well
*  So when he did that one video with the drawer with the drawer opens actually a photo
*  It was a photo when he was eating that taco right? That's it. I love Hispanics. Remember that it was after he said some rude shit about
*  Mexicans so he does this taco bowl thing say that Trump Tower is the best taco bowls. I love Hispanics
*  Yes, and the drawer was open and you saw he had that stuff from England or whatever, right?
*  This is your fed super powerful pseudo effedrine, which is essentially a type of speed
*  Well, it's I like him on speed better than the other guy
*  I like the speedy speedy Trump. He's entertaining. Well, sometimes it wears off though, and you see him slurring his words
*  It gets really weird even try to finish word sometimes try but he
*  See him have a hard time with words. Sometimes what was the one word him and George Bush both? Oh sovereignty. They both
*  sovereign
*  Well, there's that one David Pakman put a video up
*  It showed all the different times that Trump has struggled to talk
*  But there's one that's really disturbing because it's obvious he's under some sort of
*  Sedative or he's coming down from some speed and he's barely staying awake while he's talking
*  It's like if you were calling if you called me at 3 o'clock in the morning and I just worked 24 hours in a row
*  And you like hey man, what are you doing?
*  Literally like really but yeah, you never seen it
*  No, I haven't seen it
*  No
*  See if you can find it because it's it's really bonkers because when you hear him talk you like oh my god
*  Like this and there was no discussion of this is not like he came out later and said hey guys had a bad night
*  Last night somebody slipped me a Mickey. It was a real issue
*  Well his whole thing is he's a teetotaler right Trump is nonsense. Is it? Yeah, the pseudoephedrine
*  Oh, no, but then it turns out he's doing you know pharmaceuticals. Yes. Yeah, he's doing what's legal
*  That's what it is. Yeah, you know if you you the doctor writes him a prescription, you know, there was this whole thing with
*  What was that?
*  There was that reporter that named the Duane Reed pharmacy that he had gone to in New York to fill this prescription for a
*  Metabolic condition which he said is like a bullshit
*  Reason it was like he took diet pills and this did diet pills were speed, but it was prescribed by his doctor
*  But look if you're a guy who wants to fucking get shit done all the yeah, you want to be on speed
*  I don't people way to go
*  I know people who say they write songs on speed like they're like, you know musician layer. I don't know slayer
*  Okay, you know, yeah that's speed music I don't know what the kids like Sarah McLaughlin on speed you imagine
*  She'd be like fuck those puppies. Yeah, you know, I I went to one of those
*  What they call the women's Lollapalooza, what were they called?
*  Lilith I was dating a girl. Oh, she took me
*  Oh my god, she's just trying to drain you turns out I was going through mentally imbalanced time. I didn't know
*  Turns out I was like, oh I was that was what I was going through a nervous breakdown
*  It's great music to listen to right before you go to bed
*  No, but I do remember the
*  What's that hard-rockin woman who's really good middle?
*  There's one that's really good Chrissy Chrissy hind. Yeah from the pretenders. That's it. Yeah, she's a beast that she was there that
*  I'm like, this is good. Oh, yeah, I was like, that's really good. Yeah. No, I always love her. Yeah, she's awesome
*  I was like why don't you just have her play more? Yeah, what the fuck is it? I can't even remember who else was there
*  Anytime you have all women's anything or an all man's anything for that matter. It's a mess
*  Like if you say this is a men's conference, we're here for men's that's right men's
*  That's like yeah, you're gonna find a bunch of bitch-ass men too
*  You're not gonna find any real men and it all men's getaway
*  Let's get together and talk about our problems and they're all they all stem from bitches. Yeah
*  It's a horrible situation I don't know how I
*  Don't know how women I just feel sorry for women that I have to fuck men
*  Don't you we're gross? No kidding?
*  No kidding. And do you ever just listen the way guys talk to women trying to get laid? It's like oh my god
*  Especially dumb guys that which is most guys most guys. Yeah, most people. Yeah, most men and women are dumb
*  Yes, the fact yeah, I would I would I'm close I'm in the dumb
*  Yeah, I put it there's gaps in my knowledge that I can't believe. Oh, yeah
*  And well neither of us are gonna figure anything out
*  We're not we're not that guy that they're gonna call on if there's a real issue we need Jimmy Dore
*  No, but that's it. But that's see that's the thing Joe, but my whole show is that
*  Someone as dumb as me can see through this. Yes, I can pit that I can put it together
*  Oh, we're gonna admit that we have UFOs and now we're gonna have a spacebar. Okay, I can put that together
*  That's the whole thing. It's like if I can do this. I know they can do this. They're just not doing it
*  I think the UFO thing is
*  You know, I know you're probably right in terms of like one of the reasons why they released it
*  But I think there's also this
*  When you get a bunch of like really credible people like that commander-favor guy when you get actual data like radar
*  You're you actually can look at the video of the infrared infrared camera of them tracking that thing
*  There's enough of those now that people are like well
*  What the fuck is going on and if you guys have all this money and all this equipment
*  Is this is this something that the Chinese are doing or the Russians are doing or is this something that you can't explain?
*  And I think we're in this area where there's so much information
*  People can get a hold of so many videos and so much stuff that they kind of have to start talking about it now
*  Okay, I
*  You know, I see how they shut down conversations around the most innocuous of inquiries. So that's true, too
*  They can say shame pretty hard. Yeah, they that's pretty that's true, too
*  But when you got a guy who's like a decorated pilot like flavor, and he's like look
*  I don't have any other crazy stories in my past. He's not a crazy guy rock solid
*  General all-around American hero type guy. He's like look I'll tell you what I fucking saw and it's pretty crazy
*  Well, those pilots though, they look they live a crazy life. They don't they well they have to go faster than the speed of sound
*  Well sex at dawn with the the book. Yeah
*  Look Chris is a good friend of mine
*  I think there's some of the things that Chris looks at like Chris is kind of a freak
*  He wants things to be a little on the freaky side
*  No, but the idea about the pilots is that they all swap so my wife's whopping because they think they could die at any moment
*  And they they create this bond. Yes
*  Yeah, they want someone to love their wife as much as they do or maybe they want to fuck their buddy's wife
*  We're all doing coke
*  They're all
*  Trump's diet pills and they want to bang each other's wives. So you don't think that happened?
*  Probably sure happens. Yeah, especially during wartime. Yeah, we're people shift war is crazy
*  You know the the mind shifts when you see bodies when you've killed people when you've made these
*  rationalizations and also you're very aware that someone's trying to do to you what you've done to people and your entire existence is
*  From dawn till dusk is eliminate the enemy and this is it's a it's a mindset that people slide right into it's my doctor
*  Dr. Sharp
*  That fucking guy. I'm just
*  Talks you sharp
*  Just kidding. Dr. Sharp that so did so dr. Charles sharp was he's the guy he's the greatest and no canal just Joel Charles
*  Jundale that guy he's under he's in Pasadena. Okay, I almost said Pasadena. Oh if you would have said out of reason fuck
*  But a Glendale cuz it's funnier. I always go Glendale. I
*  Always go Glendale and then that and I go Glendale
*  And then Torrance the torrents is a good one. This is good. It's like why you living there?
*  What do you what do you what are you in a pinto and Taurus?
*  Anyway, so
*  What was I talking about your dr. Sharp? Oh
*  So he said he smoked pot and when he was in Vietnam because I told him I smoked pot right just to let him know
*  everything that's happening with me chemically and
*  He said that he said yeah, I did it. I said you ever smoke. He goes. Yeah, I did it once in Vietnam
*  he said they would have a
*  Helicopter circling the medical he was a doctor the medic and so you could always hear it constantly searching for whatever people coming in us
*  And then all of a sudden I didn't hear it and it had crashed right so I had to go help the guy
*  And he said I just smoked pot and as a doctor you have to be able to disassociate from what you're doing
*  And he said I couldn't and he said so when I came up on him
*  And I could tell this guy was gonna be crippled further, and I couldn't
*  It would mess me up because so I never smoked pot again Wow I could see I could you imagine like you're new to pot
*  You know how it makes you sense things extra especially when you first start
*  You know how you just extra sent and then you walk up on a scene like that like oh my god
*  I couldn't imagine that so that yeah, I probably was
*  Yeah, I mean that's talk about bad trips bad bad trip. That's as bad as it gets
*  Yeah, walk up on someone who just crashed in a helicopter in the middle of a war and you you're high as fuck
*  And you realize he's crippled so let me ask you question when when you when I would travel out of the country
*  I would always think that oh I get like a little cold flu thing every time I travel out of the country
*  Like I would get night sweats, and I would kind of get headaches, and I would feel a little flu-y you know
*  and then
*  I've got this dental implant, and so I didn't so I want you know they say don't smoke or whatever
*  So I'm like gonna be extra good. I didn't smoke for a whole week I
*  Felt like I felt when I go to Europe. I'm like you have a physical addiction. Yes. I was like no way
*  Wow
*  Did you I'm that's why I want to ask is it ever happened to you when you travel outside the country no no
*  But some people do have that apparently yes like night sweats the worst night sweat you wake up
*  And you know as soon as I take this cover off. It's gonna be freezing
*  Yeah, so I gotta get up and change my t-shirt. I was sort of sleeping a t-shirt and and jeans
*  I like to be ready Timbaland
*  Now do you sleep before do you smoke before you go to bed is that your move of course okay?
*  So it helps you sleep. Oh, yeah. Yeah, how about you? No? It doesn't help you sleep. No no
*  No when I smoke pot. I'm awake. I start thinking about shit. I don't want to go to sleep
*  Oh, it depends what I smoke right so there's the thinking pot
*  And then there's the city but even the sleepy pot makes me sometimes it gives me a burst and but then like I smoke this
*  Stuff called GMO whoa it is the best genetically modified organisms. Oh, I wonder if that's what it stands for
*  Yeah, exactly. They're trying to fuck with you. They're like the GMO shit, son. They are fucking with me
*  Well, they're working like they're genetically modifying the weed for sure
*  I was just something good today. I was just in poor so I get this at my place over in Eagle Rock
*  So I was in Portland last week, and it's legal so I just walk into a pot store
*  And I go hey, I'm looking for an Indica high THC goes. How about GMO go you're kidding
*  Fucking Barrett it was great. How high is it? It's got like 29% THC
*  What was that shit that Kevin Smith dropped off wasn't it 42%?
*  How do you get something 42% he's going hard
*  He's an all-day guy. He's one of them all-day guys. He starts off in the morning. Just keep going
*  Yeah, so that the problem with like I love to take a little puff in the morning with my coffee or what-have-you
*  But the problem is you're giving up your later night buzz because I can't get buzzed more than once or twice a day. That's it
*  Because of my tolerance and then if I try to smoke more I'll just get a headache
*  Do you ever get headaches no, I don't get headaches from potty you don't get any of these problems
*  I just get the
*  in the
*  Over-stimulation the I mean you would call it paranoia
*  But I kind of welcome it sometimes because I think it's good to be
*  Hyper aware of all these different things and it makes you appreciate when you're not
*  You know I think that that that feeling that you get when you get high when you're like oh my god like everything is fucking
*  Dangerous the world is a dangerous place, and I'm gonna die someday for sure everyone around me is gonna die
*  I hope they don't die today
*  The crazy thing is like these feelings for some reason aren't there even though you know those things to be a fact
*  Like you know you're like a basically like oh
*  We are all water balloons
*  Like water balloons of blood with like sticks holding us together were so
*  Doughy and fleshy and weak and vulnerable and you know like that guy found when he found that helicopter
*  Yeah, and that's that's what happens to your body your body's a very vulnerable thing
*  It's not very tough even the toughest bodies very vulnerable. Yeah. Yeah, I know I I watch boxing
*  Yeah, see him go down. Oh, yeah toughest guys in the world, but you know what I
*  Always wondered what I have I've been knocked out you've been knocked out
*  Yes, okay, so it's not a bit like when you get knocked out, and you wake up
*  You don't know you like did I just get knocked out. I never does it really hurt completely unconscious
*  But I got TKO'd in a kickboxing bout I got dropped
*  And then I got I got hit with a bunch of other punches and the referee stopped it
*  That was more like my that was a weird that was the weirdest
*  Feeling I had ever had up to that moment was like my legs just stopped working like they just shut off
*  Like this guy hit me with a left hook I was conscious, but my leg just went whoop
*  Oh, that's what they stopped that's when they go his legs aren't there you always heard them say that but like they go
*  They literally go out they go whoo did you and you fell oh? Yeah, oh, they stopped working
*  It was very strange
*  And it's like your your brain gets jostled around inside your head and also when you get hit on the jaw
*  There's nerves behind your jaw when your bone of your jaw slams into those nerves and your head gets
*  Rattled in the brain all of it together is like everything just goes
*  What's happening here? You know sometimes you get knocked unconscious. I didn't get knocked unconscious, but
*  My shit just shut off I did I'm always surprised when guys get knocked out. They don't piss themselves
*  I got sometimes they do they get when they do they do a lot of times when you choke them out
*  Oh really yeah, we choke guys out. They piss themselves all the time
*  They shit themselves to if they have to shit really yeah, yeah, they just
*  So do you like before you go fight? Do you try to make sure you don't have to take a shit?
*  Yeah, sometimes guys do have to take a shit though like I've had guy the one time Michael
*  Kiesa who's a top UFC fighter he was right before he was fighting
*  He looked over at me like he's as he got into the cage goes dude. He goes. I'm gonna shit myself
*  He goes a guarantee. I'm gonna shit myself while this fights going on. I'm like fuck
*  Why wouldn't he just go to the back couldn't it was the way it worked out like you know they're calm
*  Okay, you're up. It's coming, but you can't go right now
*  No, and then he just makes the rock up there and then also
*  My diaries like oh my god, he won at winning the fight, but he put did he shit no he didn't shit himself
*  Oh, I talked about he's like I was swore. I was gonna shit myself
*  He's a funny dude. No. I didn't talk about it. I don't think I said it
*  I don't think I saw it, but I talked to him. I talked about it with him after the fight
*  He's like no. I didn't shit myself. That would be funny
*  We were laughing about it if you could talk about that's like I'm gonna have diarrhea. Let me talk to you for a second
*  If you heard this story
*  Well if you do you know if you have diarrhea, it's like it's one of those things man
*  I've been on this carnivore diet. Do you know what that is? No?
*  I'm eating only meat for the entire month of January just to see what it's like no vegetables none zero
*  I had an olive and I had one piece of chili mango
*  Actually had two pieces of chili mango, but uh and so is this good for you
*  That's where it gets weird. It's a really good question. I don't know
*  I don't even know how I feel about it. So what where did you get the idea to do it?
*  Everybody's doing it. Oh really all the kids all the crazy. So I did the Atkins thing
*  I did that like back in 2001 or something when I needed to lose whatever I did that and that that worked like it
*  That does work. It's very similar
*  In that you know you're just you're eliminating carbs
*  Yeah, you get your body to go into ketosis you're getting to buy your body to burn. He says that's yeah
*  It's the thing about the carnivore diet though is I actually check my piss
*  With a ketone strip and it showed that I'm not in ketosis. So you pee on you happy in ketosis
*  No, I think it's because I'm eating so much meat that when you have too much protein
*  There's something called
*  Glucogenesis I think it's called where your body breaks the protein down and turns it into glucose
*  And so that fucks with your ketone levels and that keeps you from going into ketosis
*  But it doesn't affect your energy level. My energy levels have been amazing like all day long. I'm flat
*  I'm sound like people always ask me
*  Why do you always have like that cough? It's this goddamn coffee. It's layered superfood coffee. It coats your throat. It's delicious
*  It is delicious. I love it when you said hey, do you like to Burke and you want it in your coffee?
*  What the fuck in my head I was thinking
*  There in the clothes the new math
*  Fucking to American American goddamn coffee. Come on. So good is it it is amazing
*  It's amazing, but I drink too much of it and I'm always like a little phlegm II because yeah, it's like in my throat
*  I'm not a big on American coffee, but this is fantastic
*  American coffee is how much of his growing America. Hmm
*  Is there any coffee grown in America?
*  I know is that when I go to Italy and or if I go to Hawaii and I have coffee
*  It's always better. No, Kona has the best coffee on earth. My favorite coffee comes from Kona. Yeah
*  There's something about Hawaiian. Okay, it's the volcanic soil. Is that what it is? Yeah, and that's the thing in Italy
*  There's volcanic soil whether tomatoes taste better in their coffee
*  And everything tastes better. It's the volcanic soil. I'm pretty sure one of it does the pussy
*  Any questions
*  I'm gonna say
*  I'm gonna say it makes them juicier. I bet right just like a piece of fruit or a tomato is juicier
*  I was so it's so funny you say that cuz I was just for out of nowhere. I started talking about
*  On stage last night how I you know, I hate the word vagina, but I like pussy
*  The vagina word is a weird word, right? Cuz like who's saying that other than the doctor, right?
*  No, you never you never in the middle of sex and have her woman go sticking in my
*  She did you'd go wait, are you sure? Oh, what are you doing? I'm gonna be experimenting with me
*  Are you experimenting? Yeah, I don't think a woman wants to hear that
*  I mean, maybe they have like cute little names for it nicknames
*  I had a joke I had a joke where I would say I go I get it
*  We were experimenting the other night my wife and right in the middle of sex
*  I took it out and I stuck it in her vagina Wow
*  Totally different fits like a glove
*  Why are shock jokes fun they're fun they're fun shock jokes are fun. They're always fun for me
*  I don't like when people say they're cheap like no, they're not cheap. They're different. It's a different thing, you know
*  Yes, there's really clever intellectual jokes and those are great, too
*  All right, I love a good fucked up joke
*  Yeah, especially because you think it's going to be something clever and that it's just the note back smash right in the face
*  Yeah
*  That's funny to me. It is funny. Yeah, I I'm a fan of all kinds of jokes
*  I like I like all kinds of comedy and there's a while where like dirty comedy was like look down upon as if it was
*  Easier well, but it was it was that Andrew Dice Clay. So when Andrew Dice Clay happened
*  So a lot of people started to ape him right because he was very popular. This is going back in the early 90s
*  yeah, I don't know if you're born yet and
*  And
*  So comedy clubs started expanding and they had more clubs and there were good comics
*  So then they started they started to give free tickets away
*  And so they started to book they wanted more generic acts that appealed to people who weren't necessarily
*  Comedy fans would have so this is my theory about what happened
*  And so then they would take keep it clean because we don't want to offend anybody. It's like that's not what fucking
*  That's not what people are then that and you know, that's why they all closed and you know what my opinion on that is
*  I think
*  Bad comedy sucks, but bad dirty comedy makes you angry. Yeah, that's what it is
*  Well, you know what's funny is I've noticed this like you if people watch a musician go up and play like even an open mic
*  Whatever and he plays a song or two and you don't like him. You'll still applaud after he's done
*  But if a comic goes up and he's not funny, it's like what the fuck
*  Yeah, people get angry they get angry because you have to listen to the whole thing you can't even talk to
*  Yes, awful, yeah, so that it's I always noticed that you could suck as a musician people will still apply you suck as a
*  Community like this fucking you know why also because funny if I go to see a musician
*  I will at least appreciate the fact this person can play a musical instrument, which I can't do
*  I have no musical talent at all, but I know how to talk
*  I can talk everybody can talk and everybody pretty much everybody said at least one thing funny at one point in time
*  So, you know what? It's like right say something and then it gets a laugh
*  You know you can do it. Mm-hmm
*  You know what they've done is just do it more and really put a lot of time into it and you know craft and act
*  But when that acts terrible you start thinking I could fucking do that. Why am I listening to this idiot?
*  Well, it was bad. Yeah, so it was bad comics that made me think I could do comedy
*  Oh for sure open mic night, right? Oh, no, I was watching it on TV. Oh
*  So I remember when I was in college, we got
*  Comedy like a cable in our dorm room, right? And so I remember I was watching the show. I
*  Forget maybe it was that one on a and he doesn't matter anyway the improv. No, it was that Rosie O'Donnell one
*  Whatever. Oh, remember she hosted that one and then Bobby. I forgot about that. Yeah
*  Fridays or something. I forget what it was called, but
*  Stand-up spotlight. Maybe yeah, maybe I was on VH. Yeah, that was VH. Oh VH one was stand-up spotlight
*  Yeah, so anyway, whatever so I'm watching and I see this comic go up and I'm he does like two jokes
*  I beat him to the punchline on both of them, right?
*  He said what I thought he was gonna say and then the third one wasn't even funny
*  He had inverted the punchline, which I didn't know that's what he had did
*  But I go he should have put that thing at the end and then afterwards I go
*  Wait a minute that guy I'm funnier than that guy and he's on TV. I think I could do this
*  Yeah, right like when I would go to clubs, I would go to Zanies in Chicago and
*  Those guys would just be
*  Hilarious and I'm like I could be funny for five minutes at a party, but I can't fucking do that, right?
*  But I didn't realize they were how when you do an act and you work and you do the whole thing and
*  So that's why I was like I can't do that. Those guys are special funny and then I saw guys on TV suck
*  I'm like, well, I could do that
*  I might not be able to go to Zanies it but I could go to see there was a time during the 80s where there
*  Was so many spots and so few comics that some really mediocre comics got on television. Yeah, really like mundane
*  nonsense bits
*  Yes, and they all had that kind of comedy time. Yes
*  Yes, we hear from Chicago too, which is a rough spot like it's fucking cold there people don't take any bullshit
*  It's a different kind of thing
*  You know like those are the kind of places that make great comics like fucking cold like Boston same shit
*  New York fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck even old and need a little misery
*  Fuck you and you need a yes. There has to be a need for comedy. Yes, like I was I say it was just in Hawaii
*  We did shows there. I'm like man. These people are laid-back
*  It's not a lot of great comics. There's a few good comics that come from Hawaii, but not a lot. Yeah, not a lot. It's that
*  You got it. It's hard to be upset. They have a lot of local humor like the comics from Hawaii
*  They I've seen some comics from Hawaii and they talk about local stuff. Mm-hmm. You know, yeah
*  Just like a cruise ship. Yeah, I kind of like that. Well, they're yeah, like the guys the guys who live there
*  They do their whole act is local. Yeah, and a lot of times they like a morning DJ
*  Yeah, I too or something. Yeah
*  Think about it. That's a pretty great life pretty fucking great place
*  You're a comic and a DJ and Hawaii Jesus you beat it you did it
*  you really did first time I went to why I was in Maui I was working at the
*  some stand-up gig booked through the ice house and I
*  Get off stage and this guy comes up and we're talking and I said
*  Where you from? He goes I'm from Pittsburgh. I go really what'd you do there? He goes I was I was a plumber
*  I go, what do you do here now? I go he goes I'm a plumber
*  I go, how do you make it from a plumber in Pittsburgh to Maui?
*  He goes well one day I woke up and I realized I could be a plumber in Hawaii or I could be a plumber in Pittsburgh
*  I'm like makes all the sense of the world. It's all the sense of the world. Yeah, I was a plumber I'd move there
*  Yeah, I know a guy who teaches jujitsu there who used to teach in he actually gave him my first lesson ever in Los Angeles
*  And he after a while he was like fuck this. What am I doing?
*  And I can teach in Maui, you know and the thing about like a place like Maui
*  There's enough people like you need everything like it's not like like La Nia we were talking about earlier. Yeah, that's a weird spot
*  Mm-hmm, because there's only 3,000 people on the whole island. It's like a good theater show
*  Like you take a good theater show and those people empty out. That's the whole
*  Civilization. Mm-hmm. And then there's people that fly in because it's a resort area, but it's uh
*  I was in kawaii one time too and it's similar like after I got off stage
*  I was like, hey, where can I go to get something to eat? They're like, there's no there's no place to go
*  This is gonna go in the ocean and catch it
*  Who does Laird Laird Hamilton he lives in kawaii
*  That's the fucking coffee you're drinking. Oh this guy talked about it for about a half hour earlier. I'm bad with names
*  Does that work? Is that a good enough excuse?
*  I'm bad with names
*  Laird Hamilton, he's married to Gabriella Reese. Oh, that's a giant Aquaman motherfucker
*  Great coffee. Yeah, he makes killer coffee thought to put to work kawaii is a spot that I need to get to I've never been to
*  That one I've never been to that island. I've only been to Honolulu very briefly during a layover
*  you know when I was actually the first time was going on when I we flew in a
*  Honolulu first and then you have to take like a puddle jumper to get to Lenni
*  Yeah, but when I is like there's nobody there man and you go on the beach is like fucking eight other families on the
*  beach everybody just like
*  Everybody's just chill. I never sleep better. Oh my god. I never I mean when I was relaxing
*  When I was in Hawaii, I would go to bed at midnight and wake up at 8 in the morning
*  I'd slip straight through you feel like this never happened. You feel great ever. Yeah, I come back to LA. I'm really getting headaches
*  Immediately gets five like god damn it
*  Go get a drink and I wonder of my tie believe it or not well my Maui and Hawaii in general
*  I think they have some wonky weed laws. I don't think weeds legal there. No. No, it's not. It's it medical is I think it's
*  Yeah, but life is my condition. I know and what I need it for life
*  Yeah
*  But I have so I didn't I have fans there. So they just give me some aha
*  Do you still do you still ever take pot from fans? You know afraid? Yes. Yeah me too. Yes
*  Just you're asking for it you are right. Yeah, I thought I'd give you a little extra taste
*  I put some acid on there for you. I don't need that right my good friend Ari Shafir dosed Burke Kreischer when they were doing a podcast
*  Together so that's real. That's free. I thought that was Joe no
*  He gave him Molly dropped it in his drink
*  So
*  Was there hard feelings over? Oh, yeah, there was a real problem. I thought that was all a joke
*  There's no jokes with us we don't do jokes, I mean I just saw it on Twitter. Yeah, that's real
*  Oh, that shit's real. No, yeah, so they're not pals. Oh, they're back. Okay, the wife hates him still though
*  Burt's wife's still I could very upset. I would have a hard time with that. Yeah, I would I only really issue
*  Yeah, I don't you know doing something like that. That's not right. That's that's like forcing. Oh, he knows it's not right
*  What's really interesting is I would we were just we were all joking around about it
*  Like this is the only business
*  Where you can dose your friend we all joke around about it laugh about it more
*  Nothing happens and he actually got a bump in his career
*  Like he started selling out places faster and when he was going places who already be doing shows and people would yell out dose me
*  I
*  Doze me so now he's known for dosing people and before that Ari used to do something
*  I should say allegedly because would it this this thing which may or may not have happened is very illegal
*  But he would do a play in places where weed was very illegal. He would play a game called find the edible
*  So he posted on Twitter who give people hints and he would leave some fucking nuclear edible
*  Like to some North Dakota guy who's gonna find it who probably doesn't get any real weed
*  and he's gonna get one of those stars of death and
*  He got in trouble. I think in Minnesota
*  Really
*  Allegedly because I don't think they ever found any of the things he was talking about so maybe it was all just a prank
*  Let's go with that those edibles man. Oh, my brother has something one time and he goes Jimmy be careful
*  It's called the creeper. That's what they call it
*  And I'm like I got I have a high tolerance. Don't worry. So I ate one. I'm like nothing
*  So I did the I did it. I had another one
*  And about 45 minutes later
*  We're at a campground talking to my parents and all of a sudden I can't remember how to breathe
*  And I just go I have to go make a phone call I'm in a campground
*  So I just go to my car and I'm just laying down the next thing I know I hear my wife behind me go
*  Are you okay? I go I'm not good
*  We have to go because I let's go say goodbye to you, but I can't say goodbye. Let's just go
*  You just couldn't deal with saying goodbye. Oh my god, so yeah turns out there is some danger to that
*  But that drug oh well this danger with schizophrenia
*  There's a real danger with people having schizophrenic breaks when they take high doses of edibles
*  Really even smoking it. Yeah
*  Well you were like you were talking about when you get their withdrawals
*  Yeah, I don't get the withdrawals, but there's a small percentage of people that do the small percentage
*  Yeah, I got that so that must be like so people like all aren't you gonna quit because no if you know if I if I
*  If I dropped drinking coffee when I went overseas I would get headaches too, right?
*  So it there's a lot of things like that. Yeah coffee is one thing that's addictive that we all just admit
*  And we just accept it yeah, we're addicted to it because it doesn't really change your state that much
*  Well, you're like freaking out like you never drink a cup of coffee like me. I can't get up. You know on the ground
*  Tweaking but I know a couple people who have had legitimate schizophrenic breaks. No kidding. You know a couple
*  Yeah, yeah legitimate ones legitimate ones. We're like something happened and
*  Then what is never the same again? What is?
*  Literally literally yeah, well I've heard about that with acid, but I never heard about that with well
*  It's not that much difference when you take a high level dose. It can get psychedelic added of edibles. Yeah, yeah
*  I've had that different. You feel like you're tripping
*  Yeah, a little and you're experiencing the God save me from the comments
*  But people get mad at me when I talk about this
*  But there's a thing that happens when you because I've talked about it so many times
*  I know I'm a repetitive fuck but even you eat marijuana
*  Your body produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite
*  It's four to five times more psychoactive than THC as it's processed by the liver
*  You get something that's not psychoactive in the smoked form
*  So when you smoke it you get THC when you eat it you get 11 hydroxy metabolite
*  It's much much stronger much stronger than THC. It's a totally different sensation
*  You know like people talk about the body high like yeah, you like oh you feel it everywhere
*  Yeah, you really tweak out too
*  But what about small doses of that are wonderful like a little like they have these
*  Jumbo has these sprays. I don't have one with me here
*  I used to have one on the desk, but it's a THC spray just a couple of pumps
*  Really? Yeah, it's like a breath spray a couple of pumps and it's like God you feel great. You feel really yeah
*  But if you take 12 pumps, I took 12 pumps once I did a podcast with Sam Harris
*  In the in the middle of I took the pumps like 20 minutes before he got here and then in the middle of the podcast
*  I'm like, holy shit. I don't know if I can thank God Sam is like a super articulate guy
*  So I could just kind of like throw a question his way and he would just expand while he's expanding and talking
*  I was pretending to listen
*  But really just trying to keep it together trying to keep it together and and make sure that I try to sober myself up
*  I was like trying to force myself into a state of sobriety
*  I've uh, it was about a thousand milligrams out. Yeah, I have a hard enough time
*  Paying attention to conversations when I'm not yeah when I'm just completely sober
*  I'll lose my train of thought me too and I'm like, what are they or I'll be from board, right?
*  Yeah, not even that even if I'm super interested. I'm interviewing someone and all of a sudden I'm like, oh fuck
*  I'm not listening. I'm thinking about that thing and then they stopped talking and I'm like, huh
*  Oh
*  You can't do that that's the cardinal sin, oh it's the way that's one thing
*  I don't think I do at least I don't I can't remember I try to really lock in it's me too
*  But then I just my mind will just get oh, so I was in interviewing Tulsi
*  And so this we came to this important part of the conversation. It was about how she had switched or something about
*  Her some policy she had so I asked her about it and every I know people are waiting and
*  There was a documentary and Tarian guy in there with her and his phone went off at that moment
*  I asked the question but it didn't go off like a ring. It went off like a scene from a movie
*  So now I'm like, what is that? Who's talking and then all of a sudden I'm like what is good?
*  And then after I realized that it's this guy's phone
*  It's a scene from a movie and then that I'm but Tulsi's been talking this whole time
*  Oh, no, so then I come back and then she stops. Oh my god
*  I
*  That's why you don't want someone else in the room while you're having conversations
*  No, no doubt
*  Talking to a guy and his girlfriend was sitting right there and she just kept spinning in her chair
*  And I'm trying to pay attention to him, but I'm just seeing this girl
*  Chair and playing with her phone and then and then afterwards I was like no more no more people in here
*  Because sometimes people try to come in here and then you'll see them like hold their camera up to take a picture while the podcast
*  So like hey
*  You're you're fucking this thing up man. This is a distraction
*  Yeah, like I don't do live ones. Do you do you do live ones live? What live podcasts? Yeah
*  Well, that's a different thing though, because you know, you're gonna be live. Yeah, this isn't I mean live in front of a group of humans
*  Oh, you mean with we met their audience. Yeah, but this is alive either. Oh, so that so that's not live
*  We stopped doing them live too. It's not this isn't live. No, there's a reason for that. Oh, that's good
*  Why want to edit something out? No because
*  Cuz often
*  The other day on my show so like when we were in the green room me Graham and Ron
*  Placoma gonna do a show so we'll say things funny to each other that you can't say in public
*  Like South Park, right? Right?
*  And so we were saying in it
*  It's funny to us and then I was on the show and with Ron and we were talking about I go remember when and I almost
*  Said it and I was like, oh my god
*  So, you know that you know, yeah, how come South Park gets away with that they're the best because first of all it's cartoons
*  They don't even look remotely human and they've been around for so long. They're grandfathered in they go fucking hard
*  They're they're so important. See the one
*  With the Harley Harley, but Davidson motorcycle riders where they called them all. I don't even know if I can say it
*  They could say it what I'm talking about. They call them all the F word the ends in a T
*  Yes, yes
*  And and many more things like that good it was
*  TV like yes, they can play it on TV. I can't say it
*  Well, do you remember a time there was a time where they used to show those old Roadrunner cartoons?
*  Yes, where they were hyper violent
*  Yeah, they were blowing things up and hitting each other have frying pans and yeah shooting each other in the face
*  And it was okay pushing them because it was because it was old and so the new cartoons were all
*  Sanitized and nerfed up but the old ones were still on but you would watch the old ones go
*  Oh, yeah, this is what it used to be like
*  well
*  I watched some old Popeye the other day and
*  Bluto is basically a fucking rapist. Yes. Thank you. Yes straight-up rapist just grabbing olive oil
*  Like big fat face is crazy
*  He's like
*  She's trying to fight him off and Papa's like hey let go me girl
*  Yeah, and he has to punch her and our punch him. Yeah, he fights with Bluto and you know, it's blue
*  Oh is a rapist. Yeah, he dragged her away. That's what that was. It means a fucking it's like a hundred years ago, right?
*  It's basically a hundred years ago. Papa. I was like 1930. So almost a hundred years ago and
*  Humans were just living different back then
*  I think rape was probably really prevalent so prevalent that you could joke around about it in a fucking cartoon
*  Yeah, and so so you don't go live now because well a bunch of channels started creating their own
*  Channels with my clips and so this is what can happen
*  So if you have a channel like and then someone says hey, I'm gonna take all your clips
*  I'm gonna take the interesting parts of your podcast
*  Make my own channel and then they can get like hundreds of thousands of subscribers with all of your content
*  Right and then they can have whatever they want put that on this so then they could use it as a white power fucking
*  YouTube channel, they have 500,000 subscribers. They could use it as a men's rights channel
*  They can use it as you know, they could just switch it over and say it's not about Jimmy Dore anymore
*  Now it's about bill burr and they they just use your content
*  Which is not legal and I was like when they were doing it while we were doing the show
*  So while we were doing the show they were making clips and then loading them as we were live you're still going
*  Yeah, so they're doing it in real time. So, okay, I got it
*  So we realized that those can be taken down and then we started doing it ourselves
*  And then we realized like the only way to really stop them from doing it in real time is to do it
*  Like film it have the podcast filmed and then have the clips cut up and then release it. Okay. Oh, okay
*  That's one. Okay. That's a big one. The other one was the copyright
*  There's a real problem with copyright strikes. Like if you get three strikes, they fucking pull your channel
*  So do you ever get one? We've gotten them we've gotten before for shit that we show
*  We've gotten them for before for shit that we show in the corner of the screen
*  Like the corners feel like a photograph or a video or a little tiny thing in the corner of a screen
*  We had one where we got one from a fucking a guy took a film
*  from his
*  Like it was like a cell phone of a satellite being launched like and we were watching it like watch the video
*  We got a copyright strike from that like just watching something that was on the internet
*  You can't do it
*  You can't people own these things the big one is nature videos those fucking nature videos when you're seeing like a pack
*  Oh, yeah hyenas try to take out a lion if you play that that's a copyright strike. They will get you for that
*  So I had a copyright strike recently
*  First one only when we've ever had right that's a strike not like hey, we're gonna demonetize totally different
*  I get that all the time. Yeah, that's all the time
*  But a strike is serious because they can take your channels on if you get two more of them
*  So the and when they do that they have to put they put a stamp, you know time stamp of what is the copywritten?
*  audio, right and
*  Someone had put a copyright strike on it at the end of every one of my videos it goes do do do do do
*  And it's just from iTunes right it's not it's non royalty thing. It's just it's like a it's a chime
*  It's not even music right so it's from GarageBand or something. Yes from GarageBand
*  Yeah, and so that's royalty free and so somebody put a copyright strike on that and I'm like, that's just someone messing with me
*  That's just so I hate her and some guy from like Canada who's now living in like
*  Thailand we've I had a guy track him down and he's like, yeah, there's he has no obvious source of revenue
*  And he's trolling you so
*  He's saying the guy who investigated said he thinks it's intelligence
*  I'm like and so the reason why he took that claim on that was to show that he could take down every one of my
*  Videos because that chimes in every one of my videos
*  So for a while I so until that copyright strike got cleared up. I don't have a liaison
*  It took a while and so we took that chime out of all our videos Christ. Yeah. Yeah, so that's
*  So I don't yeah YouTube is weird, but they're dealing with managing an insane amount of yeah
*  I don't know insane amount they can't and they always err on the side of the copyright holder
*  I get why they do that. They do it automatically. Yeah, I mean we've gotten copyright hits for a screenshot
*  You know when you see the video and there's like two heads and there's a small photograph
*  The screenshot was a photo that someone had took and they were claiming copyright on that photo
*  That was just on the internet. It's just because we had it in our screen. We had we had a change the photo
*  Really? Yeah, dude. It's fucking I know and it's weird because like some people like you have a podcast. That's
*  Just audio right? So yeah, I have an audio and video and video some people don't some people only have the video and then that
*  The you count on that YouTube monetization like there's a lot of people that did that they counted on that YouTube money and then YouTube
*  demonetizes things just
*  Randomly like it doesn't make any like I've had a bunch of podcasts with Tom Papa that were
*  Demonetized like that is the craziest thing. He is the like the nicest
*  Like an offend. Yeah, he's not offensive. He's hilarious. He's a sweetheart
*  Yeah, like Tom Papa like how many did they?
*  Demonetize a Tom Papa was like two or three right to the point where Papa got like really paranoid
*  And he was thinking he thinks someone in YouTube doesn't like me. There's something going on
*  So yet he wanted to contact some people at YouTube and he went down this journey
*  I remember he had he had a he was hosting a pilot on ladder like TBS or something and I got called into
*  Like do like a run through of it or whatever and I remember I walked up to him and I go hey Tom
*  How do you get your own TV show? I really want to get one
*  And he goes here's what you do you have to overextend yourself
*  How's you can't afford
*  Yeah, and you got you got it
*  Gotta make this happen. Can you imagine going back to regular TV now though with all the freedom that you have? No, I can't no
*  I can't I can't even imagine going to the radio, right? I just got in trouble. I just got in trouble, right?
*  So I have a show it's on KP of K. They're all nice people
*  But you can't there's because they're a nonprofit there's certain things you can't do like you can't over endorse
*  Like I had a candidate on and you're not supposed to endorse and I can't I you can't go hey go to their website
*  And donate you can't say any of that stuff
*  So yeah, it's just that I'm like, oh my god. How'd you get in trouble?
*  Would you do so I did that with who does so that guy Jen Kueger? Oh, he's running for that 25th
*  Dude, what that New York Times did to him was dirty. That was dirt. I shouldn't say the New York Times
*  I should say that writer whoever that writer was the whole but there was a LA Times
*  See it was a unbelievable
*  The New York Times one was the one where they tried to say that he was that his
*  Duke where he was like, oh, of course, you're not racist. It was as clear as day that he was joking
*  It's clear as day that he was being sarcastic and so talking to David fucking Duke
*  Yeah, the grand wizard of the KKK and he's like, oh, you're not racist
*  Of course, you're not racist and then they take that and they put it in quotes
*  He said to David Duke, of course, you're not race. That's right. So that's that's like mr. Smith goes to Washington shit dirty
*  But I couldn't believe that was the New York Times that hurt that one hurt because I was like who the you think it's funny
*  Yeah, I'm like I can't even times horrible
*  Do you don't know you've got me Joe you've got me you got Kyle Kalinsky
*  I do I do have Kyle. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you. I saw your interview with Kyle. I love Kyle. I heard that
*  We were talking yesterday his the shit you said good things about you. Oh, I didn't get that far. Oh, I love you
*  I could after you told him he was your favorite news show. Oh, you're my number two. Oh, I'll take it
*  I think he's the most reasonable of all the political commentators, but you're a comedian, right?
*  And a political commentator. I think you have a dual type of specials. Yeah, you're funnier than him for sure
*  That's sweet, that's all I care about he texted me yesterday New York City was 68 degrees
*  Yes, he was like what in the fuck is going on?
*  But then he's like I feel bad because I feel so happy cuz like seasonal depression, you know
*  It's sunny out and 68 degrees like yeah, everything's great. Meanwhile, the world's on fire. Yeah
*  Whatever. It's warm. It is warm. Yeah. No, he's great
*  There's that's the beautiful thing about having corrupt and dishonest media
*  Is that it opens the door for honest media like you and independent guys like yourself like Pac-man
*  Kulinski it's easy. It's quite a few
*  It's easy to outdo them and MSNBC or CNN or it really hurts hearing this the freight from a guy
*  I respect the New York Times is horrible. That's always been what I trusted
*  I've always do I know it was it was tough
*  I was tough when I when I realized that the mainstream news media is
*  Just the mouthpiece for the establishment when it really matters there for every war
*  Yeah, they're for every war their repeaters. How do we get into Iraq? They got Judith Miller to
*  Uncritically put the whatever Dick Cheney told her on the front page
*  That's why they all they have aluminum tubes front page of the New York Times and then Dick Cheney
*  So Dick Cheney tells Judith Miller they they have aluminum tubes
*  She prints it on the front page of the New York Times
*  Dick Cheney then goes on meet the press and said look even the New York Times is reporting this
*  That's how they do it and then Judith Miller gets it she gets an on-air job on Fox News after that she got rewarded
*  There's that and then there's probably also access to candidates access to top officials access
*  Journalism, you know if you don't give them what they want
*  They don't give you access and this is sort of the game that they've always played right?
*  That's exactly right back that they have access and they they I've I've experienced it
*  But what do you think why do you think they want to smear jink?
*  Mean like because they see him as an enemy of the Democratic Party because he she wants to get money out of politics
*  Right, so that's his big thing. He has wolf pack and his whole thing is I don't take corporate money and that Justice Democrats
*  They don't take corporate
*  So that's his whole thing right is about getting money out of them
*  Politics and they want to keep money in power because if you get one out of politics their whole grift is over right
*  Right the near attendance is not worth a hundred million dollars anymore. That's right
*  How do you go from zero to a hundred million dollars as as you're in Congress?
*  Well, you're a criminal that's that's what Truman said. Yeah, there's there's the only kind of people get rich while in government are criminals
*  That's what Truman said
*  but there's like isn't it some like there's forms of insider trading that are legal if you're
*  In Congress that wouldn't be legal if you were a regular citizen
*  I don't I know that they don't have them the rules that they should I know that there's rules that I shouldn't say regular citizen
*  But if you were like working for a corporation, there's rules like they're allowed to get
*  Information and influence in terms of like how they invest. Oh, right. It's that's not right, right?
*  That's that's extra information that I could get exactly. Yeah, that's right extra
*  And then they're allowed to get that information and then they're allowed to use it for their own personal profit
*  Like somehow or another that's not been stomped out
*  Yeah, and that was someone there was a video and I don't know if it's accurate
*  Or someone was explaining how Nancy Pelosi made all that money and I was like if I watch this fucking thing
*  I'm gonna stay up all night. It was one of those like I can't watch any more of this. Yeah
*  Well, I do we have a hundred millionaire is the leader of the People's Party. Is that amazing?
*  Not only that like what did you do? Did you sell hats? What'd you make that money?
*  What do you do? Do you make cars? Why do you think Nancy Pelosi impeached Trump but then impeached George Bush?
*  I don't know. I'll tell you tell me as Julian Assange revealed through WikiLeaks
*  it was because Nancy Pelosi was told in 2002 that our government was torturing people and
*  She was a person in a position of power and the reason why the Republicans and George Bush administration did that was so now they've got
*  Democrats complicit in their crimes and so she didn't tell anybody about it. She didn't lost an investigation
*  She didn't blow the whistle on this. So now she's complicit. So when George Bush
*  Lute once when the Republicans lose the house and she becomes leader and they go you're gonna impeach him
*  She goes impeachments off the table and nobody could figure it out
*  But nobody pushed her on it because we were just so glad we had a check on George Bush at that time
*  Well, Julian Assange then reveals there's a there's the memo that shows that she was briefed in 2002 on their torture program
*  Which makes her complicit in torture because she didn't do a goddamn thing about it
*  Did you see the interview that I did with Edward Snowden?
*  No, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not the first half it was very interesting. Yeah, Nancy Pelosi came up
*  Oh, yeah, it came up that she was one of the people that cleared then made it so that these
*  Cellphone companies have access to your data and can can spy on you and
*  Use it the government can use cell phones and all sorts of telecommunications and essentially video
*  your your
*  Voicemail emails all that shit all that all that shit can can get spied through and there was it was very complicated
*  Like I don't I don't remember the exact thing that
*  The I don't remember the exact scam like but Pelosi was involved in it. There you go. I mean, they're all corrupt
*  That's the whole that's that that's kind of like the mission of my show is to remind people how we got Trump people want to pretend
*  that a
*  Corruption and lying started in January 2017 the Afghanistan papers just came out Joe that revealed that three
*  Administrations in a row lied completely 100% about Afghanistan from the day
*  They took over to the daylight left stuff like Donald Rumpfels saying we don't even know who the bad guys are
*  We have no idea who they are. Well, why are we there? Well, maybe because of the couple trillion dollars in rare earth minerals
*  I don't know. Maybe you really think that maybe it's
*  We would go to war for minerals, come on we would we would try to steal somebody's natural resources
*  Do we use upset at what a small story it was?
*  I'm upset what those papers came out and then no one really even talked about and barely got nothing so it nothing
*  It justifies everything Tulsi Gabbard has been saying these wars are a lie and bullshit
*  We got to get out of them and that that that that she's not the one lying about him
*  The one that's been lying about him has been our government including Barack Obama
*  That's what the Afghanistan papers prove that they've been lot
*  We've been lied to tell everyone what the paper says so people so the so what happened was they did a study just like the Pentagon
*  Papers, right? They do their own study that reveals that they're lying
*  So they interviewed 400 people that were like in the milk generals into the military and contractors and all these kind of people
*  To find out so they can know what what would happen in Afghanistan
*  So they revealed all this the people who they were interviewing revealed all this that at the beginning of the war
*  They didn't know who that back. They still don't know who's the bad guys who were killing they were lying about they would lie that
*  it's going well and then their personal writings would be revealing that they didn't know what the hell they were doing and
*  So it was it's worse than you think but we can still just keep sending four billion dollars a month there
*  Just keep sending it just keep sending it for what no one knows. We're not leaving
*  Trump didn't take us out. It's gonna. It's he's a up for reelection in a couple more months. We're still in Afghanistan
*  He didn't do what he said he was gonna do nobody does that's the problem
*  And that's why we got Trump in the first place because Barack Obama comes in as an anti-war guy
*  Immediately gets rolled by the military industrial complex just like Trump did I believe that?
*  I did believe that Trump his druthers would get the hell out of the Middle East right, but he doesn't really have any druthers
*  He's like, okay. I'm done doing that because they've rolled me hard enough three years of Russiagate
*  I'm gonna do what they want. Well, you saw the conversation that he had with one reporter
*  We talked about the military industrial complex and about how they want to go to war. Yes
*  I mean Trump look actively while in office
*  This is like like an Eisenhower thing like as he's leaving while in office is talking about the military barely got mentioned
*  I know and so I so I think that's why
*  The establishment wants to get rid of Trump even though he does their bidding gives him their trillion dollar tax cuts
*  Nobody asked how we're gonna pay for it. He gives him he tries to go into Venezuela. He tried he tried to do it
*  You know, he's doing Iran. He didn't come out. We didn't get out of Syria. We're not out of Afghanistan
*  He's sending more people back to Iraq. It's amazing. What what's happened? The exact opposite of what he ran on is happening. So
*  Why do I
*  Why do I think this happens? It's because just what Eisenhower said is he left?
*  He says the we the undue influence of the military industrial complex and Joe imagine they just invented
*  131 billion dollars more worth of work for Raytheon and Boeing and Halliburton
*  How much money does the recording music business make a year? I'm 80 billion
*  I mean how much does it we've just invented a whole nother economy just since Trump got it and elected 131 extra billion
*  I mean just think what you could do with that. You could build 131 Yankee Stadiums
*  Do you think every year non cynically?
*  Do you think that a lot of this impeachment stuff and a lot of the scandal stuff is really a distraction for a lot of
*  These things they're pushing through yes
*  It's a hundred percent distraction and just like I told you because if they really believe that he was doing all these things and he was
*  Why would they keep giving him extra money to go bomb people at his own BS? They they?
*  They don't try to put handcuffs on them
*  So that's how you know their foolish shit and the reason why they're coming at Trump in the way
*  There's there's ways to so now they're starting to oppose them because of this Iran thing so now you turn on CNN and Chris
*  Cuomo goes hey
*  Why doesn't Congress do its job and take back the war powers that they gave into the president under this AUM?
*  So now which is what I predicted what happened when Trump the silver lining of a Trump presidency was all the shit that the Democrats and
*  Republicans have been agreeing on which is war
*  Fracking opening the Arctic to drilling all that stuff gassing immigrants at the board now
*  We're all gonna become aware of it well the Democrats spent three years doing frickin
*  Russiagate so they didn't ever oppose him on that stuff, and they let him keep doing it and so now
*  People are starting to become aware of what's happening and so now Chris Cuomo is going hey
*  Why don't why don't we why doesn't Congress do their job? Why are you letting crazy President Trump?
*  Well, they just gave him 131, but they they gave him his spying powers again through the Patriot Act
*  They this guy who's working for Putin you're gonna. Give him spying powers you fucking bullshitter
*  They're all fucking bullshitters
*  It's a weird scam yeah, Joe if you thought a guy was working for Putin
*  Would you give him an extra hundred thirty one billion dollars to go bomb anybody at his own pay by the way?
*  That's also intelligence is that a rhetorical question yes
*  So
*  It so that's why and you know people
*  People give me a hard time about supporting Tulsi right like why you but I think it's really important to have an anti-war voice that has
*  You know speaks from experience. She's actually in the military right now
*  She actually
*  Volunteered to go serve in their illegal wars, and then they smear for it. It's kind of amazing
*  Well, she's a weird one right because she has so many characteristics that you would think that everyone who's a progressive would want as a president
*  she is a
*  Veteran who twice served overseas
*  Twice deployed she's been a veteran for a long time long time congresswoman
*  She's from Hawaii. She's I mean I guess she's Hawaiian you would say she's a woman of color. They say she's a woman of color
*  What color?
*  She's like a like a black beige. She's tanner than me is she well. She lives in Hawaii. That's why yeah
*  I don't know about these things. I'm white. I don't know is really I mean the Hawaiian roots are essentially
*  Polynesian and South Pacific travelers who landed thousands of years ago on those islands, so yeah
*  I mean it is essentially a person of color either way
*  She's a very articulate rock solid woman
*  And they've tried to find a bunch of dirt on her and they can't and they and they don't know what to do
*  And it's just funny to me that a lot of people who are supporting Elizabeth Warren
*  We're shitting on Tulsi as hard as they can and of course Elizabeth Warren shows her true colors
*  She she does a right-wing sexist smear on Bernie Sanders is what I was weird
*  This is such what a crazy fake smear like nobody's buying that so it was it was heard the media and the DNC got together
*  And they're like hey, let's do this because it was coordinated
*  This didn't come out of nowhere right and the CNN to see that story CNN wrote these two people who heard it from these other
*  Two people who were not even gonna name and that's on CNN. That's CNN. That's how they do it. It's so crazy
*  Yes, they're digging their own grave though what they're what they're doing is they're making themselves less and less relevant
*  And they're making guys like you and independent people more and more relevant and more and more trustworthy
*  And that's why they keep going to the catnip of Russia gate or Trump's tweets
*  Or whatever impeachment and this phone call to the thing and you know look how they look how the media runs interference for the establishment
*  It's amazing like you know to pretend that the Bidens aren't corrupt
*  I know this and to have people come on and go that's a lie. That's no corruption. It's been looked into
*  There's no corruption that a guy has an $83,000 job on a board in a country his dad just helped overthrow
*  What are you fucking crazy? It seems like it might be a little corrupt
*  Well the conversation where he tells the prosecutor that if if he's not gone you don't get the billion dollars
*  Right what do you know they fired the guy right you saw that video so yeah
*  I've saw that video and did but their defense to that is they're saying but that prosecutor was corrupt and the next guy was
*  Even more tougher of an investigator, but that guy was investigating barismo at the time
*  Yeah, and that guy did say later that guy who got fired said I got fired because I was investigating barismo
*  He said that in a court document
*  so
*  Believe me they're all correct. Why didn't they why didn't they impeach Trump on the emoluments clause? Why didn't they do that?
*  Why did they do it on this bill?
*  So that's him benefiting off his position in government. It's cuz they all do it
*  Why do you think because it would bring up everything it would have to that's right?
*  Hillary Clinton, I mean Chelsea Clinton just got a nine million dollar job for she deserves it. Oh my god. She did she did the best
*  So then people are saying that people are saying what's wrong with the woman using her degree? She has three degrees
*  I wonder how she was afford able to afford those three degrees. I wonder she overcame all those obstacles did she did
*  Yeah, so if they're all corrupt that that's that's then that's the story and that's why we have Donald Trump clinging to this system
*  That's why we don't have a functioning medical system or a functioning banking system because Barack Obama was paid off by the bay by the
*  Health insurance companies and the Wall Street banks and that's not me saying that that's Dylan Ratigan award-winning Bloomberg reporter says that
*  How'd they pay him off? Oh
*  Well, he has a I don't know if you notice he just bought a house and Martha's Vineyard from the guy who owns the Celtics
*  He sells his 40 has 49 acres. He's got a lot of money 49. That's more acres than Kevin Hart
*  That's a lot of acres. It is a lot of acres. Yeah, that's that's the guy who's a community organizer
*  I guess it was a gated community
*  How do they pay him off like how does that work how does that work where it's legal like how does how does the the president get?
*  When he when he left when he left the presidency
*  He goes windsurfing with Branson for a while
*  Right as we still don't have clean water in Flint and and then when he comes back in the public life the first thing
*  He does he goes to make speeches for equity firms had a half a million to pop. Yeah for 20-minute speech
*  What do you think that is? What do you think all this is? It's a bribe. What do you after the fact? Yes
*  Yeah, but it's amazing that they still honor that that they're so rock-solid in their commitment to this corrupt system
*  That even after the guy can't even help him anymore. He's out of office. They hook him up with these speaking jobs, right?
*  He gets a half a million bucks a pop and then whatever he wants to do
*  Yeah, what's not a thing about the Clinton Foundation where Bill Clinton would?
*  He would make sure that he got speaking gigs
*  Along with the weapons deals that she was giving. Yes. Yeah, this is correct. Yeah, they're hungry
*  Everybody's again, they're dirty. We didn't get Trump because the Democratic Party was doing their job
*  Right the people were got desperate and decided to take a chance on a political novice game show host
*  Who they knew was a bullshitter?
*  Everybody knows Trump's a bullshitter. They were that good go bullshit those people we ate
*  Yeah, and that's deceit and I I've been imploring that Bernie campaign, which nobody listens to me. So it doesn't matter
*  Why don't they listen to you?
*  I don't know me because I communicate in a caustic way Joe
*  But I I've been trying to
*  Bernie is
*  Should be wiping the floor with these candidates it shouldn't even be close, right?
*  And so I've been employing them Bernie take the gloves off
*  Would you quit turning to Joe Biden and saying my best friend Joe Biden?
*  You got to do what Trump did what Trump was running. He ran against the Republican Party
*  He ran against all those pukes that the people are sick and tired of that the people have been let down by
*  These are the people who took you to Iraq. These are the people who took you to Libya
*  These are the people who are bankrupting you
*  So that's what he did and and you know, Bernie gets up and he goes joke my good friend
*  I just want to let you know you're corrupt. It's like quit saying you're friends with these fucking guys who are corrupt
*  Quit do just what he could land it. He should turn and I've been begging he came close in the last debate
*  He kind of came in his voice. Tell what she said. I'm not good at impressions. You're pretty good
*  I was the best but you got right there. That was a pretty good one Joe
*  Biden
*  The reason why you can't understand how Medicare for all works is
*  Because you're corrupt and you're paid not to understand and we're gonna get rid of your brand of corruption when I'm president
*  Because you're the problem. Oh
*  My god people go crazy the place would go fucking crazy Elizabeth Warren would stand up for Joe Biden
*  That's right my sexist piece. That's right. And everybody would see what the game is
*  Wasn't he like always and then Bernie Elizabeth Biden? Yeah, Elizabeth Biden Elizabeth Biden
*  With Warren wasn't he always in support of her Joe Biden. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no Bernie Sanders
*  Yeah, there was always in support of yes. So Elizabeth Warren was like, hey Bernie's policies are pretty popular. I'll pretend like they're mine
*  Yeah, well she was a Republican people forget that till she was 47 years old. Yeah, right forget that
*  Yeah, well while Bernie was running around telling people that a woman could be president. She was still a Republican. Yes, FYI
*  Yeah, so it's amazing that you know, it's like is anybody gonna vote for Elizabeth Warren over Bernie?
*  It's like vaping. That's what I say. It's like just smoke the real thing
*  Right. Well, there's a lot of people out there that still just want a woman president. That's right
*  Yeah, and I understand I understand that but you you got you can't let identity Trump policy
*  You got a you know, that's what identity politics
*  Well, we're gonna have a woman who's not as good as a guy or we'll have a woman who's who could be it's like
*  No, you're supposed to marry them together. You know, you can't just just because of her identity. That's not good
*  I'm just gonna torture her if she makes it if she becomes the nominee
*  She's gonna handle Meghan McCain the other day on the view
*  Did you see that how Meghan McCain?
*  Twisted into a pretzel to get her to say Soleimani was a terrorist. It was unbelievable the way she did
*  This is really why don't you say he is terrorist though? But well, and then she does that do but puff your cheeks out
*  No
*  The father you get away with shit, what do you mean? What did I do? I don't know
*  I'm just saying it's a puff your cheeks out problem
*  Are we supposed to pretend she's not fat who who who we talking about who we talking about
*  Have you ever seen Tim Dillon do his version of Meghan McCain? No, oh
*  I'm gonna get you something beautiful right now. Oh really I'm gonna show you something amazing
*  So there's this tape somebody put together of a of Meghan McCain saying my father
*  Have you seen that one where she says it over and over and over?
*  Yeah, so I started I was in Ventura, California. I was playing that clip like as a joke like it were gonna laugh
*  There was almost a fucking riot at my show people made me stop playing it. They didn't want to see it
*  At first I thought they were like cheering cuz they cheer often at my show and then I'm like, oh no, they're screaming
*  Oh Ventura is a sketchy spot. I had to

*  Well, they're probably booked it's so booked. Yeah, that's this you know, the store has never been more popular right now
*  It's sold out every night. Yeah, I know I did. Yeah, I should start going there
*  I just gotta get out of my ass. I just gotta get off my I go to you know, I go to
*  Flappers which is in Burbank
*  So it's real close to my house and I go up I go up there a couple times a week and it feels good
*  Then I go to the comedy magic club on the weekend. It's good club
*  That's a great club and then and I go to the improv randomly. Yeah, and
*  So that's that's pretty much my how often you getting up a week just
*  Maybe you know two or three times. That's not too bad. That's not too bad. It's not good
*  Yeah, I'm doing three sets tonight. See that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, you gotta do a lot
*  Reps, it's all about reps all about reps. It's like Alan. Hey, my friend Alan. Hey, we go to New York
*  And now he works at that
*  The comedy seller they have like three venues now. So he just has to make one call and he gets three sets a night
*  I'm like, oh
*  If I could just go out and he'd have to travel far. It's like all real close. Mm-hmm. That's yeah
*  I that's there's nothing better than doing three sets a night, right?
*  Well stand up is like I feel like it's like running like you want runners endurance. You want to be in shape
*  You got a run. Yeah to run and stand up
*  Stand up you do it you get into it you get the rhythm you get the groove you feel you feel it once you start
*  Think overthinking it. Yeah, and that happens with you know, if you have too much of a break for me
*  Anyway, I start to overthink it. I start to get nervous. Yeah, you get nervous
*  Oh, yeah, if you take time off, I was take you feel uncomfortable. That's the best way to describe
*  It's not necessarily nervous because I know jokes. I know how to tell them right, but I don't feel comfortable, right? Yeah
*  It's a totally yes. I was in
*  So just in Portland this last weekend do helium up there no, I do the Alberta Rose Theatre and
*  I
*  Had to write a whole new show because we came back too soon like six months ago
*  We were in Portland side to write a whole new fucking show and I was really sweating it
*  I didn't realize how nervous I was, you know, like I
*  And so when I got on stage like about 30 minutes in it was going good, right?
*  I got my appetite all of a sudden I was hungry and so I got a calzone and I had to eat it on stage
*  Yes, what?
*  Couldn't I was starving. I had another two hours to go. My show goes two and a half hours
*  And sometimes eight while you're on so I'm not saying like I have to get yeah
*  That's right. It's got a calzone. How do people handle it? They all went and got calzones. They sold out
*  So you had a break? No, we just as I'm doing the show
*  I have I had three people up on stage with me. I had you in the calzone business
*  Are you the Nancy Pelosi of calzones? I have that what's going on. You know, I have I have some interests
*  in calzone
*  No, I don't know how you can do that. That's I've often looked I'll be on stage and I looked out and the chicken wing
*  I'm like I could eat that fucking thing right now. I get yeah
*  So as soon as my nervousness goes away like I'll get hungry. Yeah, that's so weird
*  Yeah, while you're on stage you get hungry if I'm yeah, cuz my nervousness goes away. I don't know how
*  No, I understand. So before that because of the nervousness you can't eat
*  Yeah, so you go on stage hungry
*  Yes, but you probably should be but I don't feel hungry when I go outside
*  It's like a knot or whatever and then the nervousness goes away doing well
*  Yeah, and then you're like I gotta fucking eat something. Mm-hmm. You go on stage and you do two and a half hours
*  Yeah, whoa
*  Yeah, a lot of time. Well, it's not stand-up. I'm they have video. That's right. You're doing your show video doing a video show
*  Yeah, so but we write jokes for the videos and everything
*  It's not just guys doing a podcast right that makes a little more sense that you want to eat in the middle of it
*  Yeah, a little more sense cuz I look if you're on stage doing your act. Oh, yeah, you can't if I'm doing my act
*  That's why I said often doing my act
*  I've looked like I'd like to have a piece of that chicken. You can't do that
*  Like I could play a video that's gonna be a minute like
*  Oh, so that's what you know come back. Yeah, you worry about shit flying out of your mouth while you're talking
*  I do not worry about that should because the people already like me. Oh, okay. That's a good way looking at it
*  Yeah, that it's you know, it's such a freeing such I don't have to convince anybody or and that's the weird thing with my
*  Comedy like I like to go up in front of people who don't know me to surprise them in this in a way like watch
*  I'm gonna but I also have to get into it a little gentler. Yes gently
*  Right away get more gently. Yeah, so I have to get into I have to act like hey my brother said this
*  You know or hey, why did I'm too dumb? I don't get it
*  You know, like why why is the government against the workers strikes, but they're for military strikes
*  You know as opposed to the way you would do it in front of your crowd. Yeah in front of my crowd
*  I'm much more, you know
*  Amped up and angry or what have you that makes sense? Yeah. Yeah, it's a weird thing, right?
*  There's a catch-22 to that because like if you play to your people all the time
*  You can get soft because they'll laugh at you just cuz they like you that's right
*  And then a regular audience feel like what the fuck are you talking about? That's right
*  There's some people that I've seen where they do well
*  Especially like some podcast folks they have a crowd and then the people will come to see them when they do their shows and like
*  Oh, they're just happy to see you and you do well
*  But then you go do a show a rando show and the fucking improv where there's like five other people especially that lab
*  That lab is hot death at the improv. Yeah that little tiny room. It can be it's set up all fucked up
*  The door is right next to your stage. You're on stage and you hear the door and see people walking in the bar is enormous
*  It's way too big. It's like if everyone in the room was a rabbit alcoholic
*  Maybe you could justify having a bar that big in a room that small
*  That's funny
*  You know what? Not that you mentioned. I'm I guess I noticed that stuff
*  But they should like that room on fire. They really should take sage through that room and I enjoy it of ghosts
*  You know why I don't fire. I enjoyed it because there's no waitresses, right?
*  Not that I don't like waitresses you go get your own drink
*  Go get if you want to drink you go to the bar
*  So nobody walks around in front of you with this so it's and there's no distractions people just sit there. Oh, you're anti waitress
*  You mother fucker
*  Jimmy's got a problem with the women. Yeah, yeah, it's a male bartender a rugged
*  You know, we just got done making fun of
*  Kyle Kalinsky got in trouble for making fun of Elizabeth Warren's dancing
*  He didn't get in trouble that Cory Booker guy went out like that is nonsense
*  You virtual signaling dummy that is so silly. He made fun of everything. He made fun of Cory Booker's jokes dad jokes
*  He made fun of the that's that but if he makes fun of Elizabeth Warren all of a sudden it's sexist
*  It's like hey his quote. You see what he said. Like it was so clunky
*  Like I'm sorry you had 18 year old autistic college student or just gets a talk for the first time. Yeah
*  Yeah, it was so clunky. Yeah, how did you formulate this this sentence?
*  Did you really feel this then and it who do you think's gonna believe this like the people who are gonna believe this
*  You they already like you the most of the people are gonna see right through this thing. So it was just to me. It's like
*  You know, it's a schizophrenic message from people like that Elizabeth Warren's defenders
*  It's like well women can women can do anything except take a joke. I guess dance watch her dance
*  Let's watch that video Elizabeth Warren dancing if you're not making fun of that you're out of your fucking mind if there's a thing to
*  Make fun of why do white people think this is dancing by the way
*  You ever notice that George Bush dance my move and then then she does this to do that, too
*  I think Ellen may be may do that. I
*  Don't know Elon Musk did it to do ceiling
*  You know I'm not trying I took his jacket off threw it on the ground was dancing. It's having a good time
*  I guess that's okay. I got a couple pops. Yeah, he's not running for anything exactly
*  Yeah, and everybody made fun of it. Nobody accused anybody of being sexist really. Yeah, dancing was hilarious
*  We'll play that first. We'll play that second
*  Let's play the Elizabeth Warren one first because Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren one is so fucking ridiculous
*  You're watching her dance and you're like how how dare you say I can't make fun of this. How dare you?
*  How dare you fine? Obviously it's it by the way
*  It's not like somebody put up a cell phone video of her dancing at a wedding
*  Right no one's gonna get make no one's that's okay
*  Yeah
*  She's on stage trying to get something from people and she thinks this will get it for her here we go here she goes
*  So here she goes here. She's up there. I
*  Don't know if you can play that music so she decided yeah, we can't play that music so it's uh
*  Look at her look at her dancing so this first of all she looks like she's this isn't it no
*  There's no it's one with Julian Castro is in the background. This is a different one. This is her
*  There she goes though. Oh, no. She's doing it there, too
*  Yeah, oh no that would oh no
*  She keeps doing this if she looks like her back is welded
*  Like it's all one piece
*  Yes, you're right. Yeah, she's a robot. She's barely real. It's about being white. Mmm. You know weird because I thought she was Native American
*  Well, that's what I said
*  You know so obviously Bernie's lying about saying women can't win or Elizabeth Warren is lying about him saying that and I'm not gonna
*  Accused a Native American of lying. I'm just not gonna go there good for you. She is one
*  1000th Native American so that's that's real. That's a real number. So it might be 2000
*  Her moves shouldn't be like very elastic right that's a lot of 70 year olds that are out there
*  Mmm
*  Good point 70. She actually looks pretty good for 70 because Bernie looks like shit, right?
*  Bernie's head is in the middle of his chest
*  It's like oh, it's like falling off
*  If I was his friend, I'd be like bro, you got to work on your posture
*  We're gonna get you some spinal decompression
*  Get you to some yoga classes. You're gonna your heads gonna fall off when you meet him. He's taller than you think, right?
*  Yes, right
*  Yeah, you meet him like oh, I thought it's supposed to be up here
*  I thought for sure I was gonna be taller than him when I met him
*  You ever have that happen? I thought for sure I'm gonna be so or any and he was he's way taller than me
*  Well, I'm 5'8. I always assume I'm shorter than everybody. Okay meet him. Okay, pretty much. So uh, unless they're like a tiny person. I
*  Thought Chris Hedges was gonna be 6'5 when I met him and he's same height. He's a normal guy
*  Yes, normal not tall. Have you met Chris Cuomo?
*  Fredo Fred, did you call him Fredo?
*  No, he'll wreck my shit if I do that. He'll wreck your shit and throw you down the stairs
*  That was so revealing. Who are you? Are you 16? But you know that Fredo is the n-word
*  For oh, we've all said we've all said we've been saying that for years. Get fed a cheetie L
*  N-word that is so fucking dumb to say that
*  The idea that he thought that he could pass it off and he knew they were filming him. Yes. Yes
*  How do you not say it's like calling it saying that to an Italian American is like using the n-word like oh
*  Is it really guess what? Here's the thing about being Italian. There's no word for us. There's no word for us
*  You can call me a guinea. You can call me a greaseball. It's like, okay
*  Doesn't work. There's no word. They don't work. They worked for my grandfather's day
*  I used to talk to my grandfather because you know
*  He was an immigrant and he came over from Italy and he told me all the horrible shit kids in school would say to him
*  All the horrible shit people history. Yeah, yeah guineas back then were
*  They were they were talked to like trash immigrants like they were they wanted them to go home
*  They didn't want them there and there was a lot of dispute between the Irish and the Italians and yeah
*  I was were thought of the way a lot of racist people think of Mexicans like they're coming over here to take our jobs
*  They're coming up
*  They're infesting our neighborhood with their smells and their food and they're they want to talk their language
*  Like my grandparents always spoke Italian in the house. They always they smell great
*  Depends on what you like. I love Italian food. So it's my but they always talked Italian my grandmother and my grandfather
*  Always spoke Italian to each other. Yeah, they lived in an Italian neighborhood up until it changed. They lived in Newark, New Jersey
*  Okay, which was all Italian. So it seems like every wave of immigrants becomes the new horrible person
*  So the I'm I grew up because I was Irish and they talk about how the no Irish need apply all that stuff and that's
*  Why they yeah, I mean that's what it's just there's waves of this right and now the wave is, you know
*  Mexicans are the scapegoats, but you know, there's that documentary they did a while back a day with no Mexicans. Uh-huh
*  But it's true. Everything would fucking shut down
*  Especially Los Angeles. No kidding, but most of the country most of the country
*  This is the dirty secret about the United States of America is that we rely a lot of in I shouldn't say we a lot
*  Of industry podcast. It doesn't really rely on illegal immigrants
*  but a lot of industries rely on illegal immigrants and it's it's a fucked up situation to be in for them because they really don't
*  Have a path to become legal even if they've been proven right for decade after decade that they're a viable
*  Contributing part of our culture because they got over here illegally
*  Even if they came over here as a child that we can't we can't let you stay, you know
*  And that's another thing, you know the immigration
*  Had they've been scapegoated since as far as I can remember Bill Clinton
*  So Bill Clinton if you go back there C-SPAN videos of him saying Mexicans come in here taking our jobs and all that stuff
*  He was he did all that stuff and Hillary Clinton. She bragged that she voted for a border wall
*  She all our barrier was a fence in some places about she she bragged used to brag about it
*  And so then Trump comes along and turns it up another notch. They're like this guy's fuck, right?
*  It's like no you guys but so I make this point. He just says it in a way that yeah
*  It's very offensive and it's wrong right when he of course it is
*  But what I'm saying is he's building off of a bunch of shit that's offensive and wrong
*  Just like when they tweeted out those so you find out this is what I say
*  Oh, he he banned all the Muslims at the airport. Then you find out why are they at the airport?
*  Barack Obama's been bombing them for eight fucking years straight. He dropped 26,000 bob. They ran out of bombs
*  Then you find out these putting immigrants in cages you find out about Barack Obama built those cages
*  Then you say find out that Trump is gassing immigrants at the border and you find out Barack Obama also gassed immigrants at the border
*  And they should be honored. They were gassed by the lesser of two evils
*  So there is the silver lining and it's finally starting to come out because the the Democrats have run this Russia gate to the it's
*  Good done. They did the Mueller report. It's over. He concluded there is no collusion. It's over
*  So now they moved on to impeachment but now he's bombing so they're finally starting to talk about the War Powers Act
*  They're finally talking but nobody's talking about cutting the Pentagon budget. Did you hear do you hear that? I don't hear that
*  No, do you think that the the main the main thing about impeachment is supposedly that he tried to get Ukraine to investigate
*  His political opponent Joe Biden, right? That's the main thing
*  That's what they say take that out and there's basically nothing right and and and people
*  Aren't really that upset that he tried half the country for sure aren't upset that he tried to investigate
*  But so many people are clinging to this as if this is a this impede impeachment makes sense
*  Because they think that he's not presidential. That's it
*  Yeah that as as Aaron Matei says who is the only guy I know who won an award for his Russia gate coverage
*  Because he debunked it like a good reporter supposed to do what he he always makes the point that Trump is not a
*  Suitable steward of imperialism
*  And they think he puts an ugly face on the shit
*  We've been this is what I've this is the Trump puts an ugly face on the stuff
*  We've been doing all along
*  And so now people are gonna be more aware of it and we would have been more aware of it if the Democrats would have actually
*  Opposed him on substance instead of Russia gate. He says things sometimes that you go
*  You are just allowed to write your own speech like when he when he was talking about
*  Baghdadi that he died like a dog
*  And you're like what you're allowed to say that he died like a dog or how about that?
*  This is the weird thing that he uses Twitter to threaten other countries
*  Like when he was talking about Iran that if they respond they we will respond in perhaps a disproportionate manner
*  Like you're using Twitter to threaten like
*  nobody ever thought that there was gonna be this sort of a
*  venue for a
*  president to just
*  Just have mouth diarrhea
*  Mm-hmm, and that's why they I mean I really believe that's a big reason why a lot of the establishment
*  Wants to get rid of them because he makes them look bad because they agree with this policies the Democrats just gave him everything
*  He wanted they paid for his fucking border wall. They gave him expanded spying powers
*  They gave him my extra hundred thirty one billion to go bomb people. They helped fast-track his judges
*  They fucking also helped him deregulate Wall Street
*  What the fuck aren't they doing for him and that's why we have Donald Trump and that's why it's important that Bernie
*  Gets in that's why it's important that he overcomes
*  They're cheating and I just want Bert you talk about schizophrenic like Bernie has a schizophrenic strategy
*  Like people are upset that I critique his strategy. I want Bernie to be stronger
*  I want him to win and I want him to so like he will come out and give a speech where he says
*  I'm running against the Democrat as establishment and people go crazy, right?
*  That's the problem and then he'll do a video where he endorses the DNC like hey give us money
*  We got he did a video with all the Democratic candidates talking about unity and you every campaign had to pay
*  $170,000 to the DNC to be included in that video. Why because the DNC is bankrupt
*  Why because no one's donating to it?
*  And so they have to extort money out of their own candidate saying if you don't give us
*  $170,000 each to do this unity video. We won't have any money to help you once you win the nomination
*  So they all ponied up and they're all in it and Bernie's in a unity video
*  Where he's supposed to be speaking against the millionaires and billionaires? There's two billionaires in the fucking video
*  Tom Steyer and Bloomberg we got to come together with billionaires to oppose. No, they are the fucking problem
*  Bloomberg is a problem. He's not he's the guy who instituted stop and frisk
*  He's the guy who says New York needs more billionaires
*  Those are the fucking guys who are the problem and if Bernie would just got
*  Stopped, you know playing footsie with them in a sense, you know and just bash them
*  I think it wouldn't even be close if they would say he's got like Barack Obama. He's got to overwin
*  Because they're gonna cheat him. So he has to overwin, you know
*  And I tell you what if he picked Tulsi Gabbard as his vice president
*  He would crush Donald Trump because there are a lot of right-wingers and there's a lot of independence
*  There's a lot of anti-war people who are upset with the Republican Party a lot of independents libertarians were set and they like her because she's a
*  All the things that you like about her. She's strong
*  She doesn't fly off the hip and she's proven herself as a patriot all that stuff
*  What do you think they're doing? Who do you think they're leaning towards for the nominee? Do you think they want Warren? Oh
*  The establishment yes. Yeah, they want that
*  Well, that's why the DNC the media and Elizabeth Warren's campaign coordinated on this latest sexist hit on Bernie Sanders, but it's not working. I
*  Don't think so. I think it's backfiring. It's it should backfire
*  It's just it's amazing that the the Pocahontas stuff that she's gotten as far as she has it is with lying about being
*  Native-american and using it to get a job and the way she lies about it
*  I mean, she's such a bad again. She's also a bad liar like when when Meghan McCain can twist you to pretzel
*  That's not good. You know when you she she went on some
*  Podcasts with these black guys. I don't even see that video where she's being interviewed by three black guys
*  And they just yeah, they just tear her to shreds. Oh, is that Charlemagne? Is that on the Breakfast Club?
*  I think maybe I don't know you know anything Charlemagne sharp as fuck
*  I think he went after her for the whole Native American thing and she was just basically saying what's well
*  It's a family. Yeah, or even a older he nailed it was it was easy
*  You know, it was like you got you talking to Barry Weiss
*  About all you do is ask questions. Here is Tony mean Charlemagne the god calls Elizabeth Warren the original Rachel Tollazell. That's right
*  Yes, that's right, that's what he did say yes, yes, yes, yeah
*  Yeah, that is that's a hilarious thing to say the original the original well, she used it to get a job
*  I mean she really did and she didn't give any of that money back
*  I mean, didn't she get a job at Harvard because of that where she said she claimed she did it
*  She claimed she did it but it was on her application. Yeah, she was Native American
*  There's a reason why yeah, and she's just saying this because our family
*  But she was saying she's Native American like that's the whole thing. You're a hard worker
*  The whole thing you're a hot a hundred percent that I don't know what she was right
*  I know it's it's really come back to bite her in the ass. I know I bet you got enough not enough
*  She'll still bouncing around that like that's a liar like she's a she's a person that makes up a past
*  She's created a fake past and she did it back when there was no DNA test available
*  So you can get away with being Native American it makes you look like you're first of all you're kind of cool
*  Right everybody like you ever see that movie vision quest no great movie Matthew Modine
*  Oh, his buddy is like a fake Indian his buddy lied about being Native American. He had a mohawk and everything
*  He was playing up the Native American thing because people want to be Native American. It's a cool thing
*  Yeah, you know that they're they've thought to be more spiritual
*  Yeah more deep and interesting and and it's certainly more oppressed
*  So if you say that if she says she's Native American
*  Oh, look at this Native American woman who made it all the way to be president. It's exactly
*  Yeah, meanwhile she's like
*  What like one two thousandth Native American is that what it was some?
*  ridiculous
*  Ridiculously small number right so she just when she got her DNA test
*  Trump said that she if she was Native American that he would give a million dollars a charity give her a million dollars something
*  That and since she was like well time to pay up like what did you look at the numbers? Yes? She did
*  Yes, she did
*  I
*  Everything you're saying right now sexist. I hope you know that fuck. Yeah, everything you're saying is so whoo must be right
*  I'm talking about a woman what are people you know what?
*  You know you talk about how you feel bad about the New York Times not being yes
*  What you cuz I know I know that feeling you wanted somebody to be
*  What what did the other news people like at MSNBC and say what do they think when they see Tucker Carlson?
*  Kicking their ass doing war coverage isn't that fucking amazing the Tucker Carlson thing was interesting right amazing. He seems at least
*  Partially independent like how is he allowed to tell the truth about war at Fox News?
*  I don't fucking get that they're not allowed to tell the truth about war at CNN or MSNBC
*  Well Shepard Smith was allowed to tell the truth, too, but he was so sorry truth, but he was again
*  I'm too wise already the fuck out here. Yeah
*  Again, he there's a lots of truth. He didn't tell also, so that's why I
*  Did you see bombshell no, what is this? That's the movie with the Roger Ailes movie?
*  Oh, I started watching that oh man that guy who's the actor that from Australia. What's his name? Oh?
*  Whoever the guy is he's fantastic in bomb what isn't that John Lithgow and bombshell though
*  Is it you're thinking of the Dick Cheney movie? I'm thinking of a series
*  There's a series about Roger Ailes and Fox News oh and no this is a movie. Oh, I didn't this is a new Charlize
*  Oh, really yeah, well she plays
*  Megyn Kelly oh really yeah, yeah, so she's playing some attractive
*  and
*  Iwr sees nonprofit working to protect native women for violence more than half all native women have experienced sexual violence in the majority of violent
*  crimes against Native
*  Americans are perpetrated by non-natives send them your one million dollar check real Donald Trump
*  So she's saying that because she's Native American
*  She tested like a trace amount like it really it's probably like she blew a Native American guy in college
*  Well what it is by the way real Donald Trump?
*  I remember saying on 75 you give me one million dollars for charity if I choice of my DNA showed Native American ancestry
*  I remember and here's the verdict
*  Warren tests
*  Warren reveals test confirming ancestry what yeah, but it's such an insanely small amount
*  But god I am 1.6 percent African I am 200 times more
*  She's Native American. That's real
*  Yeah, L. Oh L. So
*  imagine I
*  Mean I thought that when she said she got fired from teaching and then the video came out said she quit
*  I thought that would be the end that should be the end too. I got called a sexist
*  For talking about that, oh you are sexist I had a Clinton advisor come at me a Bill Clinton advisor
*  That's hilarious
*  Advisors should all shut the you think up you would think you are so lucky you're not in jail
*  You think they flew 26 times with Jeffrey Epstein. It's not a lot of times. He was a good guy
*  He had a nice jet we flew around we saw the sky. We looked at things. We had a couple drinks
*  You do a good Clinton. It's all right
*  It's not that good Jeffrey Jeffrey actually does a good clan, but that's because he's got hours and hours and hours of tapes on me
*  Every time I try to do an impression it sounds like a drunk Irish guy. No, you're Bernie's pretty damn good
*  But bill is so obvious
*  $27. Yeah, you know why $27 cuz that's my social security number 27. That's good
*  Yeah, he's cuz he was a 27th person alive. It's an old joke joke. Yeah, I get it
*  It was funny in 2016. I get it. Okay, but any Bill Clinton advisor calling you a sexist
*  Yeah, that is a damn hilarious. That's rich. Did you write the come off your dress before you called me a sexist?
*  That fucking guy
*  When he dies, there will be stories. Yeah. Well, there's already stories. It was just we just haven't heard them
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, but I mean, it's just it's amazing how much they can keep quiet
*  Well, it's amazing that the Epstein thing just comes and goes and nobody gets nobody nobody gets thrown run out of office
*  Nobody gets nothing nothing fucking nothing. Well, how about the fact that they accidentally erased the first attempted suicide video?
*  Whoops, we accidentally erased that too. How about they erased all the torture videos?
*  I mean they did that the CIA did that they lied to Congress on camera. They did it's Joe. We're living in it happens
*  things go bad, what is Jesse Ventura say he says
*  When you're telling the truth is if I can forget that quote
*  But when you're living in the universal deceit telling the truth is a treasonous act or something. I just said it earlier
*  Well, Jesse Ventura. Yeah, he was gonna run for president
*  Wasn't he he as an independent? I don't know. Yeah. I think he toyed with it is Bloomberg still right? Yes
*  He is yes, I don't hear anything about he's spending tons of money on ads and stuff and so is
*  Steyer Steyer they say it was like number two and he got himself up to like number two in South Carolina or something
*  Because of all the money he's spending and you talk to people who live there
*  They go I went home for Christmas and every third commercial was a Tom Steyer commercial
*  So it's a local thing. So he's trying to get that market. Yeah, so he's like, okay
*  I might not win Iowa, but I can maybe put all my money into South Carolina
*  so do you think the establishment wants Elizabeth Warren because she's
*  Because of the fact look she's willing to play ball. Yes. She wants to be president
*  She was a Republican forever and then she switched over became a Democrat this thing about him
*  Bernie being sexist is so obviously a political ploy. It's so transparent and really gross
*  Yeah, so now when someone acts so now when they call Trump a sexist, it doesn't land right exactly. They cried wolf to me
*  That's exactly what I mean you're at they teach this to six-year-olds. Don't cry wolf
*  Yeah, and here they are an entire organization. That's the establishment has been crying wolf. It's crazy
*  Motherfucker these motherfuckers. What do you keep looking at your shirt for I spilled them some that to merit coffee on it
*  Oh washed it off. Oh, okay during the show. Did you had any me notice? Yeah, see that see how I notice
*  Observing I am
*  So do so how many times you go out in a week how many times I do shows yeah stand up
*  Um, it depends on the week but always at least four
*  This week I'm only working Tuesday and Wednesday night because I've got to go and do the UFC this weekend in Vegas
*  Oh, and I didn't schedule a gig and
*  But a regular weekend
*  Boy, depending on from on the road or here if I'm here. I mean on a regular week
*  I'll work Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday. I do that all the time. I'll do multiple sets a night
*  I'll do the store. I'll do the improv. You want to do the ice house. Okay, so
*  I changed subjects real quick. Do you watch boxing? Yes. Did you watch Reese? Yes
*  What well he got fat he was partying. Why did he do that? He had a good time
*  Fucked up got rid of his trainer. He did a lot of things wrong. They at first they were saying he lost too much weight
*  Did you remember that but that was just because there was a photo that he was doing like the Instagram?
*  Oh, is that it? It's like him in the bathroom looking down. Oh, okay, if you like
*  Have a camera
*  You can make yourself look slim, okay, yeah like I get nothing nothing gets me more excited than a good boxing match
*  Well that fight should have been a great fight, but Andy fucked up. Yeah, he really fucked up enough plan afterwards
*  He was asking for a rematch. I'm pretty sure he trained himself too for that. Yeah, I think he did
*  Yeah, well, he was I know for a fact why do we do all that?
*  he was partying because he became the heavyweight champion the world in an incredible knockout and I bet everybody was kissing his ass and
*  He bought a Rolls Royce came to the podcast. Oh, yeah, we did the podcast. He came in a Rolls Royce. Yeah, whoo
*  Which doesn't necessarily mean you're going off the rails, but it's a really good indication
*  Yeah, I mean if he showed up in a fucking Caprice classic, I believe this guy's dialed in. Yeah, he's focused. Yeah
*  He's gonna get this one. That's an old cop car. He's driving
*  No, I'm caps
*  Shitty old bench seats. Let's go get the championship. Yeah, he's he's Rocky Balboa, but he
*  Had his chance and they're not gonna give him another one now because he can beat a lot of guys
*  Yeah, but I don't know if he can sell a lot of pay-per-views
*  Especially after that second performance the problem with the second performance is the second performance was so piss poor that you're gonna need
*  multiple like
*  Big wins in fights before people take you seriously again again, and he needs a real nutritionist
*  He really does even though he he won being fat
*  There was a lot of factors in that fight one big factor that I have heard from people who are very
*  knowledgeable and in the know
*  Insiders was that Anthony Joshua was hurt in training that he got rocked and maybe even got KO'd when he was training and not not
*  Too distant from the fight. Oh, really two weeks out from the fight got KO'd. Yeah
*  Oh, that's not good when you're a heavyweight and you're slinging those fucking gigantic fists
*  At each other like yeah, all those guys need to do is catch each other once just once
*  Apparently just happens all the time
*  there was a
*  Russian heavyweight boxer who was just criticized because he showed this video of a sparring session where he flatlines his trainer or his
*  sparring partner with one punch
*  Happens it happens all the time for the knockouts you see in the ring
*  There's probably you know dozens more you'll never see with top fight top flight guys that are just you know
*  They're bringing in guys like when Klitschko was the champion he brought in guys like Anthony Joshua to spar with he brought in guys
*  Like Deontay Wilder he sparred with Deontay Wilder. I didn't know that. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, these guys they spar
*  I love I mean, I love I love watching down tights excited
*  It's like you know at any moment exactly like you said at any moment
*  It can happen the fight can turn around down is a freak. Yeah, he's a freak. Yeah freak of nature
*  Oh, so in what way there's no one I've ever seen who can knock everyone out
*  Oh, and that's him. He knocks everyone out. Yeah, there's never been a guy if you look at his record. It's insane
*  It's not just the fact that he's won so many fights. He only has one decision loss
*  He has one draw with Tyson Fury and then the rest he knocks people into orbit
*  Yeah, every other fight he has 40 knockouts. Yeah 40 wins and that Cuban guy
*  He just laid out that guy was Tom. Oh my god, and he hit him on the forehead. Yes
*  Yes
*  Was like a short punch he's he hits so hard it doesn't make sense
*  Yeah, or tease or tease was tough and he was down. Yeah
*  What in the fuck just yes, he hits people and they have a look on their face
*  Like they can't even believe how hard he hits them. Yeah that Dominic Brazil that ko like right after the Tyson Fury fight
*  Okay. Oh my god. He's a murderer. Yeah, he's the one the most murderous puncher
*  So I think they're gonna him and fury are gonna fight again yes, yeah
*  Next month exciting. Yeah. Yeah, there it is. Oh
*  Fantastic Tyson Fury's masturbating seven times a day to prep for wilder rematch
*  No, it's testosterone up. He said that brings his testosterone up. That's what he said. That's what he said
*  Wow, I think it's just she's reading into that. Who's that fighter that used to drink his own urine?
*  Leota machida it was a boxer. Oh really? Yeah, there was a boxer
*  A lot of people were doing that for a while. They thought urine therapy was that is not true, right Joe
*  I know you're not a doctor, but I am definitely a doctor and it is true and I want you to do it now
*  I've drank my piss before I tried it. Oh, come on. I'm fury on ways
*  He's preparing for a while
*  I'm masturbating seven times a day to keep up my testosterone pumping pump it pump it pump it pump it
*  Don't you know I gotta keep active and the testosterone flowing for the fight
*  Don't want the levels to go down so I always thought having sex was bad for you before I supposed to be yeah
*  Your levels actually go up not that it's bad
*  but some people think it's a distraction like Mike Tyson's view was I
*  He said that he felt that sex was distracting
*  So he would have sex just so you have to think about it because if you didn't have sex then he was just thinking
*  I'm sex all the time, but when Tyson was in his prime you got to also remember
*  He's a really young guy like he was in his early 20s testosterone through the fucking yeah, you know and the the level of
*  Girls that were bombing on him. Yes
*  Mean Robin Gibbons was beautiful the most beautiful women in the world were trying to get some of that that fucking gladiator dick
*  But I think for him he really felt like sex was a distraction and if he could just have sex then he wouldn't think
*  So I saw this play one time was written by Steve Martin and it was a
*  fictitious meaning between Picasso and Einstein in a bar in France. It was called Picasso at La Pia Gille and
*  In it Picasso's painting and he's talking and he says an artist must stay well fucked
*  Otherwise his eye goes from the page to the windowsill down to the street across over to the cafe where the girl sitting with
*  Their skirt up and and it's like you got that's what that always stuck with me
*  Yeah, this fan artist doesn't stay well fucked it all is gonna do but do is thinking about getting laid
*  Yeah, men will understand that but men will rarely say that in the presence of women
*  And so because of that women either don't believe it or they dismiss it or they think you're a pig for
*  Expressing it right all those things but men alone
*  They'll go oh, yeah, that makes sense. I give you say that you got to stay well fucked like oh, yeah, of course
*  You have to otherwise you get fucking distracted. That is true. Women have no idea
*  I heard a thing on NPR one time probably 15 years ago and they were doing a story about this
*  woman who decided to transition to be a man and
*  So she documented it and did like an audio thing and she talked about how
*  When she was in twin started feeling her testosterone and she would become attracted to women and she goes it didn't have to be
*  A boob it could be an elbow. It could be her ankle. It could be whatever and I and she goes
*  I finally understood 13 year old boys. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, pretty fucking distracting isn't it? Yeah, and then you got to keep your shit together. Well, it's not just that
*  It's a biological imperative. It's a reason why people breed
*  It's like that's built into the DNA to make people attracted to females so they can spread their DNA
*  And that's what it is
*  It's that simple it's it's it Billy deny that it's crazy
*  But you've got men denying it because they want women to like them and then you got women
*  Dismissing it because they they think that the men who express it in an honest way are pigs and sexist and they exhibit toxic
*  Masculinity which is that's a hilarious expression because you need to thank toxic masculinity for all the bridges all the fucking all the jets
*  All the rockets all this toxic masculinity
*  If you break down all the things that men have invented and all these toxic men have prevented
*  like you from being murdered in war and
*  Protected the country and all these all the different things that you could attribute a toxic masculinity
*  most of its positive
*  Now I forgot what those guys question is it's sitting in my head since you said talking about toxics
*  Maxillinity that I fucking can't even get the word out. I can't even say it. I can't fucking sovereignty toxic masculinity is a ridiculous thing to say
*  There's there's terrible men. There's terrible human beings that happen to be men. There's also terrible human beings that happen to be women
*  There's not toxic femininity
*  They're just they just have any women women who developed in a terrible way most likely with bad parents most likely abuse
*  Physical and or sexual and then they become a monster at the end of all this process
*  This is the same with men bad men are just bad human beings that happen to be men and when you see terrible things happen
*  It's not because of toxic masculinity. It's because it's a bad person
*  I believe in the individual there's individuals and some of them are bad and some of them are good
*  But you want if you just want to generalize against all men like you're you're on an uphill road
*  There's too many and obviously not me. I've never invented anything, but there's too many things that men have done that are positive
*  There's way too many there's too many things if you wanted to have like a scoreboard and you wanted to compete men versus women
*  Well, why would what are you gonna say when you look at all the different?
*  Accomplishments that men have made and obviously it's not me and it's not you
*  I'm not talking about us like that were on a team
*  But I'm saying like just this this concept that men are bad and you hear this a lot today, especially white men
*  I don't hear from white men. Okay. Well, that's crazy because there's a lot of nice white men. This is dumb
*  Yeah, he's one of them
*  But just just this idea that you can generalize about one entire group whether it's by gender or whether it's by
*  Race but by anything but you can do that with white men
*  You can't really do that with brown women. You can't say here's a problem with black women
*  You know all black women are this that people go you're a racist piece of shit
*  But if you say here's the problem with white men both are gross both statements
*  Generalizations are disgusting whether they're a gender based generalization or a
*  Sex based general whatever it is
*  So they would say that that's okay to say that about white men because of the power dynamic. Yes
*  White men have power. So if we say that it doesn't it's not even racist, right? Right. That's what that's
*  No, I don't know. I'm not a dumb argument. I'm not a professor. So I don't know if that's true or not
*  But I do what the white power this is thing white men have more power sure
*  But they also have more power than white men
*  It's a tiny percentage of white men who have the power that we're talking about when you're talking about CEOs
*  And you're talking about you know judges or what? Yes. Yes white men are in those positions of power
*  But they're also in those positions of power over most white men
*  Like it's it's not it's it's a very small amount of people that have an extraordinary amount of influence
*  Yeah, they happen to be white men, but when you say white men suck look at this like no, that's that's the smallest
*  Percentage of people who are these billionaires? Who are these CEOs? Who are these judges?
*  Who are these people that are in positions of power that happen to be white men? So have you ever now?
*  I don't again. I don't know. I heard a guy refer to himself like a regular guy
*  Refer to himself as a cis male. I'm gonna do that from now on
*  Have that has anyone ever done that it kind of blew me like I didn't even know what it was when I first heard it
*  Yeah, it's nonsense
*  You're a male if you're a trans woman and you you want to be referred to only as a woman fine
*  No problem with that, but I'm not gonna call myself a cis male. That's some new made-up shit
*  It sounds like you're calling you sissy sissy. Yeah, like when I first heard it
*  I'm like gender. I thought that's what a guy was doing when if when I first heard it a guy said
*  I'm a cis male blah blah blah. I'm like you're a sissy. I didn't know what it meant
*  I read this tweet once by this person who was saying
*  basically to shame people into using that ram it down their throats and eventually they'll accept it and it'll become normal and that you
*  Have to because if they want to refer to us as trans we have to refer to them as sis
*  We have to force them to refer to himself as sis. Yes. Yes. I didn't even know that's where it came from
*  It's to just to make a clear distinction
*  So instead of making it look like a trans woman is lesser
*  You said you instead of that you have
*  cisgender and
*  Transgender so they're there because you're you're adding to that name that prefix
*  Yeah, because you're adding to both now
*  Yeah
*  Now you've equalized the playing field you level the playing field but the problem with that is trans is extremely rare
*  it's the reason why you have that prefix in the first place because it's
*  Really really unusual to meet a trans woman despite how the internet would have you feel
*  I was always I'm sure it's a tough life to be a transgendered person like an incredibly tough
*  I was always a little jealous
*  Why don't you become a woman? I was always like kind of looks like fun
*  Why don't you dress up like Megan McCain and just start going on rants on your show?
*  You'd be free and you would have such a fucking free pass
*  I mean look Caitlyn Jenner kill the lady no one even talks about says anything
*  Just slammed her into traffic not paying attention rear-ended her into oncoming traffic
*  She's dead now and no one even brings it up. Everyone's like she's so brave. Do you think she's intact?
*  I heard she cut it off. Oh my god, is it con?
*  Yeah, I don't but that was an accident right it wasn't like it was a careless accident
*  Oh still she rear-ended somebody and slammed her into oncoming traffic. Okay, and whether or not she was on her phone
*  I don't know. Do you ever worry you're gonna say something?
*  I'm always worried like I'm ignorant above it. Like I said, I big gaps
*  Knowledge of stuff and so I remember I was what was I talking about the other day and I got it totally wrong
*  Like I didn't know
*  like somebody from the what Jamaica
*  That's also an African American I didn't know that sure because they came over from Africa
*  So that's I'm talking about how dumb I wouldn't say African American
*  I mean, I guess once they came to America and their American citizens. Yeah, they're African Americans. Yeah. Yeah, so I didn't again
*  This is a lot of Jamaicans refer to themselves as Jamaicans though
*  The thing about Jamaicans is like it's really unique how like unique cultures are known for like specific things
*  They're very positive Jamaicans are known for incredible work ethic. Yeah Jamaicans have multiple jobs. It's always a stand-up joke hitting
*  Yeah, yeah in New York. There was always jokes about Jamaicans about you know that they would get mad at you if you had less than five jobs
*  Oh, no kidding. Yeah, Jamaicans are known for being like very hustle oriented
*  That's a New York thing
*  I mean the only thing I've ever heard about Jamaicans is the stereotype of pot and all that too that too
*  But they have a lot of jobs pot smokers having five jobs goes to show you it doesn't take away your ambition
*  They don't it does it's that that's nonsense. Look, I smoke a lot of pot. I'm I'm pretty ambitious
*  I work a lot. Does it do you ever so I'll do a show, right?
*  Where I'm like criticizing someone or something and then I'll smoke a joint afterwards to relax and then I start
*  Everything yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Okay, we're talking shit. Yeah, I know
*  you know, I mean I'm thinking about my poorly worded rant of
*  Male versus women and I'm thinking like well, I probably should have said that better
*  But that's just a part of how it works, you know
*  what I was getting at but from all this though is that
*  We have to look at each other as individuals and this identity politics bullshit that people play whether it's male versus female
*  Whether it's black versus white and Asian and this and that we they have to be humans humans first and
*  One of the weirder things that's going on in Hollywood now is
*  There there's leaning so hard on diversity that it gets distracting
*  It's like it gets like I want to see is an example. I want to see frozen the musical
*  Frozen is about a Nordic. There's Nordic people one the girl has magic. Did you ever see it? You have kids. I didn't know I don't
*  In the play in the musical the dad is black and the mom's Chinese
*  Which is like, okay, maybe she's Asian. I don't know. Maybe she's Korean. I don't know. It's hard to tell I can't see that
*  Good. I'm 52. Okay far away, but she was obviously Asian and
*  Then they have a kid and then the young version of the kid is Asian and then the old version of the kid later in
*  The musical is white
*  I'm like you're distracting the fuck. Yeah, that's the strategy distract the fuck out of that
*  How does a black guy and an Asian lady make two two blonde ladies? What's happening here or one has red hair?
*  How that happened? How did the black guy and the Chinese lady make a blonde you?
*  Yes, I guess I don't you go continuity, but they're just it's it's distracting the guy
*  He was great in his role. She was great in her role. They were excellent. It worked
*  I
*  Accepted it and I moved on but I know what you're doing
*  You know if you had a white guy playing a black guy in a movie, I'd be like what is happening here
*  Why is this white guy pretending to be a black guy?
*  This is does this is are we gonna address this like if there was a musical and there was a guy and we decided
*  we'll just have a white guy play the the father of
*  You know some some black guy and we're just not gonna say why he had a kid that was black
*  We just assume that you'll figure it out or just you just you know
*  Yeah, that's that breaks the fourth wall it breaks your but you what is you?
*  I'm suspending my disbelief and then you're doing things to make me disbelief. It's distracting. It's distracting, but I
*  Understand what they're doing. I appreciate it. Yeah, because I think ultimately what it is is it's all
*  All of it is moving in the right direction. It's just doing it in a very clunky way. They're moving against discrimination
*  They're moving against racism. They're moving for cultural diversity
*  Beautiful, but it's just distracting the way they're doing it is so up, but it's like Hollywood is so gross
*  They lick their finger. They have no virtue
*  They lick their fingers which way the wind blown this way we need Asians and they'll just fucking just start hiring Asians for things
*  I'm trying to get Asian people jobs and try to look look look look we have Asians
*  We're really and then if it becomes Jamaicans Jamaicans. We need Jamaicans get them in here get them in here
*  They don't give a fuck they're trying to make money
*  They're trying to make money and one of the best ways to make money is to ride cultural trends
*  And so our cultural trend right now is a good one even though there's a lot of people that are there. They're basically
*  Their controversy pimps, right?
*  So when these things come up they use this controversy to gain money or notoriety
*  Or push their cause or to use it as the wind behind their sale
*  So they can talk a lot of shit about other people and get a lot of attention it gives them a bit of immunity
*  Yes, it gives them a lot of immunity. Yeah, and so like all these things
*  Of course. Yeah, how have you experienced it? I've had people accuse me of being sexist
*  I've had that click we already established that you were sexist. I well of course I am
*  Because I because I treat women equally. Yes. That's the problem
*  Yeah, of course you know I was sexist because I voted for Jill Stein
*  Well anybody that says you're sexist for making fun of Elizabeth Warren dancing is a fucking buffoon
*  That's a perfect example what I'm talking about
*  Like are you saying that you a person running for the commander-in-chief of the greatest army the world has ever known and you can't make
*  Fun of the way they dance because they have a vagina fuck you. I am woman hear me roar
*  Just don't make fun of my dancing or my roars
*  Again it's like the I thought the answer to this was to treat everybody equally yes
*  That's how it should be
*  But identity politics the real problem with it of course always is that you cannot ever say
*  This is a man so he must be that this is a woman so she must be that this is a black person
*  So they must be this that's it those generalizations are bad for everybody people are nuanced
*  And if we don't believe in the individual then we don't really
*  Believe in equality we have to everyone has to have their own way to make it through this life and
*  Express themselves in a unique way where they can contribute in a unique way
*  And we can appreciate them for who they are not appreciate them as a woman or appreciate them as a man or as a white man
*  Or a black woman or what that's nonsense. It's so dumb like you happen you might happen to be a
*  Black man, or you might happen to be an Asian man you might happen to be all those things, but you're a person
*  You're a fucking individual and we should especially when it comes to
*  meritocracy things like
*  Positions of power and government like you get elected officials or
*  even comedians or anything else I you you want to make sure that the person who's
*  This is they're good, so they're just good. There's yes, so there's that yeah
*  But then there's there's also this other little part of it like so even someone who say doesn't have the pedigree like there's a white
*  Guy from Harvard right he has the straight a is the greatest whatever and then you might get a
*  Minus student who's a minority from so are a B plus student and that would be more effective to have in a position because they
*  have a different world experience so
*  Meritocracy in a sense kind of leaves out some people who were have different hurdles to get over and have different life
*  Experiences that this person won't have you know see what I'm saying like you become the people you're surrounded by so if you might be an
*  African-American, but it or or
*  So it's it's more important to have
*  Different economic
*  Represented because you can be really smart like Chelsea Clinton
*  But she doesn't know what it's like to have to have her medicine
*  She doesn't know what it's like to have to drop a pharmacy to get medicine for her daughter
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like she might be super smart
*  But she doesn't have this information that we need which is like when FDR when he was doing the banks and stuff he got a banker
*  From Texas he didn't go to Wall Street. You know what I mean?
*  He got regular people to come in so that there's something to that too, right?
*  Straight meritocracy well it is a meritocracy in that there's merit in their life experience
*  Oh, okay, we put it down these individuals that live these difficult lives like I think that's one of the greatest currencies that a person
*  Really carries with them in their life is their experience overcoming adversity their experience overcoming adversity
*  Shapes their care yes, and when you meet someone me maybe you meet this woman, and she
*  She has
*  You know all B's through college, but she's been through a lot of shit
*  And she's uniquely clever and how she handles things and you talked her and you look at a record and you go
*  You know what I like you better than this guy who got all A's because he seems kind of like yeah
*  Spectrum II and he's not gonna like to fit in with my company, but yeah that makes sense, but that again
*  We're just you don't just look at meritocracy
*  You look at the individual and there's a lot of benefit to people that have overcome
*  Difficult lives like those people come out interesting those people come out important because they they've they've
*  Seen some shit that you haven't seen yes, that's that is what and they and they understand things that you don't understand
*  Yes, and that's why like so like a guy like Barack Obama could have a diverse cabinet
*  But they're all from the same class
*  Yes, so they're all he stills he served he served the
*  Establishment power like any white president did and his cabinet did the same thing by the way his cabinet came from an email from
*  Citigroup, which I know you know yeah fuck yeah, you know what are
*  It's these things are complicated. That's part of the problem with any of these conversations and also they're so loaded
*  These things are complicated
*  That's part of the problem with any of these conversations and also they're so loaded
*  When you talk about men or women or black or white anything like everybody's on edge like don't say anything stupid right?
*  What how do you feel really like whoa? Well? I'm white so I don't have those experiences
*  So I always try to limit how I talk about it like I always say I shouldn't be talking about this because I am I don't
*  Have you should be talking about anything you want to talk about this idea that you could be should be silenced
*  Because you're you're not
*  In some protected group that's nonsense. I've always a well. I'm always afraid. I'm going to say something
*  Ridiculous and ignorant which I do often yeah me too
*  I'm gonna save ignorant ridiculous shit like this you have to have the ability to say ignorant ridiculous shit
*  If you're gonna have a free-flowing conversation like you and I so we didn't even talk on the phone before this we had no idea
*  We're gonna talk about we didn't do a pre-interview
*  We did nothing we come in here
*  It'll be hilarious we just started talking about farts
*  Jack it off seven times a day to keep my testosterone. Let's talk about that. Yeah get it get it get it pre interviews
*  They still do pre interviews under do you by the way do you ever watch any of those shows ever?
*  No, no one does very few people are watching those I mean
*  Conan O'Brien get less views than my show no I know that's why that's why they're all doing podcasts now
*  I know that's that fucking show there was a crazy article that Conan O'Brien is leading the way
*  In new media yes like what are you talking about? We've been doing this shit for 15 years, bitch
*  And this thing what the fuck doesn't even get good numbers on his podcast no no
*  Like the actual downloads me does alright
*  but he doesn't do as good as like Dax Shepard or me or any of the people that are at the
*  Top of the heap and comedy well be you know you use your platform Joe to actually have real conversations and say thing
*  I haven't listened to Conan O'Brien's a podcast because you know I've got anything else to do, but he's interviewing famous people
*  Yeah, it's fucking the same bullshit, and it's not I mean hey mark Barron's got that covered right he did that
*  Doing it for ten fucking years. That's right people opened up to their heart dug in the never
*  So he has this thing and then you do this other thing
*  It's fucking covered you aren't breaking any new that was crazy that had that was a New York Times headline wasn't it Joe
*  I think it was a was a Friday
*  I think it was variety and everybody in Hollywood was like what in the fuck are you talking about yeah?
*  Yeah, and well it was funny to yeah, I got tagged on it so many times
*  I'm like I'm not even gonna comment because I can't it's Conan O'Brien. He's revolutionized
*  Yeah, he's changing the game. He's changing the game because they gave he had a photo shoot. Yeah, he's a white man
*  Right problem. He is a cis male. He's another one of those white men at the top of podcasting. It's bullshit
*  Yeah, I don't know if he's at the top of podcasting Joe. I wouldn't say that all of it
*  It's just gross. Did you ever do his show? No. Oh, yeah, I did a show before a couple times
*  He's seen they sell seem like nice people. He's a nice guy. He seems like they all seem like very nice people
*  I feel bad when I go after them on Twitter
*  I go after Andy Richter all the course you do I go after any ritual
*  I can tell he's a nice guy. I can I know it well because you know, he's famous, right?
*  And he's a white male and he's a white male. So it's very safe for me to go after him, but he
*  There's this Hollywood mentality on the left, right?
*  And this Hollywood mentality on the left is that all bad things started in January 2017
*  They have no idea how we got there
*  So he's tweeting out this stuff about how Trump is has the cognition of an eight-year-old right because he wants to do war crimes
*  And so I what you know, how great can you believe this guy? I'm like, dude
*  They've been fucking doing war crimes since I was born. Why are you acting like this just started?
*  We're just we don't ever prosecute them and they're not gonna prosecute him for war crimes
*  Why are you fucking dude that you know what war criminals do they go and dance with Ellen on daytime television?
*  That's the cognition of Hollywood
*  Marcel Obama says George Bush and her have the exact same values a war criminal. She has the exact same
*  That's the cognition of a fucking first lady
*  We're talking about cognition how we fucking got here and you're smarter than that Andy Richter
*  And that's why I hold his feet to the fire. I know he's a nice guy, but he gets locked into that team
*  It's all that it's all team. It's all fucking vote blue. No matter who it's all it's all forget how we got here
*  Let's forget that Barack Obama was unbelievably corrupt
*  Which is why we don't have a functioning banking system
*  Which is why we don't have a functioning health care system
*  Which we why he took us from two wars to seven, which is why he had a peace prize and a fucking kill list
*  Wait, where's my kill list? Oh, maybe it's underneath my peace prize. I use it as a paperweight kind of ironically
*  Anyway, these are the things that I try to focus on Joe by the way, I was right about all of them
*  Yeah, and I was right about fucking Russia gate
*  You were but the beautiful thing about you a victory lap yet
*  You should spin around your chair the thing about you though is like you are a left-wing guy
*  That's willing to criticize the left and for some people that seems to be a problem
*  Taboo thing like they don't want to talk about the left. Oh, you can't I'm first of all
*  So I found out that people who want to make it in the Democratic Party are not allowed to come to my shows
*  No, so I was doing a show and this woman who I know who was involved in Democratic politics
*  I kind of want to say anything about who they are because they'll get in trouble
*  And so she came to my show and she goes, you know this other person who's
*  Climbing in the Democratic Party was supposed to come with me and at the last minute she didn't and I called her
*  I said why don't you come and she goes, you know if I get seen at a Jimmy Dore show my career in the Democratic
*  Party's over. Oh, it's Kamala Harris. I could tell by your accent. You racist piece of shit
*  I could tell couldn't you tell Jamie I could tell and I'm like that's
*  She has she ever been on your show Kamala Harris. Yes. Oh must be her. Oh, we did some quick easy FBI work
*  So anyway, that made me feel good. That makes me feel that I want to be an outsider
*  I don't want to I want people to be afraid of me. They're afraid you know
*  Well, I don't know if they are but they won't come on my show
*  So that's good. And my show was never about guests. My show was all about my opinion and calling out bullshit
*  Yeah, so it's not nobody doing the right thing. You know, I'm doing the wrong thing cuz they all keep asking to be on my show
*  Okay, I've had requests from all of them really. Oh, yeah Biden
*  Warren, how do you how do you resist shit?
*  Because I'm I have my friends. I talk to my friend. Yeah, I know I would get it like Tulsi and I like I like burning
*  That's it. Oh, yeah, everybody else can eat shit. Look at you fucking progressive. Yeah. Well, I've always been yeah
*  What yeah, everyone says you're right winger. They're out of their fucking mind. I've never voted right wing in my life
*  Really never never I voted Democrat except for
*  Independent I voted for Gary Johnson because he did my podcast
*  People don't realize how parb like I yeah, I'm not I'm not right-wing at all. Okay. No, that's wild. No
*  There's nothing about me. That's right wing. Yeah kill your own food. That's it. Well, that's crazy
*  95 plus percent of the population of the planet eats meat. I just happen to kill my own. Yeah, that's it
*  So it's not like 95% of the population is right wing because they kill their own food
*  I think there's a lot of right-wing like family values and things like that that I admire
*  I think but when you when it gets to homophobia when it gets to women's rights, that's where I break, right?
*  I am a hundred percent in favor of women's rights a hundred percent in favor of gay rights gay marriage
*  I'm a big proponent of
*  There's got to be some new action
*  Taken to clean up a lot of these crime-ridden communities and the idea that we can spend all this money overseas
*  We can't spend money on Flint, Michigan or Detroit or the South Side of Chicago that to me is insane
*  That doesn't make any sense and this idea that we're all on the same starting page is so fucking stupid, too
*  That that is a very non right-wing way of looking at it because everybody's like you got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps
*  There's a lot of people that came out of bad neighborhoods, but they didn't they didn't fucking cry
*  What was me they just went out there and they kicked ass. That's nonsense. You have no idea what it's like to grow up in a crime-ridden
*  poverty infested
*  Drug-addled neighborhood you don't know what that's like and we should make it so that no one knows what that's like if we want America better
*  The best way to start is to clean up all the spots that suck and make people that are coming out of there
*  Have a real chance and making something out of their life
*  Don't don't have it so that they're starting out from the time
*  They're a child with a massive deficit that to me and what you mean by clean cleaning up the play
*  Mean the community programs putting money into these communities jobs jobs that not just jobs
*  But community programs where kids have a safe place to go. That's a big part of it protect them from the gangs
*  Put more cops in those neighborhoods and have them there all the time make them a part of the community
*  they got to do something about the violence and do something about the gangs and this repetitive cycle of
*  People growing up in these neighborhoods and getting trapped in these same
*  Horrible conditions that their parents did or their grandparents did and it's an endless cycle
*  We and we pretend like we don't have the resources to fix these FDR did FDR when gave you want a job
*  I'll give you a job. That means you're gonna go work. It's not I'm not giving you anything
*  You're earning it and guess what?
*  We have the money for it wouldn't that be amazing if they did that it there could be strategies that are implemented
*  They might all not all work, but I don't see like I don't try anything's doing. Yeah, we're gonna have we're gonna have enterprise zones
*  Yeah
*  Obviously at the end and then they want the school to fix all the problems of the community
*  No, what you need is jobs
*  What people need is something to look forward to they need to know that they if they do play by the rules
*  They will get things you can have a job right now those people working if and they don't have any health care
*  Right and they get broken their life goes upside down
*  I mean, you know how I have a job but I got sick my life got turned upside down because of bills and this is
*  Not just black communities either. We're talking about the coal mining communities in West Virginia
*  Horrific man, you don't even like I have a good friend is from there
*  It's like man, you don't know what poverty is like. You don't even know what poverty is like until you see that
*  I don't have nothing
*  I talked to a guy on my show his name is Nick Smith from Virginia and he told me he was a Waffle House cook
*  And he told me and I might even told you this before he said hey
*  We all knew that Donald Trump was a loudmouth Yankee who should have had his ass kicked a long time ago
*  But Hillary Clinton wasn't offering us anything so he would at least offering us something right so they're desperate
*  These people need something
*  She wouldn't even sign on to a $15 minimum wage when she was ready. What is it? What the fuck's wrong with you?
*  Yeah, well, she didn't even believe in gay marriage until 2013. How about that?
*  2013 she this is when she came around with gay marriage get you
*  You're ahead of her on that weren't you Joe?
*  Well, I actually lived in San Francisco around gay people when I was real little really seven to eleven
*  My family lived right off of Lombard Street. We know yeah, we lived in San Francisco in the height of the
*  I mean it was the Vietnam War there's all these hippies my stepdad is a hippie. Oh, no kidding
*  Yeah, so it's like I mean I've been liberal my whole life. I just look like a Republican
*  You know yeah, I think that's it and I'm like beating the shit out of people
*  I like some violent things and I have guns and you know there's a lot of things that you could make an inference like oh
*  That guy seems like he would be but no I my friend my friend Graham Elwood is do you know him sure?
*  He's he was on his live stream the other day and he's very anti-war like me and so these people were fucking with him
*  Be pro-war and he's like, that's right. I'll knock you out. That's right. You ever been knocked out by a vegetarian
*  That's hilarious. Well, that's another group that people like to play identity politics with what you're eating
*  You know how much how much of that is so you with the meat? So my doctor doctor sharp?
*  So no, you know, I have a special bone problem sharp from Pasadena. That's that's that's holy shit
*  Yeah, I should have said that I would've been on it man. So he tells me yes
*  He always does this like this right? He goes Jimmy you're from Chicago you eat meat, right?
*  You eat deep-dish pizza, right?
*  And I go I go yeah, I'm trying not to and he goes why I
*  Go, you know, I think global warming. I saw cows jumping like dogs. I
*  Feel bad
*  Bouncing around. Yeah, I can't eat me. I can't eat pork. Just get it. I just can't eat pork pork
*  Pork is shady. I can't do it. But but wild pigs must be stopped
*  Oh there they can kill you right? No, there's wild boars. They killed a lady in Texas and ate her
*  They found her an elderly lady. They found her in her driveway torn apart by wild pigs
*  Yeah, she was on her way out to the car and she just ran to a pack of them
*  They took her out a pack. Yeah
*  Yeah, I've seen videos those things are but I have to kill them
*  There's so many of them and they breed so quickly they bleed they have four in a litter
*  They'll have four litters in a year. Really? Yeah bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
*  That's why there's millions and millions of wild pigs
*  They started with just a few pigs that were on like the Pinta or the Santa Maria or some shit and they spread across the entire
*  Country, but once you find out that they have emotions. Yes, that's probably that's what I can't hit
*  I can't do that. They have a motion from a distance
*  Joe
*  You don't want to get up close so so your theory is they don't know it's coming
*  No, well that is a good way to do it because they die their mother
*  What if you have a pig and you kill the pigs?
*  Don't do that if you're an ethical hunter you don't shoot a pig that has piglets
*  Yeah, you try to avoid it unless what about a deal the only time they do they don't do that either
*  That's illegal. Oh the only time they do do that though in some places illegal
*  The only time they do do that with pigs is when they're trying to eradicate all of them
*  Like there's some farmlands that experience just
*  Devastating losses because of wild pigs, okay
*  And especially in Texas millions and millions of dollars a year which cripples these companies they go under
*  Because of wild pigs like these some farms can literally go back
*  Oh my god, you have no idea what it's like unless you've been around them, but what about pig pig farming, right?
*  That's a different thing. So most pig farming is disgusting. I can't it's horrible
*  But then there's there's ethical pig farms where they raise these pigs where they get let them roam around
*  Meat looks different because they're eating acorns and natural food. Really? Yeah, there's a guy named Joel Salatin and he runs this
*  farm called poly face farms and
*  He's all about regenerative farming and he discusses like how like the way animals
*  Live best is the way they live naturally. Yeah, and they use to put chickens are supposed to roam free
*  So he has this portable
*  Chicken house and they roll it into a new field and then the chickens go into the chicken house at night
*  And then the morning they come out and then they go roam around and they move it to another spot
*  So they eat all the bugs and all the grass and all the stuff in the area and then they move to a new spot
*  And so they they raise chickens and the eggs are healthier
*  The the pigs the the pork is healthier
*  These these pigs are wandering around in these open areas and then they corral them and then they've been they kill them quickly. I
*  Just once I found out, you know, they have real emotions like dogs
*  I just think about my dog and yeah, I just I just fall apart. I can't I hear you
*  But wild pigs are different. Yeah, that's different because they're an invasive species
*  You know, they actually morph they change shape when they become like a wild pig and a domestic pig is the same animal
*  Like when people talk about our Russian wild boar, this is all nonsense. It's all sous scraffa. It's all one genus
*  It's the same animal really? Yeah, really when a wild when a pig a domestic pig goes wild
*  I mean there's different versions of but they can all breed with each other when a domestic pig goes wild
*  Like say if you had a domestic pig and you said go ahead porky be free and you open up your gate within weeks
*  Within weeks they start to physically change their snout starts to lengthen their hair gets thicker and bushier and their tusks grow
*  No kidding. Yes, they literally become what you think of when you think of wild boars. It just takes a while
*  But they fit they're one of the weirder animals
*  They're almost like gremlins when you feed them after midnight when you let them go they start changing they morph. So I I
*  So dr. Sharp says to me from Pasadena
*  he says
*  He said well, you should eat meat and I'm like because of my condition, right?
*  And he tells this long story about how we evolved he sits down and starts telling me and
*  About how we were cavemen and inside the glaciers and the thing and he's like so you should eat meat
*  Especially you because of your condition and I go. Okay. Well how often and he goes every day?
*  I was like Jesus I can't do that, you know
*  And so but this is medical advice from a guy who saved my life, right?
*  So it's like I eat meat a couple times a week. Do you feel better or worse when you eat it?
*  I do have more energy. Yeah. Well, that's probably good, right? Yeah
*  Well, I know it meet more often I have just because if you don't have to eat
*  Pork, I know if you eat
*  Humanely raised meat so there's great. Yeah grass
*  Yeah, you can buy grass fed grass finished meat from farmers that have a commitment to humanely raised and humanely
*  Euthanized animals. I want to use nice killed killed animals and they when the way they kill them when they harvest them
*  They just lead them into a pen
*  They have no idea what's coming and they put a bolt to their head and bang they take them out
*  Yeah, it can it can be done in a way where the animal has no idea what happens until it until it's over
*  Mm-hmm, and it's not like they're gonna live forever
*  I mean obviously this is a slippery argument because you said about people to write this guy's an asshole. Let's just kill him
*  It's not he's gonna live forever
*  you don't want to say that but the the the quality of
*  The meat is far better if the animal is living a natural life, right? You're talking about organic
*  No hormones hormones. No
*  Yeah, no, no corn man. That's just terrible for cows. They're not supposed to eat that
*  They're they the ruminants they they fucking grass
*  That's what they do when they're at their best and healthiest and healthiest for you. There's better fatty acids in it
*  It's just healthier for you. And so and so you think if you went vegetarian, it would be bad for your health. I don't know
*  I don't
*  Think it I think it's definitely doable
*  I definitely think you can go vegetarian and and be healthy
*  But you have to be really careful about a lot of your nutrient levels
*  Yeah, to really make sure you get enough vitamin D a lot of b12
*  You got to check your essential fatty acid levels
*  There's a lot of stuff that like it looks real good on paper, but then you find out it's not bioavailable
*  I tried to go vegan for a while and I got I got fat
*  What's a lot of cars? Yeah, I was you know, I didn't know what I know what I was doing
*  I wasn't doing it right. Whatever. Yeah, I'm not a bad like soy
*  Why don't you like so like tofu?
*  Yeah, just something about it
*  Did you fuck with any of that vegan chicken stuff or any of those weird ones that are they make them look like real food?
*  There's a name for that. Oh, no, no, but that fake meat they have now is fantastic really bad for you, though
*  Do you know that actually causes liver problems and rats?
*  What yeah pull up the fake meat liver problems rats? No. Yeah, look, it's all oils
*  That stuff is all processed food oils. It's processed vegetable oils
*  And that's bad. Yeah, just eat fucking vegetables man
*  If you want to be a vegetarian eat vegetables
*  Look most boys a lot of people would say a regular burger is not good for you either
*  But of course a regular burger is just meat with bread and all the bullshit the bread and all the bullshit is what's bad for you
*  It's not the burger itself as long as it's an actual meat burger, particularly if it's a grass-fed burger
*  Yeah, so what is he pulling up? He's pulling up this study about
*  One meat the one of them impossible burger beyond meat one of them, but they were talking about how
*  There's studies that are showing that this this is not but then again, they're not marketing it as a healthy alternative
*  No, they're marketing as a meat free burger burger is kind of like a fun food anyway
*  Here it is rat feeding study suggests the impossible burger may not be safe to eat L. Oh fucking
*  But if you go to the ingredients man, I've had scientists relay the ingredients to me
*  I thought it was just coconut oil
*  Oh, it's a bunch of fat up stuff because they got to make it seem like it's a real burger
*  Someone heme is that thing they that makes it taste like it's called heme heme iron some like that
*  That's what gives it that flavor that people are looking for getting that I don't know where they get that from
*  Soylent green it's not good. It's a people Joe
*  That sucks
*  Yes sucks well, it's so you'll never stop eating meat you think you'll always you'll you're like animals are here for us to eat
*  And that's that I don't think that I think we definitely evolved the human animal evolved from eating meat
*  And that's not that's not under debate
*  I mean we evolved from eating meat and weirdo vegans to try to say crazy shit like oh, why don't we have canines?
*  How come we can't eat meat raw well because asshole we figured out fire a long fucking time ago
*  And our bodies adapted because of that our teeth adapted because we figured out how to cut things with utensils
*  And we figured out how to cook things so they're more tender
*  It's it's not as simple as like why do we have an appendix? Why is that?
*  I'll tell you why because we used to eat differently and we still have a leftover organ some weird fucking organ from breaking down
*  Bark and shit you know we don't need that anymore. We don't need bark anymore. Is that what it's like roots and stuff like oh really?
*  Yeah, I think that's what the appendix is for I think it was initially for
*  Breaking down like very hard to digest
*  Fibrous things so I have my gallbladder out whoa we do with it
*  Gonna put it back in yeah, I'm thinking about it. I have it in my glove box, but what happened no
*  I just had I was having gallbladder attacks. I thought it was a heart attack. Whoa. Where's the girl?
*  I don't even know it is it was like right here
*  Oh, jeez and I always heard like your heart attack feels like it's in the center, and this was this was a little lower
*  I'm like this is a heart attack. I'm dying. This is no doubt. I'm dying
*  I thought for sure I was dying so I'm on the couch and I remember I'm just like this is my wife calls the
*  Fireman, and I'm just like this is it. This is how it's gonna happen I
*  Was kind of okay with it right, but I wasn't because I was in a lot of pain
*  I wanted it to end I was like okay if I die I die
*  But then they came and they shot me and I was like oh, I feel fantastic again, so that way it wasn't it was just my
*  Gobbler they took it out, and what does it do the gallbladder secretes bile?
*  Into your stomach to help digest things right so gallbladder is would be like the for bile when your liver makes bile it like
*  Your reservoir
*  So now I don't have a reservoir anymore, so now it just is always kind of dripping
*  Is it fuck with you anymore? You know it's fucked with a lot in lots of different ways. Yeah, my my appetite is
*  It's weird when you get nervous it doesn't come
*  It doesn't come on slowly
*  That's why you had to eat when you're on stage so that happened
*  Oh that makes so that and then and often often
*  After I eat I have to go right after the bathroom right away right away. Yeah, I don't know ever since I had my gallbladder
*  I don't know if other people have that I haven't googled it now was there any alternative to getting it removed did they say hey
*  Maybe you could change your diet. I was not given a alternative there was so there's you have like calcium and
*  Deposits in your thing and they block the duct
*  And then you know that's what causes all the pain and so eventually it'll dislodge itself and the pain will go away
*  But it could kill you if it stays and doesn't go away and so they have to take it out Jesus Christ
*  Yeah, I guess so here's a great story about our medical system right so I have Blue Cross insurance
*  I had the best that you could buy or what have you and so I had my second gallbladder attack
*  And I was like I got to get this goddamn thing out because I can't have this happen again. It hurts too much, right?
*  So I called the doctor and they're like I can't even get a consultation for three weeks in network
*  Through three to get it so I have to get a consultation then I have to wait wait another three or four weeks to get
*  The operation so this could maybe be two months before I get the operation of these
*  And I'm gonna have another goddamn attack
*  So I went out of network and I got another doctor to come take care of me faster
*  So I couldn't have to worry about you had to pay out of pocket
*  Yes, so this whole thing you're gonna have to wait you have to fucking wait right now
*  Yeah, it's ridiculous. Why you like no it's true. It is true. It is true. I have friends in Canada
*  It's way worse up there though about waiting
*  Yeah, if you like I had a friend she needed a knee operation they waited a fucking year
*  So for a whole year, she's walking around with a torn ACL really fucked up knee
*  Yeah, whole year a year 12 months 365 days
*  I don't know hobbling around do you know anybody in Canada with that would trade their health care plan for a United States?
*  They don't want to pay for it. Once you don't have to pay for it. You don't want to pay for it
*  You know, you know, there's a great video where this guy interviews people in England and he asked them
*  How much you think I saw us to be married or how much have a baby have a baby and they're like a hundred dollars
*  Try ten grand. He's like what what yeah, I saw that. Yeah, everybody freaks out. Everybody freaks out
*  Yeah, well once you're used to things being free, you don't want to pay for them
*  I don't look I think health care should be free. I really do. I think education should be free
*  I think if we're gonna spend money as a community if we have a gigantic community of people and that's what a country really is
*  That's it. It's a community. What is the most important thing to take care of? Well, we got to take care of old people sick people
*  We got to take care of poor people. We got to take like this is this the idea that somehow or another
*  That this is a this is a foolish notion that you have to take care of people that education
*  It wouldn't be better if more people are educated. Yeah, so why shouldn't that be free? Well, we don't have the money
*  But we have how much money how much 131 extra billion they gave Trump that'd be a lot of education
*  Yeah, a lot of people learn shit that way. Yeah, that's almost that's double the money
*  It would take to send everybody to college for free. That's a layer 65 billion dollars a year said everybody to college
*  They just spent 131 billion to give gift to him. That's double right? I'm not a math surgeon, but I'm pretty sure that's double
*  I think if we figure it out a way to you know, you know, Ari Schaffer says the same stuff
*  Yeah, and I was just on his show and he was saying we got to take care of homeless people
*  I'm like, I thought you were a right winger. Oh, he's not right. We at all. I guess not
*  Oh, he's very left-wing. Why do you think everybody was right-wing? Cuz we talk shit. I don't know
*  I just hear it shit, you know on social media
*  Those idiots they just think because I've talked to Alex Jones or because I've had you know, right-wing people on that, you know
*  Oh, you're platforming people Joe. Yeah, I've been friends with Alex Jones since the 90s
*  I've known that guy forever Joe when I went in that never tell you the story when you spin his face
*  So when so when the ice tees accidentally I got
*  so
*  So whatever first I didn't think that would be that big of a deal Wow that turned out to be a big deal, right?
*  Right. So then whatever so then the next day I talked to some people from his show and we were all friends, right?
*  But not him and so I went down like a couple months later to do
*  Austin
*  So I go to this does the steakhouse right there forgets the name. It's the big place, right?
*  Across from the West End and so I'm there my brother came down for the weekend my brother and his wife and we're all sitting
*  There were eating and all of a sudden really goes Alex Jones just walked in he said he right behind you. I go get the fuck out
*  He's gonna come beat me
*  But my brother's big guy right so all my brothers are bigger than me and
*  and tough too, right and
*  So I was like, all right. Well if you see him coming this way you know
*  So he's back and he goes he just sat down he shook hands with this guy three times I go
*  Sounds like they're up
*  I go and we were luckily we were finishing and I was like, okay, I'm not gonna I'm gonna finish it
*  I'm gonna walk the fuck out here. That's hilarious. Just get out here slick
*  He could crush me he probably wouldn't
*  You would be able to talk to him
*  He's a lot more reasonable than people think he is and especially now now he's not drinking anymore. Oh really?
*  He's been off booze for um shit. I want to say many many months now
*  Yeah, it's been quite a while. He has no drink and he's changed to his he's realized
*  He was losing his fucking mind was getting deep platform
*  He was drinking a like a bottle bottle and half a vodka every night. Yeah, he was going hard times
*  I can understand why people do shit like that when you and when you do drink that much you do get
*  Psychotic like you start you said I love drinking and I can't I don't drink like I used to anymore because older too
*  You body can't process it right anymore. I wake up the next day. I'm depressed. Yeah
*  Yep, I love drinking martinis during a live show. I fucking
*  Say like oh everything's wrong. Everything's bad. I'm this but you know what a lot of that is
*  A lot of it is not just the alcohol. It's also the dehydration
*  Oh, yeah, if you if you just hydrate and take a lot of electrolytes you think yeah
*  Yeah, you can mitigate a lot of that stuff also glutathione glutathione can help your body process alcohol quicker
*  Glutathione glutathione. Yeah, it's an antioxidant super potent antioxidant. Yeah, it actually your body produces it aids in the process of
*  Processing alcohol. I didn't know that yeah, I can help you a little bit. Give me a little boost
*  I did drink in Hawaii. They have
*  Couldn't stop drinking them they taste like yeah, that's a problem when things are delicious, but yet also get you fucked up all yeah
*  But I didn't wasn't driving anywhere. I didn't have to do anything. So it was all right. It was just to be a place in
*  West Palm Beach improv and downstairs they had one of those alcoholic
*  Slurpee places. Oh, no, those things. Yeah, they taste fucking
*  Now one of them called call a cab
*  And you would drink it it was like I drank one on stage once and by the end of the show I was like
*  Thank God the show ended the way I did cuz I forgot how to talk really. Oh my god
*  I was so sloshed by the time the show was over. I was one glass
*  I mean one like it was like a big gulp sized call a cab
*  I don't know how many drinks are there like seven shots load, but it's like a giant mix, right?
*  It's just like 7-eleven Slurpees
*  But it tastes good it tastes good and you get fucked up
*  Yeah, I've never been that fucked up on stage. There was a time when I was I was going through a phase where I dropped
*  My pants on stage. Oh, you stopped doing that. I did yeah people start to complain. Why I don't know
*  I'm like, this is the oldest comic gig in the fucking gig in the thing. This is the gag you drop your pay
*  Jerry Lewis is funny. Did you have underwear on? Yeah
*  Yeah, Ari Ari's pulls his hog out not anymore. I really scared now
*  Can you do that isn't that you can still kill you pull your hog out?
*  He pulled his hog out at a skank fest in New York. They had a you know, skank fest
*  I'm again not familiar get in the loop. I know I'm out of it. Did a few weeks ago. I killed Tony
*  Yeah, there's hog out again. Yeah right before he was here right before maybe Tony was here one of the times. Where was it?
*  Well probably shouldn't say that that could probably be a problem was
*  Legal well, I used to do it Joe fake rubber dick. Don't worry about it folks. I used to do it
*  You just pull your dick and yeah, and then nobody noticed that I was embarrassing
*  Yeah, Joe just sometimes I do jokes, right I
*  You know, okay. What am I here at my father? No, it's okay. It's all fine. It's all fine. Ari
*  Has always done ridiculous shit. He used to go on stage with his balls out of his pants
*  I'm not address it so he go on stage and do his act
*  He would just unzip his pants pull a sack out and then just have it only a sack hanging out while he's on stage
*  Did it at the store where there's like someone on stage Joe the bombing and he has joy behind there was a woman on stage
*  she was terrible like one of the worst comics has ever done comedy and
*  This one night she was killing
*  I mean fucking killing and this is why when she would hit a punchline
*  Joey was hiding behind the stage and he was naked and he go
*  And then he would close the curtains and so she would get this giant fucking laugh and she was like wow
*  Feeling erotes and then she's like and then I told him fuck you
*  No
*  Yes
*  Balls ass naked and what that seems like you can be in jail
*  That seems criminal with Joey's balls look like grapefruit and old lady's pantyhose and he's got a giant dick
*  So Joey would you know is he got this huge belly so he opens up the curtains
*  His pants are down by his ankles his balls and dick are hanging out. He's got this huge belly
*  Yeah, she never did comedy again
*  Really? No, okay. She should have Larry is that's in Austin actually that was where we were at the hotel
*  Hanging out in the there's are in the background. Yeah hanging out at the jacuzzi get ready for the show
*  Wow, yeah, I think the day that I mean like comedies it's already dangerous enough. Yeah, I don't need to add nudity
*  Well, you get in trouble now. Yes like that like people can get really angry at you for showing your dick
*  Well that could it's not not like the olden days
*  It was a subtle gag. It's a good we could see it. Yeah, nobody cared. Yeah
*  Joe used to do it all the time
*  Yeah, I don't there was I remember when I was a kid I had older sisters and they there was a flasher in our neighborhood
*  They were going like oh the guy flat. I'm like, I don't understand this whole thing. I don't understand why he's doing that
*  I don't understand why it freaks you out so much. It's like I don't the whole thing but I do
*  I know I understand why it freaks them. I get the freaking out
*  I still don't get why they do it
*  But I think it has something to do with someone traumatizing you when you're young. It's cut
*  Yeah, it's gotta be humiliation something you're addicted to that kind of you. There's lots of people like that
*  Yeah, well, how about guys who are addicted to they hire women to gag them and shit on them and kick them in the balls
*  And yeah, sometimes like really powerful men and hurt them
*  Yeah, yeah hurt them stop their nuts like stop on their nuts with a stiletto. Yeah, it starts bleeding
*  How is that what is that I don't know that is such a people that is broke so so down a
*  rabbit hole of
*  Humiliate. I'm you know
*  I mean I was hit a lot as I went to Catholic I got all the guilt and hitting and but and
*  Somehow I managed to avoid that kind of that kind of shit
*  I think that I don't have weird shit
*  But that's a mommy shit and like the whole pantyhose and beating you and kicking in the balls
*  It's like there's obviously it's gotta be your mom of pathologies that people can develop in their life
*  And there's probably a lot of mental illness involved in there and violence and abuse
*  But apparently there's a woman that I talked to who's a dominatrix and she was telling me and Jim Norton, you know
*  Jim yeah, I know Jim in a dominant
*  He loves dominatrix and she was saying most of her clients are like these like wealthy
*  CEOs and they run these companies and they're the fucking man and when they walk in Oh, mr. Wilson's here. Hello, mr
*  Wilson, can I get you a cup of coffee and everyone's kissing their ass and they want someone to shit on them like literally shit on
*  Them they want someone to tie them up and she yeah, she would say that those are the guys
*  Why is that though I guess it's just so every powerful guy wants to like feel a release of their power
*  Well, that's why when the John Wayne steel shit on I don't get it
*  Maybe the steel dossier right when they were talking about. Yeah, I'm getting peeing on all that stuff or peeing on them
*  That's why it made sense. It's like well, of course, of course
*  What not that it's real not that it made sense what it's real
*  But that would be a story because you would kind of expect from a super powerful guy who had a weird kink
*  Super powerful guys with weird kinks. They usually want to get pegged right they want to get pissed on
*  Pegged is the best. That's one of the that's one of the best things like cuz you can say pegged on national TV right now
*  Yes, still you can still say it pegged. No one can stop you
*  Right pegged is not like it's not in the dictionary
*  I don't think right if you say butt fucked with a dildo people go hey
*  But you shouldn't even say that because it's too wordy economy of words pegged fits better and it's it's it's got a P and a G
*  Pegged how do you just not start laughing when when she starts pegging you? I don't know
*  How do you just not start laughing might be really into it?
*  And then you got oh, yes, I'm a bad boy
*  What are the women get out of it they get to dominate you and humiliate you yeah
*  I knew a guy and this girl said that she would fuck him if if she if he let her peg him
*  And he wouldn't do it. Oh really we're calling. She wanted to do it. Yeah, well she said she was all you fuck you
*  She was all you fuck me, but I want to fuck you in the ass. How pretty was she she's pretty hot and
*  All my friends called him gay well bro. You're gay. Hey, you should have just fucked her and let her
*  Fuck you in the ass. You're gay and we my friend. It was funny. He was like it's not even a real dick, bro
*  I
*  There's no win there
*  She probably doesn't want to fuck you, but she's willing to do it if you're willing to do something for her
*  She probably always wanted a peggie guy
*  You got to make some sacrifices. Yeah, it's like your joke about
*  the the female version of
*  Who wants to give you a job in Hollywood movie? Oh Harvey and a Weinstein? Yeah
*  Harvey and a Weinstein came to my son with a solid contract. I'd be like dude. You're gonna be Batman
*  That's true. We're talking about that last night with R. Kelly like the R. Kelly story is horrific right he's having sexual 15 16 year old girls
*  But imagine if JLo had a bunch of 15 and 16 year old boys locked up in a house somewhere in Miami
*  She's making them all eat her ass and videotaping them. We would be laughing. We'd be it's so funny. It's so different
*  It is a different thing men and women are different. Yeah, they're a different thing and this idea that we're not different
*  It's so stupid. We're not math
*  We're very different
*  Yeah
*  but we're in denial of that because we work in these environments where men and women are side by side 40 hours a week and
*  Everybody's under a human resources fucking tight grip of behavior
*  And so everybody does act weird and then men don't want the women mad at them
*  So they have to pretend yeah, these guys are assholes. This guy's a total pig
*  Yeah, as a male feminist, I find that atrocious, you know, who's not a male feminist, you know, you never find that's a male feminist
*  gay guys
*  Cuz they're not trying to fuck you. Okay, so you don't have to play some stupid game
*  They care about women more than they care about anything and women's equality is the most important thing
*  No, they're trying to suck dick and butt fuck dudes. They're having a good time
*  That's what they do
*  They're not they're having a fun time with other gay guys
*  They don't give a fuck they don't want you to be victimized
*  But they're not gonna go out of their way as a male ally. That's all guys trying to fuck you a hundred percent
*  It is 100%
*  Sneaky guys who can't figure out any other way to fuck that they that they pretend to be female allies or no feminists
*  Male fit you can just be a nice person who's got like good values and ethics and you want things you want equality for all
*  But the idea that you're a male feminist you come out
*  I'm a male feminist like just saying those words out of your fucking mouth. You're a sneaky fuck
*  I know what you're doing. You're sneaky. So you're a gender trader. So you're telling me
*  That guys who say I always thought feminism was just about treating women equally that's because you talking to too many liberals
*  What is it about? Well, it is about treating people equally
*  If you feel that it's about treating people equally, but when you hear a man say that he's a male feminist
*  You're going so out on a limb. You're not just saying you're you I'm all about treating people you're labeling yourself
*  And you're labeling yourself in this sort of submissive
*  Sort of you're giving in to this cultural wave. So let me just can you what is the definition of feminism?
*  Is that okay if I can ask fuck knows right? I mean he's gonna look it up, right? I can ask suri
*  I bet you she yeah, I asked Siri. Okay ready. We got to end this soon. I know hey suri
*  What's the definition of feminism?
*  Advocacy of women's rights on the basis of equality of the sexes boy. That's an open-ended statement right there
*  equality the sex is how weightlifting
*  Making babies. There's no advocacy of women's rights based on the equality of sexes that is of the sexes
*  I think you're equal, but you can be equal but different well. We're not math right certainly should have equal rights
*  We certainly should have
*  just
*  equal
*  the way people treat each other just
*  equal morals and ethics
*  Another definition of the theory of political economics social equality of the sexes
*  Organize activity on behalf of women's rights and interests. I mean that sounds like shit that you would agree with Joe well
*  Organize activity on behalf this is we're gonna this is gonna take too long okay, unfortunately because it's three o'clock, okay?
*  But yeah, I agree with most those things what I don't agree with is someone labeling themselves that way
*  That's a man because every one that I've ever met is a little weasel
*  Well, I'm sure you know I always say show me a male feminist that can pick up heavy things and run fast
*  They don't exist
*  They don't exist you would think George Clooney calls himself a feminist does he I don't have to probably has to I think he gets pegged
*  Yes
