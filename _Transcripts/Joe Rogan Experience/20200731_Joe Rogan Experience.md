# Joe Rogan Experience #1518 - David Choe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 31, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7T6__UbhBI)
*  Hello David. What's up buddy? If I leave right now this will be the shortest one you've ever
*  done? Yeah, ever now. You don't have to do this. I know you were, you're going to say
*  some crazy shit and you're going to torpedo your life. Now that you're a cult guru with
*  strawberry blonde hair. It's more... Strawberry blonde. Well it's a home job. It's a do it
*  yourself. So it's more... My therapist would always say lean into discomfort, which you
*  don't like and I hate gingers. So I said, why don't I just become one? Your therapist
*  says lean into discomfort? Yeah, if there's something that... Like I'm in a men's group
*  also and they said, and I told them, I said I'm going to go back on the Joe Rogan experience
*  after four, five, six years. I don't know when the last time I was here. Probably five,
*  I don't know. It's been a while. And so they go lean into the discomfort. Start with what
*  you least want to share. And I go, this is me trying to... They don't know you that well.
*  That's fucking terrible advice for you. So I sit there, I'm driving over here and I go,
*  okay, start with what I least want to share. I pulled over on Van Nuys Boulevard and I
*  puked. Really? Yeah, I puked. Wow. I don't get nervous. I used to have my own podcast.
*  I've talked to you a million times. I just had a visceral response and I was like...
*  And I just pulled over on Van Nuys. And I think someone took a picture of me. So if you're
*  out there... And I don't get nervous. These things... I'm able to just almost disassociate.
*  Whatever. Just go into any situation. And I just felt... And I was like, maybe it was
*  the breakfast I had. I had a hard boiled egg and chia pudding. That's what I had for breakfast.
*  That's it? That's it. And I pull over and I was like, oh my God, I'm fucking nervous.
*  I'm just going to puke. I look across the street, there's a guy like... And then I get
*  in the car and I'm like... Do I really want to share with Joe that I tried on four different
*  outfits last night? Do I want to share with him that I got caught yesterday at... I was
*  eating at... There's a place called Johnny Pistorami's in West Adams that just opened.
*  It's an old restaurant that just reopened. And I know the guy that runs it, Danny, and
*  he said, there's an outdoor... I only eat in outdoor spots right now. And I'm like, what
*  is this? I'm so scared I'm going to be canceled if I talk to Joe. You're going to be fine.
*  We're going to maneuver our way through this. But then I go, I've been canceled so many
*  times. I kind of like it. It feels good. You haven't been canceled since the age of real
*  canceling though. The age of real canceling has been since you were on the podcast last.
*  That's when canceling has kicked up to new level because now the pylons happen. Right.
*  Before there was just canceling, you would get in trouble for things. Someone would write
*  an article. Oh my God, what did David do? He's crazy. But now the pylon, the social
*  media and the effectiveness of the pylon has been established. So now whenever anything
*  happens to someone, all the pylon people... But I like getting canceled. Do you enjoy
*  it? Do you see the Michael Jordan documentary? I still haven't seen it. All right. I'm not
*  going to ruin it for you, but it's... I heard it's awesome. The actual filmmaking is kind
*  of amateurish, but the subject matter is so dynamic that you're in it. The guy's a full-on
*  gambling addict. It's 12 episodes. It could have probably been four. The story is the
*  same. It's just this guy didn't give me the best seat on the airplane. This guy overlooked
*  me in high school. It's all these slights and he takes it and he uses it as fuel. So
*  I sit here and I go, I'm driving to Joe Rogan's right now. I'm scared to be canceled. I sit
*  here and I go, every fucking horrible thing that's happened in my life, physical abuse,
*  sexual abuse, verbal abuse, spiritual abuse, prison, getting my career taken away or this
*  or anything has always led to bigger and better. So I'm like, kind of like it. Yeah, but that's
*  just because you're a real person. You're not full of shit in any way, shape or form.
*  You might be crazy, but you're a lovable crazy. When people know who you actually are, it's
*  like you have these moments where things are uncomfortable and you're confronted with a
*  bad scene, but then you rise above.
*  Thank you. I appreciate that. What is your threshold with receiving compliments?
*  My threshold?
*  Yeah, what's your comfort level? I haven't seen you in a long time.
*  It's been a while.
*  Can I give you five?
*  Sure.
*  Okay. You only look better as you get older. You have a beautifully shaped skull. As an
*  artist, as a sculptor, I painted you. I don't like the painting anymore. I think I can do
*  a better one now.
*  It's awesome. It's an awesome painting.
*  I'm like, this guy, like all artists and sculptors out there listening, paint this guy's skull.
*  Cool. You're unbelievably curious, inspirational. You give me hope. You're funny. You're entertaining.
*  And you're a leader. Just talk to all your guys right now. You're leading this charge
*  to Texas right now. You're a perfectly imperfect, unrepeatable miracle of the universe.
*  Wow. That's heavy.
*  You're great, man.
*  Well, that's very sweet of you. I appreciate you. Thank you very much, man. That's very
*  nice of you.
*  Yeah. I love, you know, I haven't talked to you in a long time, but I told you, I just,
*  I'm sure a lot of people feel this way. You're just on all the time. You're on YouTube or
*  on a podcast or on someone else's podcast. So I still, I'm like, fuck, I think about
*  you. You're in my head. Can I give you an on air gift?
*  Sure.
*  I was, while I was trying on all my outfits last night, I was like, I want to see who
*  Joe's talking to. So, this mic smells like Post Malone. So I was painting last night
*  and I made you a shirt.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Because you guys got on a little thing. I didn't listen to the whole episode yet because
*  it's four hours, but you were talking about ghosts at the beach, ghosts on the beach.
*  So there's ghosts on the beach right there.
*  You made this?
*  Well, I didn't make the, it's, you see the ghosts on the beach.
*  You see the ghosts on the front?
*  Yes! It's fucking awesome!
*  You could wear it, you could give it away.
*  Dude, I'm going to wear the shit out of this. Thank you very much, man.
*  That's so cool.
*  You're welcome.
*  That's awesome, man. Ghosts on the beach.
*  Yeah, you never see ghosts on the beach. All the ghost stories are always at night.
*  It's true, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That was a good point. I felt like I made a good point.
*  That was a great point.
*  Because like, I mean, if ghosts were real, like if they were really scary, you'd see
*  them in cool times, like at the pool.
*  Going backwards.
*  You know? In Vegas, drinking, everybody's having fun, fucking ghost shows up, freaks
*  everybody out. Never.
*  So I got all the embarrassing stuff out of the way, I think. Oh no, so I was at this
*  outdoor restaurant eating at the corner and not having a full on panic attack, but I have
*  a nice, beautiful, wonderful, quiet life now. I'm not on the air. I don't do podcasts. I
*  don't do interviews. I'm not, I'm not like, my life is amazing. Like I completely changed
*  my life since the last time I saw you. And I go, I do want to talk to Joe, but maybe,
*  you know, maybe I'll just talk to you on the phone or go visit you in Texas. Like, do I
*  need to go on the air?
*  Well, I gave you that option. I was like, you don't have to do this.
*  But right, but I'm a sick person.
*  But you're a fun guy. You're fun. People enjoy listening to you.
*  So I had this sculpture that I made and it was in my car and I just brought it out and
*  I sat next to it and I said, I'm just going to prepare a little bit. So I started preparing
*  for the Joe Rogan experience and I started talking to this sculpture and I'm like looking,
*  I'm like, you know, it was three o'clock, there was no one eating there and I got caught.
*  I got caught.
*  Caught talking to a sculpture?
*  I got caught talking to sculpture. I was talking to this thing I made and it wasn't a friend,
*  it was a guy I knew and he's like, Dave?
*  And he comes over and I'm like, oh, fuck, dude. And he's like, shame, red face. I'm like,
*  oh, hey. And he's like, are you talking to a thing right now? And I was like, oh yeah,
*  I'm going on this thing tomorrow. I just wanted to prepare a little bit. I'm a little bit
*  nervous. I got my nerves.
*  Because I talked to you, what, Thursday? No, I talked to you a few days ago and we talked
*  for a while and I'm like, this guy is a professional talker. He's a commentator. He's a standup.
*  He has this podcast that goes on for hours and hours, thousands of hours. It's an art.
*  You're a painter. You're an MMA artist. In my world, I'm also an MMA artist, mixed media
*  artist, right? That's the bisexual of painting. It's like you use everything, anything goes.
*  So I go, this guy is so fucking good at it. Because I got off the phone with you and I'm
*  like, he's so good at talking. He's so good at talking. It's like when you practice
*  something so much that you don't even know how good you are at it. And even your podcasts,
*  they go on for a few hours, which is against everything. Everyone's like, oh kids, they
*  have no attention span these days. It's like 10 seconds, 15 seconds. It's fucking TikToks
*  or Instagram. And here's this guy. He's talking to Post Malone for four hours and making it
*  seem just seamless and effortless. And that's because you're a master at it. And I go, I'm
*  my confidence level as far as this art form is low. I don't talk to people anymore. I
*  mean, I talk to my friends, but I don't talk as storytelling or entertainment. My memories
*  shot to shit. I can't. I watched three seasons of Ozark and I can't even tell you anyone's
*  name. I go, there's Jason Bateman and there's the kid and the kid with the drone. And I
*  don't know the wife. I don't know anyone's names. I can't recall anything. And you have
*  all these scientists that are brilliant. You have comedians and everyone's like quick witted
*  and they're fast and they're and I go, I'm dim witted. I'm like a human soft serve. I'm
*  like, I can't compare yourself to the other people. I gotta let that go right now. Well,
*  you are who you are. People can't do what you do. That's true. Yeah. Your abstract
*  way of thinking, like the way you are as a person, you're so freely yourself. That's
*  what allows you to create such amazing art. Like you just, you're free. Some people can't
*  be themselves and not good at it. You're really good at being David Cho. Thank you. I'm horrible
*  at taking compliments by the way. So thank you. It's uncomfortable for everybody. I think
*  unless you're a real creative, you did a great right now. Just fucking awesome. That was
*  good. Could I have done more? Could I have given you like, we're good. You want to hear
*  something funny? Okay. So the reason why I kind of did that was I wake up every morning
*  racked with anxiety and nerves and it starts immediately. You're a piece of shit. You're
*  no good. People don't like you, this and that. And then like, what did I say when you showed
*  me my painting from 2018? I immediately have to self-deprecate. That's not that good. I
*  could do a better one. So I talked to my therapist about it. I say, I don't have a high self-opinion
*  of myself. And they go, well, an average human living in society today from morning till
*  night will say thousands of horrible things about themselves. Like thousands. Like I'm
*  not good enough. I'm fat. I'm ugly. This and that. And for you to say just a few nice things.
*  I'm like, one of those is some fucking Stuart Smalley shit. And I'm good enough. And they
*  go, see, you did it again. You just went right into it. Why can't you say you're a good painter?
*  You know you're a good painter. Why can't you say you're... And so they go, give me
*  five right now. Five what? Say five fucking things about yourself that... And I couldn't
*  give them one. I couldn't give them one. And they're like, don't you think that's...
*  Has that always been the case? I think so. I think it's... To go into that kind of self-hatred
*  is... I could sit here and say it's a Korean thing. K-Rage. But it's... K-Rage. They said,
*  take a stick of deodorant, go home tonight, and write, I am enough on your mirror so you
*  see it every morning. And I go, I'm not doing that. That's so stupid. That's fucking retarded.
*  I'm gonna do that. The ways to deodorate. Yeah. They go, you're paying us. You're here.
*  Just do it. All right, fine. I'll do it. I go and I write, I am... I misspell it. E-N-U-F-F.
*  I am enough. And then I go next week and they go, so how's it going? You know, brushing
*  your teeth, you look at, I'm enough. I can't see it. They're like, what kind of deodorant
*  did you use? You know, the clear invisible one. No, get the thick white chunky whatever...
*  Yeah, Old Spice and like, you're a fucking graffiti artist, right? So, okay. And I said,
*  I can do it, but I don't believe it. Because I can sit here and tell you
*  the amount of times in my life that I wasn't enough. Like, I can sit here and go through
*  many, many stories of women dumping me for richer, better looking, more famous,
*  better this, better that. I can tell you of jobs I didn't get. So, I'm not enough and I'm not,
*  you know, so... And it's this struggle. It's this burning fucking, like the Michael Jordan shit.
*  Like, I got a fucking... I'm not at war. I'm not... You can't fucking cancel me. I've already canceled
*  myself. How are you gonna cancel someone who's already canceled? There's nothing you're gonna
*  say. There's nothing you're gonna fucking do that's gonna outweigh anything I've already said to
*  myself. You, ah, that guy sucks. He's ugly. He's fat. He's full of shit. I've already said that,
*  you know? So... Do you think that fuels your art? Do you think there's a benefit to that sort of...
*  Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. But, you know, there's been that debate forever.
*  I remember... How do you create great art? I'm not talking about good art, but like the transcendent
*  art. The art that, like, is... You remember it. It'll live on for generations. And it's like, oh,
*  it's like the Picasso and Van Gogh and all the comedians that fucking hate their... It's...
*  It wasn't a debate for me. When I look at the art that I enjoy, the comedy that I like, the music
*  that I like, you must fucking suffer. You must suffer. You have to suffer. Comfort is the killer
*  of creativity. That's what I used to say. And, you know, I'm saying it now, but I'd be in a room
*  ranting this. Comfort is the killer of creativity. You gotta fucking... It's the killer of everything,
*  man. But I'm rich as fuck. Yeah. I'm very comfortable. But you're comfortable financially,
*  but that's how you keep sharp. You keep sharp by not being comfortable in other ways.
*  So I sit there and I'm going off on this rant. I'm like in a fucking echo chamber. They're like,
*  how long you been telling the story for? My whole life. I've believed... It's not a debate for me.
*  Right. Do you know great artists that are comfortable and they're happy and they're like...
*  They have loving families and they're... There's always something. There's always something.
*  I think you can have a balance, but you have to have this thing. Whatever that thing is,
*  there's gotta be some sort of a struggle. And that was never a debate for me. I go,
*  there has to be that struggle. And they go, but what if you take it away? Like,
*  what if you chose happiness over great art? What if you chose... And they go, Dave,
*  for someone who's rebelled and like made your own rules and done everything your own way,
*  it's so weird that you just kind of accept this. They go, can... Like what you just said,
*  can great transcendent next level art be created without that thing? Without that edge? Without...
*  With you pursuing joy and peace and love in your life? And I go, you know what? Never tried it.
*  I never tried it. Why haven't you tried it? What'd you just say? I don't know. F-E-P-S-H.
*  Fear, ego, pride, shame, humiliation. That's why you never tried it.
*  All right. F-U-K. And I go, you know what? I'll try it. And today I'm the happiest I've ever been.
*  I think I might be a little bit sick because I'm sitting here because I'm like,
*  why would I risk how awesome my life is right now?
*  Why do you keep saying that? Why do you think that you're going to risk?
*  You're a fun guy to talk to. We're going to have fun.
*  But you associate public speaking and podcasts with causing trouble
*  because you were so... But people don't know your podcast was legendary for being so ridiculous.
*  Jamie, you guys are moving to Texas, right? Will there be any vacation or break between...
*  A little bit small, but like...
*  I guess because I tell myself a story. I know a lot of podcasters. I know a lot of comedians.
*  And they don't... Oh, okay. You know what? F-U-K that. I'll use I statements. I had a podcast.
*  And as... You're a buck wild podcast, son. I would listen to your podcast sometimes. I'll go,
*  God damn, Dave. Holy shit. And you saying that right now? I'll get a hit right now. There's
*  a dopamine charge going on. That was a fun podcast, man. I'm like, the great Joe Rogan is telling me
*  my show is buck wild. Well, it's like you. Even the way you describe your own anxiety and self
*  hatred. It's like there's a freedom to your expression that you would talk about in the
*  podcast. You would say the most embarrassing, humiliating shit, and you would say it freely
*  and openly and then discuss why it's embarrassing and why it's humiliating and what you did wrong
*  and what was fucked up about it and what you were thinking while you were doing, how you knew it was
*  fucked up. It was like riveting, man. I remember I was parked in my car once and you and us,
*  I forget what you guys were talking about, but I was like, Jesus Christ, I have to see how this
*  plays out. So I'm sitting there. I didn't get out of my car for like five minutes just waiting
*  for this conversation to play out. Wow. Thank you. I mean, I don't even know where you would even
*  listen to it. I have a strong support system of friends and family that care about me. And when I
*  went off the rails and completely lost my mind, they took it off the air, which I went crazy.
*  I don't even... Well, this was back when it was on there. I'm sure it's like on the dark web somewhere.
*  Oh, for sure. Well, we were talking the other day about how you kept recording it and you didn't
*  release any of them. I never stopped. I know. But what I said is what you should do is... Because
*  you were talking about doing it again and you're like, should I do it again? Like, what the fuck,
*  my life is so good right now. Should I do it again? This is why I'll tell you what I said over the
*  phone and I'll say it to you in person. You should do it if you want to. And the reason why you should
*  do it if you want to is because the world needs more wild people. The world needs more wild people.
*  People are goddamn scared right now, David. They're scared. There's a bunch of people out there
*  that are terrified to be free. They're terrified to express themselves because they're so worried
*  about being attacked. And it's that self-limiting and self-censoring is one of the real problems
*  with social media censorship. It's not just that you're censoring people for opinions you don't
*  agree with, but it causes other people to self-censor because they're afraid to be cancelled.
*  I can't control myself. Of course you can. You're an artist. And this is a fucking... Like,
*  I went on Stirling. That was live. Yeah. This isn't live? No. Okay. But you used to be live.
*  It's a fucking high wire act. The high wire, the live thing is a high wire act. I'm a severe
*  codependent person. When I go on the Joe Rogan show, I feel like an absolute failure when I leave
*  here if I'm like, I didn't make Joe laugh, I didn't entertain him. You already made me laugh. We can
*  stop it right now. No, but I'm saying... So at that time, we're going back five, six, seven years,
*  I felt I need to one-up myself every time. Like, man, Joe just said, fuck man, you went to a crazy
*  place with Asa. So I was like, I took my... Do you have a lot of... I know we were talking about
*  Alex Gray, but you have a lot of painters on here? I've had painters on here. I wouldn't say a lot,
*  but... They're horrible speakers. They live up here, so they have a very hard time verbalizing.
*  And I get there sometimes. Well, Alex is... He's one of my favorites to have on and to talk to,
*  but he's just so deeply embedded in the spirit world. He's got like two feet on earth
*  and the rest of his body is in this dimension of spirits. He's an anomaly, but usually artistic
*  types, painters, artists, they have a very difficult time speaking, which is why they paint.
*  Right. They're internalizing everything. And I got bored of painting in the same way that when
*  I went to go to the... I'm going to kind of do a weird flex right now, but I went to the Picasso
*  Museum in Spain and they have all his art displayed by decade. Here's his art from zero to 10,
*  10 to 20. If you look at the art that he did by the time he was 15, as an artist, he's bored.
*  He knows how to paint whatever, like all his... Realistic stuff. And then you just see him going,
*  I'm bored with that. Let me go Cubist. Let me go Blue Period. And then at the end, it's just scribbles.
*  It's just like, fuck, I'm trying my hardest to get back to drawing like a kid where I don't give a
*  fuck. And people go, I like this stuff. And for me, I'm like, man, people, oh man, that guy just got
*  lucky. Everything I come in, I come with like a killer attitude. So when I did Howard Stern,
*  when I did your show and I just started, I was like a year and a half. I remember I met with
*  Jason Kaplan, the producer of the Stern show. And he's like, we have a channel here at Sirius.
*  And I'm like, hold on, time out. I've been podcasting for fucking one year and I'm going
*  to be on the Howard net. My head was exploding. I'm like... So they offered you a show on their
*  channel? We were talking about it and I was getting pumped up and I was like, I fucking knew I was
*  awesome at talking. I fucking knew this shit. And I go, but what are we doing? Talking about
*  relationships. I'm talking to a porn star. I'm talking to this. How do I take it to the next
*  level? How do I like, when I close my eyes and I hear a podcast, I'm going to interview this
*  interesting person. And can you believe this person and this shit and facts, interesting thing,
*  story, weird anecdote. And I go, talking, talking, fuck, enough with the fucking talking. Like I'm a
*  fucking artist. I'm a fucking artist. Like I want to bring some shit to this. What does that look
*  like? My guess today is yellow. What? I'm the color blue. What? What are you talking about, Dave?
*  So I'll tell you, then you fucking tell me here in person whether this shit should come out or not.
*  I feel like I need to get high. Go for it. Just keep going. I go, what is that like for me to
*  meditate, close my eyes and be the color blue, not think about the color blue, but be the exact color
*  blue. And my guess today is yellow. Okay. You don't get high, right? I don't get high. I think
*  you'll see why I don't need. I already see it. And then I go, oh fuck, I'll get triggered one day and
*  I'll think of someone who's like my enemy, someone who's coming after me. I'll be like, fuck this guy.
*  Fuck. And I'll read all the comments and shit. And it's like, Dave chose a piece of shit. And I'll go,
*  I'm going to become my victimizer right now. And the person I'm going to interview is myself as a
*  kidnapped victim. What? So I gag myself. I gag myself. And then I become the person who just
*  kidnapped me. And I start screaming, Dave, you're a fucking piece of shit because you fucking do
*  this and you steal and you rip off people and you're a fucking and then it sounds like,
*  fuck you. And I'm not pretending. I'm not pretending. Okay. I'm so. You're locked in.
*  I'm locked in. I'm like, my only goal right now is to try to convince this guy to let me go.
*  Like I'm a kidnapped victim right now. And I go, I need to fucking figure out how to
*  like hostage negotiate myself out of this. And then I play this guy who's like, my only job right now
*  is to murder you. I want to fucking kill you right now. And I'm like, my friends come in,
*  open the podcast door. I'm on the floor in the fetal position and they're like,
*  let's go to dinner. And I'm like, can you guys, you guys want to hear what I just recorded?
*  This should never go out into the world. This should never go out. And I go, hey, I'm not gay,
*  but what would it be like to just do a podcast with a huge dick in your mouth?
*  So I go on Amazon, I order like a butt plug and I stick it in my mouth. And for then three hours.
*  For three hours, you did a podcast with a butt plug in your mouth?
*  Two and a half, two and a half. What does it sound like?
*  You want me to send it to you? Sure.
*  And why wouldn't you just get it after like the first couple of seconds? Like, oh yeah,
*  this isn't going to work. Hey, there's a lot of nuance to butt plugs and the, you know,
*  like where it's going to go. There's no standard butt plug. I started getting Q-tips. It was a
*  huge one. I was getting TMJ, my jaw was hurting. And so I'm listening to this stuff and my friends
*  are like, at this point, there's no difference between you and the homeless guy on the street
*  that's talking to himself. That's having a fight with his boss that fired him 20 years ago. And
*  what's, and I go, um, were you raised religious at all? From the time I was like five till I was
*  around seven, I kicked it. You ever, um, you ever, um, see people talking tongues?
*  I have never seen that live, but I've seen a lot of videos. It looks like a good time.
*  So see, you're an adult. So you're like, this would be a good time as a kid. Terrifying,
*  terrifying, right? So you've seen it. So my mom took me to this church and
*  I mean, I'm scarred, you know, like, is it Pentecostal? It was Baptist Baptist. So I
*  walk into this room and I was six, six, five years old, right? You think just
*  right. And I go, mom, let's get the fuck out of what? And they're like, these people are touched
*  by God right now. They're talking directly to God. And I go, oh my like, and it stayed with me,
*  you know, I start teaching, um, autistic children when I used to live in San Jose,
*  art, you know, I, I tried to, uh, um, help, you know, give back to the community. And my friend,
*  uh, said, can you start teaching this kid Joseph? And then I led to a network of like all these
*  autistic children that needed, uh, art lessons. So I meet this kid, Steven, and
*  he can't put a sentence together. Hi, Dave. Like, oh, hey, come on, let's paint today.
*  Fearless. And we go outside on my deck and we look at the San Jose skyline, right?
*  Photographic memory, photograph, like not to scale, like everything's off proportion looks very like
*  I come back, okay, Steven, let's paint. He starts drawing buildings and I'm like, fuck. And like
*  this, like not looking, just like, and like, uh, like some kind of weird mom and I go,
*  this fucking guy that can't put a sentence together is a genius. He has a photographic, he's
*  what something in his brain is tapped into something that I'm not tapped into. And now some
*  words are coming out of his mouth that sound like that fucking tongues kind of stuff. You ever see
*  that, um, Jay Z documentary where they say they show him like he never writes anything down,
*  like it's all in his head. And he's like, and he does like a weird mumbling. He's like,
*  he's like, but it sounds like, it sounds like that. So I go, I need to do a podcast about that.
*  So I go in the room and I go right now as someone who's never spoken in tongues or not hooked into
*  whatever Jay Z is hooked into and whatever my friend Steven, I'm going to talk. That one went
*  on for six hours, six hours of me creating an alien fucking language, trying to talk directly to
*  God. And that one, 100% my friends go, you cannot put this out. So you have a fucking butt plug in
*  your mouth. You're talking in tongues to God. You're kidnapping yourself. And hold on. These
*  aren't all the same episode, right? No, no, the many different, but the butt plug, you didn't talk
*  tongues with the butt plug, right? This is that it sounds very similar. Those two episodes are
*  very similar, but the talking tongue. So you, there was no real words. You just sat down and
*  decided. This is what the butt plug one sounds like. How many hours does it go for? I don't
*  understand why you wouldn't have stopped after first few seconds. That's a hell of a butt plug.
*  Like a water bottle, an eight ounce. What is it? Eight ounces? 16 ounces. Yeah, eight ounces would be
*  a deal. I get it. So the language thing that you did, did you talk any English or just get in there?
*  My goal was don't, don't try to, I want this to sound like complete gibberish. Right. And from the
*  moment you started, there was no like, hello, I'm going to try something right now. You know,
*  who did that, man? It was real weird. McKenna used to do that. Terrence McKenna used to,
*  he used to do it. I think he did it under the influence of psychedelics. He would talk in like
*  these weird, crazy, fake words. What is that called? There's a, there's a term for it. Not
*  just speaking in tongues. Glossolalia. Is that it? Oh, a scat. It's called glossolalia. Yeah. Oh,
*  is this McKenna? Yeah. Play this just so you can listen to some of this.
*  Seems to be of language. It's language like activity. He talks about it. Oh, he talks about
*  it. Well, I've heard him do it in, there was a song. He did a thing with, you want to try it with
*  me right now? Sure. What do you want to do? Don't, don't use any words that sound like the English
*  language. Just close your eyes and try to think. Why do I have to close my eyes? Just, just to like,
*  you don't have to close your eyes. Sounds fake. See, you need time. You need time. Need time to
*  work on that. But I would bet. But does anyone need to hear that? I fucking dare you to do stand
*  up in that language. No, people pay money. People pay money. I can't do that to them.
*  Put myself alone maybe. But that, that thing, I was just joking around about it. Was it with,
*  was it the Post Malone thing? When I was saying, I think that aliens would be so good at language,
*  they would be able to talk to us in a, in a language and we would understand it. That they
*  would be able to figure out sound to the point where sound could, they could, they could embed
*  information in sound with their super complicated language to the point where they could talk to
*  you and you don't have to understand their language. You don't know by now. Well, what do I not know?
*  You're an alien. Oh, that's ridiculous. Like the amount you, you don't think there's any part of
*  you that you're fascination with it, that you might be like a sleeper cell. No, I'm serious.
*  Like what? Come on. Oh, I've heard all this like simulation theory. What are the chances
*  that this man with this beautifully shaped skull is born on planet earth and whatever,
*  there's probably some kind of block that's, but then you, you become this person and you use the
*  human voice to connect with sports, science, comedy, and then you amass an audience of hundreds of
*  millions of people. And I go, this fucker is an alien. No, there's no way you're an alien. No,
*  I'm a moron. Listen to me. Trust me. I just do things a lot. That's what I do. I just do things
*  until I get good at them. I will start the church, man. I'll fucking join. I don't have any talent
*  at anything. See, other than working hard and getting obsessed with things. That's my number
*  one talent. You're extremely talented. Well, I had physical talent when I was, when I was started
*  doing Taekwondo. I had physical advantages that I recognized very early. They're real advantages.
*  Like some people just have extra speed, they have extra power, they have things that their body can
*  do. That's not, it's not warranted by the amount of effort they put into it. There's, there's that,
*  but after outside of that, everything has just been being obsessed with things. And that's a
*  human characteristic. That's not an alien characteristic. And a lot of it is like, we have
*  our own struggles, right? Like your struggle is you tell yourself you're not good. I don't tell
*  myself I'm not good, but I'm never, I'm never fully satisfied with anything. Like anything that I do
*  personally, whether it's the way I behave or the things that I write or, or perform or podcast or
*  a standup comedy special. So you do the same shit I just did. Yeah. But I don't hate myself,
*  but I'm never happy. I'm never happy. I hate myself, but I'm never happy. I get to a point
*  where I go, all right, this, I did my best. I know I put in the effort. I know I researched it.
*  So that's what makes you inhuman because most humans do hate themselves. Well, what it is is
*  that you alien motherfuckers. Because of the fact that I'm obsessed with doing better things,
*  I put the work in. And from my own personal experience, when I have had moments of self-hating,
*  it's not like I've just never had any self-hating. It was mostly because I didn't put the work in.
*  You spend a lot of time with this guy. Have you ever seen him do like weird bathroom rich or like
*  anything that would be like non-human? Maybe you're a fucking alien too, Jamie. Jamie's way more
*  of an alien than me. Jamie reads my mind 100%. Wow. I'm about to say something and Jamie will
*  just go and he'll type it up. Did you know Chester from Linkin Park? I did not. I met him once,
*  but I did not know him. So I know Johan in his band, the DJ guy. So I went to his house once and
*  he played, I don't know what you call them, scratch tracks or something. And the way I know
*  that they make music is they all live in different cities. So they just like the guitar player will
*  make something and then send it to like Mike Shinoda. And Joe played me an entire album
*  where Chester just sings over every track gibberish. Oh, wow. And it sounded better
*  than any of their music that I've ever heard. And it was like, because he's just trying to get the
*  gibberish and it was like scat. I don't know what you call it. Do you know the Black Keys?
*  I've heard their music. I don't know them. Dan Auerbach, he told me he just makes up words.
*  That's fucking awesome. Yeah. Yeah. He just like, he, first of all, that guy smokes tons of weed.
*  I mean, just constantly high. Right. He's like, I get high and I just, I just come up with lyrics.
*  I just start singing, I start playing and I make up words. Wow. I go, you make up words. He goes,
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's smart to sound. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah, it's all right. So you just said
*  something. Black Keys are phenomenal. These people are paying money to come see me do comedy. So I'm
*  not going to do my true alien tongue version standup set. That's something I would have to
*  practice. Right. See, that's, that's the thing. Like if I'm going to, that would be too indulgent
*  to do it in front of them without any practice. If I knew that there was a way that I could do it,
*  that I could distill it down to an entertaining form. Right. I would definitely do it. So you've,
*  you've done like thousands of these now. Yeah. You've had every single different kind of
*  profession and weird personality sitting here. And, and I was getting to the point in my podcast
*  where I was getting pretty big guests and, and I was finding myself dissatisfied, but unlike you,
*  hating myself and becoming very bored. And I said, I'm, I'm not good at speaking because I have blind
*  spots. I stutter. I say like a lot. I say, um, and I talk over people and I'm trying to sort of
*  like wedge my agenda and try to get my point across. And I go, if my consciousness, my soul,
*  who's talking in this mic right now is what is the interview? We want to learn about ourselves
*  through another person. We want to learn, you know, and I go, there's a lot of people living
*  inside me. There's a lot of, there's like, I'm like, oh, there's a guy here right now that's
*  fucking puking on the Van Nuys Boulevard. And there's another guy that's super confident and
*  cocky. And so I go, there's a collective, there's a short bus in my brain and the person driving
*  right now today, right now is a confident sober mentally stable. But on that bus, there's a racist
*  Dave, there's a sexist Dave, there's a werewolf Dave, there's a trans Dave, there's a experimental
*  butt plug Dave, there's, there's many Dave's and they're, it's whatever attention I want to give
*  them. And, um, you ever done a psycho drama? Psycho drama? Yeah. What is that? It's like a therapy
*  tool where, um, you're in a room like this with, uh, like five other patients. Um, and I don't know,
*  could be like up to 10, I guess. And you identify one of the most traumatic moments of your life
*  and that you can't, you're stuck. You can't, you can't get past. I can't get past,
*  my parents divorcing, I can't get past failing at the, you know, national, you know, whatever
*  that moment is. And so then you keep playing that on a loop in your brain and no matter what you do
*  in life, that's always still going on. And so it's a tool to, to rewire your brain. So it's like,
*  okay, you're going to play yourself. How old were you then? 16. Okay. So you're Joe Rogan, 16. Who
*  was there? My dad was there. My mom was there, my coach, you know, and then so all the other people
*  play the roles of those things. And then you just go through and then what happened? And then this
*  guy punched me. Pause. What are you smelling right now? You go around the room and it, you just
*  dissect the moment and you're like, so what did you need at that moment? Well, I needed my dad to
*  fucking step up for me. And, but did he? No. So in this version, have him come in. So you're rewriting
*  history and I go home, I've done hundreds of these now and I go, has anyone ever done a psycho drama
*  with themselves? Right? Cause there's many voices on the 101 over here. It's like, Dave, turn the
*  car around. Who's talking right now? Scared, fucking confident Dave, we need you up on the bus.
*  Come to the front. Okay. It's like, Hey, why the fuck did you stick a Nestle Pure Life waterball
*  in your mouth? Cause you wanted to explain to Joe what a butt plug. Did you need to do that?
*  And then, so I do this for a few hours. Of course I'm recording. And once again,
*  I'm in a fucking room talking with the hot mic, crying, laughing, screaming to myself.
*  This sounds like an awesome ad for a Patreon page. This is what you do. You take those episodes,
*  you start new ones and you take those crazy ones and you just put it up only for Patreon members
*  and just ask them to please not share it unless people are paying and then use that money for
*  charity. Probably make a million dollars in a week. I don't know. I'm trying to heal myself.
*  We all are. We all are. What you're saying is a mirrored in a lot of people, especially the,
*  you're different. I'm different person all the time. I'm a lot of different people and some of
*  them have their shit together and those ones guide the other ones away from the fucking rocks.
*  In a fight, flight or freeze situation, what are you?
*  Because I'll just tell you, I could give a master class in freezing.
*  If you can get out, you should get out. Always. Flight.
*  If you can fly, flight is always the best option. I'm a master freezer.
*  You can't freeze. Flight, I'm either flight or fight. Those are one, it's one or two and
*  you can't take either one of them lightly. If you're flight, you have to know there's a reason
*  to get out and that reason has to make sense and you have to be able to assess very quickly
*  whether or not this is even going to work. Are you going to get out of here? Is this going to work
*  or am I going to have to fight? If I'm going to have to fight, I should fight now
*  and I should be only thinking about that. If you're going to fight, you can never think
*  maybe I shouldn't be doing this or maybe I should get out. Maybe I should back off.
*  Maybe I should, I don't know, maybe I fucked up. You can't think that. Once you pull the trigger,
*  you got to let the wolf out of the cage. Okay, so you're going to run. You got to run. You got
*  to, you can't, you can't go, Jesus, am I really running? What am I doing? No, you just got to go.
*  You got to get the fuck out of there. You can't worry about your ego. If you can escape, especially
*  violent encounters, if you can escape and your ego is the only thing that gets damaged, congratulations.
*  Your ego can, you can get over that, but physical violence is terrifying. So I need your help then.
*  Okay. Okay. I told you the other day, this is pre quarantine, pre Panda. I'm in the car with my dad
*  and we were going to our favorite Chinese restaurant in San Gabriel Valley,
*  which by where we live should take 15, 20 minutes tops. We live in Los Angeles. I look at the Google
*  maps, it says an hour and 10 minutes to get there. It's prime LA traffic. My dad had a stroke two
*  years ago, so he's got a kind of gimp leg. He sort of drags his foot. So I'm like his Uber driver.
*  Now I take him everywhere and he's like a typical old Korean guy. He doesn't, he likes to eat close
*  to home, no lines, fast in and out done. So we get in the car 5 36 on a weekday night and it's just
*  traffic bumper to bumper. And he's like, fuck, look at this traffic. And the thing that added
*  to this, which I didn't know was it was the Academy awards night. Oh no. So now it's like,
*  we're not moving and we're sitting, we're sitting at the light and my phone starts blowing up.
*  Like congratulations, like fuck, like all caps. I go, what, what's going on? I look at my phone
*  my dad's like, Hey, don't look at your phone when you're driving. I'm like,
*  we're not going anywhere, bro. Chill the fuck out. And parasite, the Korean film had just won best
*  film like in the American Academy awards. And all my non white friends are starting to like,
*  cause Asians all know each other, right? We kind of do, but congratulations on parasite.
*  And I go, I had nothing to do with that movie. Whoa. You get, wait a minute. You're getting
*  congratulated because it's Korean. Yeah. They're like, you must be so proud of your people.
*  Like you did it, man. Let me ask you this. Is that racist for them to do that?
*  It seems a little racist. It's a racist, congratulatory thing. Like, like if somebody
*  called me up and congratulated me for something Italians did, I'd be like, what beautiful meatball
*  is wrong with you? Beautiful meatball. I don't even know that guy. So that's what I'm saying.
*  I'm in the car going, I don't even fucking know that guy. Is it all white people that are calling
*  you congratulatory? One, one Mexican guy, two, two white guys, it's three people, three people.
*  And it's the news just hit first time in history, non-American film wins. You know, it's a big deal.
*  The Koreans are fucking like going crazy in Korea town. And, and then my mom who's in another car
*  calls me and she's like, get that guy over to our house for dinner. I want to cook for him.
*  And I go, mom, you fucking think we all know each other. You know that fucking guy.
*  You know that guy. Mom, just cause I'm a Korean in the entertainment, I don't know all of them.
*  She's like, you know, Steven Yuen, he was in, uh, Oakja Oakja. He knows Bong Jong. I was,
*  fuck you mom. The fuck off. Like your mom's even more racist. But my dad, he likes that shit. He's
*  very prideful. He's a prideful Korean guy, except he was born in China. Oh wow. So during the war
*  times, his, you know, he's Korean, but he was born in China. He was on the run. And when I like to
*  fuck with my dad, I grab him by the neck and I go, Hey, you Chinese motherfucker, you Ching
*  Chong motherfucker. Is it racist? I don't know. No, I don't think I grabbed my dad by the neck.
*  He's very, he's one of the most prideful Korean people. And I, and we're not going anywhere. We're
*  sitting at the lights and I go fucking did it, man. What? You know, I'm having a, uh, you know,
*  connection with my dad. I go, you Ching Chong, Chinese motherfucker came to America in the
*  seventies. He's like, yeah, there was no traffic then I go, yeah, just let me fucking, let me,
*  let me, let me tell my story. You come here, they try to fucking burn you out of Korea town. They
*  burn your fucking shop down. They call you chink. They call you fucking gook. You come here with
*  nothing. You're working on an assembly line. You're poor. You have, you raised three boys. You have
*  no fucking money. And look at us now. Parasite bitch. Fucking parasite. Dave Chang, best fucking
*  chef in America. Roy Choi, fucking K-pop dominating, dominating the fucking, um, Bobby Lee,
*  Bobby Lee, Steve Lee, like we're, we're kimchi on the menu everywhere now. Everywhere. You want some
*  kimchi pizza. You want some probiotic probiotic shit up in your gut, you know, like everywhere,
*  this tiny fucking country in Korea. You know, my dad's getting pumped up. He's like, yeah,
*  we fucking did it, man. And all the texts are still coming. Yes. There's a, there's a racist,
*  what the fuck's the term? It's called a perpetual foreigner. Where it doesn't matter that you,
*  I was born in Los Angeles, that you always feel like a foreigner growing up. The message from my
*  parents was don't piss off the white people. Like we need to act in a way that's a, what's the other
*  one? Model minority. We need to, we can't do anything that like upsets them because we might
*  get sent back on the boat. You know, it's like you need to act in a certain way. You have to dress a
*  certain way. You have to comb your hair, you have to get a certain kind of job, doctor, lawyer,
*  doctor, lawyer. And you need to act that fucking way because we don't want to get sent back.
*  And so yes, yes, father, yes, honorable father. So I'm sitting there and I'm feeling myself,
*  I'm feeling my race, I'm feeling my dad. And I'm like, I'm fucking did it. Fucking man everywhere,
*  K-pop, K-food, the tiny fucking country that's been under attack for generations is fucking
*  dominating. Now they'll like us. Now they'll let us into the club. Now, you know, and we haven't
*  moved an inch. We're still sitting in traffic. And he goes, I would trade all of that for,
*  for us to fucking go home right now or beat this traffic. All right, whatever. Cut to
*  Academy Awards to what was that? It was the Academy Awards. And then when was the quarantine?
*  Two, three months later, no traffic, no traffic. I can get to the beach in 15 minutes from my house.
*  It used to take an hour and a half. I go, dad, let's go to the beach. Let's get the fuck out of
*  here. Sitting in the car. And you remember when the quarantine first started, you saw families
*  walking down, like entire families walking the dog. Everything was closed. Like there was no smog in LA.
*  We fucking drive to the beach. We're almost there at a red light. And there's a guy walking his dog
*  with his kid. And I get a kind of mad dog kind of vibe. Like he's staring at me and our windows
*  are down. And I'm, I don't know, I'm always talking really loud to my dad because he's hard of hearing.
*  And the light turns green. And he just, he like with like disdain and disgust, he just goes like
*  this and pulls his eyes back. He made an Asian face. He did that to you and your dad. And I can sit here and call tough guy from the
*  butt. Fuck that guy. I got a thick skin. And maybe because it was, I was with my dad and I love my dad.
*  And I, I saw that my dad saw him do that. And I was like, fuck, like fuck man. Like
*  I was like,
*  and I froze. I froze. I was like, my dad is sad. That's wise. That's wise. I mean, he's with this
*  fucking kid. And I go, listen, it doesn't matter. You never know. If you go over and engage some guy
*  in a physical confrontation and he beats you to death, there's no comfort in the fact that his kid
*  was there to watch. You have to really, people are so flippant about engaging in physical violence.
*  It's very fucking dangerous. It's dangerous for everybody. You never know what someone knows.
*  So I snap in those moments. I go to rage and like maybe if I was by myself, maybe I would have been
*  more quick witted and had a snappy comeback. But someone hasn't done that to me. The last time
*  someone did this to me, I was probably in a third world country 15, 20 years ago. And before that,
*  maybe I was in grade school. And as a 44 year old man who's in a lot of pain that's been working on
*  himself to heal, it like hurt me. Well, fuck that guy. Just, just get away from him. That's the best.
*  You're not going to fix him by beating the shit out of him. You're not going to change anything.
*  You're going to, I mean, the idea that you're going to punish him for that and it's going to,
*  it's going to make him hate Asian people more. He's just a fucked up dude. And a guy would do
*  that to you for no reason at all. Just sees you and wants to hurt you and make you feel bad.
*  That kind of guy is hurting, man. He's probably been abused his whole life. It's probably something
*  real wrong with him. He's probably had a fucked up alcoholic dad or something, or some uncle did
*  something to him. That's always something. People that lash out and try to hurt people randomly for
*  no reason are all in pain. You know, it's that old expression, hurt people, hurt people.
*  Definitely. And that's true. And I'm hurt. Yeah. But that's not a, that's an intelligent thing
*  to do nothing because your pause, your pause is wise because you can call it freezing,
*  but you're stuck in an unwinnable situation. If you go over and beat that guy's ass, like that
*  is violence. It's dangerous. You never know how it's going to turn out. You never know if he has a
*  gun or a knife or fuck. I go darker than that. I go, I go darker than that. Fuck him. Just beat
*  up his kid in front of him. Oh Jesus. I mean, I don't think he would let you do that. Then he
*  would really kill you. But the idea is that the best thing to do is to get the fuck out of there.
*  So the freezing and trying to figure out what you, cause it's a, it's a real decision. If you run
*  over that, but if you get the fuck out of there, then that guy hurts you. And then you feel bad
*  and you never feel like you got him back. But growing up in the eighties, I got that all the
*  time and I, and I built up a thick skin to that. And I was, I was like, I'm going to go to a new
*  black school. I'm going to go to all Mexican school and they're going to make fun of me.
*  They're going to do that. They're going to call me Mr. Miyagi there. So I pull into the beach
*  parking lot and my dad had just already deleted it from, he's like, I was like, sorry dad. And he's
*  like, I'm like, what the fuck am I apologizing? He's like, ah, whatever. And, and you know, I'm
*  saying it with my whole chest, Korean. I was feeling very braggadocious and proud and it all
*  like the flights. And I go parasite got us here. And then a virus sends us right. Our dick shrivel
*  back into our body. And I'm like, oh fuck dude. Well, that is a virus too. Well, yeah, that guy
*  is a virus. Well, look, it's like, like that's that guy caught that from somewhere. Well, it's
*  our leadership. They're calling, they're calling us the 40 year old man. And that's, that's who
*  it brought it back out. It's not going to know that guy probably has always been like that, man.
*  But it's like, people are inspiring, right? If you inspire hate, then people become, if they have
*  that in you, it brings it back out. So you think by just him saying that it's a Chinese virus,
*  when he called it Chinese virus, when he called it Kung Fu and not correcting it, the violence
*  towards Asians, he didn't call it Kung Fu. Well, if he did, he didn't say it publicly. I don't know
*  if he said that, but he like, there's all those things showing that he crossed it out and he's
*  still trying. He says Chinese Chinese virus, right? The little kid got stabbed at the Sam's
*  Club in Texas, an Asian kid and violence and you know, it's Asians don't speak up. We don't ask
*  for help. We fucking stored inside and then we explode. So a little kid got stabbed. Look it up.
*  No, I believe it. Right. So because just because he was Asian, just because he was
*  because of the Chinese flu comment by Trump, they did a thing where they measure it. Every time he
*  calls it Chinese virus, the violence towards Asians goes up in this country. Really? Yeah.
*  It's fucking crazy. Oh, he did say it. Oh, Jesus. That's crazy. Because remember that lady in the
*  White House was saying, I heard someone in your administration called it the Kung Flu. And he was
*  like, remember he was like, what? So he was pretending he didn't know what, but he had already
*  said it. Unless that was after that. I think this was after that event. This was after that.
*  So he's like, that's a good name to Kung Flu. I'm gonna use it. And this thing where you're
*  saying is like people call lots of names. There's lots of names, right? Coronavirus, right? Kung
*  Flu. Yes, Kung Flu. Yeah. He said a bunch of times. Well, there's been a lot of viruses named after
*  other places like the Spanish flu, which killed a fucking shitload of people. But if someone shows
*  you the stats and they're like, look, yeah, you choosing the words you want right now is causing
*  violence towards Asian people in this country. And he's like, yeah, fuck him. You know, I don't
*  think he's that insightful, right? I don't think he's thinking about it. Fuck Trump. Anyone else
*  that's saying that, right? It's like, no, but I'm saying like that, maybe someone needs to say it
*  that way. Because you saying it that way. And I didn't know that there was a stat that showed
*  that violence against Asian people went up every time he said it. Then it makes that first of all,
*  it has a name, right? Yes. Coronavirus, COVID-19, it has name. To call it anything other than that
*  name, it should either be funny or descriptive. Now, if he calls it the Wuhan virus, that's really
*  technically where it's from. Right. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But the problem
*  is actual racism and actual violence. That's the real problem. Now, the other thing is when you're
*  a leader, that's when things get slippery, because then you can't just be a regular person. Because
*  if you're a leader, you literally can help other people. Maybe he doesn't even realize it, but
*  you really can change the way people think and behave. When a really powerful person like him,
*  the most powerful in the country, arguably, when he says something that prescribes unity,
*  that promotes the idea of companionship and of friendship and of love and of support and
*  camaraderie, literally can change the way people feel. And also if he says something hateful,
*  it'll change the way people feel. We move, whether we like it or not, there's so many of us,
*  there's 300 million in this country plus, and we move to inspirational words or angry words.
*  That's you, man. That's you. You are an inspiration. When you say things like that,
*  people listen. You see how people are. We were joking right now, but if you did start a cult,
*  there'd be fucking millions of people signing up tomorrow, and they would listen to you.
*  And if you said, this is a fucking, fuck these Chinese people, then they'd say,
*  we're with Joe. I don't know. I think most of them would leave me if I said that.
*  They would be smart enough. Kanye, fall over. And Tupac. Come on, Tupac, stay with us, bro.
*  This Kanye one does not want to stand up. It's so ironic.
*  So this is what I need help with. How fast did I answer the phone when you called me the other day?
*  Like, it was like a normal phone. It's like the first, I, I,
*  weren't we texting first? Texting first. But then when you called me,
*  I'm so thirsty that people, people assume, right? In our, in our workaholic culture,
*  people assume that you must be really busy. I mean, you actually are busy. I'm not busy.
*  I don't have anything going on. Like when someone calls me, I make it a game now. Like,
*  here's another thing I don't want to admit to you. Like I pulled up right here. I was sitting
*  outside for an hour. I was sitting in a, like I was talking to this homeless guy outside for an
*  hour before I pulled in here. And so when someone calls me now, I, you know, it's cool to let it
*  ring three times. I'm like, boom. I do the same thing. I just answer. So I don't got anything
*  going on. I know, I know in our culture, it's really cool to be like, Hey bro, what's project
*  you're working on? What are you doing? I'm like, nothing. I'm working on myself. That's what I'm
*  working on. That's really cool. Yeah. So I, I, I take my dog. I got a rescue from Costa Rica.
*  I love my dog. And I go on walks with my dog now that are so long that my dog looks at me and
*  it's like, dude, when the fuck are we going to go back home? And I'm walking and I'm smell and
*  I'm taking in my neighborhood. I'm smelling the petunias. I literally stopped to smell the roses.
*  I go, this is my life. Now I stopped to smell the roses. I walked to this underpass where there's
*  like the entire homeless community. I, um, you know, I give them snacks, clean underwear, water.
*  I just talked to them and they see me coming. They're like, Oh, there's that fucking guy that's
*  going to talk to us for like six hours again. And then I'm really busy today. Dave, uh, Sam doing
*  don't we got like a one o'clock brunch, you know, and, and this is my life now, not much going on.
*  And I'm, and I'm, and I'm, you got to tell me all this just because you answered the phone quick.
*  Like, I'm trying to set you. Well, I'm trying to set up how soft I am. That's not so I'm not hard.
*  I don't have, I'm not on it. Okay. I'm not on it. Let me pause you for a second. Okay. Let me help
*  you out here. First of all, if you just stat sat there and you weren't busy and just stared at your
*  phone and let it ring three times, you'd be a fucking idiot. But people do that. There's people
*  who are idiots. You should, you should record them. Everyone should have like a secret video of your
*  friend staring at the phone, deciding whether or not to talk to you or whether or not to let it ring
*  three times. You see the phone ring and you pick it up right away. Yeah. If I can, you don't do that.
*  You don't do cool guy like, no, let me, let me, I'm not cool guy. Someone calls me. I'm like, what's up?
*  Jamie, first ring. First ring. I tell my friends I miss them. I tell them I love them. I'm not cool guy.
*  I answer the phone. I'm not, I'm, I'm thirsty, desperate as fuck guy. You won't even think it rang.
*  My game that I play is that I try to, I try to pick it up before it even rings once. It's like,
*  you're like, like, oh shit, this fucker is telepathic. Yeah. Also if someone butt dials me,
*  I call them right back. So my point is I don't, I don't got much going on. I'm working on myself.
*  I am, I'm trying to stop and be present and enjoy things and I'm having a great day. Beautiful. This
*  is, this happened last week, by the way, walking back home. Like I'm, I've been gone for like two
*  and a half hour walk. I'm walking back home. Once again, I'm at a red light car pulls up,
*  window comes down and I'm just sitting there and I get that feeling that something's about to happen
*  and the light turns, you know, on the other crossing light turns, it's about to turn red
*  and he goes, Hey, hey, hey, hey. And I look over and he goes, go back to where you come from.
*  What do I got? Seven seconds before, you know, like I got a few seconds and I go once again,
*  this to go back, this is the second incident since the pandemic started. And I go, I got this.
*  I know this one. People used to say that to me. Fuck. And like there's, there's like, if you,
*  Asian people that are born in America, go back to where you come from. Bellflower, Whittier,
*  Garden Grove, like that's, and I, and I, and I froze again. I go, I have this, come back, clap
*  back, whatever. I have that. And I go, Joe will know what to say. He's a comedian. He's on stage
*  with hecklers. The best thing you'd say to someone like that is stare at him, but he's gone already.
*  Luke is a fuck. Let him go like mad dog stare. Like empty blank. You're a mirror. Doesn't mean
*  anything. Go back to where you come from. The guy's a moron again. Like why, why would he yell out
*  at you? You're not an argument with this person. He's a piece of shit. He sees you on the side of
*  the road and just yells out at you again. Guarantee you that guy was abused. His life sucks. Go back
*  to where you come from. That's a crazy thing to say to people. And then it's like what my mom's
*  pussy, your mom's pussy. Like, do I go offensive or do I go self-deprecating? Everybody is from
*  somewhere else. This is the place. Unless you're fucking Cherokee, unless you're a Native American.
*  So the best comeback for that is just stare down. Just nothing. Just give him nothing.
*  You want to argue with the guy. Then he gets out and beats your ass again. He threw my whole
*  fucking day off. I went home. I put, I laid down on my bed and I was like, God damn. That's what he
*  wanted to do. You know, and I go, when was the last time I got that high school high school?
*  Some Persian kid said, go back to where you come from. So it's twice since the pandemic and all
*  from high school on. Always had red lights. Maybe I should just run the red.
*  Maybe I should just roll the windows up and just look straight. And there's going to be shit heads.
*  This get, look, life is an unfair game. It's unfair. It's unfair with your mind.
*  The idea that everybody has the same mind is ridiculous. I know my mind is dog shit
*  compared to Elon Musk's. I've talked to him. Everybody has different attributes.
*  Everybody has different environment. Everyone has different family life, genetics, influences, abuse,
*  assaults, different things that have happened to you that have been horrible that you've had to get
*  through. You know, the loss of loved ones, all these different things. They vary so much from
*  person to person. We have a rough idea of what it means if your mom dies when you're five. We have a
*  rough idea. We have a rough idea of what it means if you got beat up when you were 13 in front of
*  your girlfriend. We have the rough idea. We don't know until we experience it. And everybody
*  experiences a different fucking hand of cards. And then here you find yourself, you know, whatever
*  age you are in life, just still battling demons from your childhood and all fucked up from things
*  that have been happening to you. And you've never had a good path. Your fucking brain doesn't work
*  that good. You've never had a thing that you do that makes you feel special. Right? When you paint
*  and you get rewarded for that painting and people love it, there's a charge. There's a thing. Some
*  people don't have a thing. They ain't got shit. And that kind of person sees you on the side
*  of them at a red light and says, go back to where you come from. And that gets into your head and
*  it fucks you up. That's what they want to do. They want you to feel what they feel. When someone says
*  something hateful, one of the reasons why it works is because you feel their hate. It comes off of
*  them. You get it on your system. And that's one of the ways men intimidate other men. When men
*  are angry and scream at men and get in their face, what they're doing is they're not just puffing
*  their chest out. They're not just signaling that they're aggressive and violent. They're getting
*  their hate in you. You have to feel it. You feel it like a drug. If someone's mad at you,
*  and it's all about how much tolerance you have to that drug of other people's aggression and anger
*  and resentment and jealousy and all the various toxic emotions that people have. When someone's
*  at you, I'm sure you've dated crazy women, right? And I don't even have to ask. So there's a moment
*  in time when a crazy girl's yelling at you and they're mad at you and like, Jesus Christ,
*  you're making me crazy. It's getting into me. Like you're crazy is on me. It's like,
*  I got to get out of here. It's fucking contagious. And like a virus, it can change the way you feel.
*  And if you're in a fucking hive, just like if you're in like just a hot spot of nasty thinking and
*  behavior, you grow up in that. Maybe you have abusive family. Maybe your dad beats your mom
*  and your mom beats you and you beat your brother and your brother beats your sister. It's just
*  fucking madness. And then you have neighbors that suck too. And everybody sucks. And that's as much
*  of a virus as the flu. It's a mind virus that gets out into the other people that around you.
*  And you can be real lucky and you could live in an area of a mind nature, a peaceful valley with
*  a beautiful mountain and a creek that goes through it. And that's the community that you're in.
*  You got lucky. You grew up in a wonderful community with fantastic parents and great
*  neighbors and your aunt, your uncle come over and everybody has good times and, oh sure,
*  there's a little bit of hardship here and there, but for the most part, people love each other.
*  It's not fair. It's not fair. When that guy yells out at you like that, man, it's hard to
*  internalize all this in the moment because you are feeling his hate. Well, I'll tell you what happens.
*  I go, I become jealous of comedians because when I'm at a comedy show and I see hecklers and I'm
*  like, that guy was so quick with that comeback. Yeah, but let me tell you something. I won't do
*  that in real life. Oh, I don't do that in real life. Really? Very no. Some guy cuts you off.
*  You don't have a fast one ready. No, no. But you know what? So I reflect on it when I go home and
*  I go, what did I say the last time this happened? And then I start laughing because it was high
*  school. A guy said, hey, why don't you go back to, you know, we got an argument. He goes, hey, why
*  don't you just go back to where you come from? I go home. I'm like, oh, fuck. But it's a learned
*  thing. Years went by. Years went by. The guy was a senior in high school and I said, I got it. I got
*  it. Completely revenge is the best dish served cold or all that. Like not for comedy. I see him in
*  class and I get my balls up and I go, I got it. Completely out of context. Four years later, right?
*  Your mom's pussy. The guy's like, what the fuck? That's where I come from. And I just walked away
*  and I go, that landed so flat. Not really though. Because think about it. Right now we're laughing.
*  Like it's a slow burn. A joke delivered four years later? Even worse. Even worse. A joke delivered
*  four years later and talked about 15 years later. See? See, now it's effective. It's just a real slow bomb.
*  It worked. Whenever I see stuff like that, I go,
*  because I grew up with it. You know when you're in high school and people go, hey,
*  pick a superpower. Invisibility or flight. I'm already invisible. Like being an Asian and growing
*  up in the communities that I grew up with, I was invisible. Like I don't even have a voice.
*  Like you might find this hard to believe, but I never talked growing up. I was the kid in the
*  corner and like girls would form groups and talk about which guy they want to fuck. And I wouldn't
*  even be in, they're like, Dave's sitting right there and they're like, yeah, he's not even on the
*  fucking roster. And I'm like, so I go, wait, is this racist? Yeah. But what has it, how can I turn this around?
*  What it did for me, the Asian superpower is, if you're not seen and you're not heard and we're seen
*  as non-threatening, I can go anywhere. I can go anywhere and people open up to me. I've been to
*  the Congo. I've been to third world countries. I've been to every fucking state in America. I might
*  be the most American person. Like I've been to every fucking state. I've hitchhiked from the time
*  I was 15 to every fucking state, every country. And I've talked and because, would a black guy be
*  able to do that? Would a white guy be able to do that? When people see, oh, that guy's Chinese.
*  He's like Jackie Chan or he's a whatever they think. They don't think that I'm going to do
*  anything or say anything or I'm going to pose any threat. So they just open up and they say the most,
*  I don't know, like when I started hitchhiking, people said, no one's going to pick you up.
*  Right? Like 60s, 70s, everyone hitchhiked. And then something weird happened in the 80s where like,
*  you're going to get raped, kidnapped, murdered, you know, but I go, I don't think so. I think if
*  I put my thumb out and ask for help, someone's going to give it to me. And with that, I got to
*  see the world for free. I got to go everywhere. And much like what happened was I would sit shotgun
*  and I'm getting these free rides and two things would happen. Either the driver has a long drive
*  and they want someone to talk to, or they want me to talk to them. And something would happen.
*  I'm in the car right now with a complete stranger. Anything could happen. And the first hour is always
*  small talk. How long you been on the road? What would you do? You know, it's all that kind of stuff.
*  Something switches when they know the ride's about, like I'm about to get out or whatever.
*  I'm never going to see this guy again. I'm never going to see this guy again.
*  So now we've been talking about new sports and weather for an hour. Last 10 minutes,
*  I fucked my sister when I was 12. Whoa. Everything comes out. So I've heard, think about how many
*  rides I've hitched. How old was he? He was 12. How old was his sister? I don't know. I mean,
*  everything. Drugs, incest. You know, I killed somebody. Like murder, murder confessions.
*  Really? I've heard the most insane. Hold one at a time. Murder confession. I don't know if I
*  should be telling you. You definitely should be. A guy confessed to me that he was thinking of
*  raping me when I stayed at his house. Oh Jesus. You stayed at his house? You didn't just hitchhike,
*  you hitchhoused. I was in the deep south. I was in the deep south. It was like I was trying to
*  hitchhike from LA to New York City. I was with my friend Brian. Same thing. No one's going to pick
*  up two fucking dudes. And John Wayne picks us up. Cowboy guy. 10 gallon hat. You know.
*  Damn, you boys look hot out there. Get in the car. And he's telling us about shrimp po boys. And
*  you know, he works on an offshore oil rig. And it's two weeks on, two weeks off. And it's just
*  two weeks off right now. So he's like, where are you guys headed? And we're like, we're just trying
*  to get to New York. New York? What you want to go there for? A bunch of queers out there. I don't
*  know. We just, we want to check it out. You guys want to stay at my house tonight? Like this guy
*  looks like grandpa. Just cowboy boots, cowboy hat, just big gut. Like he's a dude. Right.
*  Yeah, I'm young. I'm 17 or 18 at this time. We get to his house in,
*  fuck, this is what I'm talking about. Tiny town in Louisiana. Deep south. Like, we get in his house,
*  diehard movie collection, Rambo movie collection, shotguns, and uh,
*  lube. Just, just, just a dude, just a man's man. And he has, uh, and his side in his part-time job
*  is an anesthesiologist. Part-time anesthesiologist. Part-time anesthesiologist. And then part-time
*  offshore oil rig. And uh, I'm, you know, this is summertime, deep south, covered with like,
*  grease and mosquitoes living outside on the road, hitchhiking. He's like, you guys want to take a
*  shower? I'm like, fuck yeah. I'm the first one in the shower. And uh, and then I come out,
*  I got the towel wrapped on. He's like, he made us like a frozen pizza or something.
*  And there's a protest on the television. It's a San Francisco. This is 1993 or 94. There's a protest
*  of something with gay people in, in San Francisco. And they're protesting. And he's watching it.
*  And I'm like, what? He's like, I'm queer. You never see me out there protesting.
*  And I'm like, oh shit. And then he, and then my friend Brian, who's covered in grease and dirt,
*  he hasn't showered yet. And I'm like, oh shit. And I started getting my clothes on. And uh,
*  you know, it's one thing to be gay and then it's one thing to be picked up by like a,
*  you know, a big gay guy with a cowboy hat takes you to his house.
*  So, and, and, and I, here's the thing. I don't want to discourage people from hitchhiking. This
*  is one weird incident that's happened in like 15 years of hitchhiking. So he's like, Hey, hey Brian,
*  why don't you, it's your turn. Why don't you take a shower? Nah, I'm okay. I'm all right.
*  You're filthy. Why don't you get in there and take a shower? He's like, nah, nah, I'm all right. I'm
*  okay. And I go, oh fuck. What do we do? You know, like do a little powwow in the corner. He's like,
*  he's old. We can take him if he tries anything. We're tired. We were fucking so tired.
*  We're like, he's, he looks like he's, he was like falling asleep on his, on his couch and he goes,
*  he's going to go to sleep soon. Let's just fucking stay the night. It's fucking air-conditioned in
*  here. And then let's leave first thing in the morning before we wake up. Like, okay, fuck it.
*  Let's just do it. All right, boys. I'm going to turn in. Like, yes. So we, we take the couch and
*  I go, let's sleep in a formation and let's take turns. You stay, we should have just left.
*  She was just like, you go, you, you stay up for an hour and then wake me up. I'll stay up for an
*  hour. We'll just, and then we'll leave crack of dawn. You know, um, I had a pocket knife.
*  So I slept like this. I took the knife and I put the thing like this and I slept like that.
*  And I stayed up for the first hour and I see his, him walking around his room and the lights are on
*  and I'm like, this, this guy is not going to sleep. Midnight, one in the morning. He's still,
*  I'm like, what the fuck? Why won't this guy go to sleep? Putting his masks on.
*  So I nudge Brian, I go, Hey, it's your turn. I got, I got him. I'm going to fucking pass out.
*  He's out cold. I'm like, fuck dude. Fuck man. I'm too tired. And I go,
*  okay, I'm just going to stay up the whole night. So I'm up. I'm like,
*  guys are closing, bringing back up again, gripping the knife. And then
*  sometime around five 30 in the morning or something at my eyes are closed, but you know,
*  when you feel someone, so he comes out of his room and he's standing there and I could see.
*  And then I go, Oh shit. And then I grip the knife and I go, this is it. This is it. It's
*  going to happen right now. And he just leaves. I see he goes out the door and I go, Oh fuck. Like,
*  and then I wake up Brian, I go, Brian, let's get the fuck out of here. He's like, what,
*  what's going on? He's like, dude, he just left. He's like, okay, I'm going to take a shower then.
*  What are you talking about? He's like, if he went to the store or something, like he's not going to
*  get some duck. Yeah. He's not going to be back for a little. Let me, I'll jump in and jump. I go,
*  dude, let's just go right now. Like he was, I don't know if he was jerking off or what,
*  like he was, I had my eyes closed, but he was standing right there and he's like, I'll be,
*  I'll be quick. So he runs in, takes a fast shower. We get our clothes on and like,
*  just as we're walking out, he's like, Hey, he's like, pulls in, you guys are leaving without
*  saying bye. I just went to the market to get some eggs for breakfast. And I'm like, Oh fuck, dude.
*  So I'm like, I have the knife in my hand the whole time. I go, like it's that, that thing where I,
*  I'm a people pleaser, you know, like I'll even put my own life at risk to like this guy went to the
*  store and got eggs for me, you know, like, uh, yeah, sure. We'll have some eggs. So we go in
*  and the guy starts talking about, um, his wife and how, um, he works on this offshore oil rig with
*  like a younger dude. It's just two guys running this whole oil rig. And the other guy just talks
*  about how much he hates gay people the whole time, not knowing that this guy is. And, um,
*  and then he just, like, like, uh, like all the other times I've been picked up,
*  it starts opening up about how he was married. He has a bunch of children and then he figured out
*  he was gay. And, uh, and then he's like, I could see it. He knows we're on our way out. He's never
*  going to see us. Let's just fucking let it off. You boys look so cute on the side of the road there
*  last night. And it was like, I was so like, I'm so lonely. I don't get to, you know, you don't know
*  what it's like to be a queer guy in the deep south. And, uh, man, when I came out this morning
*  and I saw you guys sleeping together, you guys on the couch, you look so beautiful and perfect.
*  And I'm like, oh my fucking God, dude. And then he says, I thought about just, you know,
*  if you guys would have mind if I just touched you a little bit. And I'm like, what the fuck? And,
*  you know, we've once again, I froze. I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, cool. Yeah. So I'm, so I said,
*  yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna leave now. So we just fucking booked it. And then, um,
*  all of his neighbors were black. Like he lived like in a black neighborhood and like the houses
*  are on stilts because of the swamp land and whatever. And I don't know if he's done this
*  before, but as we ran out, like I heard like the kids laughing and they're like, oh, Tom,
*  they're trying to do it again. Or, and I'm like, oh fuck, like this isn't the first time. Like,
*  and, um, look, man, this is looking for hitchhikers. I've hitchhiked all over the world.
*  That was the only time. Right. And, and, and so I highly recommend that. But, um, yeah, what I was
*  saying about being invisible is a lot of times people will do this or say, Kate, come back,
*  go back to where you come from. Cause they're like, this fucker is not going to do anything.
*  And that's just not the way the world works. You know, like someone was explaining to me the other
*  day that no one ever wins a war. I go, what are you talking about? We come in, we blow shit up,
*  and then we take the, and it's like, if you look at Germany and Japan, right, it's two countries
*  that are very small. You look at a globe and you look at how small they are. These are two countries
*  that are very tiny that have tried to dominate every country around them. And Japan has started,
*  you know, they, Germany starts every world war. Right. And so you're like, oh, but we won those
*  wars, but we drive their cars. Now we drive Lexus, we drive, they won in the end. And then you think
*  of the soldiers that come home, the PTSD, the drug addiction, the homelessness. It's like,
*  look at our country now. It's like, did we win? Like you won, like on the charts, you look at the
*  numbers, we took this town, we did this, we did that. And when you fuck with people, when you hurt
*  someone, it stays with them forever. Like it stays with them for a long time, unless you have tools
*  and different things to like work through those things, which I've been working on a lot. But
*  yeah, being, oh, fuck, that's sort of racist that no one really thinks of me as a threat.
*  How can I turn that to an advantage? I'm going to travel the entire world. I'm going to train hop,
*  I'm going to hitchhike. Vice gave me like one of the first Vise shows was thumbs up. I, Gavin
*  McInnis, Shane Smith, those guys I used to, I've been writing and drawing. That's how I found out
*  about you. Really? Yeah. I found out about you from, well, from two places. One from Bourdain,
*  but two from a video that I watch of you going to the Congo looking for a dinosaur.
*  That was the first thing I ever saw of you. I think that's like, then I talked to Bourdain about
*  you and he was like, you got to talk to this guy. And when I saw your show, I was like, look at this
*  dude. This is crazy. He's looking for a fucking brontosaurus in the middle of the Congo. In 1994,
*  I was living in Israel in a farm called Ramat HaKovesh and it was a kibbutz and to live on the
*  kibbutz, you have to work. And I was the illegal immigrant there. So I'm trying, I have no money.
*  So I'm making enough, working on the farm just to live on the farm. And at this point, I'm 18 years
*  old. I've been hitchhiking since I was 15 and I've seen the whole world. I've hitchhiked through
*  Europe. I've hitchhiked through the US back and forth. And I'm bored. This is in 19, I'm like,
*  what, you go to the Eiffel Tower, you take that same, like, what haven't we done yet? We've been,
*  it's all mapped out. We've been to everywhere. We've seen everything. We've done everything.
*  I have a heart of an explorer. I want to find new things, you know? And so I'm living on this
*  kibbutz. Most of the other people there are from Australia and South Africa. And what I love about
*  them is they're so racist that they don't even know they're racist. Like I'm the only Asian guy
*  there and they're like, Nintendo, Sega Genesis. Like I'm like, I got a name. And they're like,
*  no, your name's Nintendo. I'm like, okay. And so I'm working illegally in a casino,
*  illegally at a wedding catering place, and then working on this farm. So I have three jobs I'm
*  making like, you know, under the table. And there's a library on the farm of books that have been
*  left behind by past travelers. And of course, there's an old, from the 70s or 80s, a National
*  Geographic catalog. And I start reading about Mokale Mbembe. I don't know if that's how you
*  say it, but it's scientists, National Geographic people have spotted this fucking brontosaur-like
*  thing in the Congo. And it's still there. And the Congo is still, it's the heart of darkness.
*  I gotta fucking find this thing. I gotta go there. Like I was-
*  How old were you at the time?
*  I was 18.
*  You decided you were gonna go there?
*  I was like, I have to go there.
*  How old were you when you went?
*  The 18 years old.
*  No, no. And then Vice, I'll bring it back to how that turned into Vice. But
*  so I get on a plane, tons of lying and manipulating to get the visa because it was
*  open to tourism. It was only open to business. And so I make up this story that I'm a bodyguard
*  to a toothpaste executive. And I work day and night to get a ticket to the Congo. And there's
*  no tickets. It's this airline aeroflot. And I'm in Israel, which is close to Africa, but because
*  it's this Russian airline, I get on this flight. It goes to Moscow and then Malta and then like
*  six other African countries. And then it lands in Brazzaville.
*  How long?
*  Like three days almost like like and like a shaky airplane, you know, and, you know, everyone in
*  there is the ones that got to get out. Right. So when they're coming back, they're bringing
*  chickens and goats and all kinds of shit on the plane and it smells like shit. And I don't know,
*  this is pre internet, right? I don't have any information on the Congo except for I heard that
*  there's a dinosaur there. What year? 94. 94, 94. I lost track of time, but it was right after high
*  school. So 18, 19. So you don't have a cell phone either? No cell phone, nothing. And the second I
*  get off the plane, it smells horrible because they're just burning trash everywhere and it's
*  hot and it's oppressive. And I go, what the fuck am I doing here? Like, why am I here? And everyone
*  there asked me, what are you doing here? They don't speak English. They speak French. I didn't know
*  that they're in the middle of a civil war. I think the two factions were called the ninjas
*  and the cobras, like little kids shooting at night. Every third bullet is like a tracer bullet.
*  So it looks like fireworks. I go, what is that? And they're like, oh, they're just shooting into
*  the air. First breakout of Ebola, malaria. And people go, why did you do that? It's not normal
*  behavior. And I go, the LA riots happened in 1992. I watched normal civilization, normal civilized
*  manners. You know, this is how people are. You go to a store, I saw that crumble overnight. In one
*  night it went from fuck you, everything let's burn down, let's rob, pillage, steal, everything. I go,
*  oh, it could happen that fast? And once again, that same kind of, oh, I think I'm accepted in
*  this country. I think people like me for me. And it's like, no, we don't want you. Get the fuck,
*  go back to where you come from. So I think, you know, and I could go on and on about all the
*  traumas I've experienced in my life, but I heard people, heard people. I was in a lot of pain. I
*  was like, I didn't like Korean people. I didn't like myself. I didn't like, I'd experienced a lot
*  of, a lot of abuse from black people. And I just wanted to, I didn't know anything. There was no
*  internet. I didn't like, I felt like an alien. I'm like, I don't belong anywhere. I just, so I would
*  go, everyone goes, don't go to Bosnia. Don't go to the Congo. Don't go to the Gaza Strip. And I'm
*  going to go every fucking place. My life has been very reactionary, right? My life has been like,
*  you don't tell me what to do. You don't tell me how to podcast. I'm going to stick a butt plug in
*  I'm going to do what, you know, so I'm in the Congo and
*  it's in a full blown war. There's people being, and everyone's like, who are you? Who is this
*  blonde Asian here? Like I had my hair dyed then too. And they, and so I could go and tell a million
*  stories about the Congo, but at some point, why you were looking for this brontosaurus for real,
*  or you just wanted to go to the Congo as well? I know the kids like to say 100%.
*  I've heard you say it too. Yeah. Why not 99% just to leave 1% for now? 99% I was there for
*  the dinosaur. Like, like I was so young and dumb and stupid and ignorant where I truly,
*  truly thought I was going to find it. Like I didn't know enough about like,
*  the everything made sense to me because
*  anyone listening to this right now, we're talking about a story from 20 years ago, right? Right.
*  I was a stupid kid. I believed in Santa Claus very late, you know, like I was a bedwetter.
*  I'm fucked up, man. So when I finally did get to the jungle, I got out of Brazzaville, I got up and
*  I got to this jungle area called Waiso. Then I believed because the spiders are this big
*  and the frogs are this big and how big are the frogs? Just everything is looks insane. The snakes,
*  they got snakes out here this big. Like, it was like, okay, now I believe like every year,
*  scientists were finding a new species of something that they thought was gone. And I'm like, okay,
*  and then I meet the pygmies. And that was, fuck, I don't know what version of the story I should
*  tell because it gets so dark. I met a German guy named, fuck, I shouldn't say his name. I met a
*  German guy there who was the same age as me. And he could, this is in the city. And then he could
*  tell that I was lost. I didn't know who this guy was. He was being groomed to be like the next
*  big politician in Frankfurt or something. And so I didn't get this until later. But he was here
*  as his like sex vacation to fuck as many black, he liked black women. So he's going to fuck as many,
*  curb your language Dave, to have as many intimate relations with women as possible. Is that better?
*  No. I'm trying to be better for myself. That's what I'm trying to do. The other way was better.
*  You're explaining what it was. It's not a bad thing. That's what he was doing. So I figure out,
*  so he sees me as another young guy. It's not a bad thing to explain things accurately, you know.
*  You could use other words though. Yeah, but that's what it is, right? It is what it is. But I,
*  I can, I can come off, I can turn people off when I use that language. I want, who are these people?
*  People that don't like you? No, no, they're people that they want. Dave, no swear, Dave.
*  I came here for G rated Dave and I want my money back. I'm not trying to be G rated,
*  I'm just trying to... PG-13 Dave, that's what I was signing up for. Occasionally the word shit.
*  PG-13 they have like rules, right? Like two shits. 99%. Okay, so I'm with... You thought that there
*  was a real dinosaur in there and when you got there and you saw all the big frogs and the big
*  snakes, you're like, maybe it is. Yeah, maybe it is. And what happens is we go to the last spotting
*  of it, right? And then I meet... Is there any evidence at all? Like... Everyone I talk to,
*  oh yeah, yeah, we've seen it. Like there's no like, no, that's crazy. Every fucking person I meet is
*  like, oh yeah, it's in the last... Is it one of those things where realistically there's not a
*  whole lot of people looking for it anyway? No, but there are scientists that go out there
*  and in the meantime, I've never seen anyone murdered before until I got here, right? I've
*  been through the LA riots, I've seen things broken and burned down and guns pointed, but I've never
*  seen anyone hung, I've never seen anyone stoned to death and it's absolute chaos. I'm seeing people
*  murdered, I'm scared for my life, I got attacked one time. So I go, I need to find... Now I have to
*  find this dinosaur and I also know that there's a chance that I might never go home again. So I
*  write a letter to my parents, they don't know where I am, they think I'm in Israel on this farm,
*  like I didn't tell anybody. So I wrote my parents this long letter of, I love you guys,
*  I'm about to embark on a journey to find a dinosaur and I sent it at the airport before
*  I got on the plane to the jungle. I have no money, I have only one change of clothes, I have fucking
*  blonde hair and I go into the jungle and we get lost immediately. I'm a fucking city boy, what the
*  hell do I know about the jungle? What do I know about the jungle? Did you have any direction?
*  Nothing, I just knew what... You know what? When I landed in the jungle, there was a guy
*  that I think I want to say his name is Chris, that was a Peace Corps guy and he was there to help
*  build welds in this Bantu village and he said, the place which you guys are looking for, it's like
*  it's a, you're not going to find a dime, he was like the reasonable one and I go, how do I know if
*  you don't try? I still believed, I still wanted to believe. I was willing to risk my life for it.
*  So we get, I haven't fucking told the story in so long, so we get to the jungle and we start walking,
*  there's a minor trail and then it disappears, it's just gone and I'm like, we're fucking lost in the
*  jungle. We're lost in the jungle. So I'm with this guy that, what we told people, he was here to fuck
*  as many women as possible, but we went with the story of he is the toothpaste executive and I'm
*  his bodyguard. That's a fake bullshit story. As we're lost in the jungle, he starts to think that
*  story is real. Hey, go fetch me a pineapple. I go, dude, I'm not your, he's like, you're not a real
*  executive, bro. I'm not going to get, and he starts telling me, I'm like, hey, you know that
*  was a fake story, right? He's like, and there's no one around. So we get lost for days and he starts
*  to really be humiliating towards me and right on my nerves and we had rations. We went in with some
*  crackers and some tuna in a can thing and I go, hey man, we're fucking lost. I don't know how to
*  survive. We need to ration this food out. I come, he ate it all. He ate it all.
*  And now, have you ever been in that kind of situation where you're like, I'm going to die
*  here? I'm never going to, hope is gone. I'm in a thick, thick Congolese jungle. I don't know how
*  to get out and we've been lost for days. I don't know how to survive. I don't fucking know how to,
*  this is it. And on top of it, I have this fucking German asshole who's talking down to me,
*  making fun of me and eating my fucking rations. I would pump all the fucking water and put the
*  water purification tablets and be like, thanks. And I'm like, dude, what the fuck, man? I did all
*  that work so we could share it. And so he was just, he was a dick. And so, man, and you're stuck in
*  the jungle like that before? No, dude. So we set up a tent, we have one tent and so we're,
*  we're in close quarters with each other. At night, the moon is like this fucking big,
*  like it's humongous and you hear the entire jungle come alive. Like fucking monkeys and like things
*  are bumping into the tent at night, like huge insects and like, and I'm like, I'm, I'm like,
*  I'm gonna die here. I'm gonna die here. So the few times in my life where I've been in this kind of
*  hopeless situation, the only thing that's going to get me out of it is if I can control my mind.
*  Because if I, because I'm falling, I'm like falling into despair. And in the daytime,
*  I'm doing stand up to the trees. Because we're just walking in like circles. And I'm like,
*  hey, how are you guys doing all tonight? You know, you don't know where you are. I don't know where
*  I am. I'm talking to the vegetation. Oh my god. And this guy is riding my last nerve. And he's,
*  and so I could safely say I lost my mind. And so we're down to our last food. And he and he did
*  it again. And I said, bro, what the fuck did I tell you? We got to make this last. I'm starving.
*  You ate the rations that were supposed to. That was it. And he's like, whatever. And he's, he has
*  a more like dissociated, like checked out, like, like, we'll get out of here somehow.
*  And part of I don't know, his coping thing was to like talk down to me or whatever. And so that night,
*  and we're lost at this point, a week and a half, maybe we haven't, you know, I'm fucking 90 pounds,
*  I've lost all this weight. I'm gonna kill this guy. I'm gonna murder him. I'm gonna fucking murder
*  him because I don't like people talking shit to me like that. I don't like I've been a punching bag
*  for this guy for for weeks now. And I'm just gonna fucking kill him. And if I have to eat him to
*  survive, I guess I'll do that. And so he's out cold. He's got fucking crumbs on his face, tuna,
*  fucking juice from the food that was supposed to be shared. And I pick up I go outside the tent and
*  I pick up I pick up a huge rock like bigger than this. And I go, I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.
*  I have officially lost my mind. Like I can't, I'm barely gonna survive. I can't do it here with this
*  guy. So he's out as fucking looking at his face. And I pick up the rock and I go,
*  just like I don't even have to apply any pressure. If I just drop it, he's done. Like he'll be fucking
*  dead. And I go, fuck, is there anything left? Is there any common sense? Is there any light left in
*  my? I gotta fucking kill this guy. He has to go. He has he has he has to die. He has to die.
*  He has to fucking die. And then I just I didn't do it. I'm not a murderer. I can't like,
*  in the mind. I'll do it. I'll do I'll do what murder Dave come to the front. No one's ever
*  gonna know. He does his family doesn't know he's there. Your family. Nobody knows who you are.
*  This guy Chris, the Peace Corps guy, he's not gonna fucking say anything. You can kill him right now.
*  He has a ton of cash that he hasn't been sharing with you. You can get out of here.
*  You can fucking get some of your pride and your ego back. Those fucking guys treating you like a
*  fucking like like a Chinese waiter or something. Do it. No one will ever know. No one will ever
*  fucking find out you were you're probably gonna die too. You want to die like fucking catering
*  to this guy? Just do it. And I'm sitting I don't I don't want to I don't I'm not a murderer and
*  I didn't kill him. I woke up the next day and I'm just looking at him like motherfucker you don't
*  even know you don't even know what almost happened last night. We're walking around.
*  Hey what's that? There's a fucking pygmy up one of those 200 100 foot trees. He's just sitting
*  there chilling. I go what is that? Is that a person? 200 feet above you. Huge tree like just
*  I don't know. That's so high. It's so high. It was so high. How did you spot him? He was he was like
*  moving. It was shaking a little. From the place he was to get in front of us was seconds.
*  Like hi. It's like this short. What's this jungle that was I mean when you when you're in there do
*  you even see sunlight through it or is it just? No it's so dense. I mean like yeah there's some
*  cracks but it's just this was also in the national geographic why that the dinosaur would be here is
*  because cameras can't see it because it's such a dense thick forest and there's things in there
*  that are like moving and you know. Dude your description sounds terrifying. It's terrifying.
*  You're trying to sleep in the tent. Oh my god dude I'm freaking out over here. So the the the guy
*  comes up he's this short he's like tiny he's like you guys want some honey? What? Oh my god. And
*  this is this is where my skill as an artist has gotten me out of so many situations right because
*  if you're in if you're in jail and you have any kind of skills singing dancing telling jokes
*  drawing you're a celebrity. So this guy doesn't speak English. We don't speak whatever language
*  he speaks. So I start drawing stuff like food like you know in the dirt and he's like oh yeah I got
*  you. And he and he and he goes and he brings us some meat that's all charred and I'm like
*  I don't know what that is you know. And and I took one bite and it tastes horrible and I'm like I'm
*  gonna starve to death but I can't eat that. Wow. And so it was like a movie he's like come on come
*  on we're walking and you know it's us like stumbling machete trying to he's just like like
*  we get around a corner entire village of pygmies they've never fucking seen an Asian person before
*  I'm C3PO and they're the Ewoks from Blonde they're coming they're touching my face they're like
*  yeah look at like he's like I don't know what the fuck they're saying like
*  the kids keep doing this thing like uh I go what are you saying?
*  What are you saying? There was one older older guy in the village that I guess spoke a tiny bit of
*  uh uh French so my the German guy can translate he's like they're saying you come from the stars
*  oh my god you're coming from the stars and I'm like oh my god that's heavy so I'm like
*  so I'm like we're saved they bring us some honey they bring us some fruit and I'm like oh god I'm
*  like just devouring it they're laughing at us and you know it's like the national geographic the
*  women's tits are like down to their ankles and um this fucking guy he's an alien he's an alien
*  I told you 1995 I was uh I was 19 years old yeah 19 years old yeah and and they put that um they
*  put their clothes on for the picture they were all naked when I got in there so um look at my teevas
*  that's amazing that picture is amazing so I um now had any of these people seen it did you ever
*  describe it to them oh yeah so I draw the dinosaur I go here's the dinosaur and what were they saying
*  they go oh yeah yeah yeah there's never like no it's always like okay there's the dinosaur
*  and uh they go let's go and I go they go it's it's through wetlands like this
*  there's going to be leeches like uh there's a disease called bilharzia where uh there's like
*  uh snails under like still moving waters and the second a mammal steps in the water little
*  fucking parasites shoot off the snail like uh like heat seeking missiles and they go in your dick hole
*  and then you piss and shit blood till you die and I'm like okay I'm done like I tap out like
*  so they're explaining like all the the trek and the way to go find this dinosaur and I'm like
*  I went I went up until the leeches and then when I came out with the leeches I go all right
*  like this this is it you know I go can you help us get out of the jungle and they're like it took
*  less than a day that's how close we were to like really yeah we were probably fucking walking in
*  circles so we get out in less than a day I get I get back home I'm 19 years old I start writing
*  for uh for vice I start drawing pictures for them I do comics I'm writing and uh oh no I was writing
*  for a magazine called giant robot and uh Gavin and Shane would read that magazine they're like
*  they were ahead of the curve right like when all print magazine right existed they were like
*  we need to go to digital like like they were you know vice has always been free everyone fiends it
*  they go to those magazine shops or wherever and yeah and they're like we need to have online
*  presence the internet was brand new and they said Dave that is the fucking and I told you
*  not the pg-13 but that story gets very dark darker than what I said and they go will you go back
*  with a camera and a camera crew and I said that was one of the most traumatic
*  I almost died I saw people murdered there was a fucking virus where people were bleeding out of
*  their eyeballs no okay I'll go enough time had passed it was 10 years later actually it wasn't
*  it was that was uh 95 and then it was like eight or 10 years later and um so that was the one that
*  vice filmed they're like can you go back photo for the mickey mouse shirt that was that was from
*  when I went with the film like just my camera so I go back and um how did we even get to this
*  talk to the dinosaur the dinosaur they all see the same dinosaur have you have you shit look at that
*  there it is mocha look dude you're fucking on fire Jamie holy fuck yeah that one number three
*  number three is bonkers what is that unless it's a log could be a log so I on my on my second
*  trip back I met the doctor there was a doctor that lived in the village close to that river
*  look at the track and he said he'd seen it really and he's like not uh you know I wonder if any like
*  real legitimate biologists have looked at those tracks maybe they could tell you by the way the
*  footprint like they can kind of tell whether things are fake or real not based on like how
*  where the weight is distributed like someone who really understands some how these animals would
*  would walk I think it would be really hard to fake dinosaur footprints right because the weight it
*  would have to have like it there the description I just read and I said it wasn't that big I
*  shouldn't say it's not big but it's like 30 feet 35 feet it's pretty big it's like a big big giant
*  elephant think about how big those fucking alligators were that we were just talking
*  about yeah so it might be a turtle they were seeing that's what I don't know what they actually
*  found a turtle through here their dicks were so big like when we went to the river to bathe
*  they were like okay they just take their clothes off and I'm like oh I'm gonna keep my clothes on
*  and I go they go I go dude I have like a normal penis for like I'm proportioned correctly like
*  your shit is down to your knees and this was back in the city when I got back to Brazzaville
*  and they're like bro you know why our dicks are so big I'm like why and there's all these
*  naked kids running around like because we never wear underwear I'm like what like see the girl
*  whose tits are down to their stomach never wear a bra it's gravity bro everything just droops
*  I'm like that's why your dicks are so big I'm like I'm still gonna leave my underwear on like this
*  takes too much time wait you've never you've never been to Africa no never been to dude
*  dude I'm begging you I know you're into the hunting and the bow hunting please like
*  so when I texted you like I have to do with anything Africa man hunting in Africa you mean
*  so when I texted you the other day I saw that the last time I texted you was 2018 I was like dude
*  I'm going to Africa I'll see you when I get back that's right yeah and um okay this is the this is
*  yes yeah please please very heavy so there's a there's hunter gather tribes in like the
*  arctic Papua New Guinea the Amazon Africa but very few like they're almost gone there's very
*  very few people that live off the land and I just whenever the podcast went off the air and I and I
*  ghosted I just lost my mind I hit my rock bottom and very similar pattern of what I always do when
*  things get rough is I just go to Africa I go it's a weird thing to be like rich or be in a country
*  that's rich or have stuff and some as an adult someone has to teach you gratitude like I hear
*  you say it all the time I'm thankful I'm thankful I'm grateful I go but I'm not I have everything and
*  yet I fucking complain like crazy I'm like I need to go I need to get the fuck out of here I need
*  to go someplace where where I can I can learn humility I can learn to be grateful so I get to
*  I'm traumatized now by the Congo I didn't go into my second Congo story when I went with vice that
*  was even crazier with the fucking chief try to kill us but um so Congo is the heart of darkness
*  I get why those books are written I get why people have these mind-losing experiences out there
*  because it is one of the fucking darkest countries I've ever been so I don't want to
*  go somewhere different this time do you know the European settlers they tried to live in the Congo
*  for a while I met one did you see the houses that they left behind dude when I got to this Bantu
*  village and uh Chuck his name was Chuck Chuck if you're listening I know it's 20 years ago
*  long blonde hair from Oregon Peace Corps guy he got uh malaria while we were there and he goes
*  please contact Francois and I go who the fuck is Francois and he goes he's he's in the jungle
*  and this is this isn't in the Congo village is the Bantu village and he goes you go down this tree
*  and you go so it's he's deep in the in the but this is still near a village it's not you know
*  so we go into the in the jungle and there's like a giant Victorian French like European house in
*  the middle of the fucking jungle and I'm like how did this happen and he's like so we go in there
*  and uh Francois is just like like uh some fucking weird French dude that just said I'm going to
*  stay here he had like 12 Bantu wives there's all these like half black half white babies crawling
*  around and he has a ham radio and he's like what's going on I'm like Chuck is fucking dying can he
*  said to come contact you and he's like okay I'll contact the aircraft carrier and they'll send a
*  chopper in for him I was like oh shit but yeah that's that's the one time I saw a French Victorian
*  I don't even know how to describe the architecture it was like a beautiful French home in the middle
*  of the fucking Congo jungle yeah there was a website dedicated to uh those people that try to
*  do that and it just detailed how it all went terrible for them the jungle just overcame the
*  house like you can't keep the jungle back it's too powerful there's too much there the jungle
*  everything grows so quickly it's just fucking I mean you'd have grass popping out through the
*  middle of your floorboards and shit trees trying to grow through the side of your sewage system
*  like they're just it's just too much it's wild when my life when you just said too much like
*  I just thought right now every time in my my hit a rock bottom in my life gets too much
*  I go back to Africa so when someone says go back to where you come from maybe it's Africa
*  well we all do right we all do so I look at Tanzania on the map and it's pretty close to
*  the Congo and I'm like fuck am I ready for that and I heard from so many people how nice the
*  Tanzanian so I went life-changing experience I meet I meet the Hadza who you got to understand
*  this is how humans have been living for two million years and the Hadza have been in this area for
*  50 000 years and and uh I go same thing they're like who are you know are you tourists I go
*  can I just like live with you guys for a little bit they're like they're so nice they're so
*  welcoming they don't even um they don't even have like the words for like violence and hate and you
*  know they're very present and um I go I my life is falling apart like I I'm I'm mentally ill
*  I'm bipolar I'm manic depressive I'm addicted to fucking everything my disease is a disease of
*  more I need more there's a bottomless pit I can never fill I just need to like run away that's
*  that's my action my my my action response to everything my whole life is to run away so I'm
*  in Africa no one's gonna fucking find me here and I'm living with this tribe the Hadza and they go
*  so I say living but it's not really living because they're living in a cave they're hunting they're
*  gathering I stayed there for a week doing the fake living I am in a tent I have a gen like these guys
*  are carrying all this shit for me my water like truckloads of water and in that time I saw in one
*  week how much trash I live leave behind like I don't see it here because it goes in the bin the
*  trash man comes in one week these guys leave zero carbon footprint they come to a place they're
*  nomadic they set up the shop they hunt they live and then they go to the next place I left a mountain
*  of bottles toilet paper cliff bar wrapper you know that's what all is eating there and I go this is
*  sad one human being left a mountain of trash and I go what do we do and they're like we burn it we
*  burn trash and I was like whoa environment and uh they go do you want to do you want to really live
*  with us because one week in any kind of situation like that is it's just withdrawal right I mean
*  I'm in internet withdrawal phone withdrawal friend like just comforts of of normal like western society
*  and I go fuck it fuck the tent the gender I'm gonna live with you guys I'm just gonna fuck you know
*  so I'm in my fucking underwear and I'm living on top of a rock in this cave and the oldest guy in
*  the village is you know when he starts talking it's like uh I'm in like lion king or he's like when
*  I was young and all you know I have a translator with me he's translating hadzabe to swahili to
*  English he's like elephants lions hippos like everywhere and like it was like a buffet we just
*  wake up we could kill anything and in my lifetime that has been gone it's gone it's like there's very
*  few animals left to hunt and the ones that are like they're endangered you can't kill them
*  so life there is very very hard and they go you want to hunt with us and I'm like dude look at
*  my body do I look like and um there was like a Catholic uh priest that set up a mission in that
*  area and he's been I met him he's been trying to convert the hadza to Catholic Catholicism for
*  20 years and he's like they use the the bible pages to smoke weed
*  so what do they hunt with bow and arrow like homemade bone homemade bow and arrow like like just
*  they they take this wood and they spent all day making the arrows yep they use their teeth show
*  you yeah I learned how to make it and then I they use their teeth to I think I know that guy
*  that might be Rasooli um and then they um there's a plant that they um they harvest and they they
*  do all the stuff to it and then that's the poison that they put on the tip of the arrow
*  and these guys yep there it is how crazy it is to think that this is how people hunted dude I live
*  longest time dude I live state of the art I lived like this for fucking months man it was like
*  so you did this as well dude so first first day of the hunt they're like do they teach you how to
*  shoot a bow first dude my bow shooting is so off and um yeah so we practice had you had shot a bow
*  in the past I've never shot a bow in my life there's one of these one of these guys see see
*  it it almost looks like a toy like you think it wouldn't work there's one guy in the village
*  shawnee that's so strong that he could shoot the arrow through the fucking kudu it was up
*  and I was like you're fucking a super back muscles in that mother oh my god they're
*  fucking ripped dude my god that guy is jacked they're ripped they have six so they have really
*  these are very strong bows so just pulling them back is probably tremendous like back muscle
*  everyone knows how to hunt the kids know how to hunt the what they using for the feathers at the
*  end of I know the one that's which guy no down yeah that guy yep I stayed with that guy whoa
*  really yeah he's older now see the cuts on his face yeah I have that they cut my face
*  yeah I asked them to because I like pain for real but but look at that guy doesn't it's almost
*  gone now this was a damn dude but don't don't they look like super models like they're like
*  really powerful yeah I'm like just and also you got to think of the amount of effort they're
*  let's say they're doing crossfit classes every day right I mean think about just getting by as
*  a hunter-gatherer with their crazy bow that you have to pull back and you're running through the
*  woods all the time like you have to be fit it's it's unbelievable what a crazy way to live
*  yeah look at that I mean what's what are you using for the feathers for the fletchings do you know
*  dude these motherfuckers are so in tune with nature that they'll go they'll make a bird sound and a
*  they're talking to the bird and the bird will show you where the honey is what like and then
*  there's a pack of 50 dogs following us and the dogs aren't pets they're hunting tools
*  right so the dogs are the first line of the defense they sniff it out and I'm like this is
*  this is mental right it's like oh like I'm on a fucking insane experience right now never did
*  I thought I would just wait why why am I going home so if I walk with one of the kids
*  it's a clicking language it's like like that kind of language did you learn any of it tiny bit
*  and I did of course I did a podcast where I speak
*  imagine if they take that out of context it turns out you're saying some really fucked up shit
*  I try you got to be careful right if you're making up a language like you might accidentally hit on
*  some real shit there I tried I tried just say one or two forbidden words so if I walk with
*  one of the kids and it's like him giving me a tour of his house like oh come to Joe's warehouse and
*  he's showing me right he's like grabbing a snake biting his head off he's like oh my god you want
*  some thing climbing a tree with he just grabbed a snake just grabbed off he takes out a slingshot
*  the rock a pebble this big bam hits a fucking bush baby out of the tree breaks his leg breaks
*  puts it here it's like snack for later everything is talking there it's like it looks like they're
*  just goofing off and playing but they're they have like must they have some what do you call it
*  microbes and gut biome kind of things in their stomach that no one else on the planet has
*  so the translator is explaining to me Canadian like scientists come and literally steal their shit
*  they find them and they steal their shit and I'm like their actual poop their actual poop
*  because there's biomes in there that don't exist anywhere secret to a healthier
*  hidden in the Hadza diet
*  I if you google steal African shit I bet you it'll come up see look there it is so this
*  see the bees on his fucking head they're lighting him up and he's eating the honey and it does
*  nothing to him really so we go climb hey come on climb the tree guy sticks his fucking hand in the
*  tree scoops that out starts eating it like it's a fucking hamburger bees and I'm like bro I'm cool
*  no no no come on come on like we've been doing that's a kid doing this right the kids I go in
*  one sting my fucking hand inflates to like a Mickey Mouse like it's giant I'm like you've been
*  getting stung since you were a kid so you're like immune to it and they're just doesn't bother them
*  it doesn't bother them they're fine with it and their body has also gotten immune to it
*  right that's crazy they're biting that honeycomb like it's a snack and all those bees were on his
*  head his hands and the thing you never see in all the national geographics and all the nature
*  documentaries is that it's always serious and here's the hon hod's a warrior and here's you
*  know whatever nature these guys crack you know they're like do you want to do you want to come
*  with us tomorrow like none of you're eating cliff bars and hanging back like you want to I'm like
*  yeah I'm in okay we leave at first you know the second how are they saying this all to you I have
*  the translator with me okay okay he he like works with them and the you know it's like worst case
*  scenario when they don't do food this is the sad part they do the fake show for the tourists like
*  the tourists come in usually European and then they put on the fake it's not fake it's real but
*  they dress up and do like dances and stuff and they give them money so I wake up at you know five
*  five thirty first noise and then laughter I'm like are these fuckers doing fart jokes at five in the
*  morning and that's the thing that people don't realize is when you don't have tv internet
*  entertainment and you're just with your family and your homies all day you're bored as fuck so they
*  joke morning till night like I don't know what they're saying laughter laughter someone cuts a
*  fart joke and I'm like all right let's go so you saw the pictures they're ripped back muscles six
*  packs the kids have six packs I was very out of shape I'm still out of shape but I was the most
*  out of shape and think about waking up at 5 30 in the morning and the thing that's the the final
*  animal that's like kind of left is baboons they call they almost call them in that part of Africa
*  like the baboon men because that's what they eat tastes horrible to me baboons look human
*  so we're in a cave men sleeping on the top men women on the bottom we wake up there's another cave
*  and you see oh there's people in that cave no they're baboons and they're pointing at us
*  they're pointing they're like look they're coming so I'm like this shit is crazy we're
*  hunting baboons they're like there's tons of meat on them we're gonna it's enough to feed our family
*  think about like running again I was pretty fast in high school I could do the 50 pretty quick
*  I can't run at top speed for hours and I and I got these I'm drinking water and in this environment
*  it's an advantage to have black skin because it's cooling these guys aren't sweating I'm like what's
*  going on we've been running for five hours you guys aren't sweating what the fuck and they don't
*  get tired and then they'll just start digging a hole and drink like like a handful of brown water
*  and that's enough for them and I'm like dude what the fuck like I and they're telling the translator
*  this motherfucker looks like he's never caught anything in his life and he's like he hasn't
*  and to me I'm an alien right they go he he gets his food from supermarkets what's that
*  they hunt the food for him they cut it up and package it and sell it like they don't believe it
*  right the shit I tell them they're like hey you guys you look like a fucking supermodel can I bring
*  you to America and do a fashion thing and get you guys paid and why would we want to go to America
*  well tell me what you know about America isn't that the place where people jump off
*  buildings to kill themselves like that concept is so foreign that when someone explains suicide
*  to them I was like oh my god they don't and in the time that I'm there like I said that first
*  week is withdrawal I'm like fuck where's my phone and then all of it goes away right I'm not thinking
*  about any of my addictions I'm not thinking about like I feel peace I'm not I'm not miserable my
*  depression goes away and I go morning till night you wake up you hunt for food you get home
*  celebration everyone's happy that the men brought the food back the women you know gathered the
*  berries we have a big dinner celebration because every meal you got to be grateful for dance party
*  by the fire and you're out a couple fart jokes and you're out repeat the next day there's no time
*  to be like bored and sad and upset and worried about some bullshit and so I'm trying to keep up
*  with these guys you know they're they're running at top speed like say this is um say these are the
*  baboons on top of the they're doing a perimeter they're doing okay we're going to come up all the
*  sides and the and the and the dogs are on the forefront right they're running faster there's a
*  guy named Ale'ala'ane he's got some dreads he's uh he's the the villi- the tribe we spothead
*  he's got the bible he's rolling joints for everyone he's about 50 feet behind you know he's
*  running at like a he's not doing this he's like he's got I'm maybe like two three hundred feet
*  behind this guy so they're they're trying to like you know come on so he's running and rolling
*  joints he's running rolling joints and and you had you done any running before this
*  not really man I'm a sprinter I don't I can't I don't have endurance you're doing this for
*  oh my god I almost blacked out how many miles you think you were running dude because they're
*  they're like going back and forth we're like I'm like dude I'm just gonna chill here they just run
*  everywhere run everywhere just running and you know they don't some of them have shoes like they
*  make homemade shoes but some of them don't so that it's just barefoot and I'm they're run it's
*  the it's the dry bush right so there's like plants that have like thorns and like it looks like this
*  on them just like that white scratch to me I'm getting cut open I'm like bleeding everywhere
*  their skin's tough and they're just fucking they're just clowning me to it they're clowning me they're
*  like bro how did you ever survive and I'm like I'm like come on come on guys I put a GoPro on the
*  dog so I go back and I watch it the baboon is like a human like it's talking get the fuck away from
*  me the fuck away the baboons running the dog he's like fuck you they hunt him with dogs he gets hit
*  right here he's bleeding so he's leaving a trail of blood that fucking hypes up the tribe let's go
*  we got him he's hit the dog gets his nut sack rips his fucking dick off I'm running the guy holds up
*  his nuts he's like look we got the nuts and I'm like why you show me that he's like he's we're
*  getting close they finally fucking hit the guy like sort of here and and you're saying the guy too
*  you're not just saying the baboon you're saying it hit the guy it looks human man yeah it does
*  right it looks real close he backs into a tree like a dog human though yeah and and all the dogs
*  the dogs are dope I love these dogs so much they're all hunting dogs so they all have scars and
*  fucking tails missing like because the baboons have fangs yeah they pick the dogs up and they
*  rip a chunk off oh my god and these dogs are so hardcore that there's a dog that had one leg
*  missing there's a dog that you could see his ribs and they're still down to hunt oh my god like
*  they're in the back with me but they're still like I want to show value that you know because I
*  talked I interviewed each person in the tribe and I said what is the happiest day of your life
*  and they all had the same answer the day that I hunted the biggest animal and I got to feed
*  everyone and I was the hero and so I'm all baboons for how long how long have they been
*  only hunting baboons I mean it's been for a few years now I mean they'll hunt anything they'll
*  kill anything and they'll eat there's nothing left but baboons just recently it's getting to
*  just that and even even then because this day that that day that I was on the first hunt because
*  there was many days we hunted where we didn't catch anything and that's like super downer for them
*  but this is my first hunt I had the gopro the guy's shot he backs into a tree like his last stand
*  and the dogs just start ripping his guts out and start fucking you know and I'm watching this and
*  he's like and it's like he's going fuck you fuck you and he's just like he's like picking dogs up
*  throwing them oh my god and just come up and they go right in his chest he's dead this is all on
*  gopro I wasn't even close I was like I was like wait up guys fuck they tie the the foot and the
*  leg and they make a backpack that's how they carry it so they caught four that day so they bring it
*  back to the village I don't know if you saw in that picture I brought my top ramen with me
*  so I was like they don't waste a part of this thing the person that killed it gets to eat the
*  dick in the balls they eat the head they eat the brains they turn the fur into like jackets
*  and they just they eat the brains dude so at night I thought I thought dinner time was over
*  think about it how much protein and nutrition is in the brain right and it's the final thing right
*  they stew the head that's in that pot and so the brain gets cooked and then it's like a delicacy
*  at the end they like tap a hole in and it's you know they have black skin like I remember like
*  it was fire it was in the cave it's nighttime and I hear I just hear eating and I turn my my
*  flashlight on and I see like the whole tribe just chowing the brains at the end they're like this
*  is our favorite part and save it for the end yeah and they're just like and then so it's all
*  those white brains like streaked on their face and I'm like yo you want to get in on this give me
*  some of that brain so I had some brain and you're really I eat everything I mean it's there it is
*  oh my doesn't that look like a person that's so intense so once the fur is but not on the screen
*  no yeah good once the the the fur look this is fucking like put it on screen or no look I
*  have some trouble this I'm just not going to for this okay well let me just say this if that's how
*  hardcore this picture is right you can find it yeah and find it easily look for like like you
*  want to talk up this is life or death this is you know I understand so when when but I'm saying
*  it is intense and there is a thing about primate brains right pre-ons pre-on diseases that you get
*  they find them in cannibals so there's something about eating a human so I'm smoking a week
*  humans eating human brains oh so they did get a bird there yeah so sometimes they get birds too
*  so I am but they're eating mostly baboons I ate I tasted it I wasn't eating it I'm like I have a
*  million cliff bars in my backpack I know that is so intense there's the dogs seeing that guy carry
*  a baboon on his back like the way you're describing it's so intense they got a some sort of an antelope
*  or something there and then they're drinking out of that water but they're smoking weed with the
*  bible there dude look at this fucking guy um so I'm I pass out there's nothing left in the gas
*  tank I pass out and the next day I'm like okay what like like I'm becoming a man they're like
*  did you eat the actual baboon meat as well I ate the baboon meat it's not for me it's and I eat
*  everything what it tastes like I've never eaten a human but I'm imagining that's what a human
*  would taste like it was just I don't know gamey that's the only it's it was just it was strong
*  but um well you gotta think of the physical strength of those animals
*  to how tough their meat and all the testosterone and everything is being released
*  it didn't taste good but they loved it they love the they're happy you know Steve Rinella no Steve
*  Rinella is the host of the tv show meat eater and he went to um I'm trying to remember where it was
*  somewhere in South America and they they ate monkeys there and he had some of it and he said
*  it was uh it's like they smoke it and then they cook it in like a stew and it's like smoked turkey
*  they did that to the head but yeah there he is there's um so they're eating this monkey in uh
*  they're chewing on it like that's that's intense man Bolivia that is fucking intense like seeing
*  someone chewing on a monkey leg is intense you know yeah there's just something about it where
*  it's like that's that's our cousins that's next level I mean there's something about it it's like
*  this is this is life life or death it's crazy how much we but we think that way about mammals in
*  general because if you get to deer like people are way sadder when they see a dead deer than they see
*  a dead fish there's something about like mammals right right like we don't give a fuck about a
*  dead turtle when they throw that thing on the fire and you see all the fur burn off and he's
*  like in the christ pose it looks like human so the next day I'm like all right I'm I'm getting
*  my endurance up and they're like we think you're more of a gatherer why don't you hang back today
*  like because they were like humoring me right and I was like okay okay and I brought all my
*  art supplies with me and the kids are like they use the beeswax and they make little sculptures
*  and they take little you know I'm like these kids are awesome so I fell in love with the kids
*  I'm like I'll adopt all of you I'll bring and they're like we have parents I was like all right
*  all right so I brought all these art supplies with me I got markers I got watercolor and you
*  know it's we're in the desert it's all brown so I mean not the desert we're in the bush everything's
*  brown and so I got all these bright blues and reds and the kids went nuts like when you give kids
*  art supplies like and I'm just watching them like this is fucking amazing and the day just went by
*  I just gave art lessons and like there's someone who's never seen art supplies that must be fucking
*  insane and I'm yeah and I'm asking them like what you know and they're drawing like the hunt
*  they're drawing because they've never seen tv they've never they don't have any of the visual
*  like stuff that we grew up on so everything is pure from that perspective and in my head I'm like
*  I cannot wait to get home and show this to people and maybe we can do prints and books and sell it
*  and help you guys and they go okay they show you know everyone comes back from the hunt they show
*  and they go we're on top of this this cliff the cave and they just throw it hey what the fuck you
*  guys doing man I was gonna you know in my head it's like come home frame it you know this is a
*  memory of my time there they're like oh nomadic you don't guys we were present we created it
*  we lived it we enjoyed it bye bye like what am I gonna walk around with a fucking canvas and paper
*  and I was like damn dude this shit is these people are next level and so it's a different world
*  well that's why I'm saying like I was like man now I got this experience I feel good I'm gonna go
*  home and I'm like why am I gonna go home like I'm fucking falling in love with these people
*  they're showing me how fucked up I am and like what I and so I just stayed there I just stayed
*  there about how long stayed there for a few months I bought a huge piece of land I work with um if
*  anyone that's listening right now is interested it's uh hadza h-a-d-z-a dot org and you can you can
*  if you want to like sponsor a kid or you want to see how they live and because it's this is it this
*  is the end for them like it might already be the end like I don't know if anyone listening has
*  Tanzania contacts like this way of life is pretty much over like in there's less than a thousand
*  hadza left yeah these are the guys I stayed with they're fucking amazing um and and uh
*  dude will you come yes what do you go to Africa is that what you're saying yeah I thought you meant
*  come to like the movie premiere um dude please please I your your daughters your wife will fucking
*  love it like you don't and here's the thing we could set it up where you don't have to like I
*  gave you like the fucking heart malaria tour yeah you take malaria pills you're not going to get
*  malaria and you can't do that for kids though you couldn't malaria medications so I met I met a
*  Spanish uh German couple there that has like a nice kind of bed and breakfast kind of thing like
*  not in the that area but a little bit away and the guy raises his kid like at nice private schools
*  in Germany and then in on the summer times he comes and the kids in their underwear run around
*  and they hunt with the Jesus and I'm like this is life-changing your fucking kids will look at
*  these yeah look at how look at they're all smiling having like the fucking time of their life
*  look at the dogs look at the dog yeah hadza.org how many baboons you think you ate while you were
*  there I'm telling I'm being honest with you I just tasted a little bit and then I go into my my my
*  little cubby hole and eat my my cliff bars so you only ate their meals look at that I painted the
*  oh my god you're seeing them biting a chunk off the baboons head oh Jesus dude
*  I mean it's it's it's crazy to think that that's like the cure to like future medicines and shit
*  might be in these guys's shit and then they're gonna be crazy dude it's fucking insane like
*  we met those scientists that are collecting that data out there
*  fuck I can't remember her name well obviously neither one of us is a biologist but if you think
*  about it yeah if you're living like in a completely a natural way in the middle of
*  I mean what a crazy biosphere there's so much life there yeah there's so much so much life there
*  you gotta imagine there's so much bacteria life too right and if you survived to 2020 like your
*  ancestors got you to 2020 living like that like you have to be robust so all those people that
*  do live there they're probably just a superior version any one of those guys could have been a
*  supermodel because when they take their shirt off they're fucking ripped and the guy shawty that I
*  said when he hits a kudu like the big with the arrow it goes all the way through and I'm like
*  the other one other guys in the tribe when they hit it it hits the animal dude they look like those
*  guys in the center that's insane they're fucking shredded they look like jiu-jitsu champs dude
*  they're fucking amazing they do those guys well you gotta think man I mean the the amount of
*  physical activity and exercise but they're probably their endurance is like never waning
*  running running doing it and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking with my western brain dude if I take
*  you back you guys are going to be the toast of the town's fashion models if if someone trains
*  your both thing like you could be in the olympics or you maybe could be a fucking baseball player
*  or well how about runners from there runners from parts there's one part of Africa in particular
*  that's responsible for a tremendous amount of long-distance runners and they had a radio lab
*  podcast about it and they said that it was because of their ability to endure pain that they had a
*  ritual when they were a coming-of-age ritual where they would circumcise the men like with a dull
*  knife and have them crawl naked through like thorns like they did they did some hardcore shit to these
*  guys when they were young to get them to just be able to endure pain in a way that most people
*  just incapable of they've developed a tolerance to pain because some of the rituals the episodes
*  called cut and run it's really crazy because this guy talks about it but he also says because he had
*  gone through it himself and he also said he doesn't want to do it to his son he wouldn't want his son
*  to do that it's like it's you don't have to do it it's too hard but that it makes sense man it does
*  make sense it does makes total sense just because i think i look i'm not a long-distance runner but
*  those people that are they say it's all about your mind right it's all about being able to endure the
*  pain right and some people can and some people can't and if you're a person who's grown up dealing
*  with pain it's a part of your culture you know you got to be hard as fuck to make it in the congo
*  hard as fuck to make it in tanzania you got to be hard as fuck those people like you got to think
*  of all of those different obstacles their ancestors have overcome to get them to 2020 living a nomadic
*  life in the jungle holy shit man i mean you can't be lazy you can't be slow you can't be stupid you
*  have to be able and you're taught to be able to maneuver in that world from the time you're a baby
*  joe you can't just read about it you've got to live it what is the fear like that you might get
*  a malaria or something i'm really high i took a bunch of hits that blunt during this podcast you
*  too jamie you fucker you're coming too jamie's not leaving this apartment you're crazy i'm gonna
*  i'll make it so it's the most the best we'll talk for your family and talk about it after the show
*  i'm gonna keep because dude like i love it when you bug me about things i say no to please keep
*  going i thought you like bow hunting man i'm not going over there if i did that i would only go
*  over there let's like you know just observe come to observe if i did if i went to hunt over there i
*  would do it because that's what i wanted to live off of i wanted to eat it like you can't i don't
*  think you bring it back no no we can't donate we would tribes we would eat it yeah trust me we
*  would eat it would get eaten everything there gets eaten yeah i talked to a dude once who shot an
*  elephant over there i was like whoa like why and then he said well first of all the reason why they
*  do it in the first place is because some of these elephants will make their way into towns and start
*  eating in the village and eating all their crops and so they want someone to come and shoot it and
*  i'm like oh man like that's a crazy argument like there's there's certain animals that i feel way
*  worse when they die and elephants there's something about elephants elephants are cute
*  that's it's they're not just cute man they're dinosaurs there's something majestic about
*  magic yeah they're fucking amazing they could crush you and they they're generally pretty cool
*  they're so cool strangers like regular tourists are allowed to climb on them in thailand and ride
*  them through the jungle you ever meet michael jackson the the singer yeah no so i got to meet
*  him close to before he died and i got to go to neverland ranch whoa the the mismanagement of
*  the animals there is like the they were already gone by the time i got there but where he used to
*  keep the elephants the bars are like this thick and the elephants were so like depressed and
*  and you know just from like they didn't have an actual zookeeper that knew how to handle them so
*  they would just keep them locked up and like not the elephants would fucking head bang the bars
*  these bars are like this thick and they'd be bent like this oh my god i'm like man these fucking
*  things are dinosaurs they're also intelligent yeah they're really smart they're smart yeah they're
*  smart they have feelings they feel things like have you ever seen that they taught them to paint
*  yeah i've seen that that's awesome how crazy is that i mean that thing is painting itself i love
*  that here's my question do you think they taught it we we actually talked about this jimmy didn't
*  we like do you think they actually taught him to make that shape or do you think they taught him
*  to paint himself right like if you if you could show an elephant like this is the shape i want
*  you to make and it's the shape of an of an elephant if you drew it for him and you said
*  recreate that i give you fruit he recreates that you give him fruit right that's a little different
*  than if he looks at you and starts drawing an image of you because that's we were led to believe
*  that the elephant was thinking of itself and drawing what an elephant looks like right it's
*  just a slightly less impressive thing that it might just be a motion that it's taught to make
*  but the way you look at it like you go no it's too good it's too good like the elephant has a little
*  talent like it's a like i would buy an elephant painting you should just to know that an elephant
*  did it but i don't want the elephants to have to be forced to work for right right right you want
*  the elephant to want to yeah paint paint it i'm glad the elephant just leave these paints here
*  and if you want to do it yes like exactly like if you if the elephant was living a chill life
*  i went to an elephant rescue place in thailand a couple years back and they rescue these elephants
*  and release them back into the wild successfully they've done it with several i think they said
*  seven at the time that i was there but they basically take elephants from like a circus or
*  a zoo and they rehabilitate them and they they they have them out here there's like piles of
*  sugar cane you could feed them sugar cane and this thing is like this big its heads this big
*  and i'm petting it i'm just feeding it sugar cane but they're so gentle right let strangers like me
*  i just met him right but if you wanted to you could just use you just you're a beer can man
*  fucking yeah pile drive you he do it every once to you he's so big and then when you you feed them
*  and you wash them and you hang out with them and then they'll let you ride them like you amazing
*  that you developed like a little bond with them it's interesting man because like you you're
*  hanging out with this elephant and you're feeding them and he goes to you to try to eat and then
*  you petting them and then you could wash them and he's enjoying it he's enjoying that you're doing
*  this and then then after all that then you ride them i don't like the riding part if i had to do
*  it all over again i could be like i'm good i'll meet you guys at the end i don't want to wear i
*  don't want to ride them but i get that it's but it's fascinating and they're they don't give a
*  fuck like you weigh nothing you you're a baseball hat to them what's the uh prehistoric what's the
*  mastodon is that the the snuffle off against guy from oh well it's woolly mammoth and woolly
*  mammoth there's two different ones yeah so when you're when you're in the presence of something
*  so majestic you're like you can believe that there's a dinosaur oh 100 well it would be a
*  dinosaur if it didn't exist right like if an elephant didn't exist and someone talked about
*  a giant right giant white teeth that come up up into the sky it's enormous it's as big as a house
*  what i love the baby as a house they're so cute yeah people who if you didn't know what an elephant
*  was and someone's describing if it didn't exist and someone's describing it to you right they said
*  it was off in the jungle somewhere you'd be like what right what is it a leftover dinosaur
*  you know we were trying to figure out the other day and we forgot to check how old are crocodiles
*  we were saying that crocodiles are dinosaurs but the dinosaurs supposedly were killed off 65 million
*  years ago right are are crocodiles something that actually survived before them how old does
*  it say they are 200 million years holy shit those dirty motherfuckers made it through the asteroid
*  that killed the dinosaurs those are those are dinosaurs they are dinosaurs yeah if they're if
*  it's 200 million years ago of course they're dinosaurs of course they are right jamie are
*  there uh crocodiles that paint i was looking up so that there's one the one elephant that that
*  you know the viral video of it it's got it's painting in really good detail yeah right there's
*  there's a website that has no way lots of elephant this is like the conservation elephant art.com
*  so these paintings are way different okay it's like the picasso is there some cheating going on i mean
*  that that's what i'm saying right i was saying maybe he's the michael jordan of uh elephant
*  painters but there was one or two i was like digging through here that was painting like
*  flowers with stems and petals and leaves the rest of this is just like you should see the video
*  play dave the video because the video is interesting so the painting elephant the uh
*  look he's carrying his supplies up and look it does the whole outline itself like no one's guiding
*  it great composition great not fucking bad no it's yeah it gets lots of look at that good stuff
*  you're not seeing you're just seeing the trunk is there someone behind it with a stick tape to it
*  like sort of moving it i don't think so back here it does show you okay all right it zoomed out yeah
*  i don't think so i think it's got skills man yeah control like look it knows how to outline the ear
*  that makes me feel like it's almost been classically trained though like look how thick
*  the line is of the ear then it sort of tapers off speaking of painting are you painting at all
*  no why don't you paint man i never paint i've drawn i used to draw a lot i know that i did i
*  i've never really gotten into painting not that i don't think it's awesome i just look i come to
*  your place you have these fucking paintings everywhere yeah i've seen your tattoos that you
*  you like to draw you like to draw werewolves you talk all day yeah don't you want to do something
*  where you don't have to talk and it's still expressing yourself and you like art i do
*  sometimes i still scribble i draw things sometimes but mostly um my days are busy
*  this is like the best way to like archery i like archery for calming down okay because that just
*  makes me just focus on a target and i just really it's a very zen thing to do i'm going to send some
*  art supplies to texas you just leave them there okay dude it's like the elephant i'm not going to
*  force you to do it okay they're just there and if you want to then you do it okay i do love drawing
*  still to this day but i really never have been drawing a lot lately but i'm i recognize my
*  limitations because whatever particular mental mental health problems that i have
*  i get obsessed with things and i i don't have the time to get obsessed with painting
*  oh i see so if i if i draw like i've been drawing since i was a kid it's not like a new thing
*  new things are dangerous to me you sound like me now it's true well that's why i
*  i walked away from from podcasting i just i go i know what this means to me i know what kind
*  of person i am like i'm all in like this is like i'll never paint again like this is going to take
*  over my life and then i remember i went on the stern show same thing like five six years ago and
*  i i was like i don't even know what i said i was completely like out of my mind and scott
*  ruden's assistant heard it the hollywood producer guy and he heard the show send the tape to scott
*  ruden i get a call from scott ruden he's like i need to turn your life into a television show
*  it's like it's it's too like it's unbelievable like it's like i've never heard that like you're in
*  the congo you're in jail you're this like we got to turn this into a show so i'm
*  38 i don't know something like that like fuck i made it i'm gonna be famous i'm gonna be on tv
*  and i was like man i got a fucking podcast it's gonna be huge i'm gonna be on tv i'm doing the
*  fucking news for vice we just got an emmy i'm a painter i got every fucking thing i do turns

*  he's like he's like everything just takes longer dave just takes longer now and i'm like wait let
*  me let me let me do a quick scan of my life right now i get lots of women i got i can eat at any
*  restaurant and and i have no wants or desires everything's handled and i have just the amount
*  of little bit of fame for my art where like no one's bothering me when i walk down the street
*  once in a while i'm at a supermarket and someone's like tv dsa and that's it i have it why am i so i
*  i walked away from that deal and at the same time i've been flirting with it bourdain he wasn't going
*  to do it forever and he started grooming me roy choi david chang to kind of take over for him he's
*  like you're gonna you've had it wasn't like a huge step for me because i've already been doing that
*  and i think that's how we connected he's like you know i have thumbs up which is a travel show where
*  i fuck with people and i go meet people all over the planet you have yours millions of people watch
*  your show 10 people watch your show but um you can do it with like an art twist you know and i sat
*  there and i was like fuck bro i don't know if i want your life i don't know if i want this you
*  know i had that moment of clarity and all the chaos of i need another thing in my life to show
*  people that the gambling wasn't a fluke the art wasn't a fluke that that i'm not just lucky that
*  i'm talented that i am enough the anger is like oh i'm gonna be on fucking tv now i'm gonna fucking
*  kill it and i was like my life's pretty dope right now i don't know and and dope like on the surface
*  like underneath you know i'm just a cauldron of suffering but i said i think i'm not gonna i'm
*  not gonna take this one and uh scott if you're out there i'm sorry like we we walked away from
*  that project and then um that's interesting just because you saw the what the repercussions of the
*  fame part well it's isn't a bill murray quote i want to be rich and famous and he goes why don't
*  you just try the rich first and see if you want to add the famous to it or something like that
*  it's like you deal with that now right yeah i mean people just some people see what what other people
*  have and they wish it was them right i remember being a comic in the beginning the early days
*  um when i was you know just coming up and opening for people i remember seeing people that would be
*  excited to see a comedian i'd be like wow that's fucking crazy like the person this person i know
*  people want to meet them right you want to see them like man why what do i have to do like
*  there's a part of you at 21 years old right like what the fuck do i have to do to to be like that
*  guy so what is your life like now with like the last time i saw you i mean you've been famous
*  since i've known you but it's exploded since then can you go to the restaurant can you go to the
*  restaurants most people are nice most people are friendly so how do you deal with the great
*  joe rogan experience changed my life like let's say what's up what's up what's up nice to me
*  you just keep walking moving nice to meet you i gotta get out of here
*  most people are cool they they want they just want to say hi hi's fine man nothing wrong i love it i'm
*  happy i like i love that people enjoy it but it's a mind fuck and you got to be careful it is a mind
*  fucking any mind fuck is it's a like just meeting people that know you and you don't know them
*  that's not a normal state for human beings it's weird no it's not you know so someone said it
*  best once and i took this on early on that like you meet like you have to have a like reset
*  like the the real problem like sometimes people get upset and they meet too many people
*  but i'm like we gotta have a reset like every person is a new person like this is the first
*  time you're right they don't it's not their fault that you met three people in a row on your way
*  to the bathroom this is still the first time they're meeting you but you could get stuck in
*  a spot too though right you go to a bar where everybody's a little drunk and then you're mobbed
*  and then people want to take pictures and hug you and do you think that's gonna be more or less
*  in texas i don't know man i think if i thought like that i would never do anything you never
*  take any chances never do anything different i'm jealous man i think it's i think i need to get the
*  fuck out of la man i was born and raised here i'm an angelino i think for everybody we're all
*  realizing because this pandemic that there's uh pros and cons to cities but when shit gets ugly
*  there's a lot of cons there's a lot of cons to being overcrowded right and there's a lot of i
*  mean there's also a little bit of a problem with the just a sheer amount of people if the virus is
*  spreading right because there's so many of us we're in the hot spot we're in the middle of it
*  yeah and there's so many of us you know do you see the herman cain thing no herman cain the guy
*  who ran for president he just died of coronavirus and this is after he had went to a one of them
*  trump rallies um one of his campaign rallies with no mask on and then was i think he was admitted
*  to the hospital 10 days after that right is that what it was it's a rough way to go man dude this
*  shit's crazy it's crazy you know what it's like dude it's like it's like 10 different diseases
*  like you talk to one person it seems like no big deal the other person tells you they're still not
*  well four months later they've got neurological diseases one person's mom beat it in a day the
*  other person almost died do you remember um in the 80s when aids like yes like people didn't
*  understand it yet speaking aids i have to be so bad i drank so much water before this so let's
*  pause this is not speaking of aids okay you were making an age joke i was i just have to peek
*  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen i just drank too much water my apologies no worries
*  welcome to real talk with david choe i didn't i didn't uh um we'll get back to aids but i didn't
*  i didn't i didn't dye my hair um because i'm uh trying to like empathize with gingers or whatever
*  it's because i'm going bald oh and it sucks i'm 44 i'm a middle-aged man now i like to think that
*  i'm like a young free spirit but i'm starting to thin up here and i go what are my options right
*  now shave your head shave your head yeah comb over man bun hat uh hair plugs hair transplant
*  propecia wig sewed right into your fucking skull dude i've never thought about it because i just
*  shave your head i swear to god i wish when i first started going bald i would have just shaved my
*  head from the beginning but my my answer to it was try to dye your hair the same color as your skin
*  so people don't see your bald spot and then i said and then i have like a dark week where i'm just
*  like i'm fat i couldn't keep up with the tribes the haza tribe that's still getting old and well
*  it's when you go i haven't seen you in a while you look fucking great man thank you like you're
*  always been in shape but i i've tried trainers before like i think i told you last time and
*  thank you for talking me out of becoming a ufc fighter my special you know the korean zombie
*  yes and i go why do they why do they call him that it's like because he can take a punch and
*  oh yeah he just keeps coming that's my special skill every fucking fight i've been in my life
*  that and i've lost most of them i think i told you that i never tap out like you have to break
*  my arm you have to i've had my face disfigured so i don't know that was stupid i i'm not gonna
*  go into ufc fighting but i go i when i think of myself as a person i remember myself being
*  relatively athletic in shape and when i go oh my hair's going i'm getting fat i can't run as fast
*  as i can i need a trainer i need help but what kind of trainer do i need the one like you where
*  they're like hey every morning here it's sort of like sergeant drill style or more hey dave like
*  so i went with both i went with the hard ass that shows up at my house dave out of bed i'll give a
*  fuck runs me till i puke how was that one lasted a week out done how many days a week were you
*  trying to have them on three monday wednesday friday and after friday you like get the fuck out
*  of here i just was like this isn't my style like let me try this the mic soft spoken so i got this
*  lady claire shout out to claire and she she would i told her i know myself i don't like to be
*  uncomfortable like i run from discomfort like right i want to get in shape but if you push me
*  too hard i'm an artist i'm a sensitive being i don't i don't i'm not i'm not trying to get into
*  like fighting shape just get me somewhat relatively healthy and then i sort of dropped off with that
*  too and then the pandemic didn't help so i'm sitting here and in my brain i'm like i have a
*  fucking fire in me i know i can fucking you know if i i thought when we were starting the hunt with
*  the tribe i was like i'm gonna keep up with them and i did in the beginning it's right in the front
*  with the the head guy we're running nonna that's his name and uh and then i dropped off and and of
*  course you dropped off but i'm like run every day you're gonna drop off that's just part of
*  being a human i mean it doesn't matter all this fire in your heart shit listen everybody feels
*  that like there's a reality to physical fitness and performance and the big reality is you got to
*  put in work and recover can i tell you how it takes forever can i tell you how i feel when i
*  listen to the joe rogan experience because i leave you on all the time when i'm painting i was
*  listening to when i painted the thing of you is i do feel extreme gratitude because i'm like
*  even though i've listened to joe for hundreds of hours now and there's tons of stuff i do disagree
*  with him thank god he exists he doesn't have much of an ego he like you've always uplifted me
*  promoted me all your friends um you have a great sense of humor and
*  where the fuck was i going with this i don't know but you're making me uncomfortable oh i love it
*  oh i love it um
*  fuck where was i going with this this is what i'm talking about with the memory and shit we're
*  talking about the tribes and then we're talking about uh how soft we are and we're talking about
*  how they have awesome poop and people trying to steal that poop i don't know maybe i'll remember
*  it but i think you would think that someone's poop like i know how to become like him oh this is oh
*  we're talking about feelings oh feelings so i and you know i love you and i love you too
*  thanks man i got really uncomfortable and i and and you have such fucking powerful people on here
*  that are smart that are inspiring that i start to feel self-conscious and and you have like david
*  gawkins on it's like dude this fat guy that just turned his life around and then i start to really
*  feel less of a man self-conscious like a failure i'm like fuck man if i just if i just pulled myself
*  up by my bootstraps and i just got who's speaking right now fuck you you fucking pussy the fuck up
*  oh shit okay okay and you know which dave was that that's the dave that tells me i'm a pussy
*  that's drill sergeant dave yeah the drill sergeant dave is you know i got diagnosed with severe
*  anti-social personality disorder traits and i said what does that mean why don't i have the actual
*  disorder and they're like because we've never met anyone that's so fucking hard on themselves
*  like what's the first thought when you meet anybody like friend foe anyone it's fuck you
*  but you think that all day fuck this guy fuck you who the fuck fuck but the the strange thing about
*  you is you actually have friends and people like you and you have a lot of people that love you and
*  you love a lot of people so we can't diagnose you with the actual disorder but you fucking have a
*  lot of so you would see people and just say fuck you immediately that would be your first i have
*  such a i have such insane abandonment issues my parents sent me away since i was a kid so i have
*  a really weird thing with authority or even anyone saying hey david are you open to a suggestion
*  like yeah sure let me hear it and the second they open their mouth i'm like fuck you you don't
*  fucking know me you don't fucking know me you don't and it's like so um that's so funny so i
*  listened to your show and i'm like damn dude joe fucking did this he's got all these inspirational
*  people that turn their life around like why the fuck do i still have a gut why can't i
*  and why am i still depressed why am i still addicted to this why am i why can't i get off
*  the fucking internet why like i was talking to you a little bit about the video game stuff right
*  yeah when i was in my mid-20s people couldn't wait for warcraft 3 to come out it was like the
*  new shit coming out i remember right they're like it's gonna come out and they delayed it
*  and it finally came out and i didn't i didn't have any money then and i got warcraft 2 and warcraft
*  2 the interface for the kids out there listening um it's like god interface like your little
*  peasants and paladins and you're moving them around where warcraft 3 is more 3d i don't know
*  the fuck i'm explaining video games um and i got on there and because the entire world was waiting
*  for warcraft 3 no one was playing warcraft 2 so i was the god of warcraft 2 you know when you go
*  on online games you get a game really quick this was back in the this is like 20 years ago so
*  wait i'm 24 yeah like 20 years ago so i'd get on the game and i'd be waiting i'd start a map and
*  i'm like who wants to play and i'd wait and i have to wait for people to join my career was just
*  getting started i was in a wonderful relationship with this woman that i dated for seven years my
*  life was like on the up and up and this thing completely took over my life have you ever seen
*  this documentary called web junkies about um the internet problem in china i haven't seen that but
*  i'm aware of the problem it's 2000 it's a documentary from 2014 and it starts with a kid
*  just crying and they're like why are you crying and so china had declared pc rooms internet
*  video game addiction a national emergency so they said it's okay we set up these centers
*  and you could either poison or drug your kid and just drop them off there like or you could lie to
*  them and tell them they're going to like a camping trip and then just drop them off there and then
*  they stay there for 90 days because that's and it's like a prison and these the start of the movie
*  yeah look at the kid crying you see that
*  wow so so they can't stop playing video games they can't stop watching porn they can't function
*  so this thing in the movie at some point i'll spoil it they escape like like from uh this is
*  a documentary yeah it's a documentary they escape from the madhouse at one point like the kids
*  you know they form a plan and they where do they go they go to the pc room down the street
*  they just can't they can't stop so wow it almost looks like a independent film that's why i asked
*  if it's a documentary the way they've shot it is very interesting because for me you know me i don't
*  smoke i don't drink i don't do any of that but i fucking i've been to over a thousand a.a meetings
*  and i don't drink what people why do you do that i'm like because i can't stop
*  porn i can't stop video games i can't start stop gambling and i know that they have meetings for
*  that too but they're harder to find they're more shameful there's less people and if i go to a
*  room and i'm talking and there's a guy speaking about how he got clean from alcohol i just listen
*  to him and every time he says alcohol i replace it with porn video game and i and i and i and i'm
*  like and not just that i'll do that in a last case ditch scenario but i'll i'll i'll go to all the
*  meetings i go to all the fucking meetings and so i'm sitting on warcraft 2 and i'm and i'm something's
*  missing from my life and my rage and my anger and all my my addictions and my my mental illnesses
*  are coming out in this warcraft game and i find this map that's perfect it's a small map and it's
*  called paintball and it's just everyone dies everyone has one hit point so one hit and you're
*  dead so it's more like a like a chess speedball game so the games don't last more than 15 minutes
*  you have one peasant one paladin and one wizard and i killed at that game i killed every and and
*  within five minutes you know like the way it goes you bring down a blizzard storm and you build a
*  cannon tower or whatever and you know if you're gonna win and this is before five minutes because
*  it's a fast game everything moves fast and you don't have to wait for the wood to chop it's
*  really fast and never fucked with those games i didn't have the this was before the earpieces
*  so within five minutes the game is sort of on auto so you know it's like who can do the things
*  the fastest then i start talking shit i'm gonna skull fuck your parents you dumb mother this is
*  a kid like in oh my god and i'm like like all you know the way people talk like all their demons come
*  out right and these and i'm playing kids and they're like why what is a skull fuck and i'm like
*  like i am a horrible person and then one day i was the king of this map like in this one area in my
*  life where my art career is kind of going good but not really and i don't know how to be in a

*  had a whole bit about how we would find it in the forest like yeah it's in the forest it's in your

*  was the first time i ever saw it my head fucking exploded shit couldn't believe you could see it's
*  crazy because you had never seen anybody fuck before then like you kind of knew what vaginas
*  looked like because the playboy and breasts look like but there's something about watching people

*  it's like a drug right like a a drug it's not it's not like a drug it is a drug i mean for the kids

*  would have to subscribe to showtime right but you take like hbo over an hbo showtime package
*  you would decide well let's just get hbo or we can only afford cinemax but there were some of
*  those channels like they'd call cinemax skinimax right because there's some of those channels
*  there was so much they were like um they were like fake movies with an excuse to show like
*  softcore action but you didn't see penetration no like the first time i saw penetration was when
*  i think i was 14 i don't remember who got the video but one of my friends got a porn an actual

*  moment so i have i am uh full of this cum coming out of my eyes i'm full i'm like i got a fucking
*  jerk like i don't even know what i'm like so and i always knew when my brother fell asleep because
*  his breathing slows down so i'm like sitting there i'm pressing my dick against the wall
*  i'm like and he's like finally he finally falls asleep and i go okay i'm gonna like hold my whole
*  arm because it's a squeaky it's like a shitty bunk bed oh no i hold my whole arm against my
*  this and jerk off fuck dave you knew okay whatever and and i'm talking to yourself again i start
*  doing a very gentle quiet masturbation but it's still doing a light tug with a little bit of squeak
*  because i don't want to wake up with my brother what i want to do is i want to fucking crank it
*  it and then i hear david it's my brother he's like why are you shaking the bed so much
*  i'm like oh fuck man like and now i'm like god damn i gotta find a place in my
*  anyways i could go on and on about your brother's a cock blocker he's a cock blocker he fucking
*  cocked me blocked me from myself so i bring this up because this is this is what we had to do
*  to bust the nut in the back in the day it's not that hard today it's everywhere
*  so i meet this 20 year old kid and he goes i'm a virgin i i've heard your story before because
*  your story is every old guy's story my story is my mom was watching me she left the youtube video
*  baby shark or some shit up and i she went to the bathroom and i clicked pokemon and then it was
*  pokemon cosplay triple anal gangbang and that's the first thing i've ever seen at age four
*  straight to anal age four how it's how is that possible dude if you have an unblocked phone like
*  it's very easy kid can get to pokemon porn is it that quick jamie that doesn't is that back in the
*  day that could have happened sure yeah is this also like back in the day when youtube used to
*  have it set up with like did they have restrictions back in the day because when if when things
*  first started going up there was a lot of people sneaking things in yeah that weren't supposed to
*  be on there and then they would catch them still be for all i mean i don't know but they didn't
*  have porn none of those none of those have had like i don't think so but i think people can
*  probably get away it could probably be up there for like five minutes before it gets taken down
*  or something you know what's so crazy is that twitter still has porn right hardcore right like
*  if you let let your kid look at your phone and they click on twitter they could see someone taking
*  the ass i have a blocked phone yeah that could happen so so this kid's like that's my story and
*  that's most young people's story now it isn't they found their dad's playboy in the forest
*  accidentally stumbled upon something or or some kid that doesn't it wasn't an accident someone
*  tells some older brother goes hey so my first visual burned programmed into my young mind isn't
*  a still image with a woman with a huge bush it's fucking anal penetration that's my first image and
*  as the addict craves novelty as you get older you need more and more so by the time i'm 13
*  i've already that's i need prolapsed anus stuff i need transsexual i need gay sex i need so he
*  says this kid is 20 years old he's never had sex he's like a what a simp incel whatever they call him
*  he uses viagra to get half hard he can't even get fully hard and it's his life is just scrolling
*  it's just porn video games porn video games porn and it's we could sit here and we could laugh at
*  it and i have laughed at it but this is that's a problem that's a problem so if i take it back to
*  when i'm 24 when the technology was way less i missed my first deadline i was late to work i
*  lost that girlfriend not just because of that because of other issues too but
*  i didn't get up for one weekend from friday to sunday without pissing drinking water and at some
*  point i had found my this guy this arch enemy on this warcraft game he'd win one i'd win one one
*  more one more one more he'd win one one more and the guy was like a british guy who had a wife and
*  kids he's like bro i got a life dude and i'm like fuck you pussy we go we go we go hours hours i'm
*  seeing fucking wizardry in my mind i'm seeing paladins i'm seeing them i feel like god when
*  i finally got up i fucking collapsed my legs were gone and then i almost had to call 911 because
*  they just wouldn't work for an hour and i called my friend who's a doctor and they're like you're
*  dehydrated go drink some water and if jamie just googles korean video game overdose it's always a
*  korean it's always an asian they play video games to death there's a korean family why do you think
*  that is the culture there it's like intense it's like it's uh if we think we self like
*  the the addiction that most people if you play whack-a-mole you're like hey i used to be addicted
*  to sex gambling and i jump and i jump i'm addicted to this the one where you can hide in plain sight
*  where everyone pats you on the back is workaholism right i could work all day and night and in this
*  culture you get pat on the back asian culture is the same except if you fail
*  you either kill yourself and you're an absolute disgrace and you know it's like
*  in japan it was the suicide rate was really high now it's in korea but it's all your identity is
*  tight like who are you oh i'm a podcast around this you are only what your job is and if you're
*  not good at it then what's your drug oh i'm gonna fucking just zone out in this video game pc room
*  my life's not going well there's a there's a man and a wife in korea i saw this in some documentary
*  that they would keep going to the internet room to play this video game like where you virtually
*  raise like the sims or something like that that they forgot to feed their own kid and their kid
*  died and they went to jail for it and then when they went out it's like this is a fucking problem
*  this is like a real problem and we live in a culture where there's things that are accepted
*  addictions right if you fucking do opioids and heroin and like i've been to those rooms man i
*  see how they treat people if you're like a heroin addict there's a hierarchy you're a real drug
*  addict but if you smoke weed come on man you're gonna od from that but if if you look at the
*  amount of people that kill themselves now like it's almost normalized and how many of my friends
*  have done that how many of people that you know that and especially during this pandemic the
*  suicide rates gone up like crazy that's a fucking real problem man like and people
*  when i think of bourdain and i think of myself and even starting to show off giving you compliments
*  we live in a culture that doesn't know how to when people don't shoot the messenger the messenger
*  people say that because the messenger gets shot we don't know how to ask for help we don't know
*  how to receive help we don't know even how to give help like if i try to help one of my friends who's
*  like addicted to video games and jerking off get the fuck out of here dave you don't fucking i'm
*  like bro just trying to help right we don't it's very hard to help people they have to want help
*  right if people don't want help you're not going to help them you're going to bully them around
*  you're going to yell at them they're going to eventually do what they want to do anyway
*  but when someone comes to you and says hey i need help that's when things get serious because other
*  than that you're you're forcing like i have friends that i would like if they did things differently
*  in terms of their health i can't say anything to them like i just you just have to accept it
*  this is what it is you know the people come up with their own excuses their own reasons
*  you brought this up earlier and i wanted to ask you now like you were talking about
*  like physical stuff like you get angry and get anxiety because like you don't you let yourself
*  get overweight like how much does that fuck with you and how much would you give to not have that
*  anymore like isn't that wouldn't i mean if there's one major thing that keeps fucking with you over
*  and over again that you could fix i have that's a fixed one you could fix that so i have a disease
*  of more like i was saying that i have a chasm a black hole that it doesn't matter how many women
*  i have sex with how many porn i've jerked off to how much money i've gambled and lost in one small
*  fortunes huge fortunes i have had an eating disorder which is like i thought that was
*  a girl thing that's what i thought like i got to when i went to rehab for gambling addiction
*  it was this is the first rehab i've went to i've been to every fucking rehab mental health wellness
*  center in america now um i said hey do you guys deal with process addiction another guy has sure
*  come over and when i went there there was only meth heads there they didn't even know they just
*  wanted my money yeah just come over here and i learned they're like serious gambling addiction
*  like one out of four kills themselves and yeah it's it's a it's the reason why there's no
*  balconies in las vegas the only place that has balconies is the cosmo i think and they had like
*  two suicides the first month they opened i think because it you're so i i i'm like i have things
*  that when i talk about it it's funny can't stop jerking off can't it's all i can't stop working
*  just fucking got a emmy working for vice and i got my podcast and i got this and i got this next
*  project and my next art show is going to make a million dollars and then you're addicted to that
*  there's no end to it right there's no there's no nothing and when i meet when i watch the jordan
*  documentary and i meet famous people that have succeeded at the highest levels i go how long were
*  you happy for maybe a day maybe 24 hours and then what happens the next day back to the grind it's
*  not enough got the gold medal back to the grind back to the grind and i go it's it's never going
*  to be enough i'll never have enough women money success it's it's this and i go i have so many
*  friends who've killed themselves i have so many like bourdain asked me for help he asked me for
*  help like i'm like yes what did he say he said i'm fucking miserable i'm miserable do you how do
*  you deal with this and i was like i've been waiting for this fucking phone call thank you how how
*  recent or how close to when he died was it was within the year it wasn't like right but so he
*  said it was miserable and in what way do you describe it he said you're successful i'm successful
*  do you find yourself suffering and i go absolutely please and then i called him and uh and i
*  i this is what i mean when i say asking for help and receiving for help that was a fucking hard
*  you know people that know bourdain i know his friends i know his manager you won't find a
*  fucking person that will say a bad thing about him that guy is a fucking he's so awesome he's
*  always looking out for you he'll show up for you whatever you need he'll take care of you he's an
*  amazing guy very very interesting guy very intense and so you can't find anyone but i'm like you're
*  a fucking asshole dude you're an asshole you murdered yourself you murdered yourself you killed
*  someone that person happened to be you but you couldn't even show up for yourself you
*  so i'm sorry
*  uh
*  i'm sorry i'm getting real man listen i get it you love the guy i loved him too it's um
*  i've known many people that have killed themselves now it's uh it's a very sad thing
*  that was that you can't you can never fix that that sadness is always going to be a part of you
*  you're always going to think maybe i could have gotten to him maybe i could have talked to him
*  maybe if i was there but that was it he's he he did it he reached out he's like i relate to you dave
*  i connect with you and i was like yes so what did he wind up doing he i talked to him i said hey man
*  here's all the things i've done i'm i'm in a really good place now i can help you i can
*  i can refer you to places i got you and it was almost like thank you for caring for me
*  thank you like he was he was severe codependent like he was a people pleaser right he's like i'm
*  like he never said no he's like i'm gonna fucking help everybody except for myself
*  it's okay man i get it
*  it's okay man i get it
*  so i'm gonna help everyone except for myself and i think i make this up in my head he's like
*  and i've done this too before it's like i kind of half-ass ask people for help oh dave i got
*  resources and i go that's enough just to know that you cared and that i know that there's places i
*  can go to that's enough i don't have to actually full stop my life and change until
*  you know oh fuck so that's what i mean when you say we don't as a culture people don't teach us
*  this shit people don't teach us how how to how to fucking ask for help and then receive help and
*  i i fucking gave you five compliments at the start of the show i i couldn't take a fucking
*  i couldn't take a compliment i couldn't say one nice thing about myself five years ago
*  and if someone tried to say something hey dave you're good i'd shut them down okay okay it's like
*  and i turn every i turn everything into a joke right everything i can't sit here in this discomfort
*  i don't want to be uncomfortable so i find i find this place i go i'm fucking ready now i'm ready
*  whatever my best thinking got me here like whatever talking to people sitting around like i
*  something's fucked up with me all the shit that happened in my my life i'm like throwing myself
*  in a fucking jungle with like i'm going to jail repeatedly hold on hold on yeah why are you
*  choosing to look at it in a negative way in the way you're describing it right there but something
*  must be fucked up with me i go to the jungle i'm doing all this crazy shit that's one of the things
*  that makes you interesting is this extreme real curiosity you have a a real curiosity and a
*  willingness to do wild shit like go to the congo and look for a fucking dinosaur and sleep in a
*  tent i'm telling you this crawling around i'm telling you this story now because i'm alive
*  i could have easily died there multiple times and then going back yes going back 10 years later and
*  i think a film crew is going to make that easier i get it but the fucking chief's sister had a
*  machete in her mouth and she's like let's kill these fuckers and i'm like why am i back here why
*  did why did they want to kill you because they thought we were uh they wanted money and we we
*  had used all our we gave them all our money for filming rights and the the sister was like they
*  have more like he was like the evil warlord of it wasn't the pygmies see no but still look it's not
*  you're looking at it you're what what makes you interesting you're looking at it as a negative
*  one of the things that makes you interesting is that you're a wild person who takes chances
*  that's why i told you you should do a podcast look joe i the that's but davis not a bad thing
*  all these things you're saying are not bad things can it be both i don't know man i mean i think can
*  i teach you what i learned yes the way i'm talking to you right now is how i talked coming into
*  like these looney bins that i've been to they're like wow the way you talk is very black and white
*  fuck this this is bad this is the fucking bomb this is the shit this is lit this is fire this
*  is fucked i don't even know i said that i don't talk like that it's like it's like i was in the
*  parking lot in korea town and i'm like i'm looking at the next generation of koreans they got
*  shit in their face they got piercings i watched these two korean kids talk to each other
*  for 20 minutes and they only said bruh lit and fire and i'm like what the fuck did you guys just
*  say anyways um because of my religious background where it's heaven or hell god's way or satan you
*  kind of look at everything like that right joe rogan is the best that podcast is the worst that
*  so you ask me right now why do i look at in this bad way and i go can it be both because you don't
*  have a gray there's no 50 shades of gray there's it's just black and white it's only the best and
*  the worst that's if you could you feel something if you fucking come off a big win yes i just want
*  a shit ton of money in vegas i did this i did that or if you get cancelled but in here in the
*  middle you feel nothing so you gotta go for the highs and usually you feel more when you lose so
*  you chase the lose like you don't fucking get it what dave you're gonna fuck it i like losing you
*  don't fucking get it i like feeling shit you almost died in the congo why are you going back
*  because i because maybe they didn't get you know so i hate the thrill out of escaping the jaws of
*  death there's something severely broken in me that i get a fix i get a hit i get it and the thing is
*  you've heard heroin addicts that say i get this high now just to feel even i don't even get that's
*  where i was at i'm fucking playing angry birds till my fucking fingers split open
*  i'm fucking gambling you say but you're not saying current tense no no no i'm telling old
*  stories right i know but you're saying it now right no no no no this is i'm i'm soft serve now
*  i'm fucking smelling flowers you still you channeled dave of old yeah well that's another dave that's
*  inside of you dave of old hey you're driving the bus right now you want to sit in the back or you
*  want to come back okay of old you know what jamie you into dead air can can i can i just do 10
*  seconds to get back to sure
*  this is the weirdest podcast we've ever done thank you thank you so much i need like
*  because i'm hyped up you saw that you saw old dave come up and i want to i want to amp it up
*  i want to keep going high this is awesome man so i so i i can't like you meet people and you're
*  like you're wired this way and you can't teach an old dog new tricks and that's just joe rogan
*  that you see today in his 30s and his 40s and 50s it's gonna still be that but a little different
*  version of that when he's 56 and i meet these guys i meet i most of these places are very expensive
*  and the people that end up there it's like everyone has cut them out so they have to be there
*  or they lost their job so i'm usually the youngest guy there i'm independently wealthy so i can pay
*  for it and i'm looking at these guys that have everything they have all the money all the fame
*  every everything and they're successful only in their career everything else they're a failure
*  their kids hate them their wives hate them there and i go
*  i gotta fucking i gotta rewire myself like i i can't live like this because
*  you go why is this good or bad and i'm like because i don't care if i live i'm ready to die
*  i want to die like i i but wait a minute but you enjoy life today i do today i do sometimes in the
*  time that you met me i really probably didn't enjoy life so much it's more everything feels
*  like a chore everything feels like i'm underwater like now no not now now now now i do like so part
*  of part of that is the thing leaning into discomfort but what got you over the hump like there's a lot
*  of people that have experienced what you're describing so what got you to the point where
*  it's all flowers and happy friends friends most isn't that that that is one of the most
*  underappreciated it is recipes you have people that will die for you i have people that will die for
*  me that is a fucking rare commodity in this world and when i say friends i mean they left me
*  i i thought i was a genius i was like whatever the shit you see with connie that's what i thought
*  i'm like i'm a genius i'm doing and and there was the people that were like you are a genius
*  dave you are great and i go you don't get it dude i want to fucking die right now i want a cop to
*  come out and shoot me because i'm fucking his wife right now that's what i want that's a fucking crazy
*  story for the podcast dave that's i i'm not living i'm not no one's home hello no one's home and but
*  so my friends say we're done with you wait you're my homies down for life right right or die we're
*  fucking done with you who who the fuck are we to you who are we to you you've i've had friends
*  that i've known since i was eight years old i'm 44 now my whole life they go and so in a moment of
*  clarity like the same way i didn't fucking kill the german guy i go wait every person in my life
*  that i chose to have a friendship with is telling me i'm an asshole that that i'm not me anymore
*  that i'm not making sense that i need help and i and the thing is i know i need help but i'm like
*  why did i get sent away when i was a kid there's three boys why did i get sent away because you
*  are the well most well-behaved you know we didn't have enough money to raise three boys so we sent
*  you away because you didn't cry you didn't cause problems so i'm a kid now i'm four years old when

*  it was just to live with my uncles and my aunts and and just to have other families support me
*  because my parents weren't doing too well financially so then the whole concept of nice
*  guys finish last right right so i'm this quiet asian guy and you could just say whatever you he's

*  thinking is acting right acting like the model minority acting like the good little asian boy

*  fight when i gamble when i act crazy i get television deals i get on howard stern i get
*  on fucking joe rogan i get fucking uh sold out art shows women let me pause you okay do you think
*  that you are the victim of the attention that you were getting do you think you leaned into it and
*  it became who you decided you were because that was giving you the most love and people got a kick
*  out of the fact that you genuinely didn't give a fuck so you just leaned into that so it changed
*  you it's absolutely that but it's more nuanced than that there's a it's everything well i'm
*  already mentally unstable four-year-old thing man right that's it that right i mean when that
*  happened i mean that's the fucking that's the gasoline that was poured all over you so things
*  don't make sense to me they can't make sense to you man and and as an adult i go i have wealth
*  i have money i know famous people who have wealth why we know the story rich famous uh
*  fucking blow your brains out hang yourself we know that story doesn't have to you're alive right now
*  and listen it doesn't have to ever go down that way but when when the one thing that you've got
*  to know is you can't fix any of the shit that happened to you that's that's a that's a real
*  problem because the shit that happened to you was titanic for that to happen to you at four years
*  of age as you're growing up and developing to hit a horrible situation like that at four through no
*  fault of your own that all of it makes sense it's what we were talking about that everybody
*  doesn't start from the same spot you know and it's it's what makes unfortunately it's what makes
*  people so goddamn interesting sometimes too whether it's joey diaz or whether it's you or most of my
*  friends that are really interesting had these fucked up lives that you would never want to
*  wish upon your kids but see when you say that i hear that and i love and respect you so i go
*  i this is just how i feel i go joe loves me because i'm weird and i'm interesting and for me
*  no i'm saying how i i receive it and i need to stay fucked up to be interesting for me to get help
*  who can i look to who navigated their way out of this jungle who did it right who can i look up to
*  go man that guy was wild crazy he did all this crazy shit he got rich and famous and whatever
*  and then he sailed half like where where can i find that and i go no i just accept i'm not
*  you know yes i've had suicidal ideation yes i'm fucking mentally disturbed yes i've had to
*  go to jail and lock myself up many times but at least i'm rich you know like let me stop you again
*  okay here's the thing to concentrate on what is the goal if the goal is to be happy right the
*  problem is a lot of people are doing things to be successful because they think becoming
*  successful is what makes you happy it doesn't always sometimes you feel empty and you feel angry
*  that you spend all your time working for something that you don't even appreciate when it's over but
*  you're on paper you're successful that's not really successful can i tell you one of the can i tell
*  you a story of how i got better and let me hold you okay one second this is what i want to get to
*  yes some people are happy right would we can we say that do you think some people you think
*  there's a percentage of this population that's happy some people are happy yes of course some
*  people are happy okay yes there's no characteristics that exclude you from that group you could also be
*  happy and i say this to anybody anybody who's been happy but how joe but this is what you got to do
*  concentrate on what it is first of all that makes you happy and i guarantee you for a big part of
*  it for a lot of people is their physical health improve your physical health you'll improve your
*  enthusiasm you'll improve your energy and you'll improve your ability absolutely do other things
*  you'll be happier right and then do what you're doing you've already you've already gone onto this
*  great path where you've changed basically who you are you've become like this this guy is more
*  introspective can i tell you just growing up in america part of being a man because someone asked
*  me where's your idea of a man come from i go from clint eastwood watching the guy movies growing
*  up you know the way korean men are so macho and so that's in me and what is what is that what is
*  being a man it's like shut the fuck up and take handle your business don't ask for help yes korean
*  asians we don't like asking for help we never ask for help and so when i tell you that i've been to
*  every fucking mental health institution and like there's sick people all over the country in the
*  world i never saw one fucking asian guy until i saw one for fucking five years i'm going to all
*  these places and i'm and i'm they just don't ask for help they don't ask for help you just suffer
*  silently there's people listening right now that are suffering because you know what they do
*  the story i've just told you right now i wasn't able to say that for years because i made trauma
*  a competition big fucking deal you left your parents sent you away you weren't starving in
*  korea i'm like i'm four years old dude i don't know where my fucking parents are yeah but your
*  grandpa he has this big ginseng farm you're having a nice life out there okay you know what
*  there's someone else down the street getting fucking molested getting beaten i don't have
*  everyone tries to do this like hierarchy of like i got it this bad shut the fuck up who are you
*  and i go but everyone's pain is maximum to them right everyone's maximum pain is right so when
*  you're getting hurt when someone's doing this and to someone they're like big deal that doesn't hurt
*  my feelings and i go but to me it does i'm not thinking well you know there's people getting
*  killed in the streets right now so i have no i'll say that to myself there's people getting killed
*  in the streets right now so just because one guy said go back to where you come from i have no i
*  i'm gonna quiet up zip i'm not gonna say anything because what is that that's nothing that's a oh
*  you hurt me with your words but i go but it did your words hurt me and well you're not allowed
*  to feel that and yet i do i feel shit and my whole fucking life my is reactionary to stop that by
*  building walls and come up with these coping mechanisms and i go teach me i want to fucking
*  learn and they go you're not gonna like it and you already know because i already talked about here
*  step one was i was like i'll do anything and they're like it's not gonna happen overnight
*  and then someone said there is something that will happen overnight ayahuasca i'm like i'm in
*  i'm an addict i want it quick i love you because you do fucking psychedelics i don't know what
*  kind of person you would be if you didn't like it changed my life i did ayahuasca 30 when i was 35
*  years old so almost nine years ago and it fucking the the trip i had in the jungle in columbia and
*  they told me this isn't going to change your life but it'll kick the doors open for you to begin to
*  become a different person and we're sitting here we're sitting in fucking microphones there's this
*  and this there's other dimensions there's shit and it's like i can't i'm i'm telling you i agree
*  with everything you said i when i exercise i feel great when but i there's something i i'm an addict
*  i'm a fucked up i can't i teach me i i need something besides and this is why i said when i
*  listen to all the motivational stuff and i and i get fired up i go yeah if i just fucking got up
*  and push myself and i go but that's not me i need something more and i'm gonna fucking be curious
*  i'm gonna search and so i get to a place where they go dave you turn everything into a joke
*  you lie a lot right starting with what's a what's a every guy answer to how are you doing i don't
*  care if your dad just died or you just got a divorce great okay right okay is not a feeling
*  good is not a feeling something horrible i could have had the worst day right now and if you asked
*  me how you doing i'd say good i'm okay and and that would be a lie so i go what i'm gonna go to
*  a place in mississippi i i i'm not gonna say the name i don't know if there's like lawsuit shit but
*  i went there and it's a mandatory place for crooked judges congress like high like doctors
*  lawyers and they have to be there and they have to relearn rewire or else they don't get their
*  you know licenses back to practice whoa and i was the only one there by choice i didn't have to be
*  there and so i get there and they go why are you here and i go i can't stop thinking a certain way
*  i can't stop lying i can't stop exaggerating i can't stop storytelling i can't stop period
*  i have uncontrollable behavior i'm impulsive and i don't like who i am and i'm suicidal at times and
*  i i want and they go we're gonna do something here so they they took the yellow stick it pads
*  and they wrote no joking so they put one on here and here and they go no more joking and they taught
*  me different ways to like that guy sounds like a bummer total bummer and they can have a joke and
*  they can act like they go we know that this place that you're at right now is not how the real world
*  exists but while you're here and by the way you could leave at any time we're gonna ask you to
*  to change your behavior so what was the problem they had with you joking that was your defense
*  mechanism for every fucking serious thing right oh here's the fucking i was better i was better at
*  the comebacks i told you before when i saw you do that thing in la that you see la i'm like you can
*  be a comic you want 100 can be a comic you have a comics mentality you're fucked up like a comic
*  you have crazy ideas like a comic and you're insightful you're a smart guy you'd be really
*  good at it thank you for saying that and 100 like you're there's comics you meet in life obviously
*  you're a multifaceted guy you can do a lot of different things you're a great artist you can
*  do whatever you want but there's something about comics that never became comics there's a lot of
*  them i worked for one at one point in time i worked for a private investigator dave dolan the
*  most fucking hilarious guy i've ever met in my life totally was a comic just never did comedy
*  i met a bunch of guys like that were totally comics they just never found comedy like if they
*  did they'd be one of us they'd be hanging out in the back of the comedy store can you admit that
*  you can draw like relatively good yeah i could draw relatively okay so you know through everything
*  else you've achieved in your life if you practice you'd be awesome at it but you said the same thing
*  that's funny dave you're gonna keep asking me to paint i'm not gonna do it i know who i am i get
*  obsessed and whatever when i walked off the stage at ucla i did two hours like improv and i and i
*  invited like harris widows rest in peace he's not here anymore i invited comic writers and i said
*  shoot me straight like don't do the like dave you're great they were like you fucking killed
*  two you've never done comedy before and you killed for two hours there's some rusty parts but if you
*  just kept the reps in and then similarly i've always always wanted to be in a band right so
*  mca from beastie boys passes away and then money mark who's been touring with them for 20 years is
*  out of work he's a friend of mine and i'm like i've known you for a while why don't we fucking make a
*  band we do a i perform the band mongchi we uh with bobby lee's brother steve lee as the singer
*  and money mark we fucking tour the u.s and we sell out like two small like two three hundred cedar
*  clubs and every fucking um uh high school like rock band fantasy is fulfilled and at our last
*  show i think bill burr was there i'm like we're playing here and los globos in silver lake
*  and i'm playing to this sold out 200 it's all my friends my family there's comedians there's
*  porn stars and there's like a super famous you know uh one of the most famous uh rock band lead
*  singers in the audience and he's like can i talk to you after the show i'm like yeah and he's like
*  i play to like 20 30 000 seat stadium people now and what you just took me back to was our first
*  days when we started i would do anything for that and i sat there and i was like wait joe rogan told
*  me i like i don't think he's bullshitting he thinks i could really do this comedy thing i felt
*  i felt like on fire when i was on stage this guy's telling me if i just keep touring and i keep
*  putting out videos that at some point i'll be selling out 500 1000 and then in five years and
*  i go i love playing music i love comedy and i think i've tasted just enough where i don't want
*  to fuck out you would these things take time man to fucking perfect it and craft it you've done this
*  for thousands of hours like i i said in this and this is all like after i've done a lot of work on
*  myself i'm like i i'm gonna walk away from this as someone who doesn't know how to say no and and
*  like i have that overachieving attitude i'm like why not why not did you have a good time on stage
*  doing yeah i loved it did you love them when people laughed yeah it was like a drug i felt it
*  it do you want to keep doing that and the torture of coming up with new material and like
*  you know and the bands if you don't like i'm like i know myself well enough now that i i'm going to
*  stick to one thing at a time you know so i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you the story and i you know i
*  could tell you jail stories porn so i have all these stories but the fucking weirdest shit that
*  i've ever done in my life was to go to this place and it's like an intensive outpatient place so i
*  have an apartment with a roommate i don't know fucking roommate in years and they go in the time
*  that you're here once again voluntarily you can leave at any time we're going to ask you to fucking
*  do everything you say it's counterintuitive to who you are and the way you're wired but we're going
*  to ask you to tell the truth and just fucking and i go yeah sure i can do that i don't even i haven't
*  even checked into my apartment i'm opening the door i cohen there is a man that's obesely overweight

*  right now i'm desperate i'm gonna do anything right now to fucking get better so if it means i
*  gotta tell on you for googling me if i gotta tell on you for watching breaking bad because you like
*  to do meth and suck mexican guys dicks and and vice versa and so i get a little cocky i get a
*  little and i go same thing like the hitchhiking like i know i'm never gonna see this guy again
*  i go hey walter you've told me the whole time we're here you always got to end shit with i'm
*  not gay but i'm not gay did you ever think that maybe instead of like hiding who you are finally
*  divorcing your wife and like you can go to like the gay parade and wear crazy shit and just be out
*  you don't have to because his whole thing is i only do it when i'm on meth you don't have to use
*  hide behind meth anymore and he chuckled a little bit and i came ahead i'm like oh cool i'm like
*  maybe making maybe some of these words are getting in and he's like all right and so i felt good like
*  it felt like so i leave and then i stayed at this place for six more months and during this time

*  like even these people forgot how to have fun they're like lawyers and doctors and it's like
*  entitlement out the roof they're all the super best at their job the best lawyer the best doctor
*  the best so they're used to like playing god and saving people's lives and people just catering to

*  adults being trained and i'm like i'm going to teach these fuckers how to have fun so i'm like
