# Joe Rogan Experience #1998 - Ali Siddiq
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3.0s)]
*  Hey. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7.0s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9.0s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10.0s)]
*  I'm doing great. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11.0s)]
*  You are a perfect example of how sometimes the universe throws you a little curveball [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=12.0s)]
*  and it turns out to work out better for you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=16.0s)]
*  We were talking about it before, right before the show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=18.0s)]
*  I wanted to congratulate you on the success of your special. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=21.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=24.0s)]
*  Because you were in the show for a long time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=25.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=27.0s)]
*  Because you were in this position where HBO decided not to air it because you had opinions. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=28.0s)]
*  And they said, well, we don't agree with your opinions, so you can't have opinions that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=35.0s)]
*  are different than ours. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=38.0s)]
*  You didn't even say anything. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=39.0s)]
*  I didn't think it was your feelings on things, which I feel like you're allowed to have. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=41.0s)]
*  And boom, you put it on YouTube and boom. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=46.0s)]
*  How many views does it have now? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=49.0s)]
*  First one, 8.8 million. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=51.0s)]
*  Million. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=54.0s)]
*  Million. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=55.0s)]
*  8.8 million. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=56.0s)]
*  You know what the odds of you getting 8.8 million on HBO are? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=57.0s)]
*  Zero. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=60.0s)]
*  It's zero. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=61.0s)]
*  It's zero. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=62.0s)]
*  You don't have anything to get. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=63.0s)]
*  Unless you're on the fucking Game of Thrones premiere. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=65.0s)]
*  I was ready to do math in my head and everything. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=68.0s)]
*  I was thinking it was like zero. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=72.0s)]
*  Don't even think about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=75.0s)]
*  Zero. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=76.0s)]
*  It's never. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=77.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe you got to go back to like Sam Kenison. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=78.0s)]
*  Maybe his got 8 million. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=81.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=83.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=85.0s)]
*  I mean, not that many people watch those shows, but YouTube is beautiful. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=86.0s)]
*  I mean, they fuck you on a lot of different things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=89.0s)]
*  They'll pull you for discussing legitimate medical studies. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=92.0s)]
*  This guy got pulled. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=96.0s)]
*  Did you see that thing? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=97.0s)]
*  I tweeted it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=98.0s)]
*  He got pulled off of YouTube. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=99.0s)]
*  They killed his whole channel for reading Lancet studies on psychiatric drugs. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=102.0s)]
*  Bro, it's crazy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=109.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=111.0s)]
*  They did a study on them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=112.0s)]
*  Well, it was on children and psych medications. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=113.0s)]
*  It was on children and I believe it was SSRIs, which was anti-depressants. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=117.0s)]
*  Are they prescribing those to children now? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=122.0s)]
*  They've been prescribing them for children. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=125.0s)]
*  They've been doing it for a long time, but they do not like when people discuss the negative side effects on YouTube. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=127.0s)]
*  I would assume advertising pressure. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=133.0s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes sense to me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=137.0s)]
*  You can discuss getting the belt or getting whipped, but you can't discuss the negative side effects of a drug. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=139.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=149.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could openly discuss being abused as a child, being beaten. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this gentleman, what's his name? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=156.0s)]
*  Roger McPhillan, Dr. Roger McPhillan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=160.0s)]
*  So this is what he said. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=164.0s)]
*  Our YouTube channel was terminated in less than 24 hours. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=167.0s)]
*  No warnings, explanations or strikes after we posted a video highlighting published science, black box warnings and known adverse reactions of anti-depressants for youth. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=170.0s)]
*  Why do you think this was censored? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=181.0s)]
*  And then it's weird is that YouTube responded underneath it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=183.0s)]
*  They responded, hey, here to help. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=187.0s)]
*  You know, YouTube channel URL. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=191.0s)]
*  We'll see what we can find. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=193.0s)]
*  Here's how to find it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=195.0s)]
*  Like they kill his whole channel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=196.0s)]
*  He said you terminated my I don't know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=198.0s)]
*  Like saying you, it's probably a person, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=200.0s)]
*  It's probably not that person. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=203.0s)]
*  So you terminated my YouTube channel for posting published scientific literature for reasons like this that YouTube is losing the public trust. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=205.0s)]
*  Man, it's that that dance of advertising. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=212.0s)]
*  You know, that's the dance. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=215.0s)]
*  The dance of advertising and government control. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=217.0s)]
*  It's kind of spooky. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=220.0s)]
*  It's kind of spooky shit. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=222.0s)]
*  Well, I've been living in a neighborhood that's been government controlled for a long time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=223.0s)]
*  Not really spooky to us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=231.0s)]
*  We like, oh, regular government nonsense. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=234.0s)]
*  Not good. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=239.0s)]
*  Like we just the reason why we don't trust anything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=243.0s)]
*  Brown people, black people, we just don't like you say it like, well, it's for good reason. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=244.0s)]
*  It's not like everything's going great and nobody trusts the government. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=253.0s)]
*  But a lot of people are pro-government, like government, everything. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=258.0s)]
*  Well, I think they just sold a narrative. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=262.0s)]
*  You know, I think they sold a narrative and they think anti-government is bad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=265.0s)]
*  So they're pro-government. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=270.0s)]
*  And I've had some maddening discussions with intelligent people that I respect where they're saying the government should regulate the Internet. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=272.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=279.0s)]
*  The same people that are engaging in insider trading. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=281.0s)]
*  They should regulate the Internet. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=283.0s)]
*  Are you out of your fucking mind? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=285.0s)]
*  You crazy? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=288.0s)]
*  That is it's like the guy used to be the publisher of Rolling Stone magazine, man, in the 60s, in the 70s, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=289.0s)]
*  when Rolling Stone was the counterculture, he was telling me that they should regulate the Internet. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=299.0s)]
*  We had the most maddening conversation and I respect him so much and I love him so much for what he did in the past. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=304.0s)]
*  I think that was connected to, you know, the Internet kind of destroying magazine sales. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=309.0s)]
*  It could be. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=316.0s)]
*  But it's also, I think it's an ideology, man. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=318.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=322.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=325.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=327.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=329.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=331.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=333.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=335.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=337.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=339.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=341.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=343.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=345.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=347.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=349.0s)]
*  I think it's an ideology. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=351.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=353.0s)]
*  Well, maybe Kennedy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=354.0s)]
*  You know, Kennedy gave people hope. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=356.0s)]
*  It seemed like he was giving people hope. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=358.0s)]
*  But I mean, that was before my time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=360.0s)]
*  That was before your time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=362.0s)]
*  He was killed four years before I was born. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=363.0s)]
*  Did you like Carter? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=365.0s)]
*  Well, the thing about Carter is, if you listen to Carter talk, and this goes back to Rolling Stone magazine, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=367.0s)]
*  because Hunter S. Thompson went to Jimmy Carter's campaign speech. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=374.0s)]
*  And it was so moving to him that he actually went out to his car and got his tape recorder [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=379.0s)]
*  and brought it back in and started listening and recording it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=386.0s)]
*  And I don't think any president has the ability. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=390.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why the government is set up the way it's set up. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=396.0s)]
*  It's set up so the president can never become a tyrant. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=398.0s)]
*  So the president can't make his own laws. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=401.0s)]
*  This is how the government is divided. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=403.0s)]
*  But this is the concept behind the beginning of the country. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=406.0s)]
*  The beginning of the country. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=408.0s)]
*  I think even if you're a good person, you're in a bad job. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=410.0s)]
*  You're in a bad job with a bad machine. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=414.0s)]
*  And that machine wants to make money. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=416.0s)]
*  And if it's making money by selling people drugs or it's making money by going to war, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=418.0s)]
*  it's making money by fucking finagling the economy in some bizarre way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=421.0s)]
*  Anytime there's something to gain on the other end without public knowledge, it's going to be a problem. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=426.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=434.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=435.0s)]
*  That's the game. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=436.0s)]
*  The slide of hand trick. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=437.0s)]
*  That's the game. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=438.0s)]
*  That's the game they're in. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=439.0s)]
*  I mean, to pretend they don't do that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=440.0s)]
*  I felt like some things shouldn't be on the internet though. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=442.0s)]
*  So I was like, damn, there's nobody regulating this shit. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=446.0s)]
*  Like what? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=450.0s)]
*  Like a lot of things that people just... [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=451.0s)]
*  I don't know what a lot of people have followers for. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=454.0s)]
*  Because they're so far to the craziness. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=458.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=461.0s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=462.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=463.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=465.0s)]
*  But what's the alternative? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=466.0s)]
*  The alternative is like, here's the best thing about those crazy people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=467.0s)]
*  You and I can talk about those crazy people. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=471.0s)]
*  Look at these crazy bitches. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=473.0s)]
*  And then people can listen to us talk about them and they go, yeah, these people are crazy. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=474.0s)]
*  I kind of thought the world was flat for a few minutes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=477.0s)]
*  There's some people on it and I would say, man, damn, what are you talking about? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=484.0s)]
*  Then there's other people that have some sense. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=491.0s)]
*  You've got to be able to figure it out yourself. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=495.0s)]
*  The problem is most people don't think, and rightly so, don't think that most people can figure it out by themselves. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=497.0s)]
*  A large percentage of our population that's easily swayed. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=503.0s)]
*  That's why cults work. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=506.0s)]
*  And I always wonder, when people say they're selling dope, I'm like, for real? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=508.0s)]
*  It's passe. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=515.0s)]
*  With a cult, I'd be thinking, why would I join a cult when it's never been proven to be a good thing? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=517.0s)]
*  Show me all the good, successful cults. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=527.0s)]
*  I got to see one bad cult and I'm like, I don't want to go. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=535.0s)]
*  Well, if you want to expand that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=541.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=543.0s)]
*  Religion. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=544.0s)]
*  Religion is successful cults because someone's listen. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=545.0s)]
*  If there is, let's just imagine just for the sake of this conversation that there is a religious scripture that is 100% translated directly from God. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=549.0s)]
*  Well, if that's true, if there's one, that means all the other ones are wrong and all the other ones are cults. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=560.0s)]
*  See, the thing is this. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=567.0s)]
*  People don't know what things tie in together. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=568.0s)]
*  Now you have some side stories of people who didn't just create some side things for their own benefit. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=571.0s)]
*  But it's like the Mormons. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=577.0s)]
*  It's like a long debity of, hey, this is all the same line of things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=579.0s)]
*  And it, you know, transcends to the next to the next generation. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=585.0s)]
*  But then it's these things that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=589.0s)]
*  Once the prophecy stopped at some point, and then it's like people can claim themselves to be prophets with none of the other attachment like all the other prophets got the same thing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=593.0s)]
*  Some spoke to them in the night and they have they have they have some power at that particular time. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=605.0s)]
*  It's like these people can just say, hey, I'm a prophet. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=614.0s)]
*  Well, who spoke to you? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=618.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=620.0s)]
*  There's a voice coming through the wall. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=621.0s)]
*  Maybe you live in a apartment. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=623.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=626.0s)]
*  But it's like and they just what is your power? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=627.0s)]
*  Like, who are you? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=630.0s)]
*  Who are the people that you're supposed to have? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=631.0s)]
*  And it's no power is all you had to do is be charismatic. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=633.0s)]
*  But that's not that's not the in prophecy. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=638.0s)]
*  That's not the the criteria. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=643.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, I'm looking for somebody. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=646.0s)]
*  Can't think what God's doing. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=648.0s)]
*  It's not the job. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=651.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=654.0s)]
*  That's not the job. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=655.0s)]
*  But in with this society, it's the job. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=656.0s)]
*  But don't you think it's always been like that? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=659.0s)]
*  No, I think they didn't even want to do it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=661.0s)]
*  Like, no one would have been on art. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=665.0s)]
*  He was doing something else. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=667.0s)]
*  See, the thing about Noah in the art, though, if you go back to that, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=670.0s)]
*  that story is very similar to a story that's in the epic of Gilgamesh. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=673.0s)]
*  And most likely what that story is about, the Great Flood seems to very much be real, very much be real. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=677.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of physical evidence. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=684.0s)]
*  And there's a gentleman named Randall Carlson has been on my pie. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=686.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen any of those episodes? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=689.0s)]
*  No, I have been on my podcast many times. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=690.0s)]
*  He's an expert in asteroid collisions. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=692.0s)]
*  And this time in history where after this time, there's all these stories of floods, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=694.0s)]
*  it aligns directly with this thing called the Younger Dryas and the Younger Dryas impact theory. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=701.0s)]
*  The Younger Dryas is a time period around 11,800 years ago where they think the earth got hit by comets [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=707.0s)]
*  and they think civilization got basically wiped out. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=712.0s)]
*  And it makes sense because it first of all makes sense physically. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=715.0s)]
*  So sorry if people have heard this before. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=719.0s)]
*  I beat this fucking horse to death. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=721.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of evidence when they do core samples on the earth. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=723.0s)]
*  At that time period, there's a high level of iridium, which is very rare on earth, but very common in space. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=726.0s)]
*  And there's also nanodiamonds, which occur when there's an impact, when something hits. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=732.0s)]
*  And this is all over the world. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=737.0s)]
*  I 100% believe in this. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=739.0s)]
*  But every time I hear nanodiamonds... [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=743.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=745.0s)]
*  What do you think when you hear nanodiamonds? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=747.0s)]
*  You sound like you're selling jewelry in the middle of the mall. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=749.0s)]
*  These aren't diamonds. These are nanodiamonds. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=753.0s)]
*  These are nanodiamonds. They're different. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=756.0s)]
*  But yes, I believe that the earth has been hit by comets. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=758.0s)]
*  We're in space. How can you not? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=762.0s)]
*  There's evidence. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=764.0s)]
*  There's tons of evidence. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=766.0s)]
*  They found...was it Greenland or Iceland, that massive impact that they found? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=768.0s)]
*  The earth's been hit so many times, man. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=774.0s)]
*  It wasn't just the Yucatan one that killed the dinosaurs. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=777.0s)]
*  It's been many, many, many, many, many, many, many times it's been hit. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=780.0s)]
*  And in fact, this comet shower that we go through every year... [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=784.0s)]
*  31 kilometer, 19 mile wide meteorite crater discovered under a kilometer of Greenland ice had long puzzled scientists. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=787.0s)]
*  The Hawatha crater was exceptionally well preserved despite glacier ice being incredibly effective at erosion. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=797.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=803.0s)]
*  Damn, that's big. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=805.0s)]
*  19 miles, is that what it said? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=807.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a ton of those, man. They're all over the world. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=809.0s)]
*  There's a big one that's outside of Australia that they found. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=812.0s)]
*  Giant craters where it just...it totally makes sense. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=815.0s)]
*  It totally makes sense. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=819.0s)]
*  So this guy, along with this guy named Graham Hancock, who's also been on the podcast many times, a good friend of mine, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=821.0s)]
*  he has a documentary called Ancient Catastrophe. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=826.0s)]
*  Is that it? It's not Apocalypse, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=830.0s)]
*  Ancient Apocalypse. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=832.0s)]
*  Ancient Apocalypse. I always fuck those up. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=833.0s)]
*  Ancient Apocalypse that's on Netflix, it's amazing. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=835.0s)]
*  And it's all talking about these insane structures that people built in Africa, in Asia, all over the world, in Turkey. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=838.0s)]
*  These insane structures that predate modern civilization. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=847.0s)]
*  These are like 5,000 years before we think Mesopotamia emerged. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=852.0s)]
*  Huge stone columns, huge structures that they know for sure were 11,000 years old. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=857.0s)]
*  The show's amazing. It's an amazing show. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=864.0s)]
*  I think I've watched this. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=867.0s)]
*  It's really good. And he only touches the surface, because there's so many of these all over the world. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=869.0s)]
*  And Egypt is the best example. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=875.0s)]
*  The best example of it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=877.0s)]
*  Egypt is a fantastic example, because there's stuff that's under the sand that's even older than the massive stuff that's above the stand, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=878.0s)]
*  and the stuff under the sand that they find when they dig deeper. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=886.0s)]
*  It's a totally different style of building. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=889.0s)]
*  This is what the X-Clan used to rap about. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=892.0s)]
*  Mmm. Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=895.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the poor righteous teachers, that whole brand new... [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=897.0s)]
*  This is the pyramids and building of the stones, and the whole Egyptian culture, Timbuktu, the whole thing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=902.0s)]
*  So yeah, it's been around for a long time. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=911.0s)]
*  That's the wild shit. The wild shit is that if it wasn't for those stones, if everybody lived like we live today, in glass houses and shit, there'd be nothing left. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=914.0s)]
*  There'd be nothing. What would you find in a regular house made out of wooden glass? What the fuck is going to be there in 10,000 years? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=922.0s)]
*  Zero. Zero. There'd be nothing left. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=927.0s)]
*  You'd find nails. Oh, look, I found a nail. What would you find? You'd find a few things. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=930.0s)]
*  But most of it would be consumed by the earth. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=935.0s)]
*  Yeah, most of it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=937.0s)]
*  But those guys, they figured out something that no one... They bullshit that they could figure out how to do that today. They don't know how to do that today. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=938.0s)]
*  Well, somebody just came up with the whole, let's build it with wood. But it was probably so like in Haiti, they build with stone. They still build with Jamaica. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=947.0s)]
*  They still build with stone, with the whole house made out of cement. Most places do that. It has... [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=955.0s)]
*  They have hurricanes. Yeah, they have hurricanes. Their houses have to be sturdy as fuck. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=963.0s)]
*  So I don't know what was going on in Egypt at that time when they was building like that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=967.0s)]
*  I think they were beyond advanced. I think we are... Graham Hancock has this amazing quote. He said that human beings are a species with amnesia. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=972.0s)]
*  Oh, yes, for sure. For sure. Oh, for sure. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=982.0s)]
*  And I think the way we've gone today technologically with like phones and microphones and video cameras and shit, like we've gone into an electronic technology. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=985.0s)]
*  I think they went into another technology that was different, a different path, but way more powerful. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=994.0s)]
*  They were able to move stones out of the mountains and move them 500 miles. They don't have any fucking idea how they did it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1001.0s)]
*  The necessity, you know, work, figuring out things from necessity. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1007.0s)]
*  That, but I think thousands of years of thinking. I think, you know, when we think about the Industrial Revolution, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1012.0s)]
*  and we think about the way the world was just 2000 years ago to now, I think those people were recovering. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1020.0s)]
*  I think those people 2000 years ago were recovering from shit that happened thousands of years before that, where people were just knocked back into barbarism. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1026.0s)]
*  Just survival of the fittest, just wild shit because there was nothing left. We live in a Mad Max apocalypse, even worse. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1035.0s)]
*  Nuclear winter. When those things hit into the ground, the massive floods come. It also kicks up dust in the atmosphere. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1043.0s)]
*  Nothing grows. People are probably cannibalizing each other. It was probably horrific. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1050.0s)]
*  You ever read the book, The Ice Age and the Inheritance? No. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1055.0s)]
*  This is where it talks about people, how they went into the ice age and then they had to start cannibalizing each other because there was nothing growing in all of these other things. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1060.0s)]
*  Wow. Do you think we survive it now? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1070.0s)]
*  I think you and me might survive. I know a lot of people are eating. Some people keep fucking keep it together and some people can't. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1075.0s)]
*  It's going to be hard and it's not going to be fun and life might not be worth living in comparison. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1084.0s)]
*  There ain't comparison. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1091.0s)]
*  That's the thing. If you lived on the Great Plains in the 1800s and you were a Native American, that was your whole life. That's all you knew. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1092.0s)]
*  You knew how to hunt buffalo. You knew how to make teepees. You knew how to live off the land. That's all you knew. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1100.0s)]
*  If you took some fucking person from the east side of Manhattan, some person that works some cushy office job, and you said, Jerome, this is your new life. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1105.0s)]
*  You're going to live on the plains and you're going to make your own arrows and you're going to go fucking run around and try to shoot them into Buffalo. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1115.0s)]
*  And there's no doctors. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1122.0s)]
*  So is this what making an afraid is about? Are they getting ready for the apocalypse? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1124.0s)]
*  No, they're just exploiting dummies. They're just having fun with people's dicks. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1131.0s)]
*  Blurring them out of TV. It's crazy. That show's crazy. It's so dumb. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1136.0s)]
*  They got like 13 people out. You got to meet up in the form of tribe. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1143.0s)]
*  Yeah, they could do something like that. People would go evil real quick. If there was competing tribes, people would go evil real quick. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1151.0s)]
*  I think it's going to... If it jumps... No. Okay. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1158.0s)]
*  Well, during Katrina, it was survival to fitness. During this flood in Houston, it was survival to fitness. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1163.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1175.0s)]
*  It's been some times where people have shown their colors. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1176.0s)]
*  Yes. In small pockets. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1179.0s)]
*  Like my friend, he used to brag about having this Maserati. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1182.0s)]
*  And when the flood happened, his Maserati was floating down the street. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1187.0s)]
*  And I was in my truck. I was like, hey, you want me to come pick you and your Maserati up? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1192.0s)]
*  Because you're in a bad position, my boy. In Texas, you need a truck. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1197.0s)]
*  And it was survival. He couldn't move nowhere. So he needed help. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1202.0s)]
*  Yeah, when the freeze came out here, I was having a time of my life. I loved it. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1206.0s)]
*  There was snow everywhere and ice on the streets. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1212.0s)]
*  Because I have a 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser that I had built like as an apocalypse vehicle. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1214.0s)]
*  It's lifted. It's got off-road tires. It's got steel bumpers. It's got a winch. Yeah. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1221.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you was having a good time. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1229.0s)]
*  Big-ass gas tank. Huge gas tank. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1230.0s)]
*  You was having a good time. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1232.0s)]
*  I was having a great time. Because that car's meant for that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1234.0s)]
*  It was like my golden retriever when he sees the snow. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1236.0s)]
*  When he sees the snow, he's like, woo! He rolls around in his bag. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1239.0s)]
*  It's like he's having a party. It's the best thing he's ever seen. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1243.0s)]
*  That's what it's like when my truck saw that snow. My truck was like, yee-haw! [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1246.0s)]
*  Everybody else is like in Corvettes. They're sliding into oncoming traffic. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1251.0s)]
*  That's what happens when you have one of them little low-built cars or sports car, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1256.0s)]
*  and you don't have an off-road vehicle, something that's sturdy that can move things. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1261.0s)]
*  I have a truck in this. My truck is built for that. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1267.0s)]
*  If you're only going to have one vehicle in Texas, a truck is the way to go. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1270.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Big truck. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1273.0s)]
*  It really is. Just in case. Just in case. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1274.0s)]
*  It's the sign of the most pampered society that people have cars that you can't even fit luggage in. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1277.0s)]
*  And they're just fast. You have a race car, sir. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1286.0s)]
*  Why are you driving around town in a fucking race car? Where are you going? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1291.0s)]
*  Hey man, nothing like getting out of a truck in a tuxedo. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1295.0s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1299.0s)]
*  With boots on. That's what I see the guys. I'm like, man, that's crazy. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1301.0s)]
*  But man, a truck is the way to go. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1306.0s)]
*  People don't want to think about things going sideways, but they have all throughout history. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1308.0s)]
*  All throughout history there's been natural disasters, there's been wars, there's been crazy shit. All throughout history. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1313.0s)]
*  So why don't people want to think about that? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1319.0s)]
*  Because we like to think about what's in front of us right now. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1321.0s)]
*  The human mind is set up essentially for survival. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1324.0s)]
*  And we have the exact same brains as people that lived 10,000 years ago. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1329.0s)]
*  So the people that lived 10,000 years ago, if they in fact were hunter and gatherers, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1334.0s)]
*  and they probably were hunter and gatherers because the people before them were far more advanced [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1337.0s)]
*  and they were like rebooting society. That's what I think. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1341.0s)]
*  But those people, that life that they lived was all about get some fucking food, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1345.0s)]
*  find out what the dangers are around you right now in terms of your enemies and predators, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1350.0s)]
*  and get some fucking food and feed your family and try to stay alive. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1355.0s)]
*  That's all anybody wanted. They just wanted to stay alive. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1358.0s)]
*  So we have that in our head. And shit like climate change and UFOs, it's like, what am I going to do with that? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1362.0s)]
*  Shit like what if the power goes off? Yeah, but the power's on now. Shut the fuck up. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1369.0s)]
*  I got to deal with now. I got to deal with right now. We're designed for the now. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1374.0s)]
*  I don't think like that. I think long term. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1377.0s)]
*  Your guys experienced some very difficult moments in your life. That's what it is. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1382.0s)]
*  You've experienced a lot of adversity. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1387.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's the reason. But I'm thinking, I'm always thinking long term. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1389.0s)]
*  I always got to, you know, like I'm Jason Bourne. I'm on the move. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1394.0s)]
*  I want fast fucking cash. I'm not, I can't live for the now. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1399.0s)]
*  I used to do, I used to be like that. And that was, that was too fast. Way too fast. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1407.0s)]
*  Well, that's a young man's game. Young man's game is the now. You know, talk to a 19 year old kid. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1415.0s)]
*  What are you kind of thinking about fucking climate change? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1421.0s)]
*  Oh, I wish somebody would have told me at 19, hey listen, climate change. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1423.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe my tomatoes will be able to survive. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1428.0s)]
*  I think, you know, with having a healthy love for the elderly, because I would prefer to be one day. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1433.0s)]
*  And I would like to set things up for those people that's doing it now for when I get there. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1441.0s)]
*  I don't want to wait and then get there and be struggling. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1448.0s)]
*  Well, I'm 65 and I don't understand what's going on. Because comics, most comics don't have a retirement plan. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1451.0s)]
*  Most comics don't even have a monthly plan. Comics are the wildest fucking people I know. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1457.0s)]
*  They're the wildest people I know. They spend all their money. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1463.0s)]
*  And it was crazy. That's very true. That is very true. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1468.0s)]
*  Very true. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1475.0s)]
*  You know, I can't even think of all the comics. Because I'm a planner. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1476.0s)]
*  How many comics have come to me? Because they know I'm a planner and they just went out and just did some wild shit. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1481.0s)]
*  Like, I'm just, hey man, I'm living in LA now. What? I just saw you Tuesday. Yeah, I know. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1487.0s)]
*  Like, where you living at? I don't know. I'm just out here. What the hell are you talking about? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1493.0s)]
*  And then a month later, hey man, I'm calling from somebody else's phone. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1499.0s)]
*  You think he can send me $300 so I can get a ticket to come home? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1505.0s)]
*  Well, how am I going to get it to you? Hey man, you're going to have to wire it to this and that. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1512.0s)]
*  Some comics think that if they go to a spot, things will be different. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1519.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1524.0s)]
*  My wife and I lived in Colorado once for a little while and we lived in a log house on the top of a mountain. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1529.0s)]
*  And my wife had this idea that when she got in that log house, she'd start making bread. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1535.0s)]
*  Joe, you wild, man. You think she just moved to a log house? Yeah, I did. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1540.0s)]
*  The only thing that fucked me over was she got pregnant and when women are pregnant at very high altitude, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1545.0s)]
*  this is at 8,000 feet, I think 8,800 feet. It's very high. It's real rough on them. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1550.0s)]
*  Real bad. It's like the flu every day. And we went back to LA and when we went back to LA for like a week or two, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1555.0s)]
*  she was fine. And then we went back to Colorado, kicked right back in. I was like, oh no. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1560.0s)]
*  And then I read that Colorado, specifically Denver, has a very high rate of, unusually high rate of premature births. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1565.0s)]
*  They attribute to the high altitude. It's rough. It's rough on women. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1573.0s)]
*  So we had to get out of there. If it wasn't for me, it was just me by myself, I'd still be up there. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1578.0s)]
*  I would have never started a podcast. I'd still be up there living in the woods. Making bread. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1582.0s)]
*  I love it. I love that Land Cruiser. I'd just be like sitting there chilling. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1586.0s)]
*  That's the life that I'm going towards. I love it. Just being somewhere, being able to farm and grow my own vegetables. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1591.0s)]
*  Yes. Go outside and have my own kids and goats and things of that nature. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1599.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's very satisfying. There's something very satisfying. Just even about the idea of that. That's very satisfying. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1605.0s)]
*  Not having to be somewhere. I think that's the, I'm going to slow down in 2025. I have a plan. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1611.0s)]
*  Knock out Domino Effect 3 and 4. And then kind of relax for a while. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1619.0s)]
*  Because I don't think people know this about comics. You've probably experienced it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1626.0s)]
*  My body is on some type of clock where I have to be somewhere even when I don't. Which is troublesome to me. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1632.0s)]
*  I've gotten up and packed all my things up and didn't realize that I was already where I'm supposed to be. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1641.0s)]
*  Because my body is like, my mind basically is, you're supposed to be somewhere. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1650.0s)]
*  So it takes me, if I go on vacation, it has to be for like two weeks. Because the first week, it's crazy. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1657.0s)]
*  My mind is set on this clock of you've got a performance. You've got to be somewhere. You've got this to do. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1666.0s)]
*  And I don't like that feeling. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1672.0s)]
*  I got out of that. It took me a long time to get out of that. But I got out of that where I could enjoy vacation. I could just chill. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1674.0s)]
*  I got out of that where I could just sit in my backyard sometimes. Just sit down, have a cocktail, just relax. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1681.0s)]
*  That's what I want to do. Just be able to just sit and have nothing to do. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1687.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's real pleasure in that if you earn that. And you definitely have earned that. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1695.0s)]
*  There's real pleasure in that. But people like you and people like me that are constantly on the road and constantly working on this and working on that, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1701.0s)]
*  it's like you're on this momentum. And it's hard to hit the brakes. You're going downhill. Jesus fucking Christ. Like Flintstone brakes. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1708.0s)]
*  You know, it's hard. It's hard to slow down. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1715.0s)]
*  And you've got to get to a place where you feel like, or have a plan to get to a place where, okay, this is it for a while. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1718.0s)]
*  And then detox for that month. Because a month of not doing shows is horrible. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1726.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1736.0s)]
*  It's hard. It's horrible. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1737.0s)]
*  You get addicted to it, right? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1739.0s)]
*  It took me a while to get it. It took me about two months to get really get into the pandemic. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1741.0s)]
*  But once I got into it, I didn't want to come out of it. I was like, man, I'm cool, man. I can be with my family every day. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1746.0s)]
*  I'm growing my vegetables looking good. I'm having a good time. I don't have to be anywhere. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1756.0s)]
*  I can just go to the front and take on my camera. Hey, what's happening? And talk for a minute and then be done. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1762.0s)]
*  It was beautiful. It was beautiful. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1770.0s)]
*  So why'd you go back? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1773.0s)]
*  The addiction of being a performer. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1776.0s)]
*  Killing. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1781.0s)]
*  Addicted to having to finish the story. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1782.0s)]
*  Domino effect was in my mind and Domino effect 2 was in my mind. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1788.0s)]
*  So I was like, man, I got to get back to work. I think they were tired of me. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1794.0s)]
*  They were like, hey, he's been here too long. Maybe I was feeling cool. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1799.0s)]
*  And they were like, no, he needs to go work somewhere. He's doing everything. He's painting and building. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1804.0s)]
*  I was building something every week. It was great. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1810.0s)]
*  Well, that's why it always drives me crazy when people say they get bored. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1814.0s)]
*  Like, how you bored? There's so much to do. So you just got to find the thing. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1818.0s)]
*  And if it's not, if you don't have anything to do, just go experience something. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1824.0s)]
*  Yeah. Check something out. Get moving. Don't stay home. Don't just stay put. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1829.0s)]
*  That's why you're bored. There's nothing coming at you. Go somewhere. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1834.0s)]
*  Stay put. I haven't heard that in a long time. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1838.0s)]
*  My grandmother, she would say that because back then you couldn't go into, couldn't take children to liquor stores. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1842.0s)]
*  And my girl would get out of the car. She'd leave us in the car. Hey, hey, stay put. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1850.0s)]
*  My girl would tell me, be right here when she get back or she going to beat our ass. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1854.0s)]
*  Like, what? How did that even come into the conversation? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1859.0s)]
*  But we was right there when she got back. Yeah. We stood put. Stay put. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah. Staying around and being bored. I mean, that's of course that's going to happen. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1870.0s)]
*  People wonder why they're depressed. I mean, there's a lot of reasons why people are depressed, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1874.0s)]
*  but some people are depressed just because they're not doing anything. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1877.0s)]
*  Oh, man. You're just fucking filled with anxiety and just nothing. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1880.0s)]
*  You're just like alone, just trying to think of something to do. Bored out of your fucking mind. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1885.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. How you can't think of nothing to do when it's all outside? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1890.0s)]
*  Like, you can just, you can walk, I can walk out, because I'm from that era where we used to play outside. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1894.0s)]
*  So if I go outside, I'm going to find something to do. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1899.0s)]
*  If I find another person, we're going to find something to do. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1904.0s)]
*  If we find another person, oh no, this is a football game. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1908.0s)]
*  All we need is three people and a ball. And we throwing this ball up in the air, it's a hot ball. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1912.0s)]
*  Something, we're going to do something. Something's happening. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1917.0s)]
*  Do you remember children's playgrounds, how fucking dangerous they were? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1920.0s)]
*  With those metal contraptions, those houses you would climb inside of. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1926.0s)]
*  You thought that was dangerous? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1930.0s)]
*  Do they have those today? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1932.0s)]
*  I think they do, but they made out of rope now and it's really dangerous. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1933.0s)]
*  It's some little corded rope. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1937.0s)]
*  You tear your hand up, like, I prefer the balls. I grew up with the balls. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1940.0s)]
*  You could swing from them. That was my thing, the balls. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1944.0s)]
*  Even the spinning. I think I know people who dislocate their shoulder on the spinning thing. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1949.0s)]
*  Some big grown kid would come and spin all those kids on the thing. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1956.0s)]
*  And you'd hold on and they'd keep spinning it and then you'd just let go of your head. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1961.0s)]
*  You can't hold it no more. Those are the days of concussions, good concussions. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1965.0s)]
*  Yeah, well you learned. You definitely learned what hurts. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1970.0s)]
*  Oh, I definitely learned what hurt. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1973.0s)]
*  You never let the big kids spin your head ever again. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1976.0s)]
*  Those little big kids are mean. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1979.0s)]
*  It was crazy. You're six. You know you're 13, right? Why are you over here? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1981.0s)]
*  Especially boys. Teenage boys are the most dangerous animals on the planet. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1987.0s)]
*  Man, do you understand, I lived in some apartments where these guys, they were high teens. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=1993.0s)]
*  And when you went to go check the mail, because the mailbox was by the pool, they would try to throw you in the pool. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2002.0s)]
*  And you'd go check the mail and your mother would tell you, hey, don't bring my damn mail back here wet. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2013.0s)]
*  And you would have to sneak to the mailbox and open the mailbox so quietly, get the mail, and you hope nobody sees you. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2018.0s)]
*  Because if anybody saw you, they're going to say, hey, hey, the mailbox. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2033.0s)]
*  And now you got to run. Now you got to run because they're going to throw you in the pool. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2039.0s)]
*  I remember one time I got thrown in and I tried to hold the mail up. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2042.0s)]
*  I hated them apartments, man. I hate them. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2049.0s)]
*  Teenage kids, they're fucking dangerous. Because they have man strength and they just got it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2053.0s)]
*  They just got it. It's like lottery winners. They're like lottery winners. They just start spending all their money. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2059.0s)]
*  You know, lottery winners, they go broke quick because they're like, they never had this before and all of a sudden they have it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2065.0s)]
*  When you're 13 and all of a sudden you kind of have a man body and you're 14 and you're strong as shit and little kids, you could just yell at them and tell them what to do and make them do shit and smack them around. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2070.0s)]
*  The problem is this. When you do that and then one of the kids that you hurt have uncles that's close to your age. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2084.0s)]
*  You're 14, 15, and his uncle is 19 and he don't care nothing about none of that. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2096.0s)]
*  It's like, yo, hey man, you hurt my little cousin. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2105.0s)]
*  And then he got a little more skill. He got a little more tact to his newfound male strength. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2111.0s)]
*  Yeah, they know how to use it. A 19 year old is very different. You get 19, 20 and you know, those are men. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2120.0s)]
*  I was different. I was a pretty good fighter at 19. I started fighting maybe around 10. You get some good ones. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2130.0s)]
*  I remember when I knew the difference between being 13 and being 19 when my cousin got into a fight with these guys and this guy was thick. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2142.0s)]
*  All this was like really, he was a man. And he pushed me just in the stomach. He just pushed me. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2154.0s)]
*  He wasn't even trying to fight me. He was, everybody get back! And he pushed me and knocked all the air out of me. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2166.0s)]
*  I was like, man, what is happening? And I slowly started going to the ground. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2173.0s)]
*  If he would have actually punched me, if he was trying to, he would have wiped me out. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2178.0s)]
*  Because body shots are something different. That's a different shot. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2184.0s)]
*  People think that a body shot don't look as pretty as a shot to the head, but it's just as devastating, if not worse. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2189.0s)]
*  Like that Ryan Garcia one where Javante Davis caught him with that left hook to the body. People were saying that he quit. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2200.0s)]
*  He never been hitting the liver. Oscar De La Hoya quit the same way with Bernard Hopkins. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2206.0s)]
*  The same thing. Same body shot. Left hook to the body. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2211.0s)]
*  And he tried to take a step out that corner and not the front of his foot even moved. He just went down. He was like, man, this is it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2214.0s)]
*  And if you get kicked to the body, oh my God, a kick to the body is so goddamn devastating, especially a spinning back kick. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2226.0s)]
*  You could literally pick someone up in the air. It's like they got hit by a car. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2235.0s)]
*  Any kick to the... [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2240.0s)]
*  Want to see me when I was 19? Show me that video of me knocking that dude out when I was 19. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2242.0s)]
*  This is from a Taekwondo tournament. I hit this kid with a spinning back kick to the body. So you can see how hard... [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2247.0s)]
*  150 pounds on. 155 pounds. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2252.0s)]
*  155 pounds spinning around from that 244. That's not... [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2257.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. Even though I was light, like fairly light in comparison. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2261.0s)]
*  The amount of power that you can generate with your legs and what your ribs are. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2266.0s)]
*  Me and my daughter were doing this little art project and we're drawing zombie. This zombie thing. We're making this painting together. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2271.0s)]
*  And while we're doing this, we took a photo from the Internet of an actual rib cage so we could do it right and draw it correctly. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2277.0s)]
*  And I'm looking at it. I'm like, look at this fucking weird protection of all your squishy organs that are underneath there. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2284.0s)]
*  I mean, when you really think about it, these little skinny ass bones are the only thing that's protecting your soft lungs and your liver. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2294.0s)]
*  Like this is me in the blue. This is me when I was 19. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2304.0s)]
*  That dude was done. You get kicked in the body like that. You just... [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2317.0s)]
*  There's no volume on this. But you get kicked in the body like that. It's the worst feeling in the world. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2323.0s)]
*  Everything shuts down. You can't move. You can't move. Everything just goes... [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2329.0s)]
*  It's just electrocute...electrocution goes through your body. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2335.0s)]
*  Electric power. Just the thump. Just the compression of your organs. Just your whole body going into shock. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2340.0s)]
*  Your whole spinal column getting jolted. Your legs don't work anymore. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2348.0s)]
*  That's the problem. Your legs don't work. They just feel like... [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2352.0s)]
*  They just stop working. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2355.0s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2356.0s)]
*  You can tell them whatever the fuck you want. They're not listening. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2358.0s)]
*  You're trying to send shock waves from your brain to your legs. And then your legs are like, man, if you don't get the fuck out of here, I'm going down. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2361.0s)]
*  The most shocking to me was when I would get hit on the chin. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2370.0s)]
*  Because one time I got dropped. I got hit on the chin with a left hook. And my legs just went like this. They just shut off. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2373.0s)]
*  It wasn't like I got hurt. Like, oh my God, I'm hurt. I'm going down. They just went, shut off. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2379.0s)]
*  The legs just shut off. And I was like, Jesus Christ, what the fuck was that? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2384.0s)]
*  They just stopped working. It's like my whole system got short circuited. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2388.0s)]
*  They just go, boink. What a stupid design. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2394.0s)]
*  But this is just the jaw. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2396.0s)]
*  The jaw is really the turning of the... [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2398.0s)]
*  Sometimes not though. Because sometimes a straight shot just on the tip of the jaw knocks people out. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2404.0s)]
*  It's the whole compression of the head going back. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2409.0s)]
*  I think there's something else going on too, specifically with the jaw. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2413.0s)]
*  Because you could spin someone's head around in other ways, like on the cheek, and it doesn't seem to have the same effect the jaw does. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2417.0s)]
*  I think the nerves behind the jaw... [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2423.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. Whatever was going on in the jaw, I had a crown put in. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2427.0s)]
*  And the guy went too deep when he... [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2435.0s)]
*  We did a root canal? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2440.0s)]
*  No, when he tried to numb me up to put it in. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2442.0s)]
*  So he damaged the nerve that's in the lining of the jaw. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2447.0s)]
*  And it took like two months for that shit to heal. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2451.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2456.0s)]
*  And it was excruciating. It was excruciating. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2457.0s)]
*  Nerves are rough. Nerves take a long time. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2460.0s)]
*  It was excruciating. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2463.0s)]
*  And then I had to still perform, and I was doing meet and greets, and I was having the smiles. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2466.0s)]
*  And this crown here... Oh my goodness. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2473.0s)]
*  So did it make your face paralyzed? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2477.0s)]
*  I had to get all types of massages done. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2479.0s)]
*  Because the lining of my jaw, they had to adjust it like maybe four times. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2483.0s)]
*  Because it was terrible. It was terrible. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2487.0s)]
*  A lot of people get that... What is that called? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2491.0s)]
*  What's that disease when you have half your face... Bell's palsy. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2495.0s)]
*  Bell palsy. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2499.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2500.0s)]
*  I know a couple guys with that. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2501.0s)]
*  Half your face just starts working. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2502.0s)]
*  I know a couple guys with bad bell palsy. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2504.0s)]
*  Yeah. You don't realize how lucky you are to be healthy until you're not. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2506.0s)]
*  You got to take advantage of health. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2512.0s)]
*  God, it's the most important thing. And that's another thing. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2514.0s)]
*  People, they put all this effort into life, and they don't put effort into that. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2517.0s)]
*  Into health, which is crazy. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2522.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2523.0s)]
*  And then don't even try to look at the things that can make you more healthy. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2524.0s)]
*  The amount of research that people do... They'd rather scroll on their phone [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2531.0s)]
*  than just look up something that can be helpful to them personally. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2538.0s)]
*  Something that's good for you. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2542.0s)]
*  Which is weird. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2543.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. I think people don't think about the future that much. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2545.0s)]
*  I mean, they do a little bit, kind of abstract. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2548.0s)]
*  I hate that whole, you got to die from something. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2550.0s)]
*  You ain't got to die fucking miserable. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2553.0s)]
*  You ain't got to die. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2556.0s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that you don't have to die of. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2557.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2561.0s)]

*  than starving to death for the first time in history. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2567.0s)]

*  Terry Black's barbecue. What's up? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2575.0s)]

*  What's up, Terry Black's barbecue? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2585.0s)]
*  I definitely eat too much when I'm there. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2590.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2592.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2593.0s)]
*  We recreationally eat. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2594.0s)]
*  Yes, we do. We go just, oh man, let's go see what this is about. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2595.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2601.0s)]

*  and go in there like, oh man, they got a new doughnut place. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2608.0s)]
*  Let's go see what they talking about. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2613.0s)]
*  Like, why? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2615.0s)]
*  Because we have the currency. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2616.0s)]
*  We have the... [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2620.0s)]
*  Got a nice surplus. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2621.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2623.0s)]
*  Like, it's hard to go on the road once you... [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2624.0s)]
*  Texas is my home is where I grew up, Houston especially. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2629.0s)]
*  We have great food. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2634.0s)]
*  So then you go on the road other places and they say, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2636.0s)]
*  I'm going to take you to the best barbecue place. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2638.0s)]

*  There's some places that have good barbecue. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2647.0s)]
*  Apparently, Kansas City has good barbecue. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2648.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, not really. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2650.0s)]
*  No? It's a different thing, right? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2652.0s)]
*  Not like here. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2654.0s)]
*  No. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2655.0s)]
*  Do you know where it came from? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2656.0s)]
*  LA has the worst Mexican food of all times to me. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2658.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2664.0s)]
*  Yes, the worst. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2665.0s)]
*  Do you like Tex-Mex or regular Mexican? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2666.0s)]
*  Well, regular Mexican. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2668.0s)]
*  I lived in a Mexican neighborhood in Houston [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2669.0s)]
*  and they had the best food. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2672.0s)]
*  So I was like, I don't know, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2674.0s)]
*  this must be different. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2676.0s)]
*  As Texans, I don't know. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2677.0s)]
*  They're different Mexicans. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2678.0s)]
*  There's some spots in California. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2679.0s)]
*  You just got to go to the spots where the Mexicans go. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2681.0s)]
*  That's what... [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2684.0s)]
*  When I'm in LA, it's some food. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2685.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is your bed? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2688.0s)]
*  I can't even write. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2690.0s)]
*  I used to go to this place in the valley called The Big Burrito. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2691.0s)]
*  They got Mexican soap operas playing, nobody speaks English. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2694.0s)]
*  They have like Lengua quesadillas. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2697.0s)]
*  See, that's everywhere in Houston. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2700.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2702.0s)]
*  So it's like that's the spot. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2703.0s)]
*  The real shit. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2704.0s)]
*  Yes, that's where I'm going to go. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2705.0s)]
*  I learned how to make tamales. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2707.0s)]
*  I learned how to make tamales in this store called Fiesta [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2709.0s)]
*  from this Mexican lady who did not speak English [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2712.0s)]
*  and she had her granddaughter translating [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2715.0s)]
*  what she wanted me to write down. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2718.0s)]
*  And that's how I learned. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2720.0s)]
*  I got the pots. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2721.0s)]
*  I grinded them. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2722.0s)]
*  I said, the whole nine. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2723.0s)]
*  So it's hard for me to go places and say that... [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2725.0s)]
*  I was in... [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2728.0s)]
*  Well, I was at St. Louis, Kansas City. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2729.0s)]

*  I'm going to go. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2742.0s)]
*  We eating, it was like this, hey man, look. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2747.0s)]
*  When you don't season your batter... [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2751.0s)]
*  See, that's a normal thing everywhere in Houston. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2754.0s)]
*  It's too many fish places that I can go to eat. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2758.0s)]
*  And then when Maryland told me we got the best blue crab, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2762.0s)]
*  man, I live on the Gulf. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2765.0s)]
*  You don't think we have blue crab here? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2767.0s)]
*  Like, we got a lot of food here. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2769.0s)]
*  A lot of food. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2774.0s)]
*  A lot. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2775.0s)]

*  I eat, that's the problem. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2787.0s)]
*  I eat everything, all cultures, if your food is good. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2789.0s)]
*  I live in a place that happens to have all cultures, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2793.0s)]
*  and they have great food. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2796.0s)]
*  If I want any type of African food, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2799.0s)]
*  I can just go on Bissonette in Houston. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2801.0s)]
*  I can start at any end of Bissonette, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2803.0s)]
*  and I'm going to find good African food. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2805.0s)]
*  We have five Chinatowns in Houston. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2807.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2810.0s)]
*  There's five Chinatowns? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2811.0s)]
*  Five Chinatowns. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2812.0s)]
*  Isn't Houston the third biggest city in the country? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2813.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2815.0s)]
*  That's a big country. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2816.0s)]
*  That's a big city for this country. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2817.0s)]
*  It's like, man, it's a place. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2819.0s)]

*  It's, oh, man. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2831.0s)]
*  Well, Houston was the best comedy scene in the world [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2832.0s)]
*  at one point in time, in the 80s. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2835.0s)]
*  I still think that Houston is the greatest comedy scene. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2837.0s)]
*  We put out a lot of great comedies. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2840.0s)]
*  We don't have the clubs anymore, though. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2842.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2844.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2845.0s)]
*  Yeah, Improv is there. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2846.0s)]
*  Secret Group is there. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2847.0s)]
*  They used to have the Laugh Stop. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2850.0s)]
*  Laugh Stop and River Rocks. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2851.0s)]
*  Yeah, they used to have the Laugh Stop, the Laugh Spot. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2852.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2854.0s)]
*  The Laugh Spot went under, too? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2855.0s)]
*  Yeah, both. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2857.0s)]
*  Do you remember Spellbinders? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2859.0s)]
*  I heard about it. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2861.0s)]
*  I never went there. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2862.0s)]
*  Yeah, Spellbinders. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2863.0s)]
*  We had Spellbinders, and then Improv brought out [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2864.0s)]
*  what the Spellbinders is. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2867.0s)]
*  So it's the Improv and the Secret Group. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2868.0s)]
*  And then I think they got a new comedy called Rise. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2872.0s)]
*  The Comedy Lounge on the north side. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2875.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2879.0s)]
*  Well, the Improv is a great club. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2880.0s)]
*  That's a great club. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2882.0s)]
*  That was the first club I did coming back. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2884.0s)]
*  I did that in July. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2886.0s)]
*  I did one weekend. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2887.0s)]
*  And then I got real high and I got paranoid [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2888.0s)]
*  that I was going to give people COVID, like my guests, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2890.0s)]
*  because I'm so selfish and I want to do the road. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2892.0s)]
*  Even though I was getting tested every day, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2894.0s)]
*  I was like, what if it slips? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2896.0s)]
*  What if I got a false negative? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2898.0s)]
*  So I stopped. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2900.0s)]
*  But I had a great time there. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2901.0s)]
*  Speaking of great clubs, I stopped in last night [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2903.0s)]
*  at the mothership. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2906.0s)]
*  That's pretty wild, right? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2907.0s)]
*  Pretty nice. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2909.0s)]
*  That's a nice comedy club. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2912.0s)]
*  Very comic friendly. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2913.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2915.0s)]
*  Well, comic built it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2916.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2918.0s)]
*  And I built it specifically just for us. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2920.0s)]
*  I didn't build it like a business. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2923.0s)]
*  It was like, if I was my accountant, I'd go crazy. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2925.0s)]
*  Because the whole idea was I just want to break even. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2928.0s)]
*  I just want to build it and make it the most [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2930.0s)]
*  friendly place ever for comedians. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2932.0s)]
*  So the comedians make plenty of money. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2934.0s)]
*  Everybody's happy. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2936.0s)]
*  Everybody's packed. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2937.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful room. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2939.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful curtain and the way the lights. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2940.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2945.0s)]
*  It's dope. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2946.0s)]
*  Then the name Fat Man and Little Boy. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2947.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2951.0s)]
*  You know what that's from? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2952.0s)]
*  Yeah, the bombs. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2953.0s)]
*  But you know why? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2954.0s)]
*  No, I don't know why you did it. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2955.0s)]
*  Because that's when the UFO started coming. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2956.0s)]
*  That's when UFO started coming? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2958.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2959.0s)]
*  It's part of UFO folklore. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2960.0s)]
*  That's why when you walk in the middle of the lobby, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2961.0s)]
*  there's that giant UFO. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2963.0s)]
*  That's what that's for. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2964.0s)]
*  That UFO is a replica of that. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2965.0s)]
*  And that is a replica of the craft that Bob Lazar, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2968.0s)]
*  a guy who was a propulsion expert who was a whistleblower [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2972.0s)]
*  who worked at Area S4 in Area 51 in the Nevada desert, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2976.0s)]
*  back engineering alien spacecrafts, supposedly. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2980.0s)]
*  But this is what he described. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2983.0s)]
*  And that's what we put in there. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2985.0s)]
*  The whole club, the whole idea of the comedy mothership, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2986.0s)]
*  the whole idea is the club's themed on UFOs. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2989.0s)]
*  That's the whole idea behind it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2994.0s)]
*  That's why there's that crazy gateway over the stage [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2995.0s)]
*  that looks like a starport. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=2999.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3001.0s)]
*  When they detonated the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3002.0s)]
*  that's when UFOs started coming. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3006.0s)]
*  And all the UFO activity ramped up substantially. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3008.0s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3011.0s)]
*  Because I think they realized we have nukes. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3013.0s)]
*  Like, these crazy motherfuckers. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3014.0s)]
*  They just wiped out whole cities with nukes. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3016.0s)]
*  These fucking assholes, they had to come down and go, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3019.0s)]
*  whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing, man? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3022.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3025.0s)]
*  That's why you think they came. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3027.0s)]
*  Like, hey, they got nuclear weapons. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3029.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3032.0s)]
*  Who gave them nuclear weapons? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3033.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I think they realized we reached a level [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3034.0s)]
*  of technological sophistication [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3036.0s)]
*  that we could kind of kill everybody on Earth. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3038.0s)]
*  Oh, you think one of them went rogue and taught us? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3040.0s)]
*  I don't think one of them went rogue and taught us, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3044.0s)]
*  because there's a very, like, if you go [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3046.0s)]
*  and look at the Manhattan Project [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3048.0s)]
*  and you go and look at the history of splitting the atom, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3050.0s)]
*  there's a very clear academic paper trail [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3053.0s)]
*  of how they figured this out [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3057.0s)]
*  and all the trials that they did [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3059.0s)]
*  and what they did when they detonated the Trinity bomb, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3061.0s)]
*  which, by the way, was one of the first times [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3064.0s)]
*  they ever discovered those nanodiamonds. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3066.0s)]
*  It's called, I think they called it Trinitite, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3067.0s)]
*  and it's like nuclear glass, they call it as well. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3069.0s)]
*  And it's what happens when a massive impact hits sand, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3072.0s)]
*  and it turns it into this kind of glass. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3075.0s)]
*  I think that, because when you come with all the visits, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3078.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3083.0s)]
*  what were they visiting to do? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3085.0s)]
*  Because I know, you know, they all say, like, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3088.0s)]
*  we caught one or something like that. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3090.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3092.0s)]
*  You know, if you did, did you try to torture him [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3093.0s)]
*  and get stuff out of him? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3096.0s)]
*  What would be the next step? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3098.0s)]
*  What would be the thing? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3101.0s)]
*  But what were the visits if they wasn't teaching something? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3102.0s)]
*  Because I believe in it. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3106.0s)]
*  I just don't know what they were visiting to do. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3107.0s)]
*  Well, the way I describe it is, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3109.0s)]
*  there's a great show on Netflix called Chimp Empire, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3111.0s)]
*  and Chimp Empire is all about these scientists [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3114.0s)]
*  that are embedded in this chimp tribe, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3116.0s)]
*  and they've been there for 30 years. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3118.0s)]
*  Because these scientists have been there for 30 years, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3120.0s)]
*  the chimpanzees behave like there's no people there. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3122.0s)]
*  They can get within 20 feet of these chimpanzees. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3125.0s)]
*  Chimpanzees, as long as they don't eat in front of them [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3127.0s)]
*  and as long as they never present any sort of danger, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3130.0s)]
*  raise their voices, and as long as they just stay back, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3132.0s)]
*  the chimps don't pay attention to them at all. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3135.0s)]
*  They just go throughout their life. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3136.0s)]
*  And so these scientists are observing these chimpanzees, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3138.0s)]
*  and then these cinematographers captured all of this. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3141.0s)]
*  I think the way we treat chimpanzees is probably, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3144.0s)]
*  and they let them kill each other, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3147.0s)]
*  they do wild shit to each other, these chimps. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3149.0s)]
*  They engage in territorial warfare, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3151.0s)]
*  they fight over access to fruit. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3153.0s)]
*  I think the aliens would treat us the same way. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3155.0s)]
*  I think they would observe us but not do anything. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3159.0s)]
*  And I think if we did something fucking dangerous, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3161.0s)]
*  like nuclear bombs, then they would go, whoa, okay. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3164.0s)]
*  Because I think if alien societies do exist, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3168.0s)]
*  an intelligent life is out there in the universe. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3172.0s)]
*  I think what happens is they keep getting more and more and more and more sophisticated, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3174.0s)]
*  and in the beginning they engage in tribal warfare, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3179.0s)]
*  and as they become more and more sophisticated, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3182.0s)]
*  their technology becomes far too dangerous to keep doing that same shit. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3185.0s)]
*  And that's when they observe them, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3189.0s)]
*  because it's this perilous tipping point where we could completely wipe out life on Earth, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3191.0s)]
*  or we can evolve and get to the next stage of existence [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3197.0s)]
*  where we could coexist harmoniously throughout the universe [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3201.0s)]
*  and join some fucking global, some rather universal group of beings. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3205.0s)]
*  It's possible. But the only way that's possible is if we don't nuke ourselves. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3214.0s)]
*  So with the chimpanzees, they observe it. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3218.0s)]
*  The scientists are there, they observe them. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3222.0s)]
*  And they see them, they don't pay attention. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3224.0s)]
*  See, the problem with us, that we're scared. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3227.0s)]
*  If we see an alien, I'm not going to pay attention. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3230.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3235.0s)]
*  I'm going, ha! Who the fuck did this? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3237.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3239.0s)]
*  It's like being in black. They've got to look normal. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3240.0s)]
*  I believe that it's definitely other life forms, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3243.0s)]
*  it's definitely other civilizations that's happening, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3246.0s)]
*  that we're just not ready for. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3249.0s)]
*  I don't think we're ready. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3251.0s)]
*  I don't think we're ready. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3253.0s)]
*  We've got to be groomed. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3254.0s)]
*  Do you think that there's like all these UFO sightings, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3256.0s)]
*  the government talking about UFOs, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3258.0s)]
*  and this whistleblower that came out and said there's a crash retrieval program, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3260.0s)]
*  and we have crashed vehicles, and they've recovered alien bodies? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3265.0s)]
*  You believe and I believe, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3269.0s)]
*  but it's the old man like hell no. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3271.0s)]
*  I'm not messing with it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3274.0s)]
*  Because he's not ready for the difference. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3276.0s)]
*  It's some hillbilly that just now got used to seeing black people. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3281.0s)]
*  He's ready. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3286.0s)]
*  For gray people. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3289.0s)]
*  He's ready for shit else. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3291.0s)]
*  He's like, hey man, what else, man? God damn! [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3293.0s)]
*  You got like six eyes, man. What is this shit? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3298.0s)]
*  He's not ready. He's not ready, man. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3301.0s)]
*  I wonder if that's what they're doing by these sightings. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3304.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's like a trickle effect. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3307.0s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3309.0s)]
*  Like with the Jetsons, we still don't believe in the Jetsons. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3310.0s)]
*  And we, like nobody, so they were already pulling people up on big screens, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3314.0s)]
*  talking to each other and shit on the Jetsons. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3321.0s)]
*  And my mother was watching the Jetsons. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3324.0s)]
*  Who thought that the Jetsons, so when it happened, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3326.0s)]
*  you just went and got it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3330.0s)]
*  It's $800. You just got excited about having it. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3332.0s)]
*  Instead of, what the fuck? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3336.0s)]
*  Now you, because it's the Jetsons. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3338.0s)]
*  You in this time frame. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3340.0s)]
*  It has to be a groom. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3342.0s)]
*  It's like, okay, let's see how they act with ET. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3344.0s)]
*  Okay, they seem to love that movie. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3348.0s)]
*  Shit, let's throw Alf out there. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3351.0s)]
*  Let's see if they're ready for a furry one. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3354.0s)]
*  Alf? I forgot about Alf. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3357.0s)]
*  Then he's like, hey, maybe the Muppets. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3360.0s)]
*  Maybe the Muppets, big ass bird. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3363.0s)]
*  Just rolling around and talking, snuggling. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3365.0s)]
*  It's some, then we go, we advance up to, what was that? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3368.0s)]
*  The Man from Mars and then The Great Gazoo. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3374.0s)]
*  And then now we up to Men in Black. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3378.0s)]
*  And this shit is all right. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3381.0s)]
*  You know, because it's, you know, the man, it's a trickle. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3383.0s)]
*  It's a, ah, we got to keep feeding it to him. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3387.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you just see some, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3390.0s)]
*  somebody just come down the spaceship at McDonald's. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3394.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey, what's up, y'all, y'all good? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3397.0s)]
*  Let me get two Big Macs. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3399.0s)]
*  We love y'all, it's Earth food. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3402.0s)]
*  And then you like, and then you like, hey man, you saw that? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3404.0s)]
*  You like, yeah, I saw that shit last week. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3407.0s)]
*  And then that's it. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3409.0s)]
*  Now you got to get accustomed to it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3411.0s)]
*  What year was the Jetson supposed to be? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3414.0s)]
*  I just looked, it was made in 1962. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3416.0s)]
*  Let me guess. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3419.0s)]
*  And it was 100 years in the future. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3420.0s)]
*  100 years in the future, oh, okay. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3422.0s)]
*  So 2062. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3423.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3424.0s)]
*  And here's some of the stuff they had. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3425.0s)]
*  They had flying cars. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3427.0s)]
*  They'll never get us that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3428.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3429.0s)]
*  They'll never get us that. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3430.0s)]
*  Robotic dogs. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3431.0s)]
*  People drunk flying, hell no. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3432.0s)]
*  They had robotic vacuums, video calls, tablet computers, robotic house help. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3435.0s)]
*  They had tablets? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3440.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3441.0s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3442.0s)]
*  They were for spicing these pockets. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3443.0s)]
*  Flying cars, smart watches. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3445.0s)]
*  They had smart watches, drones, holograms, 3D printed food. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3446.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3452.0s)]
*  They had a pill cam. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3455.0s)]
*  We're swallowing, it sees your body. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3457.0s)]
*  Oh, look at George. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3459.0s)]
*  He knows that's going up his ass. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3460.0s)]
*  Black screen TVs. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3463.0s)]
*  Jet packs. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3465.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3467.0s)]
*  There's a few other articles that do the same thing. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3468.0s)]
*  The jet packs they have now, is that one dude that's got wings on his jet pack and they've [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3473.0s)]
*  caught him flying around buildings and shit? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3479.0s)]
*  I don't think they last long. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3482.0s)]
*  I think you can only stay up there for a few minutes. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3485.0s)]
*  But you can fucking fly until you run out of gas. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3488.0s)]
*  This is a whole lot of this. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3492.0s)]
*  What is this one? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3494.0s)]
*  That was 10 years ago. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3495.0s)]
*  What's the most recent? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3496.0s)]
*  What can they do now? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3498.0s)]
*  I've seen that guy I think in, might be Dubai. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3500.0s)]
*  Jet wing suit? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3504.0s)]
*  I think it's the best one there is right now. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3505.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3507.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3508.0s)]
*  That is fucking wild. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3509.0s)]
*  The jet wing. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3512.0s)]
*  Is there a video of these guys using this? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3513.0s)]
*  I figured there would be on their website. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3516.0s)]
*  We could go to Instagram. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3518.0s)]
*  You definitely got to have on a fireproof pajama set. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3519.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3522.0s)]
*  Look at this motherfucker. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3523.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3524.0s)]
*  He's flying around buildings. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3525.0s)]
*  That shit crazy. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3526.0s)]
*  What are the odds of those things failing? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3527.0s)]
*  That's not like a Toyota Corolla. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3530.0s)]
*  Those things aren't reliable. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3533.0s)]
*  That's fucking emerging technology. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3536.0s)]
*  You're going to be risking your life flying over highways? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3538.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3541.0s)]
*  Hell no. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3543.0s)]
*  But if that happens in the future, the problem is people are just going to be doing it just [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3544.0s)]
*  like you see people on the highway riding wheelies, just flying down the highway. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3548.0s)]
*  Just wild shit. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3552.0s)]
*  Wild shit. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3553.0s)]
*  They're going to be doing that in the air, slamming into houses. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3554.0s)]
*  That's why they're not going to give you flying cars. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3556.0s)]
*  I'm really not messing with this car. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3559.0s)]
*  Just get in and just let the car drive for you. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3562.0s)]
*  I'm not trusting it like that. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3565.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't trust it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3566.0s)]
*  I have it. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3567.0s)]
*  I don't trust it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3568.0s)]
*  You have it? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3569.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have a Tesla. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3570.0s)]
*  You just get in and just. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3571.0s)]
*  I can. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3572.0s)]
*  And say, hey, take me to. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3573.0s)]
*  Enter in your address that you want to go to. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3576.0s)]
*  Press auto navigate. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3579.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3580.0s)]
*  And it takes off. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3581.0s)]
*  Stop some red lights. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3582.0s)]
*  No. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3583.0s)]
*  You're supposed to keep your hand on the wheel though. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3584.0s)]
*  You're supposed to keep your hand on the wheel? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3587.0s)]
*  Yeah, just in case. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3589.0s)]
*  Man, I be seeing people laid back. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3590.0s)]
*  Snoozing. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3593.0s)]
*  Like, nah, I can't. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3594.0s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3595.0s)]
*  So that's a driverless taxi? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3596.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen them around Austin. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3598.0s)]
*  I've seen them too. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3599.0s)]
*  Do they just drive real slow? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3600.0s)]
*  Man, I'm not checking for a fan. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3602.0s)]
*  I am. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3605.0s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3606.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the future. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3607.0s)]
*  No. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3608.0s)]
*  We're looking at that. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3609.0s)]
*  We're saying. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3610.0s)]
*  I think people don't realize that they trying to get rid of you with this. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3611.0s)]
*  Like, I don't do self-checkout because it doesn't make sense to me. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3616.0s)]
*  Why am I helping them get you out of here? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3620.0s)]
*  And I know I want to talk to a person if something goes wrong. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3622.0s)]
*  I don't do self-checkout. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3625.0s)]
*  And plus, I don't come nowhere to work. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3626.0s)]
*  I just got off work. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3628.0s)]
*  Why would I come in here to work? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3629.0s)]
*  Well, you're from a different generation. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3630.0s)]
*  And the generation of kids that are coming up today. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3632.0s)]
*  How many of them Uber? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3634.0s)]
*  They don't even have cars? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3635.0s)]
*  How easy? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3636.0s)]
*  A lot of people Uber now. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3637.0s)]
*  They just take lifts and Ubers everywhere. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3638.0s)]
*  Okay, so this generation Uber. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3640.0s)]
*  Then the next generation Uber. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3643.0s)]
*  Who knows how to drive the car in the third generation? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3645.0s)]
*  Well, then you're going to be having these things. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3647.0s)]
*  There's going to be a generation, whether it's our grandchildren or their grandchildren, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3650.0s)]
*  that never drives. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3654.0s)]
*  No one drives their own car. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3656.0s)]
*  Everybody has an automated vehicle. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3657.0s)]
*  That's like writing. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3659.0s)]
*  They take writing. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3660.0s)]
*  Kids don't learn in school how to write. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3661.0s)]
*  They don't learn cursive. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3663.0s)]
*  And they don't learn cursive. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3664.0s)]
*  That's crazy to me. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3665.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3666.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3667.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3668.0s)]
*  Well, they're all just typing on their phones and typing on their computers. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3669.0s)]
*  That don't mean get rid of writing. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3672.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3674.0s)]
*  They took the clock out of the school because people have digital. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3676.0s)]
*  But you still want them to be able to tell time. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3680.0s)]
*  America is not the world. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3683.0s)]
*  You're going to probably go somewhere else in the world and you're going to have to write something. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3685.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3690.0s)]
*  And you see a clock and you're like, what the fuck is that? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3691.0s)]
*  You're used to digital. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3696.0s)]
*  And then when you used to get offended when people said stupid Americans, now you're like, I understand. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3697.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3702.0s)]
*  This country is crazy, man. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3704.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's some Americans that they go abroad. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3707.0s)]
*  They just act like fucking assholes. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3710.0s)]
*  They think they're allowed to because they're in another country. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3712.0s)]
*  They ruin it for everybody else. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3715.0s)]
*  No, I think Locked Up Abroad has changed that whole ideology. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3718.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3722.0s)]
*  Locked Up Abroad has changed. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3723.0s)]
*  Oh, I go anywhere and do whatever I want to do. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3724.0s)]
*  You've seen the show Locked Up Abroad? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3727.0s)]
*  No. Watch a couple of episodes. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3729.0s)]
*  Watch a couple of episodes and then go over to Yugoslavia and see how you feel about that, man. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3731.0s)]
*  And then when people get taken. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3736.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3740.0s)]
*  Like, man, I don't go anywhere and don't check in with the embassy. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3741.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3746.0s)]
*  I need to know. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3747.0s)]
*  I need somebody to know where I'm at. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3748.0s)]
*  So when you go to a country to work, you check in with the embassy? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3749.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3752.0s)]
*  I'm in town. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3753.0s)]
*  I need to know where y'all at and what's the rules. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3754.0s)]
*  Yeah, I need to know because I'm not going somewhere and don't know where the embassy is. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3756.0s)]
*  I watched Jason Bourne. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3761.0s)]
*  At least you can run to the embassy and you're safe, at least in that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3763.0s)]
*  But if I go to Dallas, I live in Houston. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3767.0s)]
*  If I go to Dallas, I'm checking in with the embassy. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3770.0s)]
*  I'm nothing. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3772.0s)]
*  I need somebody to know where I'm at, man. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3773.0s)]
*  I'm just not rocking with being in this world without somebody knowing my whereabouts. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3778.0s)]
*  Even though I'm a grown man, I'm going to say something to somebody. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3786.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm going to roll over here. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3790.0s)]
*  I need a witness or an alibi. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3793.0s)]
*  I need something. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3796.0s)]
*  I don't believe in being in the world by yourself. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3797.0s)]
*  I just don't. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3800.0s)]
*  That's a good move. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3801.0s)]
*  The world is definitely not America either. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3805.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3806.0s)]
*  It's not. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3807.0s)]
*  Look what happened to Brittany Greiner. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3808.0s)]
*  That would not happen in America. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3810.0s)]
*  Russians come to America and they do all kinds of... [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3812.0s)]
*  Russians fight in the UFC almost every weekend and no one cares. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3814.0s)]
*  No one gets mad at them. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3818.0s)]
*  No one screams at them. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3820.0s)]
*  No one throws things at them. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3821.0s)]
*  They go out there. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3822.0s)]
*  People cheer when they win. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3823.0s)]
*  There's a ton of Russian fighters that are in the UFC. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3825.0s)]
*  You know something? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3828.0s)]
*  Me and a friend of mine was talking, another comic, Gerard G. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3830.0s)]
*  And we was talking. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3837.0s)]
*  He said, man, this country is crazy. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3839.0s)]
*  You remember when Floyd Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3842.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3847.0s)]
*  In the same country where they... [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3848.0s)]
*  I'm talking holding up the flag and United States all the way, the 7th and 3rd. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3851.0s)]
*  We was talking. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3857.0s)]
*  He said, man, this was the first time he was at a fight party, a white fight party. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3858.0s)]
*  And he said, I hope he kicks the shit out of Floyd. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3864.0s)]
*  He said, what? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3868.0s)]
*  He said, you couldn't find one Filipino in the world that was going for Floyd Mayweather. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3870.0s)]
*  Not one. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3876.0s)]
*  But you could find a bunch of Americans. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3877.0s)]
*  Somebody who was born and raised right in Michigan. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3879.0s)]
*  You could find a bunch of Americans who was wanting the Filipino to beat him. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3882.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3885.0s)]
*  I have a good point. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3886.0s)]
*  Filipinos are very proud. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3887.0s)]
*  Very nationalistic people. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3889.0s)]
*  They love Manny Pacquiao. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3891.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3893.0s)]
*  My son is a very gentle soul. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3894.0s)]
*  And Manny Pacquiao was one of the ones I showed him. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3897.0s)]
*  Because he... [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3900.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3901.0s)]
*  To be a boxer, my 12 year old, he doesn't really want to beat you up. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3902.0s)]
*  I'm like, but I saw you had to hit people. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3908.0s)]
*  But damn, you know, I'm just... [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3912.0s)]
*  I said, let me show you one of the most gentle people in the world until he gets in that ring. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3914.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3919.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3920.0s)]
*  And I showed him Manny Pacquiao and Mike Tyson. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3921.0s)]
*  I was like, look, these are gentle people. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3924.0s)]
*  And then they get in the ring and another button happens. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3927.0s)]
*  That's how you're going to have to be. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3930.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3932.0s)]
*  Did you see the Mayweather Gotti thing yesterday? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3934.0s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3937.0s)]
*  So John Gotti, the mobster, his grandson... [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3939.0s)]
*  Okay, the brawl. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3945.0s)]
*  So what happened was this is the end of the fight. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3946.0s)]
*  But if you could see if you could find what caused it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3948.0s)]
*  Because there's a video that shows the end of the fight. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3951.0s)]
*  And in the end of the fight, what happened was if you just Google, just tweet, like put Mayweather Pacquiao in Twitter, you'll find it. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3954.0s)]
*  Excuse me, Mayweather Gotti. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3962.0s)]
*  What caused it? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3964.0s)]
*  He was holding. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3966.0s)]
*  So he wouldn't stop. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3967.0s)]
*  Floyd was boxing him up. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3968.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3969.0s)]
*  So Floyd is just piecing him up. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3970.0s)]
*  So Floyd, you know, I mean, even at 46, he's the greatest of all time. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3972.0s)]
*  And this kid is really an MMA fighter. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3976.0s)]
*  He's a tough guy. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3978.0s)]
*  He caught Floyd a couple of times, some little shots. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3979.0s)]
*  But mostly he's just getting boxed up, right? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3982.0s)]
*  Boxed up by literally the greatest boxer of all time. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3985.0s)]
*  But he was holding on quite a bit and wouldn't let go and was trying to like hold and clinch and hit, which is something like right here. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3988.0s)]
*  Which is something you can do in MMA. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3996.0s)]
*  So he's protecting himself from Floyd, but he's not letting go. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=3999.0s)]
*  And so Kenny Bayless gets tired of him not listening and not letting go. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4003.0s)]
*  And he pushes him off and he says, that's it. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4007.0s)]
*  I'm stopping this fight. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4009.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4011.0s)]
*  You won't listen to me. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4012.0s)]
*  I am calling this fight. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4013.0s)]
*  So he goes crazy and gets away from Kenny Bayless and just starts wailing punches at Floyd. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4014.0s)]
*  Look at Floyd catches him on the counter right there. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4020.0s)]
*  Bang. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4022.0s)]
*  Yeah, knocked him way over that he won't. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4023.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the other guy got the win too. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4025.0s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, it became a melee. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4027.0s)]
*  And so then there's fights in the ring and then there's fights outside the ring. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4030.0s)]
*  There's all this cell phone footage of footage of people brawling and sucker punch each other. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4034.0s)]
*  I saw some of that. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4039.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4040.0s)]
*  There's sometimes this be the. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4042.0s)]
*  Yeah, here's the brawls outside. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4045.0s)]
*  Everybody's fighting. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4048.0s)]
*  Just random brawls. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4049.0s)]
*  Just people just screaming and yelling at each other. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4050.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, just. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4052.0s)]
*  You know, he was just getting frustrated. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4056.0s)]
*  Before he was just boxing him up, which is what he does. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4057.0s)]
*  That's what you came into his sport. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4061.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4064.0s)]
*  Got into his arena. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4065.0s)]
*  You crawled into the snake hole and then got mad at the snake for biting you. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4066.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't bite me like that. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4071.0s)]
*  Like you in my hole. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4073.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why he didn't listen, why he didn't let go. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4074.0s)]
*  I don't know if they were talking shit to each other. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4077.0s)]
*  I don't know what was going on. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4079.0s)]
*  But Kenny said, that's it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4080.0s)]
*  That's a wrap. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4082.0s)]
*  And then everybody went crazy. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4083.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4085.0s)]
*  Including him. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4086.0s)]
*  I probably didn't expect that. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4087.0s)]
*  Probably thought, had they taken any. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4089.0s)]
*  Well, there's no points, right? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4090.0s)]
*  Because it's an exhibition. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4091.0s)]
*  So that's what's what's interesting is Floyd's making more money than anybody. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4093.0s)]
*  And he's boxing people who have no chance of beating them. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4096.0s)]
*  And he's doing it as an exhibition. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4099.0s)]
*  It doesn't even hurt his record. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4100.0s)]
*  Because of the drug. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4105.0s)]
*  Of boxing. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4106.0s)]
*  Also money. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4107.0s)]
*  Just like the, but I don't think he needs, he don't need any money. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4108.0s)]
*  He spends so much money. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4111.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he don't need any. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4113.0s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4115.0s)]
*  Yeah, Floyd good. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4116.0s)]
*  I bet he's, if he's planned for the future, you got to keep it coming in if you're going to keep spending the way he spends. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4117.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I think he has a lot of other business interests that he can get money from. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4123.0s)]
*  Hopefully. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4128.0s)]
*  And not just boxing. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4129.0s)]
*  But it's the drug of getting, Floyd still trains. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4131.0s)]
*  Even when he doesn't have a fight. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4135.0s)]
*  He posted this a week ago of all of the Air Force ones he buys. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4137.0s)]
*  He only wears them once and then gives them away to someone. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4140.0s)]
*  One fresh pair a day. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4143.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4145.0s)]
*  He needs that money. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4146.0s)]
*  That money has to keep coming in if you're going to live like this. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4147.0s)]
*  It's not that expensive though, but. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4150.0s)]
*  He's only 46. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4151.0s)]
*  But he does this with everything, man. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4153.0s)]
*  He's got million dollar watches. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4155.0s)]
*  I don't think he buys every pair. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4157.0s)]
*  You're going to give them to him? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4161.0s)]
*  Because then you get a video like that. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4162.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4164.0s)]
*  That's smart. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4165.0s)]
*  And then you get Floyd's Air Force ones, giving away for charity. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4166.0s)]
*  That's a tax write off. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4170.0s)]
*  And all sorts of things that goes into that. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4171.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got a good point. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4173.0s)]
*  But those million dollar watches, they're not giving you those. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4174.0s)]
*  They still, you know, worth whatever they were. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4177.0s)]
*  Like you got eight of them. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4183.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4184.0s)]
*  Look at all those diamonds. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4185.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4186.0s)]
*  That's millions of dollars worth of diamonds. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4188.0s)]
*  I mean, that is, that's bonkers. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4191.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4193.0s)]
*  Look at his watch. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4194.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's like a professional baller. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4196.0s)]
*  Like that watch right there is not like, I wouldn't wear it because it's not my thing. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4206.0s)]
*  Even if, you know, I had it, I wouldn't wear it. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4207.0s)]
*  It's just not attractive to me. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4210.0s)]
*  No, I'm not into blinged out watches either. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4213.0s)]
*  I like mechanical watches, like a metal. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4215.0s)]
*  That's what I like. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4218.0s)]
*  But, you know, I get it. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4222.0s)]
*  Metal. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4223.0s)]
*  Rattle. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4224.0s)]
*  Yeah, they work. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4225.0s)]
*  Like dive watches. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4227.0s)]
*  That's why I wear a watch that you can dive in. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4228.0s)]
*  Well, I wear them so you set a timer. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4230.0s)]
*  Like if I want to do something, I spin that little bezel. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4232.0s)]
*  I can set it for 15, 20 minutes. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4235.0s)]
*  I always look down and know how much time's passed. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4237.0s)]
*  It's very convenient to have a little tiny watch. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4239.0s)]
*  Very convenient. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4241.0s)]
*  It's great when someone's going on stage. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4242.0s)]
*  You're like, how long has he been up for? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4244.0s)]
*  Because sometimes you forget. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4245.0s)]
*  You're in the green room. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4246.0s)]
*  I just look at my watch. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4247.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have to worry about that. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4249.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have to remember what time he went on stage. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4251.0s)]
*  Okay, he went on stage at 9.07. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4253.0s)]
*  So what time is it now? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4255.0s)]
*  I don't have to do that. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4257.0s)]
*  As soon as someone goes on stage, I'm like, all right. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4259.0s)]
*  Bam. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4262.0s)]
*  Now I know. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4264.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4265.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4267.0s)]
*  Dive watch literally is designed for comedians. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4268.0s)]
*  It's great. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4270.0s)]
*  If someone's going on stage, they're doing 15 minutes. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4271.0s)]
*  You can go outside, hang out, smoke a joint, go. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4273.0s)]
*  He's at 7, you know. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4277.0s)]
*  And that's the perfect thing. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4279.0s)]
*  People don't understand. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4280.0s)]
*  And these are the things that we get away from using your brain. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4281.0s)]
*  Because you take the clock down. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4285.0s)]
*  Insane. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4288.0s)]
*  Well, that's the least of what's insane about schools today. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4290.0s)]
*  The biggest insanity is that it's not a cherished position to teach people. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4293.0s)]
*  It's not a position where you have the most qualified, the best people possible, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4299.0s)]
*  and they get paid really well because they have an incredible job. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4303.0s)]
*  They're educating the young children. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4306.0s)]
*  And that education can literally form the path that you go on for the rest of your life. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4308.0s)]
*  Your experiences that you have in schools with good teachers, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4314.0s)]
*  they can shape and form you in a way that changes your whole life. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4317.0s)]
*  They can expose you to ideas that you never heard before, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4320.0s)]
*  and it changes the way you think about things. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4323.0s)]
*  It changes the path of your life. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4325.0s)]
*  Yeah, it can do all of those things. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4327.0s)]
*  Or, okay, let's go to this point first. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4330.0s)]
*  New Zealand has the best school system, has teachers who get paid, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4335.0s)]
*  and they also have the best teachers because they have people who want to be teachers. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4343.0s)]
*  I think that if it's not a position in this country where it's made attractive, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4349.0s)]
*  where people can, one, survive and actually have the wealth of what they really want to be teachers. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4358.0s)]
*  I think that sometimes we have a lot of people. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4367.0s)]
*  Like, I grew up when, if the kids of the day had my teachers, I think everything would be cool. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4369.0s)]
*  Because I had teachers that inspired thought and creativity, and they wanted to be teachers. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4377.0s)]
*  That's the biggest thing when you have people who want to do their job. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4385.0s)]
*  Or it's more like a passion to them. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4391.0s)]
*  Every teacher I ever known that was great would tell me that this is a labor of love. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4394.0s)]
*  Like, I love teaching. I'm going to teach just what I was designed to do. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4400.0s)]
*  I'm not waiting to do anything else. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4404.0s)]
*  And if you have teachers that will walk out for more money, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4408.0s)]
*  you should also walk out for a better curriculum as well if your desire is to teach children [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4412.0s)]
*  and to inspire the youth to be, and I credit teachers for everything that I am. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4420.0s)]
*  You know, my mom's a teacher. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4427.0s)]
*  So it's like, I'm, my friends are teachers. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4429.0s)]
*  My sister's in Thailand right now teaching English. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4433.0s)]
*  It's like, I come from that, and I always loved, my science teacher was my coach too. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4436.0s)]
*  He wasn't just the coach. He was the math, one year was the math teacher. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4444.0s)]
*  One year was the history teacher. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4448.0s)]
*  You know, it was people who desired and wanted to nourish children. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4450.0s)]
*  And the pay, it definitely has to be increased, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4458.0s)]
*  but you have to increase the things, the quality of what you're paying for. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4462.0s)]
*  But don't you think that that's how you do it? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4466.0s)]
*  If you want to get better teachers, the better curriculum, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4469.0s)]
*  don't you think you incentivize them with more money so you would get more motivated people? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4472.0s)]
*  I think you do both at the same time. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4477.0s)]
*  That you change the criteria, you change the pay, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4479.0s)]
*  and you change the criteria of what it is to be a teacher. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4482.0s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4485.0s)]
*  At the same time. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4486.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4487.0s)]
*  And then you put these kids in a system to where everything is nourishing, even down to the food. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4488.0s)]
*  You take all these cafeteria workers out and you put chefs back there. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4497.0s)]
*  You put some people and you teach them and give them time to dodge it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4501.0s)]
*  Just change the whole system. They should have an hour to eat. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4506.0s)]
*  And they should get a four course meal. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4509.0s)]
*  And they should be taught things while they're eating. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4512.0s)]
*  They should be in a very clean environment. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4514.0s)]
*  I used to love that the custodian, when I was growing up, he took pride in keeping the school clean. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4516.0s)]
*  It wasn't a job that was looked down upon. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4524.0s)]
*  Because he did everything. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4527.0s)]
*  He was the maintenance man and the custodian. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4528.0s)]
*  And he used to be like, hey man, I got this bathroom clean in here. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4531.0s)]
*  Now y'all going to stop pissing all over the damn... [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4535.0s)]
*  That's how he used to talk to them. We in the fourth grade. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4538.0s)]
*  Hey, stop pissing all over the damn thing. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4540.0s)]
*  And they were like, yes sir. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4542.0s)]
*  And he taught you hygiene in the bathroom. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4544.0s)]
*  I think that you should change... [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4549.0s)]
*  Like I see all these things where they changing how they house prisoners. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4551.0s)]
*  I get that. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4557.0s)]
*  But change how you teach children so you don't have to house prisoners. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4559.0s)]
*  That's the goal. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4566.0s)]
*  You're doing the shit backwards. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4569.0s)]
*  And I don't get that part of it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4572.0s)]
*  That's where I get worried. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4576.0s)]
*  And that's where I worry that... [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4578.0s)]
*  I don't know how many times we talked about it on this podcast. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4580.0s)]
*  But it came up recently because there was a man named Bruce Bryan. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4583.0s)]
*  And he did 29 years for a crime that he didn't do. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4587.0s)]
*  And my friend Josh Dubin, he used to work with the Innocence Project. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4592.0s)]
*  Now he does his own thing. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4598.0s)]
*  He gets prisoners released. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4599.0s)]
*  He's an attorney, a civil rights attorney. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4602.0s)]
*  He goes to these places and finds these people. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4604.0s)]
*  We've talked about this so many times. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4607.0s)]
*  If they really wanted to fix it, what they would do is they would figure out the areas that have the most crime [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4609.0s)]
*  and dump a shitload of money in it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4615.0s)]
*  And a shitload of time and effort and try to figure out how to mitigate all these problems in these places. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4617.0s)]
*  And you're going to have less people that go to those places. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4622.0s)]
*  And until they do that, they don't care. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4625.0s)]
*  And then you got these fears of things like the prison guard unions that literally lobby to keep marijuana drug laws [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4628.0s)]
*  so that people keep going to jail, so they'll have more people in their jails, so they don't lose jobs, which is crazy. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4635.0s)]
*  That's crazy to think of. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4642.0s)]
*  Something as innocuous as marijuana. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4644.0s)]
*  And you got prison guard unions who are actively trying to keep the laws in place so that they're employed. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4647.0s)]
*  So you got a private prison system. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4654.0s)]
*  So you got a prison system where you can make money, which is terrifying. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4657.0s)]
*  So it's like this. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4660.0s)]
*  I've been talking about this for years. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4663.0s)]
*  I'm glad you're talking about it. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4665.0s)]
*  I'm glad other people start talking about it. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4666.0s)]
*  So how do you boost up our economy when in a small town? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4668.0s)]
*  So you got in Texas, you have a lot of small towns. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4675.0s)]
*  And there's a place called LA, Texas. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4679.0s)]
*  So if you decide a Hondo, Texas. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4682.0s)]
*  So what you do is you put a prison in Hondo, which you employ the townspeople of Hondo, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4686.0s)]
*  because they go through your system of training. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4695.0s)]
*  You don't have to have law enforcement. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4699.0s)]
*  You just train them in how to run your system. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4700.0s)]
*  So you get some people that come from San Antonio. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4703.0s)]
*  You get some people from Hondo, and then you boost the economy of Hondo. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4706.0s)]
*  Then you do that in multiple towns. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4711.0s)]
*  That's why the prison system is going to constantly do that, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4715.0s)]
*  because you're trying to boost the economy around your thinking. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4719.0s)]
*  It's maybe 200 prisons in Texas. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4723.0s)]
*  Is it really that many? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4728.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4730.0s)]
*  With that in private facilities, where you have what they call transit units, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4731.0s)]
*  which is all of this stuff would be in Domino Effect 3. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4738.0s)]
*  I'm going to go through the first three years and then the last three years [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4743.0s)]
*  and show people how this system populates itself. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4748.0s)]
*  It's an industry. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4757.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely an industry. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4758.0s)]
*  That's what Bruce is explaining, that the town in upstate New York, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4760.0s)]
*  where the prison he was in was located in, everyone relied on the prison. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4764.0s)]
*  The people that are generational, people that their families had worked as prison guards. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4769.0s)]
*  You know how dangerous this is? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4774.0s)]
*  So you get into it with a guard on first shift. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4777.0s)]
*  On the first shift, you get into it with a guard on first shift. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4784.0s)]
*  So you get into it with Officer Smith on first shift. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4787.0s)]
*  Second shift, Officer Smith's mother and Officer Smith's brother work on the second shift. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4790.0s)]
*  Officer Smith's father works on the third shift. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4801.0s)]
*  Then he's a captain. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4806.0s)]
*  Do you know how much, you know how treacherous this becomes? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4811.0s)]
*  Because now something that happened on first shift, which is over because he's gone, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4816.0s)]
*  but it's been told to his brother and his mother. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4823.0s)]
*  So now you got a problem on second shift now and you have a problem on third shift. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4826.0s)]
*  So with a high ranking person that's in a system that has no police outside of the warden or the captain that's over them, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4834.0s)]
*  that's on another shift that's related to them that live in the same town with them, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4848.0s)]
*  or that's married into them, or that's neighbors with them. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4854.0s)]
*  And then how do you get contact? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4858.0s)]
*  You got to write somebody who you write and they review every letter in the people that's in the mail room. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4862.0s)]
*  How you even know your letter even got out when his niece is working in the mail room? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4870.0s)]
*  So you don't know. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4876.0s)]
*  Nobody knows that you even got beat and thrown in solitary confinement. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4878.0s)]
*  They could kill you and make up something because everybody is relying on the same thing. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4882.0s)]
*  You can't close a prison now over one person getting killed, two people, five, ten people getting killed. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4890.0s)]
*  Okay, it happens in prison. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4896.0s)]
*  That's what people think that happens in prison. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4899.0s)]
*  No, it don't. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4902.0s)]
*  But when you put people in a small town in a prison where everybody's related, everybody knows each other, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4904.0s)]
*  this is what happens to people. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4910.0s)]
*  So it's not just a, you're not inside with one danger, you're inside with a lot of dangers. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4913.0s)]
*  Like most of the time people don't think that they can get killed every day or die every day. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4920.0s)]
*  They ain't your first thought. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4925.0s)]
*  But in this place, this is the thought. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4927.0s)]
*  Now you can be killed by, or I can be killed by the whites, I can be killed by the Mexicans, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4929.0s)]
*  I can be killed by somebody black that don't like me that's from a different side of town, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4933.0s)]
*  I can be killed by the officers. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4937.0s)]
*  That's a lot of mental strain on you every day if you don't learn how to navigate this. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4941.0s)]
*  But that's the system that you live in when you, especially if they're building prisons in a small town [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4950.0s)]
*  where everybody is, there's nobody to oversee this that has some other invested interest. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4956.0s)]
*  Like if you was from another place and you were like, I just want my prison to be ran right. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4962.0s)]
*  And if I get any of these complaints, if something happens on this, you can regulate that. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4968.0s)]
*  But when it's all the same, oh man, you in trouble. You in trouble. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4972.0s)]
*  And then you make people work for 16 cents a day. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4978.0s)]
*  Where you get 16 cents at? Not in Texas? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4982.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. 16 dollars a day? No, no. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4984.0s)]
*  What did Bruce Bryan say it was? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4986.0s)]
*  No, zero dollars in Texas. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4987.0s)]
*  Zero dollars in Texas. Zero. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4988.0s)]
*  No, you see, I know about other places, that's why I'm saying they may get that in other places, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4989.0s)]
*  but in Texas it's zero dollars. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4994.0s)]
*  What was it in SinkSink? Did he say 16 dollars a day? That's what he said, right? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=4997.0s)]
*  Something insane. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5001.0s)]
*  In Texas it's zero. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5003.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5005.0s)]
*  And then you make things and they sell them. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5008.0s)]
*  You make things and you sell them. They sell them for sure. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5012.0s)]
*  And you clear fields and you grow crops and you do all that. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5014.0s)]
*  And some of that stuff, you eat what you grow. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5019.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5023.0s)]
*  So this has been a place. This place is like no other place. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5024.0s)]
*  It's different. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5031.0s)]
*  And most people are unaware of this. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5033.0s)]
*  And they are unaware because Texas is very closed lip about how they operate. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5035.0s)]
*  They don't, like on their show Lock Up, you just seen every other prison, every other prison system open their doors up to, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5041.0s)]
*  Hey, come and see how we do things. Not Texas. Not one time. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5048.0s)]
*  Texas is like, man, y'all better get out of here. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5053.0s)]
*  And they can. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5057.0s)]
*  And they can. It's their own place. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5058.0s)]
*  Like if the people that come from other places and they get into, like in Houston, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5060.0s)]
*  there's a lot of people that's coming from other places that are doing crime and then they understanding [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5066.0s)]
*  that the law enforcement system in Houston is different and it's big. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5072.0s)]
*  And they cross talk. It's not like you can't be in Iowa County and not in Missouri, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5076.0s)]
*  in Missouri City and Sugar Land and Harris County and Bel Air Police, all these people. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5082.0s)]
*  And the constables and the sheriffs, like all these people coincide with each other. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5088.0s)]
*  It's not like one system. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5092.0s)]
*  So when you get caught, they put you in Harris County system and it's not no cakewalk. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5094.0s)]
*  And you're going to learn, you're going to learn fast that it's not like, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5103.0s)]
*  oh, they don't slap you on your wrist like other places. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5106.0s)]
*  No, you can get a life sentence in Houston. Easy. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5110.0s)]
*  Do something out of pocket like you was doing somewhere else. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5114.0s)]
*  You're going to just carjack. All right. That's a capital offense. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5121.0s)]
*  You had a weapon while you was carjacking? Okay. Capital. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5126.0s)]
*  What that start with? 35. Whatever it is, it's going to be 35 years and up. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5131.0s)]
*  So get that wrapped around your mind. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5135.0s)]
*  Oh, you watched them come out the bank? Oh, you premeditated robbing? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5138.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. Sure got you on video too. And you had a weapon? Oh, yeah. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5142.0s)]
*  Capital. Like, damn. Like, man, you get hit with so many charges [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5147.0s)]
*  and then they find out you got a weapon. You got a weapon? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5155.0s)]
*  This is how they point at you. You got a weapon? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5158.0s)]
*  Capital. They ready to throw capital on everything. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5160.0s)]
*  Wow. Because they need more people to put in these jails. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5164.0s)]
*  How scary is that? How scary is that? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5169.0s)]
*  Texas is like this. I only had to go once. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5172.0s)]
*  And it's nothing ever in my life that I do to ever get back to that position. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5175.0s)]
*  Nothing. Nothing. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5180.0s)]
*  Like, I hold court in the street before something like that happens. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5182.0s)]
*  Look, I'm not in favor of carjacking or armed robbery. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5187.0s)]
*  Not in any stretch of the imagination. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5190.0s)]
*  But until we address why this is all happening. Yep. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5193.0s)]
*  Until you address why some people have zero need to rob people [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5197.0s)]
*  and some people that's the only way they can get by, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5201.0s)]
*  or the way they've learned to get by, and it's been in their neighborhood for so long. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5203.0s)]
*  They've been dealing with gang violence and drug dealing and chaos all their life. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5208.0s)]
*  So I ask you this. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5213.0s)]
*  Being formerly from this position, have I not seen anything else? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5218.0s)]
*  Like, ever? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5226.0s)]
*  See, sometimes I can rationalize when people say, I don't know anything else. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5229.0s)]
*  You have a smartphone? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5238.0s)]
*  How did you find out about smartphones? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5240.0s)]
*  Because they didn't come to the hood and drop a bunch of smartphones in the hood. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5242.0s)]
*  So how did you find out about it? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5247.0s)]
*  What you was watching? Where you was at? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5249.0s)]
*  Okay. So you were somewhere? Okay, cool. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5252.0s)]
*  Were they doing what you were doing, what you're doing right now at that place? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5255.0s)]
*  Like, were they, were you found out about a smartphone? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5260.0s)]
*  Were they gang banging at the place or were they shooting and robbing people and cutting up dope? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5263.0s)]
*  Like, what movie haven't you seen that shows you the results of this? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5269.0s)]
*  What person haven't you heard speak? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5277.0s)]
*  Like, even when I was doing wrong, I had a sensibility of, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5281.0s)]
*  I heard Public Enemy while I was doing wrong. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5289.0s)]
*  I heard Run DMC. I heard other things that had positive stuff while I was still doing wrong. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5295.0s)]
*  And I can't say it's all I know. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5301.0s)]
*  Because, no, I wouldn't have never found out about a smartphone if I was in the street. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5306.0s)]
*  Because I would be in the street. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5313.0s)]
*  So it's not all you know, but it is what you're accustomed to if you grow up in a terrible neighborhood. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5315.0s)]
*  I don't even think. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5321.0s)]
*  If you don't have good role models of the people around you, I mean, you tell me. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5322.0s)]
*  This is what I'm saying. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5326.0s)]
*  I think that it's a lot of parts to this that, but when, it's also like when raising kids. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5329.0s)]
*  Like my oldest daughter, I used to tell her mom, don't say this in front of her, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5340.0s)]
*  because then you give her that option as an excuse. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5346.0s)]
*  Something she probably never would have even thought of using. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5351.0s)]
*  But when I give her the option to use it, that's the thing. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5356.0s)]
*  Like with me, I'm very transparent about, man, I didn't have to be in the street center though. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5361.0s)]
*  My mom had a job. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5367.0s)]
*  My desire for what I accepted outside of what my mother was saying to me, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5370.0s)]
*  because nobody's mother is saying to them, get out in the street and gang bang and create ruckus. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5377.0s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5383.0s)]
*  So when does that voice become less important to you than whatever you're seeing in the street? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5385.0s)]
*  Because nobody in my community, not one black mother I ever even known in my life said to their child, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5391.0s)]
*  this is the only way for you to go and get it, is to rob, pill it, steal, kill, sell dope. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5400.0s)]
*  Not one person. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5406.0s)]
*  I've never heard that story while I was in prison. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5409.0s)]
*  From nobody. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5413.0s)]
*  And when people would tell me, man, this is all I know, how in the hell is that all that you know? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5415.0s)]
*  It's impossible for that to be all that you know, because you were doing something before you were doing that. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5422.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5430.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5432.0s)]
*  You're a person that takes extreme responsibility though. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5433.0s)]
*  You're also a grown man. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5436.0s)]
*  And you're also a man with a fully formed brain. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5438.0s)]
*  And your frontal lobe. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5440.0s)]
*  As a kid. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5442.0s)]
*  As a kid you knew this. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5443.0s)]
*  Well you were wise. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5445.0s)]
*  As a kid I wasn't, man Joe, man with me, we was out in the street doing stuff. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5446.0s)]
*  We knew that it was wrong, that's why we was trying to hide it from our parents. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5452.0s)]
*  I wasn't trying to hide my basketball championship from my mother. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5455.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5461.0s)]
*  I wasn't trying to hide, when I was working and earned something from working, I wasn't trying to hide that from her. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5462.0s)]
*  I knew exactly what I was doing because of how we were going about doing it. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5467.0s)]
*  And all of us knew that we were wrong. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5476.0s)]
*  And the consequences, what was ridiculous was we thinking that, oh we just go in and get a slap on the wrist. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5479.0s)]
*  Not understanding what you gotta go through to even get that slap on the wrist. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5487.0s)]
*  Because you gotta get arrested first. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5494.0s)]
*  And when you go to the county jail, the county jail is not a place, this is full of grown men. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5499.0s)]
*  And they don't care nothing about you being 17. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5508.0s)]
*  They don't care nothing about you being 18. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5511.0s)]
*  They don't care nothing about you being 19 because whatever you were doing in the street, you didn't care. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5513.0s)]
*  So why would we care about what you got going on in here? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5519.0s)]
*  And we gonna put you in the worst position so maybe you can say that you don't want to be in this position. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5521.0s)]
*  Maybe the people who love you will come get you out of this position. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5527.0s)]
*  Like my mother did the first time. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5531.0s)]
*  When my mother bonded me out the first time, I should have learned then. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5534.0s)]
*  I should have learned then. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5539.0s)]
*  I should have learned then. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5540.0s)]
*  This lady has a job and I'm making it harder for her. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5541.0s)]
*  I'm putting my mother in the hole $2,000 because I got a $20,000 bond. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5544.0s)]
*  How old were you then? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5549.0s)]
*  I'm 16. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5550.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5551.0s)]
*  And I have no reason because I want a goddamn UNLV jacket. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5555.0s)]
*  Well you know that now but what did you think when you were 16? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5564.0s)]
*  You know what happened was how I even get in this situation, I'm in the car with some people that's really petty. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5568.0s)]
*  They're really petty. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5576.0s)]
*  And I know these people petty because they robbing people and I'm not no robber. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5579.0s)]
*  I'm a hustler. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5583.0s)]
*  And I know better than to be with somebody that's a robber. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5584.0s)]
*  Because it's two different categories. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5587.0s)]
*  I'm hustling for whatever I want. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5590.0s)]
*  You're taking something from somebody. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5593.0s)]
*  You're a thief. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5595.0s)]
*  And I'm in the car and he snatched his lady purse and I don't say nothing. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5598.0s)]
*  I'm in the car. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5602.0s)]
*  There's some camera in the parking lot. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5605.0s)]
*  Everybody's going to go in the car. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5607.0s)]
*  We go in there. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5608.0s)]
*  I'm not going to snitch on you. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5609.0s)]
*  But I didn't take no purse. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5611.0s)]
*  And I told my mom I didn't take that lady purse. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5614.0s)]
*  But did you did you get some Jordans from the credit card that somebody used? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5619.0s)]
*  I'm with them. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5625.0s)]
*  But I ain't take nothing from them. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5628.0s)]
*  I told them that's stupid. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5630.0s)]
*  And boom, now I'm on probation. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5633.0s)]
*  Then I'm working at the grocery store. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5638.0s)]
*  And but I still got I still got bread from my hustling. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5642.0s)]
*  So I'm trying to I'm in a position and I'm trying to figure out how to give my mother this two thousand dollars back. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5648.0s)]
*  Put some dumb shit that I didn't do. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5655.0s)]
*  And I'm not supposed to be with nobody even like this. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5657.0s)]
*  And see nowadays people got this this weird loyalty to people who they don't even fucking know. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5661.0s)]
*  That's the crazy. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5669.0s)]
*  You got a lot to do somebody who you don't know that I ain't got as much to lose as you. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5670.0s)]
*  I only hang I only really hang with me and they got things to lose like me. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5676.0s)]
*  So you make better decisions. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5681.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5684.0s)]
*  Hey, man, I'm not. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5685.0s)]
*  Hey, man, you got to know you, man. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5686.0s)]
*  What what are you responsible for? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5690.0s)]
*  Who are you responsible for? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5694.0s)]
*  That means a lot to me as a character of your person. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5698.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm just out for self. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5702.0s)]
*  Oh, no, bro. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5703.0s)]
*  You can't hang with me. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5706.0s)]
*  You got nobody to just be responsible for you just yourself. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5707.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5710.0s)]
*  You got no like nobody. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5713.0s)]
*  You don't think your mama, your father, like no great aunt, nobody. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5715.0s)]
*  You got nobody in your life. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5719.0s)]
*  There's hell no like hell no. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5721.0s)]
*  Like if my agent Joe Joe don't have no kids, but he still love his family. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5726.0s)]

*  Real weird. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5784.0s)]
*  Do you know how weird it is to have somebody that's 45 years old, 50 years old coming to your house for your kids birthday party. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5785.0s)]

*  Bring somebody else that love you man. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5809.0s)]
*  We have people in our family that don't have any other family but they've been around a long time. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5814.0s)]
*  They've been around before I even had kids. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5821.0s)]
*  If you want to have a successful civilization, you have to have families. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5823.0s)]
*  Got to have families. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5827.0s)]
*  You would never have a successful civilization of all single men with no responsibility that move to a spot. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5828.0s)]
*  I'm throwing this shit at Paris so fast. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5835.0s)]
*  I'm throwing that shit at we be over. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5840.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not going to work. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5842.0s)]
*  It's not. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5844.0s)]
*  You need families. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5845.0s)]
*  I mean they've always said that. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5846.0s)]
*  That's like something that emperors have, they've written this down. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5847.0s)]
*  You know, you have to have families. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5852.0s)]
*  People have to have families. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5855.0s)]
*  That's how you can control them as well. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5856.0s)]
*  That's how they stay controlled and that's how you can control them. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5858.0s)]
*  Well I would prefer not to look at my family as some form of control. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5861.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5865.0s)]
*  It's not that way. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5866.0s)]
*  It's also you, you know, did Chappelle say it best. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5867.0s)]
*  He said, having children didn't just increase my love, it increased my capacity for love. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5870.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful quote. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5876.0s)]
*  I think it's perfectly described because that's exactly what happens. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5877.0s)]
*  It changes who you are as a person when you're responsible for young people. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5880.0s)]
*  It just fundamentally changes you. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5884.0s)]
*  Yeah, you think on a different level when you're responsible for young people. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5887.0s)]
*  And when I am at my best, I'm the most charitable to everyone because I think of people as babies. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5891.0s)]
*  Like this is a baby that grew up to be this dude I'm in front of now. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5899.0s)]
*  I think even if they're annoying me, I try real hard to just imagine what the fuck they went through to get to be this person right now. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5903.0s)]
*  It's not fun to be annoying. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5910.0s)]
*  It's not fun to be them. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5912.0s)]
*  You know, it's not when you're talking to a moron that's saying stupid shit and they're annoying. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5914.0s)]
*  It's not fun to be them. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5918.0s)]
*  It's not fun to be them where no one's impressed with you, no one's interested in what you have to say. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5920.0s)]
*  You're fucking spitting in people's faces and you're drunk and stupid. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5923.0s)]
*  That's terrible. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5926.0s)]
*  That's terrible. You don't want to be that guy. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5927.0s)]
*  That's terrible. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5928.0s)]
*  But I try to always imagine. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5929.0s)]
*  The description is even terrible. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5931.0s)]
*  Yeah, it happens all the time. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5933.0s)]
*  I've had some doozies. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5934.0s)]
*  They always want to tell you about their business. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5936.0s)]
*  They always want to tell you how good their business is doing. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5938.0s)]
*  Like, Jesus Christ, I don't even know you, man. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5940.0s)]
*  This is crazy talk. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5941.0s)]
*  Crazy talk. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5943.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5945.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5946.0s)]
*  And then when you're talking to someone and they want to get the fuck out of there and you know they want to get the fuck out of there, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5947.0s)]
*  then you feel insecure and you try to be more entertaining or nice. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5952.0s)]
*  Try to turn them around. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5956.0s)]
*  And they're like, eh, eh, eh. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5958.0s)]
*  That's not fun for them. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5960.0s)]
*  That poor little baby. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5961.0s)]
*  That poor little baby grew up to become an annoying 45-year-old dude. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5962.0s)]
*  That poor little baby. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5966.0s)]
*  That poor little baby. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5968.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5970.0s)]
*  That poor little baby. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5972.0s)]
*  He's 45, but he's a poor little baby. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5974.0s)]
*  Poor little baby is a goofy, socially awkward dude. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5976.0s)]
*  He's just annoying. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5980.0s)]
*  And they say weird stuff. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5982.0s)]
*  They do. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5984.0s)]
*  The problem is you're used to talking to comics. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5985.0s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5987.0s)]
*  I'm so used to talking to comics. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5989.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5991.0s)]
*  Some of my favorite people to talk to. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5992.0s)]
*  So when I talk to people, their stories suck. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5994.0s)]
*  You got great stories. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5997.0s)]
*  You're a master storyteller. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=5999.0s)]
*  You tell a fucking story. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6001.0s)]
*  If you're at a party and you're telling a story, people are going to listen. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6002.0s)]
*  It's going to be interesting. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6005.0s)]
*  It's going to be funny as shit. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6006.0s)]
*  Some people suck at stories. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6008.0s)]
*  And there's nothing worse when you've heard a real good story to go back to listening to a sucky story. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6011.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6017.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6018.0s)]
*  That is true. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6019.0s)]
*  You like. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6020.0s)]
*  So, and I know because I'm labeled as a storyteller when people try to talk to me, they try to tell me stories. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6022.0s)]
*  And I'll be kind of rushing it. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6029.0s)]
*  And I'm like, and uh huh. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6031.0s)]
*  It's like, all this part is, this could be interesting, but you are losing me at all of this part right here. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6033.0s)]
*  For no reason. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6041.0s)]
*  For no reason. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6042.0s)]
*  Man, speed it up. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6043.0s)]
*  You got there in two words. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6044.0s)]
*  And then I say, so, so what, no, no, no. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6045.0s)]
*  After that happened, what happened then? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6049.0s)]
*  I tried to tell the story. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6051.0s)]
*  And man, when I went back. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6053.0s)]
*  And then I don't like when people repeat the first part of the story. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6056.0s)]
*  I heard you the first time because this is how I listen to people's story. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6061.0s)]
*  I just listen. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6068.0s)]
*  Like I'm not the, mm hmm. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6069.0s)]
*  Then go ahead and yeah. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6072.0s)]
*  No, I'm just. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6074.0s)]
*  Man, did you hear what I said? [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6076.0s)]
*  Yes, because I am actively listening. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6078.0s)]
*  I'm not listening to respond. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6081.0s)]
*  I'm just, I'm locked in. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6082.0s)]
*  Actually locked in. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6085.0s)]
*  And, well you not saying nothing. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6086.0s)]
*  I'm going to remember all the points that I want to say when you're done. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6088.0s)]
*  Because you may cover something that I'm thinking. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6093.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6097.0s)]
*  So I don't want to interrupt you in the course of it. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6098.0s)]
*  I'm just listening. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6100.0s)]
*  And then, oh, I can mark that off because he just said why that happened. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6101.0s)]
*  That was podcasting. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6104.0s)]
*  And then, okay, okay, okay. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6105.0s)]
*  And okay, so all that happened, right? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6110.0s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6113.0s)]
*  Going back. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6114.0s)]
*  That's what I do because I know how to actively listen to somebody's story. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6115.0s)]
*  I love doing, Tony and I do that all the time with comedians. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6123.0s)]
*  Where we're like, this whole thing, you don't need that part. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6128.0s)]
*  That whole part is just wasted time. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6131.0s)]
*  You know that whole set up part? [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6132.0s)]

*  Oh, it's going to be great. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6144.0s)]
*  I did it Saturday night. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6145.0s)]
*  I did the big one that they did the 10th anniversary. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6146.0s)]
*  The 10th anniversary. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6148.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6149.0s)]
*  The fucking, the rabid fans that they have, it's crazy. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6151.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6157.0s)]
*  3,000 people, it sold out as quick as they could sell the tickets. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6159.0s)]
*  It sold out in under an hour. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6162.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6164.0s)]
*  And you get there and they're like, yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6165.0s)]
*  I haven't experienced that yet. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6170.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6171.0s)]
*  I'm waiting. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6172.0s)]
*  2024, we supposed to be doing a theater tour. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6173.0s)]
*  I hope it like really just sells out. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6176.0s)]
*  Oh, you're going to kill 8 million? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6179.0s)]
*  8 what? [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6181.0s)]
*  How many? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6182.0s)]
*  8.1? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6183.0s)]
*  That's the first one. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6184.0s)]
*  The second one, we trying to get, you know, 10 million, 16 million. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6185.0s)]
*  We're trying to. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6189.0s)]
*  You're going to have to change to bigger venues. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6190.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6193.0s)]
*  It's going to happen so fast. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6194.0s)]
*  You're going to be in arenas. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6196.0s)]
*  You're going to be in arenas. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6197.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6199.0s)]
*  When you do an arena, do it in the round. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6200.0s)]
*  In the round? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6203.0s)]
*  You know why? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6204.0s)]
*  Believe it or not, it's actually more intimate. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6205.0s)]
*  It seems weird. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6206.0s)]
*  But when it's a stage, it's a big tall ass stage and you're looking down on people and they're all in front of you. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6208.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6214.0s)]
*  It's like you got to almost project to like bring them into you. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6215.0s)]
*  Like, come on, we're all, I know there's a lot of us, but we're all just hanging out. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6218.0s)]
*  But when it's in the round, everybody on this side is looking at everybody on this side and everybody on this side is looking at everybody on this side. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6222.0s)]
*  Everybody sees everybody laughing and everybody's laughing at everybody. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6228.0s)]
*  And the sound is insane. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6233.0s)]
*  And you just walk around and you get used to it. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6235.0s)]
*  You just walk around and talk. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6237.0s)]
*  And while you're walking around, you do your jokes. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6239.0s)]
*  And there's giant screens everywhere so people could always see your facial expressions. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6241.0s)]
*  It's intimate. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6245.0s)]
*  You know what's insane? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6246.0s)]
*  That in this business, just wanting to be a good comic, just wanting to develop that skill. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6248.0s)]
*  Then getting to this point where we've been talking about 2024, we go in the theaters. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6259.0s)]
*  And we take in some big swings in some big places, you know, in Chicago and in New York. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6267.0s)]
*  You doing Chicago theater? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6273.0s)]
*  We hoping. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6275.0s)]
*  That's a great fucking venue. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6276.0s)]
*  And then in the course of trying to shoot Domino Effect 3 and 4 in September, trying to find a venue for that. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6278.0s)]
*  The thought of doing arenas and getting to that point and people say, man, you've been doing something for 25 years, are you tired? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6289.0s)]
*  I get bored. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6299.0s)]
*  You don't get bored with the elevation of doing things on a bigger scale. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6301.0s)]
*  Doing all these shows that sold out and ad shows and when you walk out and people come in to see you. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6307.0s)]
*  But now doing arenas or doing a theater, when people come into the theater to actually see somebody tell stories. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6317.0s)]
*  I'm not coming to see you do no TikTok clips or because that's not I'm not coming to see you do crowd work. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6325.0s)]
*  I'm coming in with the whole mindset of he's about to do an hour and 30 minutes of compelling stories. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6331.0s)]
*  And this is what I came for. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6342.0s)]
*  To get that type of locked in this on an audience. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6344.0s)]
*  Once I achieve it, I think I'm going to be very, very happy. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6349.0s)]
*  You're going to slide right into that. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6355.0s)]
*  It's no different. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6357.0s)]
*  It's no different than clubs. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6358.0s)]
*  It's no different. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6360.0s)]
*  The only thing that's different is the environment. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6361.0s)]
*  But the experience of doing is the same thing. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6363.0s)]
*  It's just killing. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6365.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6367.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6368.0s)]
*  Just the challenge. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6369.0s)]
*  What makes it interesting for me 30 plus years in whatever my 34 something 35 years and something crazy. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6371.0s)]
*  The challenge is jokes. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6379.0s)]
*  It's new jokes, new bits getting better. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6380.0s)]
*  You always get better. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6382.0s)]
*  You figure out a way to tighten it. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6383.0s)]
*  Figure out a way to do this one better. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6384.0s)]
*  Every new bit is a new living thing that you're feeding and growing and trying to make it the most palatable and the most exciting and the sneakiest and the funniest and the most outrageous. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6385.0s)]
*  You just get the biggest laughs with it. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6396.0s)]
*  Like, what's the funniest way to say this? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6397.0s)]
*  And every day you fuck with it a little more and every day you're adding to it and every day you're putting a new piece here, a new piece there. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6399.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6406.0s)]
*  I don't have to do it. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6407.0s)]
*  I do it just because I love it. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6409.0s)]
*  That's why I opened up the club. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6410.0s)]
*  That's why I tour. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6411.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to be coming to the club. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6413.0s)]
*  I'm excited. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6415.0s)]
*  When are you here? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6416.0s)]
*  I don't know the date, but I assume. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6417.0s)]
*  You're going to love it. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6420.0s)]
*  You're going to love it. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6421.0s)]
*  It's like the end of July. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6422.0s)]
*  It's a fucking great place, man. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6423.0s)]
*  It's set up just for us. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6425.0s)]
*  It's set up just for us. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6427.0s)]
*  Everything about it, everything about it from the way you move around the club where you don't have to go through the crowd to go from room to room to the way the green room set up, the balconies so you can watch the show. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6428.0s)]
*  This black curtain is so beautiful. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6439.0s)]
*  Beautiful, right? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6442.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6443.0s)]
*  You know, we had to change it. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6444.0s)]
*  It was a blue curtain at first, but then we put on the monitors. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6445.0s)]
*  Like, it looked really nice. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6448.0s)]
*  The guy, the architect who did it, Richard Weiss, is amazing. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6449.0s)]
*  And he did a fan. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6452.0s)]
*  He did the whole building. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6453.0s)]
*  Amazing, amazing job. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6454.0s)]
*  But he wanted to make it pretty. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6455.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6457.0s)]
*  So you had a beautiful hardwood like light hardwood floors and a blue screen, a blue curtain rather. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6458.0s)]
*  And we were watching on the screen. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6462.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm fucking with everything right in the beginning, especially we need a light here and a light there. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6463.0s)]
*  We need timers underneath the monitor so everybody knows how much time you're doing. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6468.0s)]
*  And so, you know, how much the time the guy's on stage, how long he's been up. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6472.0s)]
*  And also, we want a light for each room. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6475.0s)]
*  So when you're in the little room, it's a green star in the green room. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6478.0s)]
*  So when he gets the light, you see the light. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6483.0s)]
*  So there's a green star lights up in the green room. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6485.0s)]
*  And if it's in the big room, it's a blue star. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6487.0s)]
*  So it was all this tweaking and shit we did. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6489.0s)]
*  And we were watching on the monitor. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6491.0s)]
*  I'm like, that floor has got to go. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6492.0s)]
*  It's got to be black carpet, black carpet and a dark, like sparkly black curtain, just like in the little boy, the smaller room. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6494.0s)]
*  So we put that in there. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6502.0s)]
*  Now it's, now I don't want to fuck with anything. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6503.0s)]
*  Now I'm like, we're good. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6506.0s)]
*  I looked from the balcony. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6507.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6509.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6510.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6512.0s)]
*  I can't wait to come. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6513.0s)]
*  And it's right on 6th Street. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6515.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6517.0s)]
*  All lit up in the front. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6518.0s)]
*  It looks great. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6520.0s)]
*  And everybody's so hyped up. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6521.0s)]
*  They're so hyped up. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6523.0s)]
*  It's such that because we were talking about doing it for two years. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6524.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6527.0s)]
*  I had actually bought another building and I had to get out of the deal. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6528.0s)]
*  There was like some shit wrong with it. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6533.0s)]
*  And I got out of the deal. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6535.0s)]
*  And so it took a whole extra year to like get this other place. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6536.0s)]
*  And then once I got the place, I had to go on some coffee. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6541.0s)]
*  You know, what's amazing is that when you have friends that say something like, yeah, I bought another building. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6544.0s)]
*  I know it sounds stupid. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6553.0s)]
*  Then I grew up with that. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6556.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6559.0s)]
*  So I had a whole other building and then I had to get out and sell that building. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6560.0s)]
*  They're like, who buy buildings? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6565.0s)]
*  That's dynamic. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6568.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6570.0s)]
*  It's normal for me now. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6571.0s)]
*  I know it sounds fucked up. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6572.0s)]
*  I'm just being honest. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6573.0s)]
*  So the building that I bought was owned by a cult. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6575.0s)]
*  Get out of town. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6579.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6580.0s)]
*  I didn't know the extent of it until I was already in the deal, until I already signed the contract. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6581.0s)]
*  My friend Adam called me up. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6585.0s)]
*  He goes, hey, man, you watch the documentary on this cult? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6587.0s)]
*  Adam, Adam, you get our talent coordinator. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6590.0s)]
*  I go, no, he goes, oh, it's bad. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6593.0s)]
*  You should watch it. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6595.0s)]
*  He was it's fucking crazy. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6596.0s)]
*  It's called Holy Hell. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6597.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6599.0s)]
*  It's about this dude. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6601.0s)]
*  His name is Jaime Gomez. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6602.0s)]
*  And he was a gay porn star and a hypnotist. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6603.0s)]
*  And he started a club or started a cult rather in West Hollywood. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6607.0s)]
*  He was teaching people yoga. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6610.0s)]
*  And he got a bunch of young disciples. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6612.0s)]
*  They believed that he was a guru and he was God energy. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6614.0s)]
*  And he convinced them he ran this game for like 10 fucking years. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6617.0s)]
*  Maybe he was hypnotizing people. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6620.0s)]
*  He was 100 percent. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6622.0s)]
*  That's how that's how he got in trouble. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6623.0s)]
*  That's they all started talking because one guy left the cult. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6625.0s)]
*  When he left the cult, he sent a mass email saying, hey, man, this guy's been hypnotizing me and fucking me for the past 10 years. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6628.0s)]
*  And then they all started talking about it. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6633.0s)]
*  And they all started sharing the email and they all started sharing their stories with them. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6636.0s)]
*  They had all kind of kept it under wraps. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6641.0s)]
*  And this guy was doing this and he escaped L.A. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6643.0s)]
*  because they were after him was right around the time when Waco went down and the cult awareness network was like going after cults. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6647.0s)]
*  And so they escaped. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6653.0s)]
*  He changes his name again. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6654.0s)]
*  His name was Jaime Gomez. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6655.0s)]
*  He changed his name to Michelle. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6657.0s)]
*  And then he changed it again to Andreas. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6658.0s)]
*  That's when he moved to Austin and he built this place called the One World Theater. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6661.0s)]
*  And this is the place I bought. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6665.0s)]
*  So all these poor lost kids, they built this place for him. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6667.0s)]
*  They were his disciples. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6671.0s)]
*  They didn't have contractors. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6672.0s)]
*  The cult members built the place. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6674.0s)]
*  The hypnotos on. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6676.0s)]
*  Well, I don't think that was under hypnosis. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6678.0s)]
*  But what he would do is he'd give them therapy every week. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6680.0s)]
*  He charged them money, charge them 50 bucks for therapy. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6683.0s)]
*  And then he'd fuck them. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6685.0s)]
*  This guy, you should watch the doc. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6687.0s)]
*  The documentary is wild because hell. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6689.0s)]
*  Yeah, because like we were talking about cults and the big here's the thing in the beginning, it was working. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6692.0s)]
*  The beginning it looked like fun because I think in the beginning he was young and hot. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6698.0s)]
*  He's a beautiful man, especially when he was young and he had this crazy body six pack. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6702.0s)]
*  That's when he's getting older. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6706.0s)]
*  But when he was young, he was when he was a gay porn star, he was a beautiful man. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6707.0s)]
*  And I think he probably got plenty of dick already. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6711.0s)]
*  He didn't have to fuck his disciples. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6713.0s)]
*  And he just had these people that were like washing his feet. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6715.0s)]
*  And he was teaching them yoga and telling them that they're all God energy and everyone's God and I'm God. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6718.0s)]
*  And he even got so far with hypnosis that he convinced these people that he could give them the enlightenment. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6723.0s)]
*  He could give the good touch them. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6728.0s)]
*  I think it was he called it the knowing. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6730.0s)]
*  And it would be like this big thing. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6732.0s)]
*  You had to earn the knowing. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6734.0s)]
*  But when he gave it to these people, just the power of suggestion, these people like they were having these like ecstatic psychedelic experiences like they encountered God and it lasted for days. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6735.0s)]
*  These are people talking about this after they left the cult, after they knew he was a con man. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6747.0s)]
*  After they knew that he just been hypnotizing people and fucking them and he was just full of shit and getting plastic surgery and all kinds of wild shit. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6752.0s)]
*  Even though they had gone through all that, they still went back and talked about when he would do that to them early in their life and that they really did like experience God. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6761.0s)]
*  They was on show. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6771.0s)]
*  I don't think they were. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6773.0s)]
*  I think it's the power of suggestion because I've seen it. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6774.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotist? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6777.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6779.0s)]
*  They can do some wild shit to people. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6780.0s)]
*  That's a comedy hypnotist in front of an audience. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6782.0s)]
*  If you're a real hypnotist like this guy was. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6785.0s)]
*  And did nobody know it. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6789.0s)]
*  And you're trained in hypnotherapy. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6790.0s)]
*  You know how to get people to think. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6794.0s)]
*  And if you've learned how to get people to think that there's this thing that you have and you can give it to them and you hold it over their head for a long fucking time until you actually do give it to them. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6798.0s)]
*  And when you do give it to them, they believe it wholeheartedly. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6808.0s)]
*  So they actually experience it because your brain can produce all kinds of wild chemicals. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6811.0s)]
*  Your brain can produce legitimate psychedelic chemicals like full on tripping chemicals. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6817.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6822.0s)]
*  So this guy can convince you that that's happening. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6823.0s)]
*  Your brain probably does dump all those chemicals out because you think it's actually happening. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6825.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6830.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6831.0s)]
*  So he's kind of telling the truth, which is the most fucked up thing. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6832.0s)]
*  He's kind of giving you this experience and it is a real experience. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6836.0s)]
*  But the whole thing goes off the rails. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6839.0s)]
*  It goes off the rails. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6842.0s)]
*  Eventually they actually fly him to Hawaii to get rid of him. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6844.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6849.0s)]
*  They can't get rid of this guy. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6850.0s)]
*  Why he can't be arrested for the nonsense that he's doing. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6851.0s)]
*  See the thing is if you're going to arrest him, like those people are there because they're willing to be there. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6855.0s)]
*  They want to be there. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6860.0s)]
*  They believe in him. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6861.0s)]
*  Twenty people went with him to Hawaii. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6862.0s)]
*  When the cult broke up, a bunch of them flew to Hawaii with him. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6864.0s)]
*  We started a whole new cult over there. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6868.0s)]
*  And he's old by then. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6871.0s)]
*  Now he's old and he looks like shit. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6873.0s)]
*  When he was young and he was like this beautiful guy who was convincing everybody, you are love. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6875.0s)]
*  We are love. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6880.0s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, we don't have to go to regular work. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6881.0s)]
*  We grow our own food. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6884.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6885.0s)]
*  This is why I don't believe in, I don't believe in cults, things like that. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6886.0s)]
*  And I'm not, like I believe they happen. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6890.0s)]
*  I just don't believe the person who's standing, just like I don't believe in anybody who's trying to tell me how to get rich quick. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6892.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6898.0s)]
*  Because like, why would you tell me? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6899.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6901.0s)]
*  Like you are not that damn gracious where you like, oh, I'm a billionaire. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6902.0s)]
*  I want to make you a billionaire too. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6906.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6908.0s)]
*  Get the. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6909.0s)]
*  Get rich quick scheme that they don't want you to know about. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6910.0s)]
*  That's always what it is. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6913.0s)]
*  They don't want you to know. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6914.0s)]
*  Man, in any type of, any type of group thing, like something comes around all at once and everybody's doing it. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=6916.0s)]

*  I know. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7286.0s)]
*  I know when somebody can do it. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7288.0s)]
*  So that's my thing. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7289.0s)]
*  And putting these specials out, that's the other niche of it. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7291.0s)]
*  That's another way you're doing it is podcast style in a way, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7296.0s)]
*  because you're doing it yourself now. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7299.0s)]
*  And doing it yourself and putting it up on YouTube is the way to do it, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7301.0s)]
*  rather than going through some big corporation, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7304.0s)]
*  some Netflix or HBO or whatever it is. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7306.0s)]
*  You're almost betting against yourself at this point, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7309.0s)]
*  because the numbers that you get when you put it up [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7312.0s)]
*  where everybody can get it anytime they want, [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7314.0s)]
*  and then someone can say, oh my God, have you seen this? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7316.0s)]
*  And then they could share it and they send it to you. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7318.0s)]
*  Oh my God, this dude's hilarious. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7320.0s)]
*  And they send it to you. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7321.0s)]
*  And then people just start sharing it. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7322.0s)]
*  They share it on social media. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7323.0s)]
*  They share it in text messages. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7324.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7326.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7327.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7328.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need anybody anymore. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7329.0s)]
*  And podcasts just add to it. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7330.0s)]
*  It just adds to it. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7332.0s)]
*  And it's easy and it's fun. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7333.0s)]
*  It's fun to do. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7334.0s)]
*  Have a friend come over. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7335.0s)]
*  Have a drink. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7336.0s)]
*  Have a smoke a joint. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7337.0s)]
*  Start talking shit. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7338.0s)]
*  Laugh your ass off. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7339.0s)]
*  That's basically what it is. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7341.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7346.0s)]
*  And having a great time. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7347.0s)]
*  It's amazing the amount of power in sitting up talking. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7349.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7360.0s)]
*  Well, I think one of the things that's happening to people [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7361.0s)]
*  when they're stuck in an office all day [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7366.0s)]
*  or stuck working all day [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7368.0s)]
*  is they're not getting to have long conversations [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7369.0s)]
*  about things they really think about. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7372.0s)]
*  And if you are in a situation [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7374.0s)]
*  where you can listen to people have those conversations, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7376.0s)]
*  it's the next best thing. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7379.0s)]
*  And sometimes you can listen to those people [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7380.0s)]
*  have conversations with people [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7382.0s)]
*  that you're never going to get to meet. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7383.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7385.0s)]
*  Oh, that's the best. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7386.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7387.0s)]
*  You know, I think that if you have great guests [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7389.0s)]
*  or you have great opinions or great thoughts [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7393.0s)]
*  that you can podcast. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7397.0s)]
*  Some people ask you to do their podcast. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7398.0s)]
*  You're like, man, who the hell? [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7403.0s)]
*  What the hell are you all even over there talking about? [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7404.0s)]
*  It's not for everybody, but it's for you. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7406.0s)]
*  That's what I say about a lot of things. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7408.0s)]
*  But that's most things. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7409.0s)]
*  Most things that I like are not for everybody. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7411.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7413.0s)]
*  That's comedy. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7414.0s)]
*  I remember when I... [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7415.0s)]
*  The only time I've ever not wanted somebody to be good ever [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7416.0s)]
*  was at the comedy stop. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7422.0s)]
*  The laugh stop. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7425.0s)]
*  In Houston? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7426.0s)]
*  In Houston. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7427.0s)]
*  That was the only time I ever wanted somebody not to be good. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7428.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7430.0s)]

*  I came there, you had to get on the list when I started. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7433.0s)]
*  You had to come there and get on the list. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7436.0s)]
*  All the open mic nights. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7437.0s)]

*  He is 25 on the list. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7460.0s)]
*  And he said he's been doing it 20 years. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7463.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking, yeah, I know a lot of comics, man. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7466.0s)]
*  I've studied this game a lot. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7469.0s)]
*  I hope he's not funny. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7471.0s)]
*  Because if he is, I got a long ass way to go. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7474.0s)]

*  Do you really? At open mic nights? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7497.0s)]
*  At open mic nights. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7498.0s)]

*  You know what it's like? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7516.0s)]
*  It's like if you are in a boxing gym and this dude's been KO'd the last 16 times he's barred, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=7517.0s)]

*  You know, because this is why I believe in Bigfoot. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8010.0s)]
*  I don't think Bigfoot is some science project that got out that is crazy. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8017.0s)]
*  And they know it. They know it exists. They know it's on the on the level. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8024.0s)]
*  They know it's just crazy. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8027.0s)]
*  I think Bigfoot used to exist. I think it's absolutely. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8028.0s)]
*  It's definitely a new one. I don't think so. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8032.0s)]
*  You don't think it's a new one out there? No, it's some grizzly bear sheep. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8035.0s)]
*  You know why I really don't think it? [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8039.0s)]
*  Because the people that I know that are like real hunters that go deep, deep, deep into the backcountry for weeks at a time. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8041.0s)]
*  Real dudes. Dudes are in Alaska. Guys are in the mountains of Montana. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8048.0s)]
*  Guys are in the Pacific Northwest in the rainforest up there. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8052.0s)]
*  Those dudes never say shit. They never seen shit. Everybody just sees bears. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8056.0s)]
*  You see bears. And I think if you're a person that's not around wildlife a lot, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8059.0s)]
*  you see a bear walking on two legs in the deep forest, especially if it's dark out. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8063.0s)]
*  You think you saw fucking Bigfoot. For sure. But at one point in time, it was a real thing. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8067.0s)]
*  You know that? The whole story. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8072.0s)]
*  I knew the real ass Bigfoot. Yeah. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8074.0s)]
*  Gigantopithecus. This is the thing with these scientific experiments. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8077.0s)]
*  Do you remember? It was a while back. I think we talked about it. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8084.0s)]
*  I talked about it somewhere where these orangutans got out of a nuclear lab in San Antonio. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8090.0s)]
*  A biometrical lab in San Antonio. You can look this shit up. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8100.0s)]
*  Now, it's no telling what they did to them orangutans while they were in there, but they were smart enough to get the fuck out. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8105.0s)]
*  Where did they go? They were just out loose. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8113.0s)]
*  Did they catch them? I think so. Imagine one got away. Just hide now. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8117.0s)]
*  They don't even know what they came in contact with. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8122.0s)]
*  So it was a biomedical lab. I didn't know they do experiments on chimpanzees. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8127.0s)]
*  I almost have a lot of sympathy towards any animal. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8133.0s)]
*  Brilliant baboons escape from Texas Biolab using their captors' own barrels. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8141.0s)]
*  Yeah, baboons. Using just a 55 gallon barrel, three baboons liberated themselves in the confines of the biomedical research facility this weekend [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8146.0s)]
*  for about half an hour before they were captured and returned to incarceration. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8154.0s)]
*  Incarceration is a fucked up word used for baboons. They never did anything wrong. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8158.0s)]
*  That's fucked. Baboons are freaky. They're different than orangutans. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8163.0s)]
*  Baboons freak me out. They use the barrels. They got almost like a wolf mouth. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8167.0s)]
*  It's like a monkey with a wolf mouth. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8171.0s)]
*  But on Saturday, one baboon learned to put a barrel upright and use it to get to the top of the wall. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8175.0s)]
*  Then the three other baboons, monkey saw and monkey did. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8180.0s)]
*  So they just hopped over and the four baboons scaled the wall, but one returned on its own volition. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8184.0s)]
*  That's a bitch ass one. He told on everybody. He said, no, the fuckers got out. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8190.0s)]
*  The remaining three were apprehended by members of the animal care and animal capture team, which wore protective suits and masks. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8194.0s)]
*  San Antonio news outlet KSAT reported that witnesses were concerned that the baboons were carrying infectious disease. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8201.0s)]
*  A news release from TBRI stated the baboons weren't infected. What does that mean? [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8207.0s)]
*  They weren't infected. Infected with what? What are you doing over there? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8212.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing over there? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8218.0s)]
*  That's the premise of the movie 28 Days Later. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8221.0s)]
*  Outbreak. And when the story happened, I said, man, y'all don't realize at the end of the world, that's the start of every zombie apocalypse movie I've never heard of. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8225.0s)]
*  Well, you know what's fucked up? There is a real zombie virus that everyone is aware of. It's called rabies. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8240.0s)]
*  Rabies. Rabies. Rabies is a zombie virus for animals. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8247.0s)]
*  I mean, they're not dead, but they might as well be. They're trying to get to you and bite you. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8252.0s)]
*  They're trying to literally that their brain is hijacked. They're so aggressive. They're trying to bite you to infect you with the rabies. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8258.0s)]
*  So the rabies has convinced these animals. The baboons hop offence. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8265.0s)]
*  So here's these guys chasing them. They're running, chasing after the baboons. Hey, bro, get back here. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8270.0s)]
*  What if that baboon just turned around and just fucked them up? That dude does not look like he's wearing a suit. He looks regular. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8275.0s)]
*  Yeah, those are just guys on the street. These kids are out of their fucking minds. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8282.0s)]
*  Bro, these kids are getting close. Oh my God, these are just dorks. Where is this? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8286.0s)]
*  It was in wherever it happened outside of San Antonio. Oh my God, that's Texas, people. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8292.0s)]
*  Very close to here. Wild dorks chasing after a baboon. That thing will fuck you up. Fuck you up. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8296.0s)]
*  These are clearly people who have never seen a possum. Yeah, they used to see them in the zoo. They used to see them in the fucking zoo. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8304.0s)]
*  A baboon is way vicious, but a possum? Oh my goodness. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8311.0s)]
*  They don't even have the good COVID masks on. Those gloves aren't going to do jack shit. What are you going to do with those gloves? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8317.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you going to do unless that thing is used to people handling it? Good luck. You can't even pick up a feral cat. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8327.0s)]
*  You can't even pick up a feral cat? How the fuck do you think you can handle a 50 pound baboon, bitch? [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8337.0s)]
*  There's a fan. Oh man, that's way more than 50. They're about 80 pounds. The big males? [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8345.0s)]
*  How much is a normal baboon weigh? I would say they're like 50, 60 pounds. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8353.0s)]
*  They look to me like a Belgian Malinois size. Mark K. and Corso is a big dog. That's a big dog though. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8359.0s)]
*  What do you got, a 120 pound dog? 140 pounds. I had a Mastiff that was that big. Regency Mastiff. He was 140 pounds. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8365.0s)]
*  And Harry's lost like 7 pounds. 88 pounds for a big one. Wow. Oh my God. What is this one? [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8375.0s)]
*  That's the kind that gets us the big ones. Oh, it's a specific kind that gets that big. They didn't say what kind those were. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8385.0s)]
*  There's a psychologist named Robert Sapolsky. He's a psychologist, right? Is that what his profession is? Sure. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8391.0s)]
*  There's a professor named Tom who studied baboons and a fascinating thing happened. With this troop of baboons, they were dominated by the alpha males. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8397.0s)]
*  And the alpha males always got first access to the food. Neuroendocrinology researcher and author. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8405.0s)]
*  Professor of biology. The alpha males always had access to the food first. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8413.0s)]
*  Well, they were getting food from a dumpster that this resort was using. And the alpha males had access to it first. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8419.0s)]
*  And it was one of the dumpsters was filled with bad food, tainted food. And these baboons ate it and died. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8425.0s)]
*  So the ones that ate it first were the ones who had access to it. They died and the alphas were all dead. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8433.0s)]
*  So when the alphas were all dead, in the absence of the alphas being dead, the betas never assumed an alpha position. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8438.0s)]
*  They just got along with each other. And it lasted for like, I think, quite a while. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8444.0s)]
*  It lasted for years, I believe, until probably they went back to their normal way of behaving. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8451.0s)]
*  But for a long fucking time, they behaved in a way where there was like, there was no brutish. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8456.0s)]
*  Because like in those packs of baboons, they're fucking horrible to each other. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8462.0s)]
*  Maybe they didn't think they were waiting on them to come back. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8467.0s)]
*  And it was like, hey, don't nobody do nothing because you know they're going to come back and beat us. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8471.0s)]
*  Right. Don't pretend you're the boss. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8476.0s)]
*  And then somebody came and said, I don't think they're coming back. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8478.0s)]
*  And then they started with the bullshit. Bitch, I said it. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8484.0s)]
*  Jimmy, see, you can find that study. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8490.0s)]
*  Bitch, you can't eat first. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8492.0s)]
*  Did you find it? [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8494.0s)]
*  Top ranking males died off in the mid-1980s. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8496.0s)]
*  Aggression by the new top baboons dropped dramatically, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8499.0s)]
*  with most aggression occurring between baboons of similar rank [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8503.0s)]
*  and little directed towards lower status males and none at all directed at females. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8506.0s)]
*  Troop members also spent a large percentage of time grooming, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8511.0s)]
*  sat closer together than in the past, [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8515.0s)]
*  and hormone samples indicated that the lowest status males experienced less stress [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8518.0s)]
*  than underlings in other baboon troops. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8523.0s)]
*  Interestingly, these effects persisted at least through the late 90s. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8525.0s)]
*  So wow, it's more than 10 years. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8530.0s)]
*  Well after the original kinder males had died off. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8532.0s)]
*  Not only that, when the adolescent males who grew up in other troops joined the garbage dump troop, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8535.0s)]
*  they too engaged in less aggressive behavior than in other baboon troops. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8540.0s)]
*  As Sapolsky put it, we don't understand the mechanism of transmission, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8545.0s)]
*  but the jerky new guys are obviously learning. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8549.0s)]
*  We don't do things like that around here. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8553.0s)]
*  So at least by baboon standards, the garbage dump troop developed [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8555.0s)]
*  and enforced what I would call a no-asshole rule. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8559.0s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8562.0s)]
*  Oh, this is prison. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8564.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8566.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8567.0s)]
*  Because you can come in. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8568.0s)]
*  See, I see what happened now. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8569.0s)]
*  The other guys was like, no, you see what happened to the mama, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8571.0s)]
*  end up in the dumps and shit. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8575.0s)]
*  See, we not going to go that route. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8577.0s)]
*  So that's basically what happened. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8581.0s)]
*  They saw, hey man, these other guys gone, they dead. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8583.0s)]
*  And then you see they say that the other guys who were less stressed, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8588.0s)]
*  they was getting their ass whooped up there for it. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8593.0s)]
*  They were getting slapped around. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8596.0s)]
*  So when the kinder males like, hey man, look, let's just have a peaceful situation. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8598.0s)]
*  We ain't got to do all that, man. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8603.0s)]
*  You can come talk to me. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8605.0s)]
*  I'm not slapping nobody. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8607.0s)]
*  When you on what we call a Cadillac tank, that's what a Cadillac tank is, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8609.0s)]
*  where you come over there and everybody come and lay it down to you, [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8615.0s)]
*  look man, we ain't doing nothing that bullshit over here, man. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8621.0s)]
*  All that, whatever you going to do, all that stealing and whatever you, [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8624.0s)]
*  have you got mood over here, it's Cadillac over here. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8628.0s)]
*  They let you know. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8630.0s)]
*  Because it's, you don't want none of that wild shit over here. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8631.0s)]
*  You don't want to lose your TV, you don't want to lose your coffee pot, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8635.0s)]
*  you don't want to be locked down, you don't want to be none of that shit. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8638.0s)]
*  Hey man, you need some, come tell somebody. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8641.0s)]
*  You ain't got to steal nothing. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8644.0s)]
*  It's a convict tank basically, where people understand how to do their time. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8646.0s)]
*  You want to do your time less stressful. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8652.0s)]
*  I don't think people would appreciate, like the average person thinks about a jail, [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8654.0s)]
*  they don't think of that. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8659.0s)]
*  I think they probably wouldn't imagine that that would be the case, [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8660.0s)]
*  but that makes sense. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8665.0s)]
*  You know what's weird about jail? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8666.0s)]
*  I don't understand why jail is so brutal when you're not found guilty yet. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8668.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8673.0s)]
*  Because when I went to jail, I'm going to talk about it in the special, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8674.0s)]
*  but when I went, my whole thought was how to get out. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8678.0s)]
*  You don't even eat for the first four days. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8683.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8686.0s)]
*  You don't eat nothing, like they be bringing food in there, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8687.0s)]
*  you like, nah, I mean y'all going to have to eat that shit. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8689.0s)]
*  Because you thinking I'm getting out. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8691.0s)]
*  I'm not actually leaving myself the prison food. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8693.0s)]
*  I'm not even eating none of this shit. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8696.0s)]
*  None of this jail food. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8697.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8698.0s)]
*  And then after like four days, you don't get out, then you like, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8699.0s)]
*  well, hey man, let me get my juice. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8702.0s)]
*  Y'all been had the rest of that shit. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8704.0s)]
*  Then like day number seven, you like, now you eating all your food, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8706.0s)]
*  because you're not getting out just yet. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8711.0s)]
*  But you still going to court. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8714.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be thinking about doing nothing while, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8716.0s)]
*  because I'm still trying to fight my case. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8720.0s)]
*  And I don't think most people don't even think like that. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8724.0s)]
*  They get, I don't know what they be thinking, [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8727.0s)]
*  but it'd be some wild shit on their brains, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8729.0s)]
*  especially when they there for a long period of time. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8733.0s)]
*  I've been in here a year fighting this murder case. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8737.0s)]
*  Okay, but are you guilty? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8741.0s)]
*  So why are you acting like you guilty? [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8745.0s)]
*  You in here doing all the rest of this nonsense. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8747.0s)]
*  I think it's a stigma that comes along with prison, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8749.0s)]
*  that people try to act out when they go there. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8753.0s)]
*  So, but I've been in other jails where it's not like that. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8757.0s)]
*  It's like, hey man, I'm in here trying to get out. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8763.0s)]
*  And I was there on traffic tickets, but it was still like, [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8768.0s)]
*  even if you go to Harris County on a traffic ticket, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8772.0s)]
*  it's like you're in full-fledged, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8776.0s)]
*  like why am I even around anybody who could, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8779.0s)]
*  what you in here for, capital murder? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8781.0s)]
*  Why am I even in here with you, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8783.0s)]
*  and I'm in here on traffic tickets? [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8786.0s)]
*  Like we're not supposed to run into each other. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8788.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8790.0s)]
*  Shit, this shit is crazy. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8792.0s)]
*  Like you're not even supposed to run into those people [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8795.0s)]
*  until you go to prison, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8798.0s)]
*  because jail and prison are actually supposed to be different. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8799.0s)]
*  Now I understand you're getting a, [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8802.0s)]
*  you don't want to be in either place, [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8805.0s)]
*  but I don't understand the animalistic behavior [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8807.0s)]
*  that jumps off as soon as you get locked up. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8812.0s)]
*  And it's only with a certain ethnic group. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8815.0s)]
*  Do you think they think they have to do it that way, [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8818.0s)]
*  because they've been told that that's what it's like when you get in? [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8820.0s)]
*  That's the stigma that comes, [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8822.0s)]
*  but even though I was somewhere that I knew that was bad, [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8824.0s)]
*  I didn't go into it with the, I'm finna be bad too. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8828.0s)]
*  No man, I'm already, if somebody try me, [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8831.0s)]
*  then I'ma defend myself, but other than that, [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8835.0s)]
*  I'm not going in there trying to bother nobody, [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8837.0s)]
*  but see that's the whole thing. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8840.0s)]
*  I've never started a fight though, too. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8842.0s)]
*  I had to remember that by myself. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8844.0s)]
*  I've never started a fight, even though I can fight. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8846.0s)]
*  I mean I can fight well, I just never started one. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8848.0s)]
*  But if you start one with me, then you'll figure out like, [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8852.0s)]
*  oh shit, he can actually fight, yeah. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8855.0s)]
*  I just don't start him. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8858.0s)]
*  And I think most people that can fight don't start him. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8860.0s)]
*  Because it becomes, I'm not the same person in combat that I am as normal. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8864.0s)]
*  Like this shit is different with me. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8872.0s)]
*  And I'm locked in. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8874.0s)]
*  The scary thing is people who can fight, who like to fight, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8877.0s)]
*  who do go looking for fights, and those are real too. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8881.0s)]
*  Those are real too. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8884.0s)]
*  So just don't fight. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8885.0s)]
*  It's the dumbest thing to do. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8887.0s)]
*  You want to fight? Learn how to fight. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8889.0s)]
*  Go to a gym. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8891.0s)]
*  You can get plenty of fighting in the gym. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8892.0s)]
*  You don't even have to have a fight. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8894.0s)]
*  Most sparring matches are basically fights. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8896.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8898.0s)]
*  And you, I didn't tell you, but people know. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8899.0s)]
*  Did I tell you when I sparred with Todd Manuel? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8903.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8906.0s)]
*  Man, Todd Manuel beat the shit out of me. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8908.0s)]
*  And I was fucking with him. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8910.0s)]
*  Like I can't even be there fucking with him. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8912.0s)]
*  He had just fought Victor Ortiz or some shit like that. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8914.0s)]
*  And I just walked in and fucking with him. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8916.0s)]
*  I just got in the ring with him. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8918.0s)]
*  Like, what's up, Todd? [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8919.0s)]
*  Shit. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8920.0s)]
*  He ain't be in here talking shit. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8921.0s)]
*  Todd took it to my ass too. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8923.0s)]
*  He's like, well, people know I can fight, but Todd was on one. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8928.0s)]
*  Todd took it to my ass. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8932.0s)]
*  And it was that first two body shots that I was just, [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8933.0s)]
*  and I was fucking with him. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8937.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8939.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's good and then there's professional good. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8941.0s)]
*  Right? [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8944.0s)]
*  And then there's high level professional good. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8945.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8946.0s)]
*  High level professional good is fucking scary if it's boxing. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8947.0s)]
*  Yeah, like Gotti just found that out about Floyd. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8950.0s)]
*  Like that shit is different. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8953.0s)]
*  Now you can say a lot about Floyd, but once them gloves get on [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8955.0s)]
*  and you across from him, oh, that shit's different. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8958.0s)]
*  He's still very, very fast. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8960.0s)]
*  Very fast. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8963.0s)]
*  And that shit hurt. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8964.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8965.0s)]
*  All that shit hurt. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8966.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8967.0s)]
*  Like even if he playing, that shit hurt. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8968.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8969.0s)]
*  I mean, he fought Logan Paul. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8970.0s)]
*  Logan Paul weighs 200 plus pounds. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8971.0s)]
*  And he turnt the shit out of Logan Paul's neck. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8973.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8976.0s)]
*  Like wow. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8977.0s)]
*  And I think he held him up like, hey man, don't fall [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8978.0s)]
*  because you're going to mess the money up. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8981.0s)]
*  I think he's just too big. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8983.0s)]
*  I think Logan was just too big. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8984.0s)]
*  If they were the same size, I think Floyd would have knocked him out. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8986.0s)]
*  But Logan was so big. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8989.0s)]
*  He was so much bigger than him. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8990.0s)]
*  But them shots though. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8992.0s)]
*  It's so crazy to see a guy who is the best boxer of all time [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8993.0s)]
*  having a fight with this super athletic, gigantic YouTube kid. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=8999.0s)]
*  I mean, look at the size difference. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9005.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9007.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9009.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9010.0s)]
*  It was like when he wrestled with the big stuff. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9011.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9017.0s)]
*  Pro wrestling. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9018.0s)]
*  But at least that's theatrical. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9019.0s)]
*  This is an actual fight. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9021.0s)]
*  He turnt his neck. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9023.0s)]
*  Even when he fought... [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9025.0s)]
*  Look at the big show. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9029.0s)]
*  When he fought Canelo. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9031.0s)]
*  When he fought Canelo, Canelo was a big ass dude. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9032.0s)]
*  Yeah, Canelo was a big ass dude. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9035.0s)]
*  But he was very smart with that Canelo fight. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9036.0s)]
*  He made Canelo drop down to like 152. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9039.0s)]
*  I think that's what the weight limit was. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9041.0s)]
*  Canelo really had to drain himself to get down there. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9043.0s)]
*  And also, you watch Canelo before Floyd and after Floyd, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9046.0s)]
*  and you just go, oh, he learned. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9051.0s)]
*  His head movement is superb now. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9054.0s)]
*  Canelo gets in there. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9057.0s)]
*  There's fights of his where you see his head movement. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9058.0s)]
*  You're like, oh my God. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9061.0s)]
*  I just saw his last fight with Canelo, and he big. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9063.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9067.0s)]
*  He's a big fellow. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9068.0s)]
*  Well, he's doing 175 now when he knocked out Kovalev. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9069.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he got real small for that fight. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9072.0s)]
*  You know, Floyd is smart, man. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9075.0s)]
*  Like same with Manny Pacquiao. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9077.0s)]
*  He waited and waited and waited and waited and waited [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9078.0s)]
*  until after Marquez knocked out Manny. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9082.0s)]
*  And he's like, okay, we can fight now. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9084.0s)]
*  I think that was mostly promoters. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9086.0s)]
*  These promoters just be... [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9088.0s)]
*  They're brutal. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9090.0s)]
*  They just are. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9091.0s)]
*  And then everybody blame the fighter. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9092.0s)]
*  Oh, you didn't want to fight it. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9094.0s)]
*  No, they couldn't get the shit together. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9095.0s)]
*  Bro, the most disappointing one to me is Tyson Fury and Usyk. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9097.0s)]
*  I was really looking forward to that fight. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9100.0s)]
*  That was an interesting one to me because Tyson Fury is the biggest in the division. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9102.0s)]
*  He's got insane skills. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9108.0s)]
*  He's fucking huge. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9110.0s)]
*  He's six foot nine. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9111.0s)]
*  He's arguably one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9112.0s)]
*  And Usyk is this phenom of technique and footwork and movement. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9115.0s)]
*  But how is he going to fuck with that six foot nine guy? [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9120.0s)]
*  How is he going to fuck with that jab? [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9122.0s)]
*  Can he even get close to him? [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9124.0s)]
*  He's so much bigger than him. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9126.0s)]
*  It's a fascinating fight. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9128.0s)]
*  And they fucked it. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9129.0s)]
*  Even gave him 70-30. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9130.0s)]
*  Tyson said he wanted 70-30, which, you know, makes kind of sense. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9132.0s)]
*  He's the big star. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9137.0s)]
*  Usyk even said yes, and they still couldn't get the deal done. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9139.0s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck happened. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9142.0s)]
*  I know that Crawford and Earl Spence is going to be... [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9144.0s)]
*  Thank God they got that done now. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9147.0s)]
*  Because I was worried that they were going to wait until Terrence was older. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9149.0s)]
*  Because if it happens two years from now, what is he, 36 now? [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9154.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9158.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9159.0s)]
*  That's a fucking good fight. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9160.0s)]
*  Regis... Regis... Rougalou is coming up. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9162.0s)]
*  Terrence Crawford is the slickest switch hitter since Marvin Hagler. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9167.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9171.0s)]
*  This is going to be a problem. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9172.0s)]
*  This is a hell of a fight. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9174.0s)]
*  28-0 versus 39-0. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9175.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9178.0s)]
*  And I think that... [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9179.0s)]
*  Oh, what you predicting in this fight? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9181.0s)]
*  I would never predict a fight like this. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9184.0s)]
*  Because a fight like this to me is a let's see. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9187.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9190.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely a let's see. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9191.0s)]
*  It's a let's see. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9193.0s)]
*  Because they're both at the top of the top in boxing today. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9194.0s)]
*  The pinnacle. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9198.0s)]
*  Both of them. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9199.0s)]
*  Both of them have their strengths. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9200.0s)]
*  This is one of them let's see. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9202.0s)]
*  I didn't think Tank and Ryan was just going to be this electric fight. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9204.0s)]
*  I just didn't. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9208.0s)]
*  I just thought Tank was just too much. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9209.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought he was going to be too much too. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9212.0s)]
*  He has too many tools and his style is so weird. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9214.0s)]
*  His style is so weird. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9217.0s)]
*  He's so conservative in the beginning. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9219.0s)]
*  He's not throwing hardly any punches. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9221.0s)]
*  But the fucking threat of danger always looms. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9222.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9225.0s)]
*  That's the problem with him. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9227.0s)]
*  He's like, you could be doing all that. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9230.0s)]
*  He just, you like, he's like, oh my god if he hit me with any of this shit. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9232.0s)]
*  You still throwing very tentatively. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9237.0s)]
*  Like, hey, if I throw this jab at it, I need to get this shit right back. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9240.0s)]
*  Right back. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9244.0s)]
*  Like, I need this shit. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9245.0s)]
*  Do you understand how fast I need to get this jab back to my goddamn face? [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9247.0s)]
*  I need to, I don't even, and people won't even throw it all the way out there. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9250.0s)]
*  Because they need to get like, I can't give, because he's already up under you. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9260.0s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9261.0s)]
*  That you see that he's up under you, you're like, oh shit. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9262.0s)]
*  If I throw any goddamn thing, he going to turn, he going to blow my shit up. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9265.0s)]
*  And he's coming straight from the floor with crazy speed. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9273.0s)]
*  It's like Tyson. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9278.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9282.0s)]
*  It's more, like people don't realize, this shit is like a small Tyson coming. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9283.0s)]
*  Because Tyson was so leveled up under, like as soon as you throw anything out there, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9288.0s)]
*  like if I throw my jab out there, I got to have my knees bent and this shit got to, [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9293.0s)]
*  I need my elbow to guard my goddamn bread basket, my liver, my kidney, all this shit. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9298.0s)]
*  Because ah, it's just bad. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9304.0s)]
*  It's bad news. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9306.0s)]
*  It's just bad news. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9307.0s)]
*  Terrifying. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9308.0s)]
*  The consequences of any mistake are so big. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9309.0s)]
*  The consequences. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9312.0s)]
*  Pull up a Jervont Davis highlight. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9313.0s)]
*  Let's watch some highlights, KO highlights. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9316.0s)]
*  As soon as you open any of that shit up, he is, ah! [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9318.0s)]
*  How many fights does he even have that have gone to decision? [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9323.0s)]
*  It's only a couple. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9326.0s)]
*  It's the one when he broke his hand. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9328.0s)]
*  It was one fight where he won a decision when he broke his hand. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9331.0s)]
*  That might be the only one that went to a decision. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9333.0s)]
*  Damn shame. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9336.0s)]
*  The only guy who I think has a higher knockout ratio that's a champion is Arthur Betterbeef. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9337.0s)]
*  That's the light heavyweight guy. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9346.0s)]
*  Count two. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9347.0s)]
*  So he's got one in 2014. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9348.0s)]
*  And then one, yeah, up here. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9350.0s)]
*  Isaac Cruz. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9353.0s)]
*  27 and 0. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9354.0s)]
*  And all of them except two are by knockout. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9358.0s)]
*  Or excuse me, 29 and 0. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9361.0s)]
*  And all of them except two are by knockout. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9363.0s)]
*  27 knockouts. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9365.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9366.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9369.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9370.0s)]
*  That shit. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9371.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9372.0s)]
*  And it's skillful too. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9373.0s)]
*  Right up under your shit. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9374.0s)]
*  That fucking uppercut is so nasty. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9376.0s)]
*  I'm right here and as soon as you throw something out there that I think is, okay, uh-huh. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9379.0s)]
*  You finna go. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9386.0s)]
*  Oh, look at that right hook, man. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9387.0s)]
*  Right on the temple. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9389.0s)]
*  It's just he hits people different. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9390.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9392.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9393.0s)]
*  Right over. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9394.0s)]
*  Right over. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9395.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9396.0s)]
*  The speed and the accuracy. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9397.0s)]
*  It's the power and it's also the technique. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9398.0s)]
*  It's like everything is there. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9401.0s)]
*  It's not like he's just a slugger. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9403.0s)]
*  He's like, he's a scientist. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9405.0s)]
*  He's like dissecting in there. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9407.0s)]
*  He's downloading data and then applying it and moving on you in a way you never had anybody [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9411.0s)]
*  move on you before. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9416.0s)]
*  Well, you can't breathe. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9417.0s)]
*  Look at that body shot. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9418.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9419.0s)]
*  He will not let you breathe. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9420.0s)]
*  What's that? [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9422.0s)]
*  You throw yours and I'm gonna throw mine. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9423.0s)]
*  I'm already up under you. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9426.0s)]
*  And when you look at him, I mean, he looks super athletic and fit, but it doesn't look [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9428.0s)]
*  any different than a normal super athletic fit guy. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9435.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9438.0s)]
*  He looks very doable. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9439.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9441.0s)]
*  It's not like some weirdness about his body that you see like Yoel Romero. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9442.0s)]
*  He's so ridiculously huge. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9448.0s)]
*  When he knocks people out, it kind of makes sense. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9450.0s)]
*  But Gervonta looks like a regular guy, but he hits like a fucking Mack truck. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9453.0s)]
*  That is the role fight. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9458.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9459.0s)]
*  This is really crazy. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9460.0s)]
*  I mean, look at that left hand. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9461.0s)]
*  Play that again. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9463.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9464.0s)]
*  Huh? [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9466.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9467.0s)]
*  I mean, it's picture perfect. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9468.0s)]
*  He's coming in and he catches them coming in with a perfect left hand. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9471.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9475.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9476.0s)]
*  You don't even. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9477.0s)]
*  I mean, some people. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9478.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9479.0s)]
*  Some dudes from a shot like that, they're never the same guy. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9480.0s)]
*  He ain't the same. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9485.0s)]
*  That shoe is leaning. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9486.0s)]
*  Boom. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9490.0s)]
*  I mean, incredible. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9491.0s)]
*  Look at this shot. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9494.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's so dangerous, man. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9496.0s)]
*  He's so dangerous. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9497.0s)]
*  It's like that body shot is what set all that up because he is. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9498.0s)]
*  What's the guy that went to his corner and is like, man, I can't see? [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9504.0s)]
*  The guy before Ryan, the guy went to his corner after the round is like, I can't see. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9509.0s)]
*  I don't know which guy it was. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9517.0s)]
*  I don't think it's him. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9519.0s)]
*  But either way, I mean, this is how hard this kid hits. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9521.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9524.0s)]
*  He's on some crazy situation where the judge sent him to jail because he was under house arrest. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9526.0s)]
*  But they put him in house arrest in a house and it was too small for his security detail, his family and his kids. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9532.0s)]
*  And so he got a suite at the Four Seasons. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9537.0s)]
*  And his house got robbed, apparently. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9541.0s)]
*  And his house got robbed while he was in prison. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9543.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9548.0s)]
*  Insane. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9549.0s)]
*  He's so fucking talented. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9550.0s)]
*  There's so many fights for him now after the Devin Haney, Lomachenko fight and Shakur Stevenson. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9551.0s)]
*  Like that division is just stacked. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9557.0s)]
*  What you think about that Lomachenko fight? [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9560.0s)]
*  I didn't agree with it. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9562.0s)]
*  It's close, though. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9563.0s)]
*  If you go back and watch it, it's a close fight. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9565.0s)]
*  But I think Lomachenko edged him. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9568.0s)]
*  I think Lomachenko should have got the decision. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9570.0s)]
*  He was pushing it. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9572.0s)]
*  He definitely had more significant moments. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9573.0s)]
*  But Haney did land some very good body shots. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9575.0s)]
*  And showed his heart because he got pushed further than anybody's ever pushed him before. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9578.0s)]
*  Look at what he did to Kambosas, two fights in a row. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9583.0s)]
*  He boxed Kambosas his face off. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9586.0s)]
*  I had to go back. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9588.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9589.0s)]
*  Hector Luis Garcia. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9590.0s)]
*  That guy. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9591.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, I can't see. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9592.0s)]
*  He goes, I didn't know where I was. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9593.0s)]
*  That's how hard he hits. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9595.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9596.0s)]
*  I had to go back in the Haney, Lomachenko fight to go to the ... because I started watching [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9597.0s)]
*  in five, in the fifth. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9603.0s)]
*  So I had to go back and see what type of damage did he do in the first four. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9606.0s)]
*  And I say, well, I guess they just go on these body shots. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9613.0s)]
*  Because Lomachenko, from round seven to the end, I thought that he was winning this fight. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9617.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought he was winning too. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9626.0s)]
*  When I watched it without the sound, I thought that he ... clearly eight, nine, and ten were [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9628.0s)]
*  clear Lomachenko rounds for me. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9637.0s)]
*  Eight, nine, and ten. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9640.0s)]
*  And then 11 and 12 was a toss up because of the vicious body shots. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9641.0s)]
*  He did land some good ... what are those body shots worth? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9651.0s)]
*  If you look at a Gervonta Davis body shot knockout blow, it's obviously worth a lot. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9654.0s)]
*  But people tend to think that hitting someone in the face generally scores more than hitting [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9659.0s)]
*  someone in the body. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9664.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's fair. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9665.0s)]
*  It was a very, very good fight. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9667.0s)]
*  It was a good fight. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9669.0s)]
*  The problem with a fight like that is when the decision comes and most people don't agree [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9670.0s)]
*  with it, it kind of like taints the effort. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9673.0s)]
*  It's like everybody looks at Haney like he did something wrong. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9677.0s)]
*  And he fought an amazing fight against a guy who's a ghost. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9681.0s)]
*  Lomachenko's a ghost. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9684.0s)]
*  I mean, what he does in there is wild shit, man. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9686.0s)]
*  And he's a hard-hitting ... and he pushed the fight to me. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9689.0s)]
*  He pushed the fight. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9694.0s)]
*  He pushed the fight. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9695.0s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely pushed the fight and he definitely did some wild shit. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9696.0s)]
*  But he definitely got hit with some hard body shots. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9698.0s)]
*  It was a good fight, a very, very good fight. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9701.0s)]
*  I think the fact that he was trying to absorb the body shots with coming off his feet. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9703.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9709.0s)]
*  And it just don't look good. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9710.0s)]
*  It looked like somebody knocking you off your feet. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9712.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9714.0s)]
*  Instead of ... [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9715.0s)]
*  You're jumping with it. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9716.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're jumping with it, trying to take the impact off, and the shit's still hitting you. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9718.0s)]
*  And if he would have stayed down, I think it wouldn't have looked this bad. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9722.0s)]
*  But shit, if you would have stayed down, would you have went down? [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9726.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9729.0s)]
*  He's doing the right thing. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9730.0s)]
*  You got to go with those shots, especially with Devin Haney. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9731.0s)]
*  Devin Haney's a big lightweight. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9735.0s)]
*  He's big. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9736.0s)]
*  He's big and he hits very hard. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9737.0s)]
*  And he's so skillful. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9739.0s)]
*  His jab is top-notch. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9740.0s)]
*  In the Kambosas fight, I was ... Kambosas is good, man. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9741.0s)]
*  What he did to Tiafimo when he dropped him in the first round, I was like, whoo, he's fast. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9745.0s)]
*  But Haney's jab looked crazy. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9749.0s)]
*  It looked crazy, but he also technically looked so good. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9753.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9757.0s)]
*  Everything he did was so good. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9758.0s)]
*  Everything he did was ... He's so well-schooled. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9759.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9761.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9762.0s)]
*  That was good. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9763.0s)]
*  That Lomachico, I was ... I just want to see them fight more. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9765.0s)]
*  But I think Crawford is going to ... [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9770.0s)]
*  That is a big one. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9772.0s)]
*  I think Crawford's going to pull it out. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9773.0s)]
*  Well, it's going to be interesting to see. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9775.0s)]
*  To me, that is ... Who the fuck knows? [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9777.0s)]
*  I'm excited to see it. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9782.0s)]
*  Errol Spence is a bad man. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9783.0s)]
*  He's a bad man. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9785.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a bad man. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9786.0s)]
*  He hits hard. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9787.0s)]
*  I think he's underrated by a lot of people for some reason. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9788.0s)]
*  But ... [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9791.0s)]
*  Bud is ... [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9792.0s)]
*  That's another level. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9793.0s)]
*  But this is the highest level both of them have experienced, I think. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9794.0s)]
*  Who do you think out of people that Bud has beaten? [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9797.0s)]
*  He's beaten everybody's fight. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9801.0s)]
*  But who do you think is on the level of Errol? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9802.0s)]
*  Arguably, this is the best fighter he's faced. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9805.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is the best fighter he's faced. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9808.0s)]
*  I think this is the best fighter. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9810.0s)]
*  And there's no disrespect to any of the other fighters he's faced. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9811.0s)]
*  Yeah, no disrespect to any of them. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9813.0s)]
*  But I think right now, Errol is like ... He's in that Sugar Ray Leonard and his prime stage. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9814.0s)]
*  There's a stage where a fighter is so elite that you're like, [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9819.0s)]
*  I can't wait to see what happens when he fights Roberto Duran. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9822.0s)]
*  I can't wait. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9825.0s)]
*  There's this level where you're like, how good is he? [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9826.0s)]
*  I just saw Sugar Ray Leonard. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9830.0s)]
*  How good is he? [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9832.0s)]
*  I just saw Sugar Ray and his benefit for diabetes. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9833.0s)]
*  And Sugar Ray looks fit right now. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9838.0s)]
*  He works out on Instagram. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9841.0s)]
*  Sugar Ray looks like he ready right now. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9843.0s)]
*  You can see his workouts. He puts workouts up on Instagram. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9846.0s)]
*  And you know, when you run into a fighter and you don't realize how small they are, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9849.0s)]
*  in certain fighters, and then other ones you don't realize how big they are. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9855.0s)]
*  I ran into Sugar Shane Mosley at the same benefit, and he's smaller than me, [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9859.0s)]
*  but he's rocked up, like up on his sweater with so many knots. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9865.0s)]
*  It's like a pillowcase full of shoes. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9872.0s)]
*  It's like, he was just all these rocks. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9874.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey man, Sugar Shane, you good? [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9876.0s)]
*  What's up, brother? You good? [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9878.0s)]
*  I'm like, good lord, you strong, man. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9879.0s)]
*  Like, why? [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9882.0s)]
*  Right now. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9883.0s)]
*  And then, Bernard Hopkins was there in a suit, real tailored. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9884.0s)]
*  I was like, hey champ, how you doing? [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9887.0s)]
*  Hands was just stone, y'all. I'm good, brother. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9889.0s)]
*  But talking soft, you say, hey brother, you good? [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9891.0s)]
*  But Sugar Ray, man, Sugar Ray. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9894.0s)]
*  It's Sugar Ray, still working out. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9897.0s)]
*  And he's... [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9899.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9900.0s)]
*  Oh! All that hurt. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9901.0s)]
*  It's like at Midtown, at Main Street Boxing Gym, right? [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9904.0s)]
*  It's this man, he is 79, and he comes there every day. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9909.0s)]
*  He cleans up in the gym. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9915.0s)]
*  And try it. Try it. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9917.0s)]
*  Think that you're going to get a win off of him. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9921.0s)]
*  Hey man, let's just box around. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9923.0s)]
*  This is going to be the worst day of your whole entire life. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9925.0s)]
*  He's 79? [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9929.0s)]
*  I don't know who he used to fight. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9930.0s)]
*  What he's doing with that bell call. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9932.0s)]
*  It is a problem. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9935.0s)]
*  Like, hey man, you know I just... [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9938.0s)]
*  Man, you just talk like we friends. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9941.0s)]
*  Like, this shit is bad. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9943.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9947.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9948.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9949.0s)]
*  And it's, man, it is a melee. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9950.0s)]
*  Did you see George Foreman hitting the heavy bag at 74? [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9952.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9955.0s)]
*  Did you see that? [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9956.0s)]
*  Yes, I saw it on the internet. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9957.0s)]
*  Find that. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9960.0s)]
*  It is insane. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9961.0s)]
*  Insane. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9962.0s)]
*  Do that. Do that. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9963.0s)]
*  Insane. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9965.0s)]
*  And then like Mike Tyson working out. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9966.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh my God. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9969.0s)]
*  Oh, it's like man, does his trainer, does it not look like he's killing him? [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9970.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9975.0s)]
*  His trainer is Rafael Cordero. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9976.0s)]
*  He's a legendary MMA trainer. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9978.0s)]
*  He runs King's MMA in California. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9980.0s)]
*  Rafael Cordero is the man. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9982.0s)]
*  It's like them blows are coming so close. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9984.0s)]
*  And he's wearing a bodysuit and eating those body shots. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9986.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9989.0s)]
*  And then also you got that, just knowing Mike Tyson has boxing gloves and he's in front of you. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9992.0s)]
*  And somehow now that you're in a fucking ring with him and he's moving towards you, like what does that feel like? [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=9998.0s)]
*  But check this out. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10003.0s)]
*  Look at George. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10004.0s)]
*  And that's the big one. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10005.0s)]
*  Yeah, give me some volume on this because we got to hear this. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10006.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10009.0s)]
*  Watch it. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10012.0s)]
*  What happened to the volume? [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10013.0s)]
*  Oh, we got to hear it. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10015.0s)]
*  Oh, you got to hear it. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10017.0s)]
*  Oh, this doesn't mean anything. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10018.0s)]
*  Let's fix that. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10019.0s)]
*  Let's fix it. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10020.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10021.0s)]
*  And that's that. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10022.0s)]
*  I'm quite sure you have been on the biggest bag in the gym. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10023.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big ass bag. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10027.0s)]
*  And that shit don't move. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10028.0s)]

*  Jamie, what's going on? [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10033.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10034.0s)]
*  Can we try just. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10035.0s)]
*  No, it's not even getting to my computer. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10036.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out why. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10038.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10039.0s)]
*  But it did before. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10040.0s)]
*  No, that was my laptop. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10041.0s)]
*  Oh, so there's something wrong with the connection to the computer. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10042.0s)]
*  There it is. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10046.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10047.0s)]
*  Okay, back it up. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10048.0s)]
*  Back it up so we can see it again. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10049.0s)]

*  This left. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10063.0s)]
*  Dude, and that's one of the things that you can do. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10064.0s)]
*  You can do. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10069.0s)]

*  This left. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10076.0s)]
*  Dude, and that's one of the things that George Foreman used to practice. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10077.0s)]
*  Go to George, young George Foreman hitting the heavy bag. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10085.88s)]
*  George Foreman, like he would hit the heavy bag different than a lot of people would. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10089.46s)]
*  One of the things that he would do is he always just practice wallop in the heavy bag, just [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10094.24s)]
*  stand in front of it. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10099.16s)]
*  Full blast, swinging punches. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10100.8s)]
*  Not like setting things up, moving around. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10103.119999999999s)]
*  No setup. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10105.119999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10106.119999999999s)]
*  What. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10107.119999999999s)]
*  All right, we're back. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10108.119999999999s)]
*  See if you can find young George Foreman hitting the heavy bag. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10109.119999999999s)]
*  Why did he have his face on that bag? [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10113.599999999999s)]
*  George coming around. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10117.199999999999s)]
*  The other dudes, because he's never had George Foreman hit the heavy bag with it before. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10118.199999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10122.119999999999s)]
*  It's hard to hold the heavy bag without doing that, though. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10123.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10126.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10128.0s)]
*  So this is what he did. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10130.0s)]
*  He did a lot of this. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10132.6s)]
*  The volume is dead again. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10135.4s)]
*  Here it goes. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10136.4s)]
*  I got it now. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10137.4s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10138.4s)]
*  But who hits the heavy bag like this? [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10139.4s)]
*  He's just winging punches. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10147.04s)]
*  He got his hand out the way. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10148.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10149.04s)]
*  Look at the dents. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10150.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, even the way he does it, he's just throwing power shot after power shot. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10151.080000000002s)]
*  And that's just to break you. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10158.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and not even really bending that much at the knees. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10161.04s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10166.04s)]
*  The kind of power this dude had. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10167.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10170.04s)]
*  I mean, this is ferocious. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10171.04s)]
*  Ferocious. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10173.04s)]
*  When he gets his legs into it, my god. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10174.04s)]
*  This thing Ali was taking it. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10178.04s)]
*  Took it all. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10180.04s)]
*  Took it all and dodged it. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10181.04s)]
*  I want you to pull up George Foreman knocks out Joe Frey in the back. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10183.04s)]
*  He's just like, this is just a good way to get him to be on the edge. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10188.04s)]
*  This is the way to go. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10193.04s)]
*  I want you to pull up George Foreman knocks out Joe Frazier. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10196.04s)]
*  Oh, it was crazy. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10200.04s)]
*  I thought Frazier was going to die. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10202.04s)]
*  He knocked him off his feet. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10204.04s)]
*  That was a crazy one because that was when Joe Frazier just beat Muhammad Ali. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10206.04s)]
*  And then you see what Foreman does to Frazier and everybody thought that Foreman was going to crush Ali and they were scared. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10211.04s)]
*  Because it was like, this is a real, it's like this is the first super heavyweight or something. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10218.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10223.04s)]
*  So this is the second round. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10224.04s)]
*  So this is when he's already hurt, I believe. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10227.04s)]
*  I don't remember how many rounds it was. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10229.04s)]
*  Oh, they're showing a replay of this. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10231.04s)]
*  So this was like he had heard him the round before. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10233.04s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10236.04s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10237.04s)]
*  The power. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10239.04s)]
*  Even the way he's boxing, he boxes the way he hit the bag. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10240.04s)]
*  Look. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10243.04s)]
*  It's just the power is so extraordinary that if he catches you at all, he thumps you with that jab and then just swings at you. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10244.04s)]
*  And he hits you. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10254.04s)]
*  Oh, look at that uppercut. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10255.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10256.04s)]
*  Look at that right hand. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10259.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10260.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10263.04s)]
*  Look at that uppercut. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10264.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10265.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10267.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10269.04s)]
*  So the round ends. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10272.04s)]
*  He doesn't know where he is. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10275.04s)]
*  Now the round is about to end. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10278.04s)]
*  Two knockdowns in the first round of Joe Frazier. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10280.04s)]
*  Down again. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10284.04s)]
*  No saving by the bell. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10285.04s)]
*  So he gets up and he goes back to his corner. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10289.04s)]
*  Now, this is what's amazing that they didn't stop this fight. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10292.04s)]
*  They didn't. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10295.04s)]
*  That's amazing that his corner didn't say, that's it. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10296.04s)]
*  That's it, champ. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10298.04s)]
*  That's it, champ. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10299.04s)]
*  Because they know. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10300.04s)]
*  Because he's a warrior and you can't let him go after him. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10301.04s)]
*  Different time, too. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10303.04s)]
*  This is a different time, too. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10304.04s)]
*  I think today they would have stopped the fight. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10305.04s)]
*  Yeah, they probably would have stopped this. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10307.04s)]
*  I think today they would have stopped the fight. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10308.04s)]
*  Especially knowing this type of power that's coming. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10309.04s)]
*  So this is afterwards. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10312.04s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10315.04s)]
*  What's he warning him about? [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10316.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10318.04s)]
*  Oh, my God, this power. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10321.04s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10325.04s)]
*  Boom. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10326.04s)]
*  And see, the problem is, you can't even tell. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10328.04s)]
*  You can't even block that with your gloves. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10332.04s)]
*  No, it doesn't help. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10334.04s)]
*  Because it's too much power. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10335.04s)]
*  It's so much power. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10336.04s)]
*  And it's skillful, too. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10338.04s)]
*  It's like he wings those to the body, but he's also skillful with the jab. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10340.04s)]
*  Oh, look at that left. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10343.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10344.04s)]
*  Frazier couldn't even throw his. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10346.04s)]
*  For the fifth time he's down. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10348.04s)]
*  This is crazy, this fight. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10350.04s)]
*  And he's still... [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10352.04s)]
*  He's... [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10355.04s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10358.04s)]
*  I mean, what a warrior Joe Frazier was. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10361.04s)]
*  And that leg, he gone, too. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10363.04s)]
*  Yeah, oh, for sure. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10365.04s)]
*  But he's still in there. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10366.04s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10367.04s)]
*  Three times. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10369.04s)]
*  Three times. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10371.04s)]
*  The fight is stopped. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10372.04s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10373.04s)]
*  Oh, my God, it's not stopped. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10375.04s)]
*  Angie Dundee is screaming, stop it. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10377.04s)]
*  Ferdy Pacheco. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10379.04s)]
*  Okay, they're stopping the fight. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10380.04s)]
*  It is over. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10382.04s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10383.04s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10385.04s)]
*  And Ali sitting on the couch like... [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10387.04s)]
*  And he go, my shot. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10390.04s)]
*  This who I want to fight. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10392.04s)]
*  Do you know that Hunter S. Thompson flew to Africa to watch that fight and was so scared that Ali was going to get killed? [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10395.04s)]
*  And so he didn't want to see Ali get the fuck beaten out of him, so he stayed in his hotel. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10403.04s)]
*  He stayed in his hotel and he got drunk and he floated around on the pool, on a pool floaty. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10408.04s)]
*  And then afterwards he found out that Ali won. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10413.04s)]
*  So they'd flown him to Africa to write, to report. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10415.04s)]
*  Rolling Stone flew him there. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10421.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10422.04s)]
*  He just completely failed. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10423.04s)]
*  Didn't go there at all. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10424.04s)]
*  He's like, no, I'm not. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10425.04s)]
*  Put on a Nixon mask and he was floating around on a pool floaty. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10426.04s)]
*  It was like video of him doing it. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10430.04s)]
*  Because I don't want to see Ali get killed. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10432.04s)]
*  Because he didn't want to see his hero get killed. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10434.04s)]
*  Everybody thought he was going to get killed. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10436.04s)]

*  Hearns cracked him a few times. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10499.04s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10501.04s)]

*  And when he knocked out Roy, everybody was like, holy shit. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10753.04s)]
*  And then Glenn Johnson did it, and that was a scary one. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10757.04s)]
*  Remember that one? [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10759.04s)]
*  Yeah, his mitt was up pretty long time. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10760.04s)]
*  They was sweeping and everything. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10762.04s)]
*  Those scare me. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10765.04s)]
*  Those kind of scare me when someone stiffens up. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10766.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10769.04s)]
*  And to have it happen after the Tarver KO, those are the kinds that scare me. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10770.04s)]
*  Because sometimes a fighter is still recovering from the initial knockout, [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10775.04s)]
*  and they've just convinced themselves they're okay. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10779.04s)]
*  And they're not ready. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10781.04s)]
*  No, man. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10783.04s)]
*  You know, that's why Manny Pacquiao, after Marquez knocked him out, [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10784.04s)]
*  Freddie Roach said, I want you to take a year off. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10787.04s)]
*  A whole year. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10789.04s)]
*  You want to still work together? [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10790.04s)]
*  I want you to take a year off. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10792.04s)]
*  That was a bad knockout. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10794.04s)]
*  That was. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10796.04s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10797.04s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10798.04s)]
*  Marquez is a bad man. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10799.04s)]
*  He's a bad man. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10801.04s)]
*  And shit. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10802.04s)]
*  And he looked like he was on all the good stuff. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10804.04s)]
*  He looked like his piss would melt the Styrofoam cup. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10810.04s)]
*  I want everything that I'm not supposed to be taking. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10816.04s)]
*  This shit is, I'm ready. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10818.04s)]
*  If they drug tested him, it would ding like a carnival bell. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10820.04s)]
*  Ding! [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10823.04s)]
*  Like one of them Bugs Bunny ones where he's got the big mallet. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10826.04s)]
*  He's juiced up. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10829.04s)]
*  They didn't test him for nothing. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10830.04s)]
*  He was working with the guy that Pacquiao used to work with. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10832.04s)]
*  The juicer Pacquiao. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10835.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10837.04s)]
*  The guy that Pacquiao, the strength and conditioning guy, [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10838.04s)]
*  which is always the juice guys. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10840.04s)]
*  Always the juice guys. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10842.04s)]
*  Always the juice guys. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10843.04s)]
*  Those are the guys. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10844.04s)]
*  They're 70 and they got abs. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10845.04s)]
*  I was just eating this banana. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10847.04s)]
*  I didn't know what was in it. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10849.04s)]
*  He ate my food. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10851.04s)]
*  I had no idea what was in it. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10853.04s)]
*  Canelo said he got some tape. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10855.04s)]
*  Canelo said he got some tainted beef. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10857.04s)]
*  How did you get the fucking steroids in your body? [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10859.04s)]
*  Tacos, bro. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10862.04s)]
*  I just had a tainted taco. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10864.04s)]
*  It was sprinkling on the taco. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10866.04s)]
*  This shit was crazy. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10868.04s)]
*  Frank Mir, who is a UFC heavyweight champion. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10870.04s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10873.04s)]
*  Yeah, he was jack city, son. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10874.04s)]
*  Jack city. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10876.04s)]
*  And that's at the weigh-ins. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10878.04s)]
*  And they had real weigh-ins back then. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10879.04s)]
*  So he looked a lot bigger the next day. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10881.04s)]
*  So those weigh-ins, like the UFC, we don't have real weigh-ins. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10883.04s)]
*  We have real weigh-ins, but when the public sees it, it's the ceremonial weigh-in. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10886.04s)]
*  And it's oftentimes many hours after the first weigh-in. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10890.04s)]
*  So what happens is they weigh in at like 8, 10 in the morning. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10893.04s)]
*  And then they get to rehydrate till 4 p.m. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10897.04s)]
*  When they get back on the scale for the ceremonial weigh-ins. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10900.04s)]
*  They've been drinking water and electrolyze all day and eating all day. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10902.04s)]
*  So they might be like 10 pounds heavier. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10906.04s)]
*  Like no bullshit by then. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10908.04s)]
*  And then they look good. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10909.04s)]
*  So Marquez on fight night, though. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10910.04s)]
*  Show him Marquez versus Pacquiao. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10912.04s)]
*  Was it three? It was the third one, right? [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10915.04s)]
*  That was the last one. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10917.04s)]
*  On fight night. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10919.04s)]
*  It was four. That's right. It was four. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10920.04s)]
*  And they wanted to have a fifth one. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10922.04s)]
*  And Marquez was like, no, I'm good. I got it. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10923.04s)]
*  I got this one. Sorry. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10925.04s)]
*  You got me, but I got you motherfucker. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10927.04s)]
*  I got you where it counts. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10929.04s)]
*  He was jack city, son. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10931.04s)]
*  Look at his arm. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10933.04s)]
*  Yeah. Man, he was like fucking jacked. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10934.04s)]
*  And he was doing a lot of like crazy workouts for that fight too. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10937.04s)]
*  A lot of dumbbell shit. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10939.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10940.04s)]
*  Look at the fucking power behind that shot. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10942.04s)]
*  My God. Look at that. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10945.04s)]
*  Look at the power behind that shot. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10948.04s)]
*  Man, Pacquiao. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10954.04s)]
*  Pac Man was getting packed. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10956.04s)]
*  And then when he, he literally like, that's it right there, Jamie. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10959.04s)]
*  That's it. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10962.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10963.04s)]
*  He literally ran into that shot, looking to land a shot. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10964.04s)]
*  And Marquez timed it perfectly. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10966.04s)]
*  To watch a great like him get flatlined is always so strange. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10968.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10972.04s)]
*  You know, like you're so used to seeing him doing that to like Ricky Hatton. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10973.04s)]
*  Right? [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10977.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10979.04s)]
*  That's why. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10980.04s)]
*  Yeah, because Ricky Hatton got it. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10981.04s)]
*  Ah, Ricky Hatton got it. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10984.04s)]
*  He got it from Pacquiao. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10986.04s)]
*  He got it from Pacquiao. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10987.04s)]
*  And then when he got it from Floyd, he ran into the buckle. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10988.04s)]
*  Like, I'm like, man, what the hell is going on? [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10991.04s)]
*  Because he, ah. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10994.04s)]
*  Floyd got him first, right? [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10995.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10996.04s)]
*  And then Manny leveled him. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10997.04s)]
*  Yeah, Manny flatlined him. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=10998.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11000.04s)]
*  Look at the power behind this. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11001.04s)]
*  Watch this. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11002.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11003.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11006.04s)]
*  I mean, the way his head snaps back and he falls. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11007.04s)]
*  Look at this lady over here. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11010.04s)]
*  Look at her. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11011.04s)]

*  Yeah, look at her. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11013.04s)]
*  Look at him. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11014.04s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11015.04s)]
*  Viva Mexico. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11016.04s)]
*  He has zero concern. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11017.04s)]
*  Look at him. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11020.04s)]
*  I mean, Pacquiao is out cold. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11023.04s)]
*  Is he down? [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11025.04s)]
*  Is he down? [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11026.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11027.04s)]

*  Like, he didn't give a shit. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11030.04s)]
*  I mean, that's like a gunshot wound. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11031.04s)]
*  Look at this. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11032.04s)]
*  Boom. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11033.04s)]
*  I mean, it is the perfect punch. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11034.04s)]
*  That might be one of the great, I mean, it is one of the greatest punches, one punch knockouts [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11035.04s)]
*  in the history of boxing. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11040.04s)]
*  With the consequences on the line, with all on the line, with these two guys being world [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11042.04s)]
*  champions. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11046.04s)]
*  Did the Pacquiao show say get cracking? [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11047.04s)]
*  Is that what it said? [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11049.04s)]

*  You just got fucking rocked. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11051.04s)]
*  You got cracked. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11054.04s)]
*  You got what you asked for. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11055.04s)]
*  That was a wild, wild fucking four fights between those two guys. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11056.04s)]
*  Get cracking on his shorts. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11062.04s)]
*  He's a hell of a pool player. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11064.04s)]
*  He is? [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11066.04s)]
*  Yeah, like world class. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11067.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11068.04s)]
*  What? [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11069.04s)]
*  Yeah, like professional level pool player. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11070.04s)]
*  Legitimately. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11071.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11072.04s)]
*  Like Minnesota Fats? [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11073.04s)]
*  Minnesota Fats wasn't really Minnesota Fats. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11074.04s)]
*  Minnesota Fats was New York Fats. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11077.04s)]
*  And then when the movie The Hustler came out with Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman in 1960s [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11079.04s)]
*  and in 1963, I think. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11083.04s)]
*  Was that 63? [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11085.04s)]
*  When that movie came out, the movie was so popular that New York Fats changed his name [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11087.04s)]
*  to Minnesota Fats and said the movie was all about him. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11093.04s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11096.04s)]
*  He was just a good, his name was Rudolph, Rudolph Walden-Durone. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11097.04s)]
*  And he was a good pool player, but he was not at the level of like Willie Moscone, who [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11101.04s)]
*  was like the world champion at the time. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11105.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11107.04s)]
*  He was just a really good talker. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11108.04s)]
*  He was just a smooth talking Hustler character. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11109.04s)]
*  Man, there was some guys that grew up in pool halls that would beg to differ. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11112.04s)]
*  They was great. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11118.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11119.04s)]
*  If who was great? [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11120.04s)]
*  Any of them guys. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11121.04s)]
*  There's some guys who never even got noticed. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11122.04s)]
*  They'd just been playing in pool halls all their life. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11124.04s)]
*  Like, yeah, because you know, I know them guys who talk like, I wish Minnesota Fats [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11127.04s)]
*  would come down. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11131.04s)]
*  I'd wear his ass out. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11132.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11133.04s)]
*  Well, they probably would wear Minnesota Fats out, but he would probably wear Minnesota [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11134.04s)]
*  Fats out, but he would play in one pocket. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11138.04s)]
*  He really didn't gamble in anything other than one pocket, I think. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11140.04s)]
*  That was like a, I'm sure he played nine ball too, but I mean, like when he would play [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11143.04s)]
*  big games against people, he'd like to play in one pocket. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11146.04s)]
*  He could play everything though. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11149.04s)]
*  He was like a real professional class pool player. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11150.04s)]
*  He was a hustler, but Willie Moscone was like the world champion. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11153.04s)]
*  Willie Moscone, his high record of running balls in a row was like 526 balls in a row. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11158.04s)]
*  It lasted for decades. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11164.04s)]
*  That's the person that's in public, John. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11166.04s)]
*  That's the public person. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11168.04s)]
*  That's not really true. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11169.04s)]
*  It's not really true. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11170.04s)]
*  Because in the pool world, no, in the pool world, everybody gets found out, especially [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11171.04s)]
*  today because they gamble. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11175.04s)]
*  Because the great players, the best players, they all gamble. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11177.04s)]
*  You ever heard of Minnesota Reds? [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11180.04s)]
*  I'm sure there is a Minnesota Red. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11182.04s)]
*  I'm telling you, somebody. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11184.04s)]
*  But believe me, this is my world. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11185.04s)]
*  Like, I literally came up in pool halls. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11187.04s)]
*  I know a lot about pool hustling. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11189.04s)]
*  This is my dad on his own stick and all this. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11191.04s)]
*  And he always say, man, if I don't go shoot, we don't eat, which wasn't true because he [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11194.04s)]
*  owned the company. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11199.04s)]
*  But he was a pool shark. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11200.04s)]
*  I'm sure. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11203.04s)]
*  I'm sure. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11204.04s)]
*  There's a lot of pool sharks. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11205.04s)]
*  And there's some guys out there that I used to be in the pool hall. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11206.04s)]
*  I'm like, dang. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11209.04s)]
*  If they went public, like if that was, do they got anything? [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11210.04s)]
*  Do you think everybody makes it to it? [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11213.04s)]
*  Like, it's some basketball legends that play that ruckus, right? [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11215.04s)]
*  Right. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11218.04s)]
*  And everybody's mind, you talk about Dr. J. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11219.04s)]
*  They're like, come on, man. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11222.04s)]
*  Willie Earl. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11223.04s)]
*  Right. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11224.04s)]
*  Willie Earl was the co-writer. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11225.04s)]
*  But only people that know about Willie Earl. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11226.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11229.04s)]
*  Well, there's guys like that in pool. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11230.04s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11232.04s)]
*  Everybody knows about them. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11233.04s)]
*  They might not be in the professional tournaments or not in the tournaments, but everybody knows about them. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11235.04s)]

*  Everybody knows about them. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11240.04s)]
*  They're all hustlers. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11241.04s)]
*  They're all gamblers. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11242.04s)]
*  So they all gamble. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11243.04s)]
*  To get that good, to get really good, you have to play for stakes. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11244.04s)]
*  You don't get that good playing funsies. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11247.04s)]

*  You play for real bread. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11251.04s)]
*  So when you play for real bread, people find out. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11252.04s)]
*  Because the pool wire is like the quickest wire in the country. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11255.04s)]
*  If someone is playing for $25,000 at hard times in Sacramento, people in New York City hear about it. [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11258.04s)]

*  Instantly. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11265.04s)]
*  People text each other. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11266.04s)]
*  There's no secrets. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11267.04s)]
*  If you playing for $2500, I don't hear about it. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11268.04s)]
*  So if guys are good, if guys are good, everybody knows about it. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11269.04s)]
*  There's local legends. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11273.04s)]
*  There's like this guy named Justin Bergman. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11274.04s)]
*  He might be as good as anybody alive, but he doesn't play in too many tournaments. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11276.04s)]
*  But everybody's scared to gamble with him. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11280.04s)]
*  He goes and gambles with world champions and robs them. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11281.04s)]
*  And he's like this dude who never leaves his town. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11284.04s)]
*  And people come to him and try to gamble with him. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11286.04s)]
*  It's folklore shit. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11288.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11289.04s)]
*  But they're all known. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11290.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11291.04s)]

*  Jeffrey pulls the hustler. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11348.04s)]
*  So now, now he screws his cue together. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11350.04s)]
*  All right, so now they're hustling. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11353.04s)]
*  Let me see. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11356.04s)]
*  Okay, yeah, they're not going to show you. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11357.04s)]
*  See, they're not showing him to it. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11362.04s)]
*  That's the most embarrassing shit ever is when they try to get someone to pretend they can play pool and they can't really play pool. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11364.04s)]
*  That's why the color of money is so impressive. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11370.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, color of money is. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11372.04s)]
*  Because Tom Cruise looked like he could kind of play a little. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11373.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11376.04s)]
*  I mean, he didn't look really like a world champion, but he looked like he could play a little. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11377.04s)]
*  Like it looked reasonable to assume that he could play pool. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11382.04s)]
*  That's like with any skilled thing, like pool and any other thing, when they have somebody acting like this. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11385.04s)]
*  Right. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11390.04s)]
*  Like, like. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11391.04s)]
*  Like boxing. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11392.04s)]
*  Like I was going to say Creed. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11393.04s)]
*  Like Creed. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11394.04s)]
*  I mean, I saw Creed. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11395.04s)]
*  Creed is the worst goddamn boxing movie. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11396.04s)]
*  Like, I'm like, man, Will Smith did better in Muhammad Ali than fucking Creed. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11399.04s)]
*  Will Smith did good in Muhammad Ali. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11404.04s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11406.04s)]
*  He look good in Muhammad Ali. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11407.04s)]
*  But Creed, I'd be like, man, if you don't get these dance steps the fuck out of here. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11408.04s)]
*  Like, I'm like, that is fucking terrible. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11414.04s)]
*  Like, this is like, you can tell that they were just doing a count all the pad work. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11421.04s)]
*  Like, hey, look, one, two, three, turn your body. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11426.04s)]
*  One, two, three, turn your body. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11429.04s)]
*  Like, God, this is so terrible. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11430.04s)]
*  Creed is hot. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11433.04s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11434.04s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11435.04s)]
*  Like, can you, I can't particularly watch, like if you watch me watch Oz or any drug dealing movie or any doctor thing, [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11436.04s)]
*  it's the most excruciating thing happening to my face. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11449.04s)]
*  I'm like, that's, that, that, this is what I'm doing. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11452.04s)]
*  This right, that, that, ah, man, this, that don't even go like that. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11456.04s)]
*  Like, it's terrible. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11461.04s)]
*  Like, I'd rather watch something else that I don't know anything about and just be intrigued. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11466.04s)]
*  Like, oh, maybe that could, you know, maybe that could be happening. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11470.04s)]
*  But this, I'm like, man, what the hell am I doing? [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11473.04s)]
*  Whereas I would watch it and I'd be like, hmm, I guess that's how it goes down. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11476.04s)]
*  And I'm sitting over there so frustrated next to you, it's whispering. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11485.04s)]
*  It's like, yo, that's not how it go. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11488.04s)]
*  Man, I'm trying to watch the movie. [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11490.04s)]
*  Yo, that's not how it actually goes. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11491.04s)]
*  Explain it to me later. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11493.04s)]
*  I'm enjoying this. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11495.04s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to go to the lobby. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11497.04s)]
*  I'm going to go to the lobby because I hate this. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11501.04s)]
*  It's got to drive people crazy to play piano. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11503.04s)]
*  They see someone faking it. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11505.04s)]
*  That's got to drive people crazy. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11507.04s)]
*  That's not even your fucking body movement. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11509.04s)]
*  Like, none of this is your body movement. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11514.04s)]
*  Like, I would hate that. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11517.04s)]
*  Nobody plays piano anymore. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11518.04s)]
*  Think about that. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11520.04s)]
*  You had Ray Charles. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11521.04s)]
*  You had Little Richard. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11523.04s)]
*  You had, no, no, no, no. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11525.04s)]
*  John Legend still plays piano. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11528.04s)]
*  Oh, does he? [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11530.04s)]
*  People definitely play piano. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11531.04s)]
*  Yeah, but not like back in the day. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11532.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11534.04s)]
*  Jerry Lee Lewis. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11535.04s)]
*  Got more instruments now. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11536.04s)]
*  Billy Joel. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11537.04s)]
*  I know. [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11538.04s)]
*  I know. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11539.04s)]
*  I'm not, it's not a judgment. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11540.04s)]
*  I'm not saying, it's not a judgment. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11541.04s)]
*  I'm just saying it's interesting. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11542.04s)]
*  Like, there used to be so many, Elton John, there were so many piano acts. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11543.04s)]
*  There were like these big piano acts back in the day. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11547.04s)]
*  I think Usher may play one or two songs in his Vegas. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11550.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11556.04s)]
*  But it is people that play. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11557.04s)]
*  John Legend definitely plays the piano. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11559.04s)]
*  In every commercial and everything. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11562.04s)]
*  He is definitely. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11564.04s)]
*  I'm out of the loop. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11565.04s)]
*  I knew what you meant, but there's also a lot of people. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11566.04s)]
*  There's other stuff to do. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11569.04s)]
*  Right, but what I'm saying is that it used to be like a viable kind of music. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11571.04s)]
*  Yeah, like, guitar is still prevalent. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11575.04s)]
*  Like, most people still play the guitar and the drums. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11577.04s)]
*  Like, most people don't pull out. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11580.04s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11581.04s)]
*  But it is people who, like. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11582.04s)]
*  Is there something super sincere about singing a song while you're playing the piano? [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11584.04s)]
*  Like, goodbye, no, my jeans. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11588.04s)]
*  You're just standing there. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11592.04s)]
*  It's very sincere. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11593.04s)]
*  I felt that. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11597.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11598.04s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11606.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11607.04s)]
*  Like, the guitar don't give you that type of feel. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11608.04s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11609.04s)]
*  Like, you. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11610.04s)]

*  It's very emotional. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11613.04s)]
*  Goodbye, no, my jeans. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11614.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11615.04s)]
*  Makes you cry. [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11616.04s)]
*  If he's just standing there. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11617.04s)]
*  That's what John Legend. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11618.04s)]
*  That's why John Legend do it. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11619.04s)]

*  There's no back to that piano. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11642.04s)]

*  Everybody knows. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11663.04s)]
*  But everybody knows that John Mayer is super talented. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11664.04s)]
*  You would think he's taking the night off. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11667.04s)]
*  He's a very nice guy. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11669.04s)]
*  I think Elton John does his own like, he kind of slightly turnt, but he's on like a platform. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11670.04s)]
*  You can kind of see him. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11676.04s)]
*  Elton John is. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11677.04s)]
*  Oh my God, he's the man. [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11678.04s)]
*  Elton John back in the day. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11680.04s)]
*  What's that song? [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11682.04s)]
*  Saturday Night? [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11683.04s)]
*  Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting? [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11684.04s)]
*  What is the actual name of that song? [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11686.04s)]
*  His shit's Sideways 2. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11688.04s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11690.04s)]
*  It must be something like that. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11691.04s)]
*  It must be to show that he's playing it, which makes sense I guess. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11692.04s)]
*  I think Stevie Wonder's Sideways 2? [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11695.04s)]
*  Also you get to see more of him that way. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11698.04s)]
*  You get to see his hands and his legs moving and everything. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11701.04s)]
*  It's probably better. [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11703.04s)]
*  Because I've been thinking like every time I've seen him play piano, I've never seen him turn forward. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11704.04s)]
*  It's 100% always sideways. [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11709.04s)]
*  Maybe because it would just be all knees. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11710.04s)]
*  Knees and crotch. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11712.04s)]
*  It's just getting all knees and crotch. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11714.04s)]
*  Kind of weird that he wears glasses. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11717.04s)]
*  Like why is he wearing sunglasses? [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11719.04s)]
*  He always does. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11720.04s)]
*  Isn't that odd? [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11721.04s)]
*  He always used to wear the big crazy glasses. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11722.04s)]
*  That was when he was going bald. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11724.04s)]
*  Maybe his eyes bad now. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11726.04s)]
*  He's got his hair fixed. [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11727.04s)]
*  Because he's definitely not going bald anymore. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11729.04s)]
*  Like he might still lace front. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11730.04s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11732.04s)]
*  But Stevie Wonder. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11733.04s)]
*  I don't know if Stevie played. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11736.04s)]
*  Ray Charles never played to the side. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11739.04s)]
*  I mean the front. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11741.04s)]
*  Either. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11742.04s)]
*  I think they always played that way. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11743.04s)]
*  I think it's probably because there are those pianos that will play themselves. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11744.04s)]
*  So people probably want to see you moving around. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11747.04s)]
*  They want to see you actually doing it. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11750.04s)]
*  See if you can find... [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11752.04s)]
*  Stevie. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11754.04s)]
*  That's what people don't play no more. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11755.04s)]
*  The harmonica. [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11757.04s)]
*  So here he's sitting behind keyboards. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11758.04s)]
*  Is he facing the crowd? [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11760.04s)]
*  I can't tell. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11761.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11763.04s)]
*  Looks like he is there. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11764.04s)]
*  I think he turned. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11765.04s)]
*  He got keyboards and then he turns to the piano. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11766.04s)]
*  What about trying to find Ray Charles? [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11768.04s)]
*  How did Ray Charles do it? [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11771.04s)]
*  Because Ray Charles didn't even know where they... [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11772.04s)]
*  He only knew by sound where they even were. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11775.04s)]
*  I guess they all do it that way. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11778.04s)]
*  Makes sense. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11787.04s)]
*  No, I guess maybe a better answer is that when you open the piano up, that's where the [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11788.04s)]
*  sound comes out. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11794.04s)]
*  Oh, because it goes like this. [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11795.04s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11798.04s)]
*  And then maybe it's just traditional that they all just do it that way. [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11800.04s)]
*  Oh, that's that top thing. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11803.04s)]
*  The top axis like sound bounces off of it. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11804.04s)]
*  You point the sound the other way, it's going to be not a good concert. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11806.04s)]
*  Oh, that's pretty bad ass. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11808.04s)]
*  That's probably most of the reason why. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11810.04s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11812.04s)]
*  That's pretty cool that they designed a top like that. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11813.04s)]
*  It's like a sideways harp, like an enclosed harp. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11816.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11819.04s)]
*  Okay. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11820.04s)]
*  But these pianos don't do that, so that kind of defeats what I just said. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11821.04s)]
*  All right. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11824.04s)]
*  I got to wrap this up. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11825.04s)]
*  Tell everybody the names of your specials, where they can get them. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11826.04s)]
*  Domino effect, Domino effect 2, Lost. [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11831.04s)]
*  They can go right on to my website, ollyseddeak.com. [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11835.04s)]

*  What do you want on Instagram? [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11843.04s)]

*  Yeah, Olly Seddeak Comedy is my YouTube. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11854.04s)]
*  Oh, because it says at Olly Seddeak. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11856.04s)]
*  That's why I was confused. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11858.04s)]
*  So it's Olly Seddeak Instagram, Olly Seddeak Twitter, ollyseddeak.com. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPjTRdpP-U&t=11859.04s)]
