# Joe Rogan Experience #1492 - Jocko Willink
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL5RzI5LyVc)
*  If anybody's got the answers it's Jaco got any answers. Oh, I'm not quite so sure about that
*  Do you know magic the gathering is now racist I
*  Don't know what magic the gathering is some game that the nerds play. Oh, sorry. How is it? How is it racist?
*  I don't know. It was just read. I only saw the title of the article that they're trying to cancel magic the gathering
*  I'm like, oh Christ
*  Thought that's what you guys liked. I thought they liked magic the gathering
*  I have no everything's everything's everything's problematic. Everyone's getting canceled. It's amazing how many people did blackface
*  Yeah, it's very strange
*  It's very strange
*  It's very strange. I was on it was on primetime TV. Yeah. Yeah a bunch of times
*  Yeah, I mean like in the modern world prime time TV Jimmy Fallon was doing well
*  He's doing a Chris Rock impression, which by the way you used to be able to do when I was in high school
*  My friends were mr. T for Halloween. Nobody gave a fuck. Nobody was like Jimmy. What's wrong with you?
*  Everybody's like, oh, you're mr. T for Halloween. It was never like a problem. It's very it's a very strange thing
*  You know, but you can do whiteface. No problem here. What is this magic the gathering and vogue prejudice card?
*  That's a it's an enchantment card which restricts the casters
*  Opponents only using summons that match the skin color of their opposing creatures
*  Huh?
*  If you brought me on to talk about this I should leave now about about magic the gathering
*  This is why I'm here man. We're in a bad way shows how fucked up everything is
*  There's a lot of thin skin out there. I know apparently I just don't I mean it seems like a perfect storm
*  Like if you wanted to engineer the downfall of society you would do it in several steps
*  you would have a reality show president where everybody's mad at them and and then all the
*  Liberals get their feathers in a ruffle and everybody gets real super uptight and and then there's this big divide between the left and the right
*  That's kind of you know
*  Manufactured and then you'd have this disease just lock everyone inside
*  Yeah
*  President lock it shut down the economy force people to not work
*  So if your business falls apart you could be the most hard-working
*  diligent disciplined person who's always at work an hour early always has your eyes dotting your t's cross you still go broke and
*  you're still fucked and
*  Then you have this George Floyd thing and then boom it just ignites the power keg
*  the other thing that you have to wrap around all this is the social media, which is
*  You know I'm only gonna post things that are just gonna completely make everyone that sees whatever I'm posting
*  Emotional and and filled with rage whether you're on the left or you're on the right my goal is to enrage people
*  That's the goal and then that just gets spun up over and over so you're taking all these little incidents and you're multiplying
*  times thousands and thousands of views
*  And and then on top of that
*  Mainstream media is the same thing right?
*  It's not like there's this huge difference between what the mainstream media shows and what social media
*  They're both these both a motion emotional media. Just trying to make people emotional, which is the worst possible thing
*  No one makes good decisions when they're emotional
*  No, I spent my adult life trying to train humans to not get emotional in pressure situations
*  Why because it's gonna end up bad every single time every single time and yet?
*  That's what our that's what our society is based on right now, but it's based on these emotional reactions
*  Yeah, because of social media
*  I think and because of things like YouTube and user created content where anybody can kind of make videos so many things are vying for
*  Folks attention that mainstream media has resorted to clickbaity cut type shit whether it's New York Times articles
*  Which you know used to be beyond reproach that they're they've gone social justice warrior and clickbaity
*  And all these other websites are a hundred percent clickbaity
*  That's the only way they can get people to pay attention like I saw like the dumbest fucking article
*  I couldn't believe how dumb it was it was an article on Ozark is like has Ozark been cancelled
*  And I'm like fuck they cancelled that show that shows amazing
*  So then I click on the article the entire article is about a guy who couldn't find
*  Season one on Ozark because there was a glitch and then he found it
*  And so it's not so the whole article was just bullshit. Yeah, but they got me
*  They get everybody got you to click they're advertising dollars because they can show the engagement with the audience exactly well
*  Here's a good one CNN showed a guy got shot yesterday in San Bernardino
*  Hispanic man got shot in San Bernardino, so that's the title the title of the article is
*  Hispanic man gets gunned down by the police in San Bernardino
*  What they leave out is the guy had a gun and was shooting at the cops so this guy's got a gun
*  There's photos of this gentleman with a gun and there's a cop on his knees
*  About to shoot the guy the guy standing in front of a gas station. There's gas pumps
*  I mean, I mean maybe felt like they wouldn't shoot at him because the gas tanks were right behind him that the pumps were right behind
*  But why would they leave that out guy with gun in gunfight with cops dies is the right title not
*  Hispanic man gunned down by cops like they're literally trying to incite
*  Anger and violence they know that you read that and you see Hispanic man shot by cops like these motherfuckers
*  They're murderers. They won't stop and they leave out this picture of this man with a gun pointing it
*  You're looking at me like I'm gonna say some kind of really profound answer I got nothing for you
*  But because because you're exactly right that what is it?
*  What do they set up that headline for it's a outrage people anyone that actually opens it up and regions would actually
*  Probably say something like hmm sounds like the cops did a good job on that one and killed a bad guy before he blew up a gas
*  Station and her it killed a bunch of innocent people
*  But that's that's obviously not that I think if you try to write a headline the other way
*  How these heroic cops face man with gun eliminate him before he can cause terror in this neighborhood
*  That would be a nice headline to read
*  But you're not gonna see it
*  Cuz it's not gonna drive enough people crazy today if your wife tweets all lives matter you can get you
*  Just you doesn't even have to be you anymore
*  Yeah, all lives matter just imagine a time. We're saying all lives matter is so
*  Controversial that you could get fired didn't that happen to a soccer player or something yes a soccer player's wife tweeted something like that
*  Yeah
*  The guy who runs the Kings or the guy who's the commentator for the Kings they fired him you know and then
*  This is a lot of it is this right so
*  People are feeling a certain way and they're not they're not feeling like this girl that wrote all lives matter
*  Do you think that was her clandestine way of showing that she's all about white pride you know what I mean
*  No, she was thinking hey everyone matters. She's probably having some nice thoughts
*  She's but then all of a sudden no this chick is evil right for doing this and I think there's a lot of that
*  I think there's a lot of people that I think most people are
*  Pretty sane. I think most people are pretty reasonable
*  I think you know anybody looking at at the George Floyd case like yeah, that's completely wrong. That's disgusting
*  It's horrible tainist to watch I haven't heard anyone say other anything other than that
*  So how are we just getting so completely divided on this whole thing and start attacking people start attacking each other
*  Just over over absolutely everything. That's a good point because this is literally a case where no one is
*  Saying there's nothing wrong with that cop did no one no one zero people zero people
*  But yet everybody still at each other's throats zero people have have
*  Stuck up that guy in any way shape or form even law enforcement no law enforcement people saying you gotta understand
*  This is how you control a man you gotta lean on his neck for about eight minutes forty forty forty five seconds forty six seconds
*  No one's saying that and unfortunately what you know what you know what they're saying. They're saying defund the police
*  Yeah, they're saying no more choke holds right which I think is crazy
*  If you want to get someone to be under control, and you can't choke them
*  You know what you have to do you have to hit him in the head with a baton
*  Yeah
*  Seven times and you got a risk giving him brain damage permanently injuring them if people know what they're doing I mean
*  Obviously if people know what they're doing. Oh, we'll put a choke on the wake up. They'll be cuffed. Yeah, we're all good
*  Yeah, obviously
*  But you know it's the people that are doing it wrong is the problem the people that shouldn't be doing in the first place
*  It's untrained people. It's but if you're if you're not you're a cop and you're a fight for your life, and you can't use
*  chokeholds that's
*  Fucking crazy insane you're gonna get shot and killed or somebody else is gonna get shot and killed someone's gonna take your gun
*  Yeah, and and the idea of defund the police and I I understand the premise okay, and this is once again where
*  Many people that say defund the police they don't mean hey just get rid of police of course
*  There's a there's a fraction of people that are saying defund the police means we don't want any more police anymore
*  There's a portion of people saying that there's some people are saying well if we defund the police
*  We can relocate some of that money, and we can do you know better schools
*  And we can put money into the infrastructure inside these neighborhoods
*  But here's the problem
*  You know what the police need more than anything else they need money for training
*  And they're the way the police departments are set up they do
*  the most
*  Ridiculously minuscule amount of training for what their job is so as you know I was in the SEAL teams
*  We would train for 18 months 18 months. We were trained to go on a six-month deployment
*  cops they train they get like two hours or four hours of
*  combatives training a year a
*  year
*  That's that's complete insanity in Sam it's complete insanity the thing I've been saying is
*  Cops should train one-fifth of the time
*  One-fifth of the time you should be training whether it's two hours a day four times a week
*  Or whether it's one day a week where you're gonna go and you're gonna go through scenarios
*  You're gonna do combatives you're gonna work with sim munition. You're gonna do de-escalation drills
*  Because it's really hard
*  I mean being a cop is I think is the hardest job in the world and by the way
*  They're not gonna have to worry about defunding the police because no one's gonna want to be a cop anymore
*  Who is gonna be fired up to be a cop right now? Who's gonna think you know what when I grow up?
*  I want to be hated by entire. You know by a massive portion of the country
*  I want to be viewed as someone that's a that kills innocent people
*  The recruiting in cop for police is gonna go down so hard. It's gonna be ridiculous
*  It's gonna be ridiculous, and then who are you getting there? You're gonna get people that are
*  Worst level people worst level humans are gonna show up to be cops so the training piece though
*  They should do very
*  Very scenario driven training right where you come into a room, and this isn't like super expensive stuff either you come into a room
*  There's a person there
*  They appear to be compliant you ask you you learn how to talk to him
*  You very quickly learn that instead of yelling him out of the out of the gate you say hey, man. What's going on?
*  Hey, what's your name? You know what what's going on? We got a call here is everything okay? You immediately deescalate
*  Then you learn what to do when they're not when they don't respond the way you want them to respond then you learn what?
*  To do when they start to do something drastic. What's the best thing for you, and you play through these scenarios?
*  It's just like jujitsu in the fact that
*  What makes you just are good what makes you just are good as we can go hard against each other
*  Over and over again and not really get hurt not really get killed so you get really good at it
*  That's what you need to do in training for police you need to go through these tough scenarios
*  Over and over again because you do get better at it you do get better at it you become
*  You learn how to mentally detach and not get emotional and realize that there's other things that are happening
*  when you see the the George Floyd case I
*  A couple of other cops too. I think two of the other guys were complete rookies right they've been on the force for a very short
*  period of time
*  No one in that group of four obviously you got the killer himself
*  He's he's actually conducting the act, but all the other guys are not paying attention. They're they're all
*  Emotional themselves hey stay back and and they're probably watching him saying what's why isn't that guy moving and they're just caught up in it
*  Whereas if someone would have showed up on the scene or one of those guys had been through some good training in their life
*  They would have said
*  What's happening here hold on my partner over there has been on this guy for two minutes. He's not moving anymore
*  I'm gonna walk over and say hey, man. Let me take over. I got this deep go over there decompress
*  This takes training you have to train people and I got I saw this over and over again in the SEAL teams training guys
*  You get a young kid that's coming through training for the first time and they go into a room and they're getting shot
*  Simunition bullets or there's someone yelling and screaming or they we put we put Arabic women coming walking out of rooms
*  We'd have people get blown up with wounds. We would do this to them over and over again, so they realize okay
*  I just got to relax. I got to take a step back
*  I got a detach from this situation so I can process what's happening and I can make a good decision
*  Because as I said earlier no one is making a good decision when they're panicked when they're freaked out when they're scared as
*  a jujitsu guy
*  When someone puts hands on you you're not actually scared right you're like oh, okay
*  I know what to do here if you don't know jujitsu if you've never had someone grab you before or you haven't had someone grab you
*  in
*  17 months or 14 months no one's laid hands on you because you got a badge and a gun so people when you tell them to do
*  Something 95% of time they go. Okay. Yeah, I don't want to get in trouble, but then somebody grabs you you're instantly your your emotions are spiked
*  your adrenaline spiked and
*  the only way to overcome that is through
*  consistent training
*  That that happens on a regular basis. You can't just train somebody one time
*  It's like ring rust you know you can't just train somebody one time and oh now I don't need to train anymore
*  No, you need to do continuous training so so that fact right there
*  We if we want to if we want to help the police through these situations
*  We need to invest more money into them. We need to get them better training
*  we need to pull them out of the field to train and
*  Pull them out of the field to decompress
*  because
*  You ever done a ride along no like you
*  Whether you're doing a ride along whether you're going into any situation where you're thinking you could be killed and even if it's just a remote
*  Chance, but you're doing that all the time all the time
*  And you're hearing you're seen on the news your oh you hear this your buddy got shot your buddy got whatever this other guy got
*  You know take his gun taken away like that stuff happens that stuff happens people get killed. I mean there's been I
*  Think there's been 31 cops killed
*  this year 31 cops killed this year and a lot of those that's not including you know like a car accident or
*  COVID there's been a bunch died of COVID but just people that have been engaged with bad guys, and they got killed so you're a cop
*  When another cop gets killed you're thinking that could be you so that's your mindset and that mindset builds and that mindset
*  Builds and you're working 10-hour days, and you're working 12-hour days, and there's no training, and there's no breaks
*  Where do you end up right? Where do you end up you end up being a little bit paranoid?
*  You end up being a little bit angry what happens when you get in a fight with your wife?
*  You know it's like all these things you add them together. It's a freaking hard job and
*  from a
*  From a like an entire
*  Systemic way of training and recruiting and and
*  keeping police
*  Ready to do their job
*  Whatever that job entails because let's face it most of the time that and job entails
*  Well, I guess most of the time it entails. Hey, I'm gonna go have a bad
*  I'm about to go have a bad relationship with another human being that's what's about to happen right whether I'm pulling you over
*  Whether I'm I've been called to your house because you were yelling and screaming and people heard your wife screaming or whatever
*  That's what's happening. I'm showing up in a bad relationship. You don't like me, and I already don't like you
*  That's where we start. That's where we start so we got to train people for that
*  We also got to train them for all the times that they go into help people save people
*  They're the first people on the scene at car accidents people are bleeding out
*  We got to train them for that and then they have to also be trained for hey
*  This is a bad guy
*  This is the guy that you just talked about at a gas station with a weapon that wants to kill a bunch of people
*  You got to be prepared for that whole spectrum as a police officer and yet we send them to a
*  Three month long police academy and then we send them out in the street
*  And that's what they do day in day out day in day out
*  It seems to me that they need to be vetted too
*  Much better than they are now just like the seals like you can't get through buds unless you are a superior human being
*  You have to be able to tolerate a bunch of shit that most people are gonna fall apart during and this is this seems to me
*  That is a great way to weed out people that just don't have it
*  Yeah, there's
*  Well one thing that's interesting just from a physical perspective
*  most police departments don't even have a minimum physical requirement to
*  Continue to be on the force that you have to be at a certain level to graduate from the academies
*  But oftentimes there's no standard beyond that
*  Yeah, I've seen cops before the really like this is hilarious
*  Like what is gonna stop someone from closing the distance on you like you you ain't getting to that gun
*  Yeah, but the mental aspect is stuff that you can get better at yes
*  You can get better at it
*  But you only get better at it through training right and you only get really comfortable through training a lot
*  And yet we put these people in these horrible positions over and over and over again
*  And we get we don't give them the proper training and now there's these politicians that because of the current social climate
*  They're encouraged to want to defund the police. That's a great way for them to get
*  Brownie points from their constituents the people want the police to fund it which is that what it's the dumbest idea
*  I've ever heard of my life
*  It's it's so crazy that this is actually gaining steam to the point where in Minneapolis because they're trying to quiet down the mob
*  They've actually gone ahead and done it
*  What the fuck is Minneapolis gonna look like in a year from now? It's gonna look like Mad Max. I mean, it's gonna be crazy
*  That's gonna be it's gonna be crazy. It's gonna be uh, you know criminals will go there to commit crimes
*  If there's no if there's no police there, are you crazy? By the way, this Choco energy drink is the shit
*  Yeah, I just don't understand where they think this game ends and I don't think they've planned it out
*  They're not playing chess the the other the other thing that you know, you're talking about this
*  Brownie points for the politicians and and there's Brownie points and there's
*  People trying to create sides. It's my side versus your side and that's a completely political thing, right?
*  and all that does is increase the divide between
*  the police and the civilians and and this reminds me a lot of
*  Of a counterinsurgency right so
*  Insurgency the insurgents are you know bad guys inside of a country the country's not bad
*  There's some bad guys in a country
*  So what you have to do is you actually have to go out and build relationships with the good people inside that country
*  So that the good people inside that country can help you get rid of the bad people
*  What happens if you go out and this so this is Ramadi Iraq? This is my last deployment to Iraq
*  there's a bunch of
*  Just totally normal good people Iraqi people that are living in the city of Ramadi
*  What do they want to do? You know what they want to do? They want to send their kids to school
*  They want to run their little market. They want to do whatever that whatever is that they do
*  That's what they want to do. They have the same goal as a normal family
*  they're just a normal bunch of people and
*  Inside that group of people there's a bunch of bad people and these are insurgents some of them are foreign fighters
*  Some of them are foreign regime elements from Saddam, but they're bad and they want to create chaos and mayhem so
*  Americans we go in there if we go in there super heavy-handed and
*  While I go to capture or kill one bad guy I
*  Kill or maim a couple of those normal civilians. What happens?
*  Well a couple of those normal civilians family go wait you guys aren't good
*  You guys are bad you guys just killed my brother, and he didn't do anything wrong and
*  Then we do it again, and then we do it again, and then we do it again
*  And each time that we do this where we're creating more animosity from the local populace who by the way like I said
*  They're just not good normal people
*  So what we had to do is really focus on going out and building relationships
*  With the local populace how do we do that and one of the things this this happened after I left
*  But you remember the surge that took place and they sent a bunch more troops over there
*  Part of the reason that they sent that surge and part of the reason that that was allowed to happen was because the battle of
*  Ramadi where I fought went very well and since it went well people said well
*  Maybe maybe we can pull this off, so they sent more troops and one of the directives that general Petraeus gave
*  Is he said there can be no more drive-by counterinsurgency?
*  And what he meant that by that was when you go to a neighborhood
*  You can't just drive through the neighborhood in your Humvee in your bulletproof Humvee with your windows up drive through show of force
*  And then leave that that doesn't work what you have to do is stop your vehicles
*  You have to get out you have to talk to the local populace you have to ask them
*  What's going on you have to ask them if they need anything you have to build?
*  Relationships with the local populace the good local populace that just wants those insurgents out of there
*  And that's what I don't see happening and the more we increase this divide between the police and the civilians
*  The worst that's gonna get and so the police have to start doing a better job of outreach of hey
*  Well, you know I asked you if you did a ride-along
*  They should be offering ride-alongs all the time till the total local kids
*  17 year old kids 15 year old kids hey come and see what my job is like come and help me out that
*  15 year old kid he knows who the bad actors are he knows who the good kids are
*  You know bring that kid along on a ride-along let him see what it looks like from your angle get out meet the parents
*  Meet the families that's where we're failing to build relationships
*  Between the police and the civilians and that causes that that that causes these problems
*  I think you're a hundred percent correct, but I don't hear anybody repeating what you're saying
*  That's what's terrifying to me. I think everything you're saying is logical it makes sense it comes from experience
*  I don't hear anybody saying this yeah, and I well
*  I think maybe it's because people just don't recognize what's happening because they're too in it right there too in it
*  they're they're wrapped up in it and
*  And that's another part. You know I talked about recruiting who you recruiting recruit those kids
*  Recruit those kids, but you have to build a relationship with them before you can add before anyone's gonna go into the police and look the I
*  Think it's that I think it's the LA Police Department if you look at the LA Police Department compared to the racial makeup of LA
*  They they're pretty equivalent, and they're pretty equivalent on purpose
*  They do that for a reason so you got to get that you got to continue to build that those relationships so that
*  We talk to one another
*  You know we actually communicate with each other because anytime you know I'm allowed to sit over here in my area
*  And you're sitting over there in your area
*  We're building animosity. We build that kind of animosity between each other and now the littlest thing the littlest thing
*  I mean there was a woman that was killed in Minneapolis
*  Like two three years ago. Do you remember this one? Yes female?
*  Okay, yoga instructor
*  Called the police the police called the police to report a disturbance police showed up, and there's no video no footage
*  She gets killed by the cops
*  She gets killed by the cops
*  It's insane that that these things happen, but we also have to remember
*  What like I said?
*  What is a police officer thinking about and what kind of training and we give them and what kind of?
*  Psychological screening to your point what kind of strike and it's not just one time psychological screen screening because guess what?
*  People get burnt out and it happens at different times to different people you take 35 guys in combat
*  I've got some guys at the end of a six-month deployment there. You know what they're telling me can I stay longer?
*  I'm doing fine you get one month into that deployment. You've got other guys that are saying hey
*  Do you need anyone to head home early?
*  Right that happens so you think in a police force of a thousand people or whatever size your police force is you're gonna
*  Have some people that are
*  steady
*  Mentally stable they can deal with it they can go they can they can get being an officer in
*  Shooting today and tomorrow they can go back to their job and be perfectly fine
*  There's other people they could never work again after they're an officer involved shooting what kind of?
*  investment are we making into this psychological health of
*  Police and look I hope it doesn't sound like I'm sitting here
*  Just putting it all on the police because
*  Everyone is playing a role in this and one of the things that you need to look at as well as
*  How to get arrested right
*  There should be a public service course on how you should get arrested
*  This is what you should do if the cops are pulling you over if the cops ask you if the cops approach you about something
*  Here's what you should think one of the things you should think is okay
*  This cop may not be bad this cop may be looking out for my welfare right now
*  That's a great hopeful thought the other thing that you have to think is kind of worst-case scenario
*  This cop might be agitated this cop might be looking for somebody that fits my description
*  This cop might might have just been in a fight with his wife. He might have just lost a partner
*  There's a million bad things use that scenario in your head
*  Use that scenario in your head to to contemplate how you're going to interact with a police officer
*  Which is you know what they're looking at they're looking at your hands
*  You know why because that's where the threat comes from the threat comes from your hands
*  So when you're making quick movement with your hands don't do that listen to what they say
*  Move move slowly when you move this should be a good thing
*  This should be public service the police should be putting out
*  Hey, if you interact with the police we hate to have to say this but since our police sometimes are in bad situations
*  Here's some things we recommend and we highly suggest and we beg
*  We beg that you do this we beg because what happens to these cops when they kill somebody
*  What happens them their lives are just totally destroyed? Well, that was the thing about that guy in Minneapolis. He'd already killed people
*  He'd already been involved and I think it's at least two shootings and he had more than a dozen complaints against him
*  Yeah, not good. Not obvious by the end by the end result. Yeah, that's the type of guy
*  He was it's pretty obvious by the fact that he was able to do that to a man
*  The guy's literally calling out to his dead mother
*  You know, I mean the type of man that can stay on someone's neck while they're doing that when all that guy did was
*  Have a counterfeit $20 bill. That's it
*  This is where when you talk about psychological, you know screening and that's why I'm saying it has to be it has to be constant
*  Yeah
*  because
*  People people change. Yeah, right and red flags. I mean
*  Like you said hindsight's 2020. We're looking at this case now. We're going who the hell lets this guy continue to police and
*  By the way interestingly enough if you talk to internal affairs at police departments
*  The vast majority of the complaints that they get about other about police are from police
*  So they complete they report each other. That's little known fact
*  Most of the most of the reports don't come from the civilians out there saying hey this happened or that happened
*  Most of the time it's cops saying hey, this guy was out of line here. Well, that's that's a good sign
*  This
*  It just it doesn't look rosy when I'm looking at the future. I know I don't see a way
*  during this climate
*  What what scares me the most is
*  I don't see a way if we don't talk to each other that that's where there's no solution
*  Because you know look for every 10 viral video that you see of a of a cop hitting and somebody with a baton or a
*  Rider throwing something through a window for every 10 of those viral videos. There's another viral video that has
*  You know the guy with the free hugs t-shirt on that's out talking to the cops and saying hey
*  You know I I get it and they're communicating with each other and talking and when you communicate with people
*  It's just like the hostage rescue basic technique you want to humanize you want to humanize instead of dehumanize and right now
*  We're just
*  Dehumanizing each other completely and that's what scares me more than anything else is if we can't talk to each other
*  Because look you take the most hardened
*  soldier in war some you know some badass soldier that's done four deployments six deployments whatever and you put him into a room with
*  a kid and a mom an Iraqi kid and her mom or an afghan kid and mom and
*  You put him in that room and say hey sit here for 15 minutes and find out what they're about. Here's an interpreter
*  That guy's gonna come out of there going yeah, I get where they're coming from
*  And same thing vice versa you take a hardened jihadist and you say hey talk to this guy over here about what he's trying
*  To do inside your country
*  Well, just just just talk to him when you open up the communications and are you gonna get some extremists on both ends?
*  Yes, you will so maybe I shouldn't have said the most hardened
*  Soldier and the most hardened because at them you know what the most hardened soldier becomes a killer
*  Becomes a killer that that happens happens all the time. You know I I
*  Shouldn't say it happens all time it happens from time to time. That's how you get the me lie massacre
*  It happens the most hardened jihadist. They're not gonna change their mind
*  They're not gonna come to any any rose-colored view of America
*  but
*  Barring those total extremes
*  You've got people you got a few other human beings and if you can get them to talk to each other
*  They can find consensus they can find common ground, but if they're not talking to each other
*  Then we don't move it make any progress and what to your whole kind of point about what's happening right now
*  There's less and less communication between people open communication
*  because if you if you talk to a someone and they say the cops did this this and this and
*  You say oh
*  Okay, explain to me what happened. Tell me what went down and then you say hey
*  Let me tell you what it's like for a cop being a cop when he sees that when he sees something going on
*  How many domestic violence
*  Cases happen and the person shows up and they're getting assaulted by both parties
*  So
*  maybe that's what you're this cop was thinking when he showed up and
*  Saw your mom in this situation and did this to your dad, right?
*  Like this is real conversations, but we don't we don't have them and not only we don't have them. It seems like
*  It seems like there's forces that are actively trying to prevent us from talking each to each other from sitting down at a table
*  And saying hey man, what tell me what's going on? What forces?
*  Who wants who wants the country to be divided it's the people that you're talking about earlier that that how do they score points?
*  How do I score points with this group? How do I score points with the other group? It's by making
*  Making everything as divisive as possible
*  It's it's it's horrible to watch man. It's sickening to watch I
*  was reading a
*  Whole series of tweets where there's a journalist that was talking about how?
*  Cop shooting black men is a real problem, but another real problem
*  That's not being discussed by this black lives matter group is black on black crime
*  And how do we stop all the murders that are taking place in Chicago?
*  This is something that should be discussed and
*  This guy was getting attacked and one of the one of the another journalist is literally tweeting at him saying you have been told
*  Not to discuss this
*  But yet he ignores the
*  These commands that that he should not discuss. There's a very real issue
*  As if somehow or another bringing up another issue
*  That is also a problem
*  Diminishes the original issue of this guy getting killed by cops
*  Which of course it doesn't yeah, but this the idea is that there's problems. There's real problems
*  It's not just the cops killing these people. There's there's look the cop killed this guy in Minneapolis
*  He didn't do anything in Seattle. How the fuck did that shit happen in Seattle?
*  Well, it happened in Seattle because of this reactionary world where where one person does something somewhere
*  It gets through social media it gets through the mainstream media it becomes this
*  this huge
*  Inflammatory subject and then the next thing you know windows are getting smashed things are getting lit on fire
*  Cars are getting turned over blocks are getting taken and that's where we find ourselves. I
*  Think it was May 29th
*  There was a cop killed. I want to say in Texas
*  And he was killed when they rolled onto a scene they got they got a call
*  Hey suspicious person running through the neighborhood. They roll up on the scene
*  They start a couple a few cops are now searching for this guy and they see a building with an open door
*  They go. Okay. Let's that maybe he's in there. Let's go clear this building with an open door
*  They go in this building with an open door their shots fired one of the cops killed one of the other cops
*  so just
*  You know friendly fire death
*  That right there
*  If you if you take that and you just extrapolate that over how hard it is to be a police officer
*  That you can be going into a building and you shoot one of your friends
*  Because you think they're bad
*  That is a real problem
*  That's how hard this job is my point is that's how hard this job is but
*  We have to do a better job of explaining that we have to do a better job of explaining how hard this job is
*  as far as the
*  Hey, don't talk about
*  black-on-black violence I
*  was trying I was talking with my
*  podcast
*  bro, echo Charles who's a black guy and
*  We were talking about that and I said, you know, I think it might have a little bit to do with this
*  If you were if you're watching UFC and there's two guys that are fighting and
*  The round ends like just just at the end of the round
*  All of a sudden the referee comes in and like punches one of the like just just
*  Muay Thai kicks a guy in the head and knocks him out
*  Everyone would be completely
*  Utterly outraged about this right because of course that guy wasn't in the game. What's that guy doing?
*  So I think there's a little bit of that. That's that's the the referee is supposed to not do that
*  and
*  When you see a cop the thought is hey that guy's like that guy's viewed as a referee
*  That guy's not supposed to be doing this
*  So I think that is kind of where some of that that that outrage comes from because this is a cop
*  This isn't supposed to be happening here. This guy is no not supposed to be killing people, right and he did
*  This also that the cop is just a person who has this extraordinary power
*  Yes, extraordinary responsibility to what's terrifying to me is that what I'm looking at this idea to defund the police and then I'm
*  Thinking like what are these?
*  What are these neighborhoods look like if you wind up doing that and
*  Then how do you get back out of that?
*  What do you do refund the police? Do you do ramp it up and do it better next time?
*  I mean, this is a long process you're looking at a lot of trial and error here over
*  You know perhaps multiple years before they figure out what what they fucked up. Yeah, and I know there's some there's some
*  City, I think it's in New Jersey that Camden. Yes that completely disband dismantled their police
*  But then they rebuilt a new police department and and I actually get that like you could get a
*  Department that was so completely and utterly corrupt. Yeah, you said you know what we're getting rid of all of them
*  And you ever see cocaine cowboys
*  No great documentary
*  But one of the things that talks about is the corruption during the cocaine era of the 80s where the entire
*  graduating police force the entire from the police academy the entire
*  graduating year
*  Everyone was either murdered or went to jail for corruption
*  Everyone the entire graduating class
*  That's how bad it was. Yeah, so if you have that kind of you have that kind of problem
*  You might get it. You might want to dismantle that police force
*  You know what happens in the SEAL team sometimes sometimes there's a platoon. That's so bad that they just they just dismantled the whole platoon
*  How often is that very rarely, but it does happen really? Yeah, what causes them usually there?
*  Well, the problem is bad leadership
*  It's always bad leadership because you can take a bunch of knuckleheads and you give them a good leader and they'll do they'll do fine
*  So it's always comes down to the leadership
*  So sometimes they'll replace a leader
*  But if the and usually when they replace leader you'll watch the platoon will turn around almost instantly because someone steps in and says alright
*  Here's what we're doing. Here's how we're doing it and they they make that change, but sometimes you have just
*  Like a bad platoon and they say you know what you guys are done
*  It seems incredibly difficult to be a good leader one of them one of the more interesting things about what you're doing
*  With your platform whether it's your podcast or the Instagram videos you put out you're showing
*  What good leadership is there's not a lot of people?
*  When you look at if you get a thousand people how many of those people are going to be a real good leader?
*  Well, this is what's this is what has become my career after the SEAL team
*  Because I got very very lucky in the SEAL teams very very lucky first of all my whole career was just luck
*  I was the luckiest guy ever in the SEAL teams and
*  I happened to be in the right places at the right times and I got some great experience in some very tough situations
*  And then the last thing that I did in the SEAL teams for almost the last three years
*  I was in was I ran the training the tactical training not the training where guys carry boats on their head and carry logs around
*  I didn't do that. I didn't I went through it, but I didn't run that training. I ran the training where
*  Everything I was talking about you're running scenarios. You're putting people in bad situations. You're using simunition
*  You're doing all these things so I got to see over and over again
*  Leaders get put into pressure situations and how their leaders responded and then how the team responds to that leader and what?
*  these different things wash out how they wash out and what's interesting is and what I
*  Really realized when I was in that position is that their leadership is a skill
*  And you can get better at it now just like fighting just like jujitsu
*  There's certain people that have a natural propensity to be good at you got some let's say someone's really strong right they're gonna
*  Have an advantage. Let's say someone's super flexible. They're gonna have a little advantage. Let's say someone has
*  They're big right these things are advantages in fighting in leadership. It's the same thing. Let's say someone is
*  Super articulate that's helpful. Let's say someone doesn't have a bad temper. That's very helpful, but everyone is at a different level
*  Well, just like you can take a bunch of different sized and shaped and athletic ability people and you can make them better at fighting
*  You can take a bunch of people with different levels of leadership characteristics, and you can improve them and then there are actual
*  Moves
*  There's actual moves that you can do as a leader that are just like a jujitsu move
*  Oh Joe comes to me and he's yelling and screaming at me that he didn't get the
*  He didn't I didn't give him two extra people to go on his job
*  Instead of me going hey Joe shut up. You don't know what you're talking about instead. I actually listen to you right I listen you say
*  Well hold on. I didn't know you needed that many people. What do you what do you need them for?
*  So I show a little sense of urgency I kind of reflect what your emotions are so I'm not just
*  Creating a fight between you and me because if you and I are fighting you and I are not finding a solution
*  So I'm gonna reflect a little bit of your emotion
*  And then I'm gonna diminish it a little bit so you and I can have a real conversation
*  So there's moves that you can do as
*  A leader that function like a jujitsu move, and they're very very powerful the more of them
*  You learn the better off you'll be and you need to practice them. You won't be good at them out of the gate
*  It's gonna take some just like if I showed you an arm lock and you never done jujitsu before you're not gonna be able to
*  Get on the mat and do it to somebody you're gonna have to try it a couple times
*  You're gonna have to learn the little nuances to the move so there are ways that leaders can get better and yes, there's absolutely
*  Natural leadership qualities that make people just a natural better leader
*  But they even those people can improve so your question of out of a thousand people how many?
*  Really good leaders there are well you have to ask
*  Okay, you just talking about how many people are just naturally born great leaders you're probably your suspicion is correct
*  It's not a huge amount, but how many of those leaders can you improve?
*  Exponentially in their ability to lead and that's what you have a company actually on front
*  That's what we do all the time is we go and work with companies. We work with leaders. That is exactly what we do and we take
*  companies of I mean we work with companies that have
*  150,000 employees and you start getting everyone all the all the leaders aligned and getting the frontline troops understanding where the
*  where the leadership is and what they're thinking and
*  So you can become a much much better leader over time now
*  How much of this do we see in the civilian sector how much to even more directly?
*  How much of this do we see in the political world the answer is?
*  An unbelievably small amount I think it's a ridiculously small amount
*  Yeah, it's a ridiculously small amount. Why is that? I bet there's a there's a lot of reasons first of all who who at this point?
*  In in the world thinks that that sounds like a great job, right? Hey, I'm gonna go get attacked from all sides
*  I'm gonna have my personal life picked apart
*  I'm gonna get you know make I'm gonna work really hard and really not I'm gonna have a pay cap on how much money I make
*  There's all kinds of reasons why becoming a politician
*  Doesn't look like the best job for for most people that would look and say hey
*  Would I rather be the CEO of a company and make a ton of money and make create a huge product and leave a big impact?
*  And influence thousands of people that work on my company in a positive way
*  Or would I rather go and get ridiculed and get broke down and have to try and get my job again in four years?
*  Or two years or whatever the case may be it's a tough
*  That's a tough job too, and a lot of people say I'm not gonna why would I jump into that game?
*  Well, I know I say that why would I jump into that game?
*  Why would I want to go and be a politician right now, right?
*  It's crazy like for me to for me to want to go into the into the political world there would have to be
*  Complete nut or chaos in America. I mean way beyond beyond where we're at right now about this
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm telling you what I think when because people ask no you should do this. You should do that
*  I say mom, you know, we're not at a point where we need this
*  About four days away from we could be I think the answer, you know, let's get let's get out Dwayne the Rock Johnson
*  I agree with you. He's
*  He's the guy that could really I think unify people and I think he would have to run as an independent
*  I recommend he does it right now
*  Right right now. He's like, yeah, you know what I'm in
*  I'm I think he would win. I think he would win. I really think he would win as an independent. He's
*  Obviously a smart guy. He's super articulate
*  He listens you can tell that he listens. I mean when you see him interact with people he's he's very
*  Genuine how he interacts he's built businesses, right? He's built big
*  well
*  really
*  Productive businesses that are doing great
*  He he's I think he'd be great
*  It's got a fantastic work ethic. I got a fantastic work work ethic that he you know, he built he came up from nothing, right?
*  He had seven bucks in his pocket
*  We all know the story and and he has more bucks in his pocket than that now
*  so
*  And most important I think I think he's just a popular guy, you know
*  He would get up and and when the country's going through hard times
*  you know, I was talking to a friend on the way up here and
*  They were saying hey, you know
*  people people want leadership and they're looking for it and
*  And and they're not hearing it and a lot of times people don't even recognize the fact that they don't have leadership
*  They don't even recognize it. It's a leadership vacuum. So they don't even know
*  What they should be?
*  Thinking well, let me give you an example. You're let's take a seal platoon seal platoon raids a house. There's some explosions
*  There's some gunfire and no one's really sure where it's coming from and no one's really sure what to do now that individual
*  A lot of the individuals in that platoon are just kind of holding on security
*  They're not really sure what to do and they're not really even
*  Recognizing that there's a leadership vacuum
*  But then someone comes in the leader the platoon chief the platoon commander comes in and goes everyone get to the roof right now
*  And everyone goes oh cool. Now we know what to do
*  So same thing happening in America right now. There's no
*  Kind of voice saying hey everyone
*  This is what I just saw on this video, this is what I just saw this was a heinous crime this
*  We have some deep-rooted problems that we need to fix. Here's the way I'm gonna move forward
*  Addressing these problems getting to the bottom of them and here's how long the timeline is gonna be and
*  By the way, my ears are open and you know where the place you know where I'm coming right now
*  I'll be in Minneapolis tomorrow afternoon
*  That's you know, like oh we got a problem like that if we have a problem like that. I am going on the ground
*  I will be there. I'll be there. What do I'm the guy something the president?
*  So I'll be there in what two hours. I'll be there on the ground. I'm gonna find out what's going on
*  I'm gonna meet with people we're gonna talk. I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna find out what this means
*  I'm gonna get to the bottom of these problems
*  That's that's what then you can actually speak
*  From a position of okay. I just spoke to these nine people matter of fact. They're coming with me
*  We're gonna come up with a plan. We're gonna come up with a plan together
*  You know, that's another huge leadership
*  Everyone thinks in the military that the that the leaders sitting at the top going all right gentlemen
*  Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna approach this building from the West. We're gonna assault the front door. No, that's not the way it works
*  That's not the way it should work. The way it should work is I say to you Joe. I say hey Joe
*  Here's the target. I want you to go after tonight come up with a plan and you say okay cool
*  And then you if you're a good leader you get with your team and say hey guys. Here's the target
*  We're going after how do you all think we should do it?
*  And now you all come up with your own plan together and then you come back to me and say hey, Jocko
*  Here's how I want to do it and I said looks good
*  And maybe if I got to make a little adjustment
*  I say hey make this little adjustment here or maybe use this weapon over here or whatever
*  I make little tiny adjustments, but it's still your plan and from a leadership perspective
*  That means you are you and your team are totally bought into the plan
*  You made it up as opposed to me coming down and barking orders at you and telling you how we're gonna do it doesn't work
*  I mean I can force you to do it because I outrank you know
*  I order you to do this that done that doesn't fly you know many times in my entire military career
*  I said hey, I'm the boss you better do what I tell you to do you want how many times. I said that zero
*  zero times
*  No one thinks like that so in a leadership position what you have to do is say hey, I'm gonna come
*  I'm gonna find out what's going on
*  I'm gonna talk to people and we're gonna put together a plan to figure out how we're gonna get this solved
*  This is not acceptable in America
*  That sounds fantastic
*  But what if you're a Republican and they're Democrats and then you get on the ground and you have a mayor that's non-compliant
*  You have a governor that disagrees with your strategy. They don't want you there in the first place
*  They want to work it out themselves. They want to defund the police. They're voting unanimously to defund the police
*  They don't like what you're saying cool
*  What okay if that's where we're at right now. Let's let's come up with a plan. Let's see how we get through this
*  Here's some things I'm worried about because if you if you're telling me you want to defund the police because you think that this
*  Police department is completely another utterly corrupt. Okay, let's let's explore that because you could be right you could be right
*  This is where a lot of leaders make a mistake where it becomes an ego thing
*  Especially like you're talking Republican and Democrat
*  So that means if I'm a Republican no Democrat can have a good idea ever and if I'm a Democrat
*  No, Republican can have a good idea ever. That's completely wrong. That's completely wrong
*  So even right now like when you threaten me right now right now you're like hey
*  What if I tell you I want to defund the police and I want I tell you I don't want the cops now
*  You tell me all those things as a good leader. You know what I'm gonna say. All right
*  There must be something really bad going on here beyond even what I just saw on this video
*  I'm coming and I want to hear what's happening and I want you to tell me what your suggestions are and if your suggestions are
*  To defund the police. Let's explore where that where that plays out
*  Let's see where that ends up because as we start peeling back the layers even the most even the most ardent anti-police person
*  You're gonna get to a point where you say, okay
*  When my house is when when one of your constituents house is being broken into
*  Who are they going to call? What what mechanism are we gonna put in place for security?
*  How are we gonna keep people safe from crime?
*  And then they've got to answer that question and and maybe they come up with a good answer
*  I don't know yet
*  But as a leader you have to listen to other people's ideas and we have to you you absolutely have to do that
*  there's a saying from
*  Patton leader on the front line is always right the leader on the front the leader on the front line is always right
*  So I've always tried to embrace that theory not just from a leadership perspective, but even from a human perspective
*  You know when you want to tell me something that I don't know about
*  I'm gonna listen to you. I'm actually gonna I'm actually really gonna listen to you. I'm gonna try and ask myself well
*  Let's see Joe lives in this city and Joe's here with this community and Joe is telling me right now
*  That we should have no police here
*  Well, could he be very emotional? Yes, he could does that mean I should not listen to anything he says no
*  It doesn't means I should monitor your your emotions and I should take that into account
*  But I should also be saying there's got to be some core to of truth to what he's saying now
*  Is it possible that Joe's just a bad actor and just evil? Yes, it is. How do I know that unless I listen to you?
*  Their answer is you don't you know what I'm hearing right now
*  Jaco and the Rock
*  I think yeah, yeah, well, I really hope it doesn't get to that point saying all makes fantastic sense
*  But the problem is everybody is so partisan. It's so difficult to get people to work together and people are so there's they've so much
*  Invested in keeping this party divided by these party lines
*  Keeping the country divided by the the right and the left. It's it's it's so nuts. It's completely nuts
*  Yeah, it's completely nuts. And when you hear the extremists on either side you you should say to yourself
*  You should say to yourself
*  They want us to fight
*  Right, it's like, you know here I'll drop dime on myself
*  I'm a big like when I was a kid in the SEAL teams
*  I was an instigator if I could if I could talk smack to two different people and let them
*  Start to get escalating like they wanted to fight
*  I would do that all day long especially once I started training people jujitsu, you know
*  I'd be the guy that was saying oh, he thinks he could take you now because he trained for two weeks
*  You haven't been here and what do you he said that? You know, I would do that all day long escalate
*  So we had to do that because it's fun to watch people fight to the death
*  It's fun, yeah, there's there's some level of fun to it. Yeah, but fighting to the death is there's a different kind of fun
*  yeah, but
*  when you
*  Recognize that when people on the extremes are telling you extreme things that what they want is to create a divide
*  That's what they want so that you just go you know what I just can't have that so I'm voting here or I just can't
*  Have this so I'm voting here. It's a it's a nightmare. It is a nightmare
*  It's a very difficult one to get out of you need real leadership to get out of it
*  Yeah, and that's just absent right now on both sides totally absent and there's no middle ground
*  No, no, there's no one that says well, you know, I I
*  You know, I like some of Trump's policies right someone says that it's like oh just destroy that person
*  Yeah, or you know, I agree with I agree with
*  Nancy Pelosi on this thing. You must be you know a communist, you know either way, but that's the way that's where we're at
*  Yeah, that's why that's why unfortunately well fortunately unfortunately, but
*  If if the rock was gonna run, I think he would own
*  I think you would have to run as an independent right to just say listen
*  I'm not down there's some things I agree with over there. There's some things I agree with over there
*  So, you know what I'm doing? I'm going in the middle, which is where most of America is
*  So if you want to vote extremist, you can go to this side other extreme you go to this side
*  Everyone else vote for me. When was the last time someone even won as a governor?
*  That was an independent was it Jesse Ventura?
*  Possibly Minnesota. Yeah, possibly might have been him. I
*  Mean you never even hear about it. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of people out there
*  Yeah, well, there's a whole like money thing that happens, right?
*  There's a whole money thing where if you're not a Republican or Democrat
*  You're not gonna get those big coffers full of money to put paid advertising out and get people in the streets to vote for you
*  Yeah, you don't have the machine behind you. You know the DNC behind you or the Republican Party
*  Yeah, it's um, it's a real weird situation. We find ourselves in with no clear path to sanity
*  There's no clear path path to sanity if we don't talk to each other
*  And right now we're not
*  Yeah, we're not
*  I've seen uh, you know, the people are so
*  Just angry
*  Just angry when you talk to him about this stuff
*  Just anger comes out. It's horrible. It's horrible to watch. Yeah
*  What disturbs me is I don't see I mean in the past when there's been disputes or things have been wrong
*  It seems like there's a clear path to
*  to sort of
*  Work things out. It doesn't seem like a clear path
*  It seems like every day it kind of gets a little worse like people get ramped up even more and then there's this event
*  That's looming on the horizon this November event this election event
*  And no matter what whether it's left or right whether Biden wins or Trump wins. There's gonna be madness and chaos
*  It seems hard for me to understand that Biden could it could maintain his health
*  You know through a presidency that seems very challenging to me. Yeah, I mean it seems like he's been
*  Going down, you know with his coherence level
*  You can kind of see it over even months, right? Yeah, he's on a really really rapid downward spiral
*  It seems stressful for anybody
*  Stressful for anybody
*  Except Trump for whatever fucking reason that guy eats it up
*  But for most people running for president alone just the grueling
*  just the schedule that's involved and traveling and doing all these speeches and
*  It just breaks him down. I mean one of the reasons why Hillary lost was she just wasn't willing to travel as much
*  There was all these different events that she was supposed to go to she just couldn't go
*  She couldn't take it anymore. She thought she was gonna win anyway, so she just stayed laid back. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is a brutal
*  Thing but it's really also just completely insane that the two candidates are these two people
*  Well, yeah, right first of all that the best the Democrats could do
*  I mean they had all these other people that were well spoken
*  Yeah, it seemed like young and healthy and there's you know, there's so many
*  That is hard to comprehend. Yeah, right. It's really hard to cover. Yeah that yeah
*  You're looking at these this group of whatever we have 350 million people 320 million people in America
*  And this is this is who you end up with. Yeah, I mean
*  Fucking anybody but by anybody. I mean, we don't even know who his vice president is right? That's gonna make a big deal
*  That's gonna be a big difference because the vice president is compelling and interesting
*  He says he's gonna pick a woman whether he picks
*  The problem if it was gonna pick Klobuchar Klobuchar was responsible for a lot of those guys
*  skating in Minneapolis
*  So well, that's not good and then if he's gonna go with Kamala Harris
*  Tulsi Gabbard kind of took the legs off of that lady
*  Yeah, so then who's left mayor Pete?
*  He seems like a guy was just you know, like he's got a playbook
*  He's kind of like following this Obama playbook and I just don't feel it from him at all
*  At least he's gay. We'd have a gay guy in office that had lightened people up a little bit. I
*  Believe that we had a powerful gay leader
*  I think it'd be great for the country like I think you know, like the
*  One of the things about Obama being office beside the fact it being office beside the fact
*  It's very articulate and educated and some well-spoken statesmen said it's like hey, look, we're making progress
*  We have a black president like I felt that I felt like a wave across the country people like you
*  you can be president in this country like even if you're
*  born out of a single family single mother family and you're
*  black guy
*  You can you as long as you got the goods you can make it like this is great
*  this means we really are living in a meritocracy and
*  It would be great if there was a gay guy that had the same experience like like all the people that are homophobes like
*  Yeah, but that fucking mayor Pete he's got me. Yeah
*  I'm not the Bible says but you know what fuck the Bible. I'm voting for that guy. He's better than Trump
*  I mean that would be great, but he's just I don't think he's the guy maybe he's the guy someday
*  He's also a young guy right? So who else who the fuck is there?
*  Especially since it's gonna be Biden and he said it's gonna be a woman. He's definitely not gonna go with Tulsi
*  She's too fucking dangerous. Yeah, the the Democrats are scared of her. She doesn't play games, which is so crazy
*  I know she's got everything everything they want woman of color
*  Congresswoman served overseas
*  To deployments. Yeah, she's got everything. She's super articulate super articulate
*  Level-headed super level-headed very intelligent. Yeah, but she's just not corrupt
*  this one problem
*  I mean other than that you look at it like Jesus Christ this lady she's willing to
*  Talk to people on the other side. She's you know, she's a stateswoman
*  She's a you know, the way she speaks she speaks like a leader
*  You know, they won't even consider her she's too dangerous well, so who else is there I'm going back to
*  DJ Dwayne the Rock Johnson. Yes, that's what I'm going back to him independent. Yeah as an independent. Yeah, and Dwayne and Jaco 2020
*  We need you
*  It's it's very very
*  It's very horrible and and when I see all this divide right
*  This is one thing that just
*  To it to have been in the military and to been on the battlefield and fought alongside guys of
*  Every background every background that you can imagine white black
*  Mexican whatever Puerto Rican
*  Asian there are everyone's out there
*  Everyone's out there. And by the way going to memorial services for these guys overseas
*  There's not one thought in your head there's not one thought in your head that's thinking oh
*  Underneath the flag on that coffin. Is that a black guy or is that a white guy?
*  Not one thought in your head is thinking that in any way shape or form. All you know is that that person
*  Took a bullet got blown up. That could be me. They took that for me and
*  To come back here and and now see this this this
*  Country being ripped apart
*  It's
*  That's the most horrible thing for me
*  This is something that gets discussed a lot by guys and teams and
*  By different guys in the military period that when you've served overseas with
*  with these guys that
*  racism becomes the the least
*  least considered thing it's you your brothers because you're literally the
*  Consequences of your actions the consequences of your day-to-day existence is so so dire life and death
*  It's the the most drastic consequences that we are aware of there's nothing you're losing your life
*  Or you're not or they save you or they don't your brothers. You're all together
*  but in this world the consequences are less grave and
*  The requirements of people are less extreme you're less extreme
*  The requirements of people are less extreme you're not as tested you're not your character is not as exposed
*  you are not as you're not as vulnerable in that sense and
*  Because of that I think people are more outraged and they're finding more reasons why we're separate more reasons to divide us more reasons
*  Why they're different from us whether it's because of ideology or skin color
*  You know Sam Harris has a podcast where he's discussing all the different things and he brings up one really great point the podcast
*  It's out now
*  He said could you imagine a world where we we think of color the same way we think of hair color?
*  Like the color of people's skins the same way could you imagine a world where I don't trust redheads
*  You know I don't do those people with dark brown hair fucking creepy to me
*  You know all the people in my neighborhood that are blonde
*  They're all shady like that seems so preposterous
*  Well one day the goal would be so great if one day
*  That's how we feel about all skin color. It's no different than hair color
*  It's just
*  Characteristics that you were born with you have no control over who you are is what's important. That's it
*  Yeah, and I think that's that's what that's the position that the military
*  Put you in it puts you in this position of look I got to rely on this guy I
*  Got to rely on this guy, and if they're reliable
*  I'm down. I'm good if they're not reliable
*  I got a problem, and it doesn't matter what color they are doesn't matter what there doesn't matter any of that
*  It's like is this person gonna be there is this a good person that's gonna be there to back me up
*  And that's all we care about and so for me
*  This is like super regressive to be going through this to watch the country go through this and think how did wait
*  Wasn't I just ten years ago like overseas with a bunch of guys and we didn't care about any of this didn't didn't didn't enter
*  Into our minds. We're not looking at it all the time, and I guess part of it is because
*  You got a beer you're in a fight you're in a struggle and and right now let's face it in America
*  They're not a lot of struggling happening, but we're kind of making our own struggle right now exactly
*  Yeah, and I think one of the things you've talked about that's very important
*  Is that a lot of this divide is?
*  Because of this really shitty way of communicating whether it's through social media or whether it's through reading stories or watching videos
*  It's a terrible way to not just get in for information
*  But it's a terrible way to interact with people
*  Like the way to interact with people is the way you and I are doing it right now
*  Just talking to people and I think the vast majority of problems would be solved
*  Amongst reasonable people if they just talked through they just talked to try to figure out you know you know hey, man
*  I didn't like that you did this well. What did I well all right? Well? I was thinking when I did this
*  Here's what you're right
*  Here's why I did it and this is what I was thinking and I was wrong because of that and if people could just say that
*  And people could accept that they would shake hands or hug it out
*  Rather than have a fucking Twitter beef that leads to a gunfight
*  I mean literally that's that the way we exchange information with each other back and forth through social media is the absolute
*  Worst way people can talk you're not looking at each other. You don't get any social cues
*  You don't feel any empathy towards that person that you're not in front of them. You're not there and
*  You're looking to see how many people agree or disagree who's liking or dissing because it's a public thing right so how many likes
*  Their thing got 400 likes mine only got 20 shit am I wrong here
*  It's it's just a terrible way for us
*  It's it's a newfound way for us to communicate and a terrible way for us to communicate
*  It's not we're not designed for it. This is not how we evolved
*  we evolved to communicate with social cues and
*  To look at each other and be around each other and you know you could say something to a person and
*  You you're both laughing or you see it written down the same way you like you guys a fucking asshole
*  Yeah, even from a leadership perspective, you know we'll talk about this a lot with hey
*  Oh, you know I sent you I'll send you an email. You know that says
*  Hey Joe, can you get this project done next week?
*  Thanks, and you're in a bad mood when you read that you know yeah, you're good
*  Who the hell do you think you're telling but if I was like hey Joe can you get this project done by next week?
*  We really need it
*  I'm looking at you and kind of give me a blank stare and I explained it to you a little bit more and all
*  Of a sudden it turns into a perfectly good conversation
*  Exactly when I send you that email or in this case a tweet right then you you hate me
*  Yeah, it's like we got management to do right now. You got a
*  When you want something out of someone or you want you want some things to get done
*  You got to manage that person's personality and mood and you got to manage the relationship that you have with each other
*  And you have to be proactive you have to you'd have to call. What's up, man?
*  How you doing everything good you good like they have to get a good feeling out of you
*  Yeah, and you gotta say listen. I gotta ask you this favor
*  I need this thing from you, and then and then you're rolling and everything's good exactly
*  You don't do it that way then people go fuck this guy
*  Oh this guy just wants things from me or this guy's annoying or you know this guy's treating me like a bitch
*  Exactly yeah the world through zoom right now, so
*  We're doing a lot of zooming so my company has long front the just the video alone
*  Increases your ability to communicate right massively it doesn't get all the way there, right?
*  But just being able to look at someone and have a conversation with them as opposed to either just a hearing them on the phone
*  Or absolutely so so that idea of hey, I'm actually gonna sit down and talk to you. I'm actually gonna sit down
*  Hey, well, I'll meet you the are like we pivoted obviously once
*  You know we used to go into or we still do but going into businesses and working with them
*  Shaking hands how you doing talking to them and then all of a sudden in three days. We were doing everything online
*  Everything hey to meet me on this zoom call, and you can get there you can get 97%
*  Effectiveness just by looking at someone and talking to them you know like I said there's a little percentage that you're still not gonna get
*  But if you think you're gonna communicate effectively through social media tweets
*  You're just freaking wrong. Yeah, that's one step below email, right?
*  Social media tweets is one step below email emails one step above that phone calls is one step above that zoom is a step above that
*  another layer
*  Person a person is the best person person's house. That's what we're designed for no everything else is just
*  It's and that's what's leading to all this fucking madness and chaos a lot of it is fueled
*  it's weaponized by by social media tweets and
*  Yeah, cuz by the way when you send me a tweet to be to be an asshole to me
*  I I actually just retweet that and tell everyone what an asshole you are a bunch of people retweet it as well
*  Good mayhem. Oh god. We're not we're not working together. You know it's an
*  We're not we don't we're not working together right that's another thing that kovat did right all of a sudden
*  We took everyone and isolate them. You're not you're not seeing them. You're not talking to them
*  So now everyone is almost strictly communicating by these methods that you're talking about
*  Yeah, this is horrible horrible for society horrible for society the
*  the
*  Idea of coming to work in a place right the idea of hey
*  I'm gonna show up and work at a place with other people that is
*  such a huge part of
*  Getting back to where we need to be
*  Like when you pull everyone out of work and you and there and and even worse, and I'm not even just beyond kovat
*  Well, you know what happens?
*  We've moved all manufacturing overseas, right?
*  So all those people that used to go and work in the same place every day that used to show up and have a common
*  mission and a common goal
*  They don't have that anymore
*  much of the
*  Middle class doesn't have that anymore. They used to have it. They don't have it anymore, and that's
*  interestingly
*  China's middle class is growing right now. Why is their middle class growing because they're manufacturing they're making things
*  They're filling that void of people that have that level of skill set of hey, you know what I just got out of high school
*  I can't afford college. So what am I gonna do right? Oh, well in China. Well, you can say, okay
*  Well, I guess I'm gonna work at a factory. Hey, it's a horrible sweatshirt. It's do whatever we need that
*  They need to improve their their conditions, but hey, these people have a job. They have a purpose
*  They're moving in a certain direction in America. We've kind of on a massive scale
*  Gotten rid of that
*  Class of people's purpose and that's a big focus for you, right with your company origin in particular
*  Yeah, which by the way, I got the boots. They're fucking dope. You guys make great shit. It's like really high quality
*  really beautifully manufactured stuff like and
*  There's something very valuable right now about American made it used to be there's it was very divisive
*  Like you've said American made like what are you xenophobic? You don't like foreigners? What the fuck is wrong with you?
*  But now you realize like oh with will the with kovat, you know
*  we were cut off from even getting goods and supplies from other countries and
*  Then we were getting so much of our medical supplies from China and then we're getting so much of our vaccines and medicine all these different things
*  Manufactured by China. You're like, hey, why don't we do that here?
*  Well, we used to but I was cheaper by like a dollar a thing to send it over there like oh Christ and people are realizing
*  There's a great benefit to making things here in America and it's not just this idea of national pride
*  National pride's great. But also like you don't you don't have to go anywhere to get things and you keep jobs here
*  Yeah
*  And I think Kanye West is looking to build same same thing as we're doing he wants to manufacture stuff in America
*  Why because he knows when you have a bunch of underprivileged kids
*  The best thing you can provide a bunch of underprivileged kids is
*  jobs jobs that they can entry-level jobs, you know when I was a kid
*  It was almost like hey, if you're not careful, you're gonna end up working in the factory, right?
*  That's what's gonna you know, you can end up working in a factory. No one wanted a factory job
*  The thing is so so that kind of became a mantra. Oh, you you don't want to work in a factory
*  You better go to college. Well, there's fact first of all factory work has changed
*  There's jobs that people do in a factory that takes a massive skill set and the boots, you know the origin boots
*  We were probably
*  Year two years three years from losing the knowledge of how to actually do that and luckily my buddy Pete has
*  started, you know
*  grabbing people that know how to do it and passing that information down to the next generation so we can actually be a
*  self-sufficient country and we can bring back those jobs of people that
*  Look, that's a that's a proud way to make a living
*  These are craftsmen like you said these are craftsmen and craftswomen by the way
*  Our factory is mostly filled with women and they're out there. They have a skill set. They're learning a skill set
*  There's what there's upward mobility as you get better at your job as you can do more things
*  You can make more money. And by the way, you're making something
*  You're making something with your hands. You're producing something here in this country. That's just like well
*  It's like when you go hunting when I go hunting you get something for yourself
*  There's a certain feeling of being self-sufficient and America on a large scale, especially during kovat
*  We look up and say wait a second. We can't even we can't even make that stuff
*  We don't even know how to make that that's a nightmare
*  Well the boots in particular think think about if you started from scratch like if I started from scratch
*  I don't know shit about how to make a boot
*  If I had a it would take there's a long learning curve of figuring out how to make an excellent boot that fits
*  Right as well made and durable like those boots that you guys sell like I was going over I was looking at this thing
*  I'm like they fucking put some time and effort into this thing. This is a really well-crafted
*  Piece of art. Yeah, it's it's it's functional artwork and
*  That knowledge because that's not that's not that's not our generation that learned that right?
*  We're we're pulling that information from the old shoe dogs up in Maine that are
*  60 years old 70 years almost you know out of the workforce having to bring them back into the workforce to to educate
*  The younger generation on how to actually do this. We got a kid up there. The name is Cameron
*  I was 22 20s a young kid and he has learned now how to weave the material for our geese
*  So he's the guy that knows how to weave material
*  This is the bro. This is so complicated
*  Where do you see all these different pieces of string coming together get this big machine with so he's got like a loom
*  Yeah, he's got we've got looms up there, but we had to get the knowledge right from the old timers that said, okay
*  Let me show you how to do this and like you just said
*  How long would it take to figure out a loom on your own?
*  First of all, I think I would fail because I don't think I'd have the patience if I just had this machine to look at
*  So capturing this knowledge so that we can become a self-sufficient country again
*  It's got to be paramount in what we're doing and it's not just
*  It's not just hey because I'm pro-america
*  Yes, I am
*  But if we want to get rid of the kind of social unrest that we have right now
*  Hey in Ramadi, you got a 15 year old kid that's putting a roadside bomb in the road
*  You know why he's doing that is he doing it for some big ideology? No, he's not
*  He's doing it because he's gonna get paid $50 by the insurgents. He wants a job. He wants a life
*  He wants to make money
*  What happens in America? What happens with kids in the inner city that are underprivileged when they don't have a job?
*  What are they gonna do? What are they gonna do? They're gonna fall into oh, maybe I'll sell drugs
*  Maybe I'll commit robberies whatever I'm gonna do but they're not doing it by choice in many cases or if they're doing it by choice
*  It's because they don't see any other choices to even make so we've let our manufacturing go away and now we've got
*  Voids we've got voids where people don't have an ability to make an income and that's
*  That's that's that's just a complete loss of pride, right?
*  If you don't have the ability to earn money to take care of yourself to take care of your family
*  If you don't have that ability, what are you gonna do? You're gonna figure out how to make it happen
*  It's so short-sighted too. I mean it was all done for just a small amount of profit per item
*  Small amount of profit per item and it cost the country so much. Yep, and and and then the
*  Then the narrative became we're not able to do it. That's why we don't do it
*  We're not able to do it that became the narrative. Well, you know, even the big corporations would say well, you know
*  We'd love to we'd love to make stuff here, but it's impossible. It's impossible
*  Completely and totally ridiculous
*  Also like when you go through Detroit and you realize that Detroit at one point in time in the early 20th century was
*  One of the richest countries in the world or excuse me one of the richest cities in the world you you you go through it
*  You realize over this is where they were making all the fucking badass cars
*  All the amazing American cars of the 60s and the 70s. They were all made right there and then they fucked up
*  someone made some decisions to save a little bit of money and make a little bit of money and
*  Completely short-sighted didn't look at the economy as a whole didn't look at the nation from a position of a patriot
*  Someone who looks at the country in a whole what's best for the country then just said what is the best way that we can
*  Maximize our profit. Well, we need to set up factories in Mexico and China and all these other places
*  We can get people to work for nothing. You can't buy a fucking cell phone
*  It's made in America all the people that design and engineer cell phones for Apple. They're right here
*  They're not making them here
*  There's not a fucking single cell phone that's made in America try buying one that's made with all American parts all American labor in America
*  We what no such thing doesn't exist and what you're gonna be told is it can't be done. That's all cannot be done
*  That's what's cool about Elon Musk. Yes. Oh watch this. Yeah, I'll make cars here. I'll make them awesome
*  I'll make rocket ships
*  I'll say guys fucking tunnels under the earth. Yeah, we need a couple more of those dudes. Yeah, it's uh
*  it's
*  It's good that people are opening their eyes though
*  It's good that people are realizing because of the pandemic and because of the fact that all goods and services that we're being imported on a daily
*  Basis were shut down and also people terrified of getting things over there
*  What are you gonna spray everything down? Everything's infected and what do you what I'm scared? What do I do?
*  But the medicine is the craziest one the fact that we rely on China for some ungodly percentage of all of our medicine like
*  Holy shit guys, like is this the right way to do this just for profit?
*  Yeah, it seems like we got a little bit lucky with COVID. Yes, like right a little bit lucky because it turned out to be not
*  Not bad. Did you ever get the antibody test? No fuck should have tested you today
*  Sorry, cuz you think you might have had it, right? I'm
*  so
*  The end of January right right as this thing was kicking off. I did a live tour. I did Austin
*  Then I did Washington DC
*  Then I did New York City
*  Seattle San Francisco and LA every event shook hands and bro hugged
*  between a thousand and two thousand people
*  That's what I did at the end of January. I went to the the absolute like
*  Ground zero locations for kovat and just just bro hugged and talked to a bunch of people and shook hands and you know
*  Just got after it and then I got sick
*  Yeah, like a week later something two weeks later. I guess it was
*  February I was sick and I was like, hmm gee, I wonder what that is and then and then March came around and we started
*  The the sick like you know often it wasn't real bad
*  It wasn't real bad, but it was it was you know, it was bad enough that I you know
*  I I think I might have skipped like I'm just gonna stretch today cuz I really feel like crap for a workout type of thing
*  So I didn't get I wasn't down hard. I wasn't in and I didn't miss any I didn't miss anything
*  But I felt bad and so I figured that was my that was my kovat experience
*  My wife got sick my son got sick two daughters in college and my young daughter didn't get sick at all
*  My ten-year-old daughter didn't get sick at all. So sounds like it. Yeah, but did you have it or not?
*  No, I didn't I'm making a fucking text right now. I'm gonna get a doctor in here in an hour and a half
*  We're done
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna make this happen because I want to find out
*  You would be the only guy that's tested positive if you did know we had
*  Tim's buddy was his name Ben
*  He didn't false positive then we tested him again. Yeah, I think it would be I think it would be crazy if
*  That travel schedule that I had
*  Sitting on all those airplanes from and to and from all those different airports in all those airports that's just that's just crazy
*  Yeah, all right. I'm asking right now
*  That was another you know, we're talking about egos
*  The the the scary thing about the whole kovat
*  Unraveling was that
*  The
*  Leadership wouldn't say hey, you know what?
*  I actually think I was wrong about this and we're moving in this direction now, right?
*  Not just leadership but everyone right everyone just hey, no, you know what? I think I was wrong here
*  Maybe we need to adjust this
*  Here's it so you didn't get to see that
*  That's a great point cuz that that really was a failure of leadership because it was very clear
*  It's an important time when they found out when they did the large-scale antibodies test
*  Particularly in California and they go like Jesus Christ
*  Hundreds of thousands of people have been exposed to this
*  This is not what we thought like and the amount of people that are actually sick instant result back
*  Covet inbound you dead the amount of people that
*  That actually tested positive for the antibodies was way higher than they thought it was
*  Yeah, and the amount of people that were actually hospitals was way lower
*  And then they looked at the average death that people died
*  It's actually older than the average death that people die. Yeah. Yeah, my son pointed that out to me
*  Yeah, we shut down the fucking economy for that. Yeah, I
*  Guess I was was a little bit whatever. I
*  Was pretty real. I was pretty cavalier through the whole thing our buddy. Dr. Pete. Yeah, he was
*  Well, he was way nervous cuz he was in early right and when you saw the early stuff
*  Yeah, when you're like, hey, it's one out of every ten people are dying, right?
*  But even he was making adjustments. He said wait a second in Italy. There's different cities
*  That was I think where he started changing his his attitude. He said wait a second in Italy
*  There's different cities and in some cities they're really compressed together and people are old people living with young people in the same place
*  And oh, wait a second. We need to separate this out and
*  Then it just hey, it wasn't as bad. Thank God. Yeah, thank God. It wasn't as bad and
*  My buddy Andrew Schultz had a great point. He said basically kovat exposed
*  Weaknesses in both business and in people's health that's what it really did
*  Yeah
*  The the lockdown did because there was businesses that literally couldn't survive a week without money coming in
*  Well, that's a that's a badly managed business or a business that has a very small and narrow profit margin
*  And then there's people that literally can't survive any sort of disruption in their immune system
*  Their immune system is shattered one of the things that came out of it that I found out from dr
*  Patrick was that 70% of America is deficient vitamin D 70%
*  29% is severely deficient to the point where like they're like they have medical issues because of a deficiency in vitamin D
*  Yeah, you've got to get on that you got to get on the vitamin D for sure get on the vitamin D
*  And the best way to get it is to get out in the Sun
*  Yeah, and that's the one thing you weren't supposed to do the whole thing is fucking madness. It was a perfect storm
*  Yeah, it's like when the plague in the what the black plague they thought it was
*  They thought it was cats. They thought cats delivered the plague to everyone. So they killed all the cats, but it wasn't the cats
*  It was the rats and the mice and so when you killed the cats guess what happened to the rats and the mice they
*  Insane so it was almost the same kind of thing you see unfolding. Yeah, and no one's saying hey, you know what actually we're wrong here
*  Hey, you know what and what about the masks? So this was crazy
*  Well, I got some buddies that texted me they said hey, there's this thing coming you origin you guys should start making masks
*  Just to just to cover your face and I said, oh, okay. I don't know anything about this stuff
*  I talked to my buddy Pete. I said hey, it sounds like that we're gonna need to make masks and he says, okay
*  So we we start thinking about hey, how would we make these things?
*  And then a couple days later the government the government comes out and says masks don't do anything. Don't worry
*  Don't don't wear a mask. Don't get masks. So I talked to Peter said hey, man
*  It looks like this isn't a good it looks like we don't need to do it because it looks like doesn't help at all
*  Five days later
*  They're like everyone wear a mask at all times
*  And by the way, we're gonna pass laws that require you to wear a mask
*  I'd call Peter I'm like it looks like we need to make masks, you know, and we ended up making
*  hundred a couple hundred thousand masks and
*  We were we were sending them to this is the weird thing
*  we're sending them to hospitals like we donated thousands of masks to hospitals and
*  And and then you know two weeks later it was like no actually they don't do anything
*  I still don't know
*  well, it's hard to the problem is people get shamed and
*  The the World Health Organization came out and basically said the only reason you should be wearing a mat
*  Where's the CDC now the world here to Fauci said US government held off promoting face masks because it knew shortages were so bad that
*  Even doctors couldn't get enough. So is he just saying that now this morning or today?
*  So guess what you all every we all got lied to
*  Held off on promoting face masks because it knew shortages were so bad
*  But then doctors couldn't get enough recently the CDC said the only people that should be wearing
*  Masks are people that are treating kovat patients and that regular people shouldn't be wearing masks
*  And then the World Health Organization said that asymptomatic people it's extremely rare that they transmit to other people
*  So we were worried about asymptomatic people which is the reason why we kept kids at school and we were worried about overwhelming the hospitals
*  We did all this other stuff as well
*  Crazy about my kids school. I was like hey you fucks. This doesn't even kill the kids
*  It's killing the kids get killed by the flu
*  Meanwhile, you don't even scan the teachers or the staff or anybody people have the flu
*  They don't want to miss a day of work. They just fucking show up and give it to everybody
*  That's normal and kids actually die from the flu and it's not a small number
*  It's not a small number of people that die from the flu last year was sixty two thousand
*  It's not as many as kovat, but then you're hearing you're hearing two camps you're hearing one that the kovat deaths are actually under
*  Reported because a lot of people die from kovat and they don't even register it
*  Okay, boy, I guess it's worse than it is and then you're hearing no no actually we're getting
*  Incentivized to report deaths as kovat Elon Musk on the podcast said if you get killed by a shark
*  But you were kovat positive they would list it as a kovat death obviously he was being facetious
*  But not entirely
*  Because there's a lot of people with leukemia that also had kovat listed as a kovat death obesity heart attacks
*  Listed as a kovat death because they tested positive for kovat
*  Cancer also had kovat kovat death. I mean fuck
*  That's really disturbing
*  You know when you hear those statistics then you see these things that they're saying and just the lack of trust that you end
*  With the government when the government has already people just generally don't really trust the government a lot right right
*  There's no one that's always thinking the government has always given them the straight skinny
*  And it goes back to this click-baity bullshit my wife pointed out this story yesterday
*  Where she's reading about this kid that died 17 year old kid perfectly healthy it says she reads into the article type 1 diabetes
*  Type 1 diabetes is not perfectly healthy no that's really sick and fucking dangerous
*  You have to take insulin to stay alive
*  Yeah, and think you can get complications from like oh everyone's living type 1 diabetes
*  Diabetics can live real normally and then they can have an instance that causes them to die yeah
*  They can have their foot removed
*  Yeah, there's all sorts of shit that goes wrong when you have diabetes your immune system is severely compromised
*  But it's like we're our information
*  It's not pure we're getting all this muddy thing and Fauci telling us the only reason why they told us not to wear a mask
*  Is because they knew you didn't have enough like holy shit
*  How many people died because of that you fuck and then the World Health Organization says actually no one died because of that
*  You don't have to worry about it. You really don't need to wear a mask
*  Fucking what is happening?
*  The I think so much of this ego plays so much into this of people not want to admit. They're wrong
*  Here's another thing that people won't say I don't know right I don't know
*  Like as a leader I've been in situations where I did not know for this to somebody tell leaders all the time
*  I say listen tell your people the truth about what's happening by the way
*  We're seeing examples where this is factually not happening inside America right now if you're a leader tell the people the truth about what's going
*  On that's what you need to do and then people come back to me, and they say well what if?
*  What if I don't know what what if I don't know the truth then what you do is you say hey?
*  I don't know the truth hey guys. I don't know. I don't know exactly how this is gonna play out
*  These are some contingencies that I'm preparing for that is so much more acceptable
*  From the troops then when you try and pretend like you know what you're talking about it turns out you're wrong, right?
*  I mean Trump does this so much that people lose track of it right where he thinks something and he just goes out on a limb
*  He just walks right out on a limb and says hey this kovat stuff will be gone in a week
*  Yeah, and and you know he just saws off the limb behind his foot. He does that all the time
*  It's it's a good example of how not to lead because then people start to trust you less and less and then when things like this
*  Happen where you find out that they actually did
*  Purposely now think if they would have said this like oh, we're worried about we don't have enough masks
*  Then you know what you come out and say you come on you say listen everyone
*  We're not a hundred percent sure what the masks do for people, but we do know this inside of a medical environment
*  We have to prioritize getting those people that are absolutely exposed these masks. That is why we are gonna put up
*  Some kind of a control over who's allowed to buy them you just tell the truth
*  Well that was kind of happening at some places like Amazon was only doing that they won't only sell knows
*  What is it n95 and then you guys yeah?
*  They were selling them only to hospital workers and there you go they were allocating them along with other types of hand sanitizer
*  and
*  Bunch of different things they were selling
*  Specifically to them first and first responders perfect example. Yeah, what you don't do is say hey everyone don't worry about it
*  He's saying that like well hey fucko now we can't trust you ever again exactly yeah
*  That's that's the freaking problem. You're looking at this guy next time. There's some kind of disease next time
*  There's a problem. How do we know if we can listen to you?
*  I'm also thinking he was saying a couple of weeks ago the United States doesn't open up soon
*  We could we could face permanent damage
*  Economic damage yeah permanent economic you think yeah, I'm like hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. How come you didn't say this before?
*  How come you didn't say hey? We have to weigh in the pros and the cons here
*  Yeah, you know you you should have and this is actually something when I talked to Peter T about it
*  I said hey it seems like maybe some people should be quarantined and other people shouldn't and he's like yeah
*  Absolutely so like my dad who's an older guy who's you know he's an older guy
*  Compromised immune system guess what he should be isolated. Yeah, you should be quarantined. Yeah should my
*  17 year old son should my 20 year old daughter my 20 will
*  2018 year old my 10 year old should they be in isolation should they be quarantined?
*  Absolutely not absolutely not hey first week two weeks where we're here
*  And it's a 10% Bob you know we're hearing all these things cool
*  You can make it you can make an in extremis call you can say hey guys
*  I don't know what's happening, but in Italy it looks real bad guess what we're gonna. Do we're gonna shut down for two weeks
*  I'm sorry, but this is what we're gonna do and you go at the nation says
*  Okay, okay, we get it and then two weeks later. You say you know what it looks like it's really
*  Might impact our medical systems. We're gonna shut down for another two weeks just another two weeks never goes
*  You know I gotta pay my mortgage, but okay two more weeks and
*  Then you say then you got it then you got to have the courage and the ability to put your ego in check and say
*  You know what thank you. Maybe may not have been necessary
*  We don't know right now, but it looks like we can start opening back up
*  Let's rock and roll the other problem is once they tell you what to do
*  They don't want to stop having that power and control
*  Yeah, they love governor literally said wear masks because then we can get back some of our freedoms
*  Yeah, you're gonna give away freedom
*  Maybe I should run for governor. Yeah, I didn't know I could control freedoms you got my vote
*  Give away freedoms
*  the
*  Businesses surviving right you're talking about the businesses surviving
*  There's a lot of businesses that especially little businesses right little jiu-jitsu schools little restaurants
*  You want a restaurant to operate on 50% capacity that you?
*  Restaurants aren't making this kind of money where they can throw away 50% of their profits
*  50% of their capability to make money they still because they still got to have that cook
*  Yeah, that cook is there the dishwasher is there right there's your bare minimum
*  Yeah, and they got to be there no matter what if you serve 50 people great if you only serve 25
*  You don't make any money. Yeah, so there's all there's gonna be there's a lot of businesses that run that day-to-day
*  You know month to month paycheck to paycheck to try and stay afloat
*  That's the that's what America does and sometimes they're able to creep out of that and they get ahead and that's awesome
*  That's how you end up with these big powerful companies
*  Yeah, I've had a couple of restaurant owners in Adam Perry Lang who owns APL steakhouse and Janet Zuccarino and Evan funky who?
*  They own feel it well he she owns Felix Janet owns Felix
*  and he's the head chef and they were explained to me profit margins and
*  It's fucking crazy. It's it's you really look at how
*  difficult it is to run a restaurant and
*  All the decisions that have to be made and you know food goes bad if you keep it too long
*  And you got to buy a certain amount of food you anticipate a certain amount of customers
*  You got to know your custody was explaining gotta you we know our customers
*  So I know most of them are not gonna order this
*  So I'm gonna have certain amount of meals that I'm gonna have of the fish and more meals of the steak and the pasta is
*  Primary that's what most people are coming here for and like fuck and then you tell them
*  Oh, you can only open up at 60% and waitresses have to wear a fucking hazmat suit and it's like
*  Goddamn, man, what are they 10% 15% 5% profit margin? I think they were saying
*  14% is how they operate
*  But it's difficult. It's very difficult
*  And you know people don't want to spend too much money on meals
*  You know and so they it has to be kind of engineer like how can you how can you do it?
*  Right and Janet has had a ton of successful restaurants like she's a wizard at it
*  I mean she's been doing it straight out of college and her problem was she was in the process of building
*  Multiple restaurants so all of her money were out even though she's extremely profitable and very very successful at all these restaurants
*  She's building out all these other restaurants at the same time with that money because she knows how to make money
*  She knows how to run these businesses, so she's doing so she's got a Jamaican restaurant. She's got an Italian restaurant
*  She's got all these things happening and then boom the government tells you you have to shut down
*  That's yeah, that's the the profit margin
*  There's so many bits, you know, cuz we work with all kinds of different businesses. Yeah, and the profit margin on
*  Many many businesses is
*  Really really lean one of my favorite examples is big construction companies big construction companies that are doing
*  You know five hundred million dollar projects or you know seven hundred million dollar bridges and coliseums and stuff
*  their profit margin
*  Is like four percent. Holy shit percent. Holy five percent if they do awesome
*  Like six percent
*  And they're you know ordering concrete and they've got to have it showed up a certain time and then the rebar wasn't in place
*  like it's crazy there the margin for error is so small and
*  There's so many businesses that operate like that and a lot of times I think some of the people in government
*  They've never been in business before and so they don't understand that for them
*  Hey, just operate at 50% capacity inside your restaurant. You'll be fine. That's a very good point and they've never run a business
*  You know, I have a jujitsu gym. We got shut down. So now now we're now they're telling us
*  Hey, you can allow people back in the gym. They just have to be six feet apart
*  We can't do jujitsu six feet apart. You can't do Muay Thai six feet apart
*  So what are we supposed to do now? And by the way?
*  What about oh you want us to check people and we want to have this there's all these protocols that are putting in place to
*  Have someone come into the gym. So now we got a higher extra people
*  We got a higher extra cleaning staff because the gym has to shut down for this period of a day and they need to
*  Re-clean everything like obviously the people that are making these rules have never been in it never been in business before
*  Yeah telling a person who is running a jujitsu gym the people have to be six feet apart
*  The whole jujitsu is zero apart zero feet apart zero zero space that's the whole goal of jujitsu
*  Smash
*  The whole goal take your body and smash someone's body with it the whole idea is no space
*  Yeah, that literally is the foundation of jujitsu
*  Pressure applied with no space. Mm-hmm, and this goes back to the idea of as a leader
*  Taking the information from the frontline troops and saying how you tell me what's a good way to run this you tell me
*  You tell me what's a good way to run this and let's see if we can figure out a solution this problem
*  I would really want to talk to jujitsu gym owners and my suggest I've never run a jujitsu gym
*  I've been in a shitload of them. My suggestion would be have people fill out a waiver
*  So they waive their rights have people fill out a form that says I have not tested positive
*  I've showed no symptoms of illness. I
*  Promise that if I do I will not train and I will get myself tested testing is readily available now
*  You know for a long time we were getting shamed because we were testing people
*  Yeah, I was tracking on angry that we were testing people like look you can test people too
*  You fuck just like you could buy a steak. It just costs money
*  You know, are you mad that people have steak and you can't afford a steak?
*  Well, you know, there's people that there are different stages of life, you know in this game called society and
*  Capitalism and an event you start off at square a you know, everybody starts at a different spot granted
*  But I started at bottom and you figure out a way to get a fucking test
*  And if you're in a spot right now in your life, we can't have a test
*  We'll definitely don't go and expose yourself till we know what the fuck it is
*  But don't get mad if people can afford tests you crazy fucks. Yeah, and
*  What we're at right now what you just do Jim's is you should have a form that you fill out
*  Just like when I was at a restaurant
*  I went to the lonesome dove restaurant shout out to them in Austin, Texas
*  Fantastic place they make you fill out a little form
*  Says you haven't tested positive, you know, you know, you're not sick. You're not showing any symptoms, you know
*  They do a little temperature check check your forehead. Are you looking good?
*  All right, come on in sit down. Did they pack you in or to keep you know
*  I think you're a little bit separated, but that was two weeks ago
*  And there's another place Gus's fried chicken shout out to Gus's best fucking fried chicken on earth in Austin, Texas
*  We went there two weeks ago and you couldn't eat there
*  You had to wear a mask in the restaurant and you had to order takeout
*  So we got takeout then we came back again yesterday yesterday
*  No fucking mask everybody's in there sitting all the seats are packed. They strongly suggest you wear a mask
*  And no one's no one wore a fucking mask the waiters all wore masks
*  But it's like things are getting different. There's another restaurant red ash that we we ate at Saturday night that place
*  had
*  75% capacity and you had to wear a mask until you got to your table and then you had to wear a mask again if you
*  Had to go take a leak you gotta put your mask back on take a leak come back and it doesn't make any sense
*  It's like they're just this health department guidelines and people they're trying to open up and they don't want to get sued
*  They don't want to get people mad and like we're trying to protect everybody
*  But we don't know how to do it and it doesn't matter what the science of you
*  You could show them an article that shows that masks are bullshit and they're still gonna tell you but you still gonna wear your
*  Mask because we're playing a little game here
*  We're playing a game called keep people safe
*  Nobody's saying a goddamn thing about take your vitamins drink water
*  Healthy work out get out in the Sun
*  No, no the government never says that you don't hear it. Gov. Ernie someone is fucking goofy slick back hair
*  He's not telling you to go work out and get in the Sun
*  It's gonna be a I think America can only take so much and I kind of said this from the beginning
*  Like you can keep American locked down for a little while two weeks
*  For weeks and then people start saying you know what I gotta go out I gotta go make something happen
*  I gotta do something. I gotta earn money and it's a people that are looking around saying
*  Well, I don't really need to earn any money right now
*  They're the ones that are saying everyone stay in your house and don't come out and wear a mask
*  Alright, we got a doctor coming at 330. No, I think I got you a positive this time. He's wanting to get a positive
*  Oh, yeah, he's got a goddamn healthy people in here. Yeah, I've had
*  Now I've had I think I had seven no eight tests
*  One two three four no swabs
*  I've had four. Yeah, four no swabs and four antibody tests. I haven't me personally
*  I've still come out negative every time but the other thing that he said and those doctors are very smart guy and a young healthy
*  Guy he said that doesn't mean you haven't been exposed to it means your immune system did his job
*  Really? This is another thing that people are saying people saying oh, well, you just got lucky
*  You haven't been around someone who had it it was no no
*  Many of the people that I tested are positive or in a family where the other people that are also in that family are
*  Negative, so they have it they've been around these people for fucking weeks and they don't get it
*  Why because they have a better immune system particularly children? So I guess I'm gonna win win situation
*  Yeah, because if I had it if I tested positive like see no factor
*  I powered through it you beat it now even if I didn't have it. I'm gonna say hey see you I beat it
*  Yeah, I'm gonna win win. Yeah
*  I know
*  Depending upon what your results are
*  I know nine people that have had it now and out of those people only one of them had it bad and that was my
*  Friend Michael yo, and he got it bad from if it's real easy to track. He flew all the way to New York
*  No sleep. What was the dates? He was in January January Jamie no
*  early February or late January
*  March
*  Show in New York was March the very beginning
*  End of February end of February he was here and then he went okay, so he left here
*  That weekend went to New York no sleep right flies to New York does radio does TV all set does his comedy gigs
*  No sleep does gigs the next day same deal does promo all this shit flies back home
*  No sleep gets up in the morning drives to Vegas with his wife and kids the fucking kids screaming in the car
*  Drives back home that night
*  Hangs out with his wife's family in Vegas and drives back home that and so eight hours in the car just that day
*  Then the next day he's got auditions day after that. He's got auditions then boom hits the wall and he's fucked
*  He feels like shit. He felt like shit by the way his mom got it. She also tested positive beat it in a day
*  Hmm. How long was he down for he was down for a week?
*  But he ran himself to also vitamin D deficient
*  And so all those things ran himself down vitamin D deficient doesn't take care of himself
*  So but but he caught the perfect storm of exhaustion and travel travel fucks you up it fucks you up
*  Yeah, and I
*  Leading into this I was traveling all the time my whole life matter of fact the lockdown is the most consecutive nights
*  I've ever spent with my wife since we've been married and we've been married for 20 years
*  Most consecutive nights because you know I was in the Navy I was deploying I was going on trips
*  And then when I retired was working with consulting all over the place
*  Yeah, so it's been kind of cool hanging out with my wife night after night
*  All right, these are FDA approved kits, too, so we're good. So we're totally good
*  We're gonna find out for real fully legit doctors pumped. What do you think you think I think I've had it or not?
*  What do you think yeah?
*  I would say because your kid your youngest kid didn't get it get sick
*  And then the other people did get sick, but no one got it badly, and I know your family's very healthy
*  I know your your daughter's a savage your son's a savage I
*  Would imagine you probably had it thinking about all the places you've been I bet you I bet you test positive for the antibodies
*  I know a few jujitsu guys have got it. I've got they all just got coughs. Yeah
*  Oh, yeah, I'm plus plus on top of all this. I'm in my gym. You know I was in my gym
*  Oh, yeah
*  You know I got all kinds of we we have a lot of people that show up at my gym because they just want to train
*  They want to come check it out. Yeah, and my gym is big. You know we've got
*  2,000 members right yeah, it's 2,000 members it's not
*  Just a
*  Victory MMA and fitness in San Diego, California, but you know so it's a big gym
*  Yeah, and you know every two thousand members that means they're all interacting with you know three or four other people
*  Outside of the gym if not five or ten people so and they're literally sweating each other's mouth complete. Oh, yeah
*  That's another thing that's another indicator when I got sick my main training partner this guy Andy Andy Burke
*  I train with all the time he got sick, and then his girlfriend got sick. Who's also a jujitsu fighter
*  MMA fighter she got sick, too, so
*  We'll see I'm curious it's hard when you train hard you get sick
*  It's part part of the the thing too when you break down your body and your immune system gets
*  You know when you're one of those guys that trains really hard you do have a tendency to get a little cold
*  Your immune system gets tested here's something I've noticed when I have downtime like let's say this has happened to me a few times
*  I'm going to Montana and
*  I'm super stoked. I'm gonna go up there and chill right
*  Soon as I get up there I get sick really it's happened to me like maybe three times where I I finally have
*  Four days or five days where I you know don't have anything scheduled to go up there. I'm gonna shoot my bow
*  I'm gonna chill and I get up there, and it's like my mind switches and all of a sudden I get sick
*  It's like I saved up
*  Illness to where I know I can be allowed to get sick does that ever happen to you
*  No, but there's a good argument there for like just the way your mind controls your whole system
*  Yeah, because your mind is just like pedal to the fucking metal slayer in the back
*  Yeah
*  Everything is go go go and then when it's silence you're probably like what have we been up to I
*  Feel like that happens. I don't I was wondering if it ever happened to you because it's it's it's happened enough times that I'm talking about
*  Right my best example is cam Haynes that motherfuckers never sick, and if he's sick. He still runs anyway
*  He's just got a little bit of a cough, but at all the people that I know I don't want anybody who who's
*  Consistently putting in the kind of hours every day that he does oh yeah, he runs 16 miles every fucking day
*  Yeah, sometimes a marathon sometimes a marathon every day while he works eight hours a day
*  And then he gets home and lifts weights. I mean it's not like you run and he gets his reps in yeah
*  He gets his reps in with his bow every day, and he's lifting and he's lifting every day every day
*  He doesn't take days off that fucking guys never sick if he's sick. It's like the next day. He's running again
*  You look at his Instagram. It's hey. It's a great day to run out there fucking I
*  Did I think there's something to forcing your body to consistently and constantly perform totally yeah imagine not?
*  Like Olympics right you're in the Olympics for wrestling
*  Let's say and you've got your whole entire life is on one day
*  Mmm, if you get sick like right anything bad happens that day. Yeah, you're done
*  Those big moments like that are fuck when you're so stressed out to say your immune system is super jacked
*  But I think there's a there's a thing about peaking for a big event whether it's a fight or the Olympics or something versus
*  Maintaining consistent conditioning they're very different things like a good example is Tim Kennedy
*  Tim Kennedy went through I believe two camps in a row camp fight got canceled
*  Kept training went through another full camp and then when he fought Kelvin Gastelum
*  Yeah, that guy's never retired and he was gassing out in the fight and there's a real good indication from all involved
*  That is because of over training. I know that when I would train fighters
*  You could absolutely see when they would over train. It wasn't a big question. You'd go in you'd have a fighter
*  That's whatever level at let's say let's say jujitsu because I'm training jujitsu with them and every day
*  You know there they feel a certain level and then one day you come in and you train with them and they're just a they
*  Just suck and I would tell them. It's like hey man two days off go eat some steak because you would know
*  100% that they're over trained. Yeah 100% we tell vegans
*  Yeah, we tell them definitely some steak
*  You need that steak
*  Get some get some steak in you. Yeah, just give him an elk
*  Just give him just a one good piece of backstrap just just try just trust me
*  Run through a fucking wall
*  Yeah, it's that really weird thing about watching people go through camps through fight camps, and you know
*  I really I basically don't train fighters anymore like I used to just because I don't have time anymore
*  But you would you would work so hard to make sure that on that night
*  That they're there yeah, they're there and some people get in the cage and they do better
*  Then they would normally do some people get in the cage and they don't do as good and you got you know
*  Jeremy Stevens a great example because
*  Especially when he first came out started training with me
*  he's not he's not with us anymore, but when he first started training was like he was a
*  white belt in jujitsu, but man when he got in the cage he would just elevate man like mentally
*  Psychologically elevate and he would perform way better in the cage
*  And then I've had other fighters that you'd get it like they would be
*  kicking people's asses in training and then they get in the cage and it's a down step and it's
*  so hard to see that so hard is because sometimes those guys are very committed and they're working hard and
*  They're doing great, and they just get in there. It's just it's a psychological thing
*  Yeah, some people are dwarfed by the moment. It's very interesting to say it's a
*  Some people are also afraid of the embarrassment of losing that's a big one and they can't trust the process
*  They can't just they can't just remove themselves and just go out there and fight mm-hmm
*  He do you follow Muay Thai at all a little bit, but not to any great extent
*  There's a guy who George St. Pierre brought into his training camp when he was doing the ultimate fighter
*  John Jean Paul Skarbowski, and he's this French savage Muay Thai fighter who?
*  Would basically get drunk every night showed up at training at
*  GSP's camp drunk like he was out all night. He was in Vegas right so the ultimate fighters in Vegas
*  Drinks all night shows up in the day the next day and fucks everybody up
*  And they're like this is so embarrassing like guys were like devastated like this guy literally came in holding
*  He's got a cup like from like one of those to-go cups from one of the Vegas clubs
*  He showed up in the morning see if you can find it because it's kind of hilarious looks like a guy who should be driving
*  An uber okay. He's not built like a savage. He's just his mind is
*  Just he's got the I don't give a fuck and he's got it down
*  Yeah, and was a you know world champion Muay Thai fighter beat champions at Lumpini Stadium in Thailand and just amazing fighter well
*  You know you always hear about the comparisons of a black belt in jiu-jitsu versus a white belt right something
*  And it's real real obvious, but when you get at a high level of Muay Thai
*  It's very similar
*  Maybe not quite as similar because there's always this idea that well
*  You know I at least know if I throw a pie at least know as a human how to throw a punch
*  At least there's some idea right there's some like a normal human has no idea of how to do an arm lock zero
*  You at least know have some concept of how to throw a punch so there is like a punchers chance
*  But I remember the first time I sparred with the real Muay Thai guy
*  I was I felt like a white belt
*  I was like oh, okay
*  Because I would think about throwing a kick and I would get you know kicked myself
*  I would think about it and get kicked oh
*  He knows exactly what I'm gonna do just like a white belt in jiu-jitsu
*  You know you can predict everything that they're gonna do
*  Look no six-pack I
*  Mean literally looks like a guy if you saw that guy show up like this dad-bot motherfucker
*  Just he showed up straight from the club
*  I mean you can kind of tell he's drunk and he gets in and starts training with these guys
*  Let's even get to some actual training footage because they were they were humiliated
*  I mean he was ragged on these dudes and beating the shit out of him and dropping them and it did
*  Looks like nobody but it's the the problem
*  You know he's a world-class
*  Kickboxer yeah, and these guys just really have no idea how to handle his movement and the the skills that he has
*  Yeah people underestimate people don't think there's as much of a difference between
*  Like a black belt in jiu-jitsu and what would be considered an equivalent, you know world champion in Muay Thai
*  Oh, yeah, there's a big step in the step in the ring and she
*  Guys sometimes get cocky about that. I had a buddy of mine
*  He was taking an MMA fight and he wasn't doing any striking
*  He was doing very little striking and he was a really good ground fighter and I said
*  Do you know how you can toy with a guy on the ground and they really have no chance?
*  He goes yeah, I go people could do that to you standing. I go you have to understand that the fight start standing
*  it's not like you start like it's not EBI rules where you start on the guys back and
*  You know you have a really good chance of submitting him if you got a great rear-necked choke. This is not that
*  This is you start
*  20 feet away from the guy and you're standing and you know you have to close that distance
*  You're not a great wrestler either
*  Yeah, well, that's the key component right? Yes
*  It's a giant factor if you did if at least if you wrestle you know
*  Well, at least I'd know I have a decent chance of taking him down. Yes a decent chance and even that's no guarantee anymore
*  Well, I go back to Mark Schultz when he fought in the UFC, you know
*  When Mark Schultz fought in the UFC only fought one UFC fight
*  But that's what you want to see like a world champion Olympic gold medalist top of the food chain wrestler
*  You're only on your feet if he wants you to be like you good luck throwing that punch or kick because you
*  You have no chance
*  He's gonna close the distance and drag you to the ground unless you have really good takedown defense and back back then
*  When he fought Big Daddy Goodrich people didn't really have it unless they were wrestlers
*  They didn't really have good takedown defense
*  It hadn't really been established as like a part of the whole skill set of MMA yet
*  You basically had what you came in there with your karate guy. That's what you had your Muay Thai guy
*  That's what you got. You got to hope you land that elbow before that guy clinches with you and there is it there is a
*  Overall strategic advantage to grappling. Yes, because you can close the distance
*  And if you're gonna punch me you have to get close enough to you
*  You have to make contact with me which mean I can grab a hold of you and get you down
*  That's why that's why the early UFC's it was like
*  Oh, you're gonna have to get close enough to either punch or kick me and when you do that
*  I can grab a hold of you and get you to the ground also the chaos factor
*  Especially in a street fight the chaos factor is like bodies are flying
*  There's bad timing the clinches have it's not like every you know
*  You'll you'll watch the occasional street fight where a guy tees off on some drunk guy and you know
*  It lands the perfect punch and knocks him out cool that does happen
*  Yeah, but you know what also happens melee wild shit misses and then someone clenches
*  And then the worst thing in the world is to fight a grappler who's good at takedowns when you're on the concrete
*  That is the absolute worst thing in the world you get suplex on your head on the concrete
*  One of the worst things that could ever happen you're basically getting hit in the head by the world. Yeah, well, this is why I
*  When I talk about you know people say well, what kind of self-defense you you always say jiu-jitsu for self-defense
*  But do you know you shouldn't let a street fight go to the ground?
*  Here's here's how it works out
*  If you come to me and you want to fight me and you like square off like in a boxing stance
*  I can run away from you right I can just run away. I can just run away
*  I'm gonna get away from you. I don't want to fight you if you want to kick me
*  I can run away from you like there's my primary self-defense is I'm just gonna run away from you
*  When you grab a hold of me now, everything's different. I can't run away anymore now
*  I have to actually know how to handle myself in a grappling situation
*  So that's why I start with you jitsu and look absolutely learn boxing learn more time learn wrestling. Absolutely. No doubt about it
*  But the very first thing you need to learn is because if you want to fight me I can run away if you square off
*  And you know you put your Dukes up and say come on or you push me good
*  I'm running away. That's fine
*  I'll take that but when soon as you grab a hold of me now
*  I got a problem because I can't run in a way run away
*  No problem is the ego where people don't know how to fight and someone puts their Dukes up and they decide to see what
*  They can do they decide in that moment to either fake it or just like see if they can possibly hit the guy
*  And then they get the bank
*  So many tease off on them. Yeah, I think that's I think the whole thing with CTE right now
*  That's why I think the popularity of jiu-jitsu is going to continue because
*  It's a large part of fighting same with wrestling grappling in general
*  I think is going to continue to get more and more popular because
*  Because of CTE because you know as a parent you're not looking hey
*  I really want my kid to be sparring a lot when they're 13 right? No, there's not too many parents that are saying that right now
*  It's not a good idea. Yeah, so I think but you still want your kids know how to fight, right?
*  So how are we gonna do that? Well, we're gonna teach them jiu-jitsu and wrestling and let them have that base
*  And then if they get older, hey should they know how to throw punches?
*  Absolutely, should they get in the boxing ring sometimes and do some boy tie matches? Absolutely. You should absolutely do that as a human
*  But you know you can do that when you're 17, maybe 16 you can start getting that stuff in but the kids jiu-jitsu
*  I don't think there's anything else better for I
*  Completely agree and I think with martial arts with striking
*  It's good to know just to know distance just to understand where you're safe and where you're not safe and understand tells
*  Understand what's happening when someone does this when someone does this and then this is coming when they do this
*  This is coming like you should know that some people don't know that you should know how to protect yourself
*  How to keep your hands up how to duck under things you should know that it should you should understand the timing
*  you should understand distance and timing those are important things, but
*  Fucking swinging knuckles with some guy in the street is so goddamn dangerous because first of all you don't know what he knows and you're
*  Everyone's vulnerable everyone every person that gets punched in the face is vulnerable
*  and if you just want to have like some sort of a
*  Kick boxing match with some man on the concrete like I don't advise that
*  Advise clench and trip. Yeah, I advise get out of there. Yeah
*  Yeah, definitely if someone wants to start some shit with you
*  You're absolutely better off just swallowing your ego and getting the fuck out of Dodge I
*  That's the whole warrior kid books. Yeah teach those kids. Hey, there's gonna be problems. There's gonna be bullies
*  If you can you don't need to fight them
*  Yeah, and what's oh, I am somebody hit me up, you know, cuz I'm always telling people change you just to change you do
*  You had somebody hit me up, you know, I've tried it
*  But I don't I want to try to try it a couple times, but I don't like to fight and I'm like
*  Hey, if you don't like the fight to fight you more than anyone else should learn jujitsu
*  Because if you know jujitsu you probably your chances of having to fight will go down a lot just by the way you carry yourself
*  Just the way by by the way you present yourself the chance of you having to fight go down a lot
*  Also with jujitsu you're involved in real-life
*  struggles the thing about like karate sparring and a lot of point like light sparring is it's not the real
*  Chaos that comes with an actual fight. Whereas jujitsu is full blast
*  Someone's trying to get you it's full so you get used to full blast you get you get accustomed to it
*  You know what to expect as someone swings for you and you clinch with them
*  You know what? It's like to resist with a 100% non compliant body
*  You know someone's like fuck. I'm really trying to get away from you really it's not like play sparring. Yes, you can go full out
*  And you know where this brings us right back to
*  Officers yes. Well Andrew Yang said it best. He said I think that every police officer should be a purple belt
*  That's an incredible statement. It's a good level, right?
*  It's like an attainable level within a couple of years, but with a couple of years, man
*  You've got your ass kicked. You've kicked some ass you've you've like a purple belt is basically a black belt who hasn't done enough time yet
*  It's all it is. Yeah, I mean once you've got past blue bellic blue belt is I put in the time
*  I've learned how to do some stuff and maybe I'll do this. I might make it
*  I might make purple belt like you basically everybody who gets a purple you want to grab and go hang in there
*  You are a fucking black belt
*  What's better to say and you're a black belt in jujitsu? You're gonna be a black belt in jujitsu
*  Just keep fucking going you you already have exhibited enough technique that you could actually one day achieve that just keep going
*  yeah, the amount of confidence and
*  and mental clarity that
*  Cops would have if every cop was a purple belt. Oh, it would be amazing amazing nothing better that we could do
*  Then to just somehow make that happen. Yeah good idea for Andrew Yang the horrible video of this guy
*  Involved with this lady and he's he's a cop and he's talking to this lady and she's non-compliant
*  And he grabs her and he he fucking brute
*  Strengths her to the ground and throws her on her stomach and then gets in a rear naked choke and people are filming this
*  And yeah, it's a terrible rear naked choke
*  He'd tell he sucks the whole thing is terrible like I couldn't imagine a black belt ever handling it that way ever ever
*  First of all, you wouldn't be so threatened by her
*  She's not physically threatening at all and you wouldn't want to bully her and to show her that you could throw her around like
*  That it wouldn't happen. It wouldn't happen fear, right?
*  That's fear kicking in and it's fear not only of his ego, but he might be legitimately
*  She wins the last time he put hands on somebody
*  I mean if you put hands on people
*  You know, you don't have to do what he did in that situation
*  I haven't seen the video but you don't you know, you know, you don't have to do that
*  I think he's just a pussy when I'm looking at the video
*  I'm like I just think he just wants to throw his weight around which is another thing you wouldn't do if you know how
*  To fight that's part of why a lot of people act like that
*  It's because they really don't know how to fight and that's really they really don't know how to do that
*  To a grown man
*  So when they're doing to someone who they can do it to because they're just bigger they they do it
*  They'll force them then pose them so they'll be a bully
*  It's it's horrible to see but you wouldn't see a black belt do that to somebody
*  the amount of confidence that he has
*  Exactly. It's the same thing with kids. Yeah, I posted some of a few months ago
*  But it's you know, some some bully thing had popped up and I said hey if you want to stop bullying
*  You know have kids change your jitsu Muay Thai wrestling. They should have it in school
*  They should oh, yeah teaching kids in school. And here's the thing people thought I said not only will it prevent them from getting bullied
*  It will prevent them from bullying. Yes, which people don't understand people cannot comprehend
*  What that means and it's exactly what you just said if somebody actually knows how to fight and you've been humbled and you've been beat
*  Down and you've been choked and you know what that feels like and you know what it means and you know how that feels
*  The chances of you look you could still be an asshole
*  But the chances of you becoming a bully are way less way less than if you're insecure and scared and have a you know
*  Trying to make up for your ego by abusing people. That's who becomes bullies
*  Yeah with kids and with adults hundred percent the more the more you train the more secure you are
*  The smaller your ego is the more you're able to step back and see things clearly, you know
*  That's one of the horrible things about that
*  The George Floyd was the other cops they're not detached from the situation
*  They're all wound up in it and you get to teaches you and fighting teaches you that if you do that if you allow yourself
*  To get wrapped up in the stuff you're gonna you're gonna make bad decisions
*  I think also for kids a lot of the reasons why they do horrible shit is because they have too much fucking energy
*  Oh, yeah jacked up with young hormones. Oh, yeah
*  testosterone yeah testosterone and
*  And
*  angst and angst and
*  Bro, it's kind of fun, right?
*  You know like yeah, you it's kind of fun. Like there's mayhem going on. Yeah, I went out
*  What is that the right word? Am I a jerk for saying that?
*  I don't know when I was a kid that kind of mayhem
*  I wanted to be a part of it, you know
*  if and and actually I was talking to one of my LA cop buddies and I was asking him the difference between like the
*  The
*  92 riots was a 92 or 93 Ronnie King those those riots and these riots
*  Those riots he was like those were the people that kind of instigated and started and perpetuated those riots. Those were
*  Real like gangsters like shock callers were making those things happen
*  This one these riots were he was like, yeah, these are kids. These are kids that drove down from Riverside
*  These are kids that well, you know and and sure some of their some of their attitudes was like hey
*  There's been you know in justices against police. We want to stand up to that got it
*  And then he said of course, there's a criminal element as well that are legit
*  Normal robbery crews that are saying oh cool. We got some good cover right now
*  Let's get in there and make some you know steal some stuff and we probably won't get caught
*  But that's that's a big difference. So you do have an element of kids that are like, oh, there's some mayhem going on
*  There's some mayhem going on
*  Guess what?
*  17 year old boys like they like mayhem. They like mosh pits, right?
*  You love that stuff. That was my childhood if there was some mayhem
*  I wanted to find it right and that's that fuels these things normal boy behavior normal boy behavior
*  Especially when those boys are getting told don't go out
*  And they're being locked up in houses right now with no
*  They're they're got freaking steam coming out of their ears
*  Also, the cops are gonna stand down while you smash windows and everybody can get free sneakers
*  Yes
*  Nothing to do with George Floyd. It had so many things to do with so many different steps
*  Yeah, so many different factors that it collided together on that one day. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's
*  Man, I don't know how this one ends up man. I don't know how it ends up either
*  It ends up with me getting the fuck out of LA
*  Gone, huh?
*  Gone looks like it. I don't see the benefit. I want to come back and visit a lot, but it's just
*  It's just not not a smart place
*  You know, I'm unfortunately managed either. I'm rooted here. Unfortunately by the ocean. Yeah, cuz I'm an ocean guy
*  Yeah, and so there's really limited choices in the world. Yeah, it really is. Yeah, that's a
*  Problem, you know, they kind of got me you're that connected to the ocean
*  What is it about the ocean that you you always post pictures of the sunrise in the ocean? I
*  Don't think there's you know going surfing just going just going in the ocean and plus my my life was kind of being in the
*  Seal teams was always we always had that that was part of our life
*  You know part of our life was the ocean growing up in the ocean just
*  There's some I don't know, you know, I guess I guess for me. It's a huge like nature thing, right?
*  You know people you should be you should go outside go outside and go hike in a mountain
*  you know go go to Montana and hike around see what that feels like go to
*  Go to Idaho check that out go to the mountains go to California mountains that you feel different
*  You feel different. Yeah, you feel humbled you feel small you feel perspective
*  So the ocean does that for me and it's just mind clearing right you go out surfing like your mind is clear
*  It's kind of like jujitsu. Hey, you got to get out there. You're you you don't even know what you sometimes you don't even
*  You know you get done with a good role in jujitsu and you say well, hey, what?
*  You don't barely even remember it because your mind is just gone
*  You're just monkey mind Zen is total Zen state same thing with there being in the water for me surfing same thing
*  Like oh, I'm out here and my mind is just empty
*  It's monkey mind and and I think that's really good for you plus the fact it's humbling plus the fact it's healthy
*  So yeah, I just have a strong connection to the ocean. I know my son's real waterman
*  You know he's out. He serves all the time
*  I'd hate to do that to him and then my little daughter's getting her surfing on so yeah
*  It's just one of those things man. Yeah, I get it. There's a reason why surf towns like
*  Like towns that are near the ocean or chill mm-hmm you get humbled by that
*  Like you take yourself seriously look at that fucking body of water over there stupid
*  Yeah, you ain't shit
*  You know people say well
*  What makes the seal team so good in one of the major components is the ocean?
*  Because when you've got to do an operation that involves the water it just sucks it just everything about it sucks
*  Everything about it sucks you're getting in up. You know you're parachuting from a plane into the water
*  It's nighttime you got boat yours freaking parachute like drifting around you got to get your motor started
*  It's freezing cold boats flip over then you got to drive that boat to the beach
*  And you got to drive through the surf zone your weapons are covered with sand you're freezing cold
*  It's just everything sucks everything sucks about it
*  So when that's kind of your starting and by the way you haven't even conducted your operation yet
*  You do you haven't even started the operation and you're freezing cold you're tired your radio got flooded out your night vision
*  Goggles are freaking filled with sand everything sucks, and now you got to conduct your operation
*  So in order to survive that way on a regular basis
*  That's one of the things that makes the seal teams good is we're we're used to this one additional component all the time
*  That you always have to deal with you have to figure that out you have to be able to gut through it
*  That's why in basic seal trading. They just put you in the water for a long time. They just put you in there
*  We have to develop an attitude that embraces the suck. Oh, yeah, yeah
*  For sure you actually enjoy it in some way some crazy way that you know it sucks
*  Like that video that I always quote your video good
*  Dude, I listen to that in my head all the time
*  And I'm listen I've watched the video a ton of times and listen to it
*  I've played it on this podcast at least four times
*  But I hear it when I'm training like if I'm running hills
*  And I'm fucking exhausted and there's like another hundred yards to get to the top of that hill I hear good
*  Good you exhausted means you're fucking doing it. Yeah good. Well. What are your what's your choice?
*  What else you're gonna think about cry you know cry
*  No, it's like no actually good bring it let's make this happen
*  Yeah, and if you can do I also do that in the sauna when I'm exhausted in the sauna, and it's like 190 degrees
*  19 minutes in and you know doing a 30 minute session. I'm like good good sucks
*  It means it's gonna have a great effect on your body gonna get that hormetic effect
*  This is how you get the heat shock proteins pussy. You know hang in there good
*  If you want to if you want to do something that's worthwhile. Yeah, it's gonna suck
*  Yeah, it's just gonna suck and you might as well just enjoy that part of it. Yes
*  Yeah, I
*  Mock myself to the other thing I do oh you make fun of yourself. Oh all the time
*  Yeah, I get pissed at that little part of my brain. I'll be like oh really you think you're gonna
*  I think I'm gonna listen to you. Yeah, not happening not happening
*  Yeah, I did these like these I put these things in the kids books
*  You know what I mean put those things I've got those kids books
*  Like there's a one of the kids books talks about this hill horrible hill
*  You know like this what's this what you're gonna face horrible hill, and what are you gonna? Do you know it's gonna suck?
*  Just got to do it. Yeah, you just do it, but the thing is it's always sucks while it's happening
*  It's always fucking horrible
*  But then when it's over it feels great that you got through the suck
*  And I don't think most people who don't experience suck they don't experience that feeling of conquering suck
*  Yeah, and that's the that's the important thing to try and remember yeah, so you remember it. I remember it
*  I remember what that so even when it's sucking. I'm like I know how this is gonna feel
*  I know how this plays out, and you know what actually I know other feeling
*  You know is when you don't do it yeah, and the end of the day comes you're like dude
*  That was pathetic you didn't even you know you and that's just the worst feeling that's the feeling that really makes you sick
*  And so between that carrot and stick carrot being like I know this is gonna be good and stick mean
*  I know at the end of the day if I'm putting my head on the pillow, and I was a bitch
*  That doesn't feel good. I don't want none of that
*  It's also when you're a type of person that wants to achieve and so you're always trying to get things done
*  You're trying to push yourself when you fall short because of cowardice
*  It is the worst feeling that or just just failure any kind of failure
*  The reason why you would one of the reasons why I mean at least I can speak for myself personally I
*  Do things so hard is because I've felt that sting of failure
*  I you need to know what that feels like especially when you quit you need to know what quit yeah
*  See that's it you need to know in your own
*  And you need to hear that that fucking sting feel that sting so that when it comes up again
*  You're like not today, bitch not today
*  I've been here before keep going keep going
*  Find a way, but there's something about good like just even saying it it makes me smile
*  Really does it works it really does work because it's an attitude changer, and I use the sauna sauna is really easy
*  It's not that it's just fucking 30 minutes
*  You just deal with it
*  But there's something about those last 11 minutes that you can get in your head like fuck me really good
*  Probably get the good effects by just leave now. There's like all these little mind games you play
*  But if you just say good does it suck good?
*  Yeah, I started start smiling you can rationalize a lot of that you can start rationalizing of why well
*  You know these last four minutes won't really make that big of a difference a shift in perception
*  And I always noticed that from listening to music when I run
*  Like there's something about listening to a great fucking song when a great song kicks on when you're running
*  Like if I'm running in Ted Nuget stranglehold comes on you know there's something about stranglehold because it also has like a double meaning
*  Right it's jujitsu. It's trying to fucking you know you like this so when you hear that here. I come again
*  I can run I can run I can get extra energy. I'm like where the fuck is that energy coming from?
*  Well, it's coming from my mind right the music stimulates my mind
*  It kicks in those endorphins, and then all of a sudden I got an extra gear
*  Well, how come I can't just conjure up that fucking extra gear
*  I think you can you can't got to figure out how to do that all the time
*  Yeah, that always is horrible to see like you know in a fight when a guy either
*  He loses a fight and after he lose the fight. He's raging. He's all mad, but he was just gassed right
*  He was just gas where was that where was it? Where was that right there? Yeah two and a half minutes ago
*  Yeah, I mean sometimes just overcoming anxiety for fighters sometimes
*  When it's over and the plug is pulled it
*  You know it's over and they're like fuck
*  And then they're angry and raging because they realized they failed they didn't manage their energy correctly they didn't manage their mind their anxiety
*  Yeah, exactly the same feeling
*  I'm so hard on myself man everything I've ever done wrong everything I've ever said wrong
*  Just everything just say I'll be I'll be in the middle of working out sometimes
*  I'll think about and go fuck but that is also that that's what makes you work
*  Yeah, and that that keeps you going that key that makes you achieve
*  It's like people think that it's easy to just kind of go out there and get things done, but it's not it's that's why most
*  People don't do it
*  Yeah, you know I so I don't sleep a lot right and
*  Sometimes people are like and look I'm not saying you should shouldn't sleep on everyone should sleep as much as they can
*  I don't sleep a lot people like you know why don't you sleep more and I'm like
*  Well, I wish I could I wish there wasn't this little thing in the back of my head going hey
*  Hey, you know you're actually that you could be doing a lot more right now. What about this? What about that?
*  What about the other thing like that's what's going on in my head? There's not something that's going
*  Gee I have to get up like no there's a thing in there going you better get up you better get up
*  They're tracking on you. They're watching you you better get up here. It's happening. There's a bad guy out there
*  He's training harder like that's what's in my head is not in my head like oh no no
*  Hey, please
*  Let the freaking let let the freaking powers of the world allow me to go into bed at night and just pass out and be
*  Like oh, I'm I'm good. I'm satisfied with my life right now
*  I wish I could feel that for freaking eight hours a night. It ain't there it ain't there
*  It's like all people talk about staying hungry. I'm starving
*  All the time all the time like stay hungry yeah, you have to like
*  Yeah, I
*  Know it never ends. It doesn't end. That's the thing and you soon as as soon as I get somewhere as soon as I get somewhere
*  I'm like oh
*  Where else where I need to go I need to go somewhere else yeah
*  Getting soft yeah, yeah always no matter what I've ever done. It was one day. There'll be a thing well become
*  Satisfied and calm no with everything that's good that comes now. There's an equal fear of becoming a pussy
*  There's a fear of now becoming lazy and becoming like second rate and just like god damn it. There's no end
*  Yeah, there's no so I now I don't even think there's an end no. There's there's definitely not an end
*  You know that's what's funny about shooting the shooting the bow right is what's what I find funny about shooting the bow is
*  Anger
*  Aggression really doesn't help you at all at all you know what it fucks you up, huh?
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying because anger and aggression is all fast twitch shit, too
*  It's all movement whereas the bow is like you got to have the mind of no mind
*  You got to just just execute and just stay completely focused on the task totally detached from what's happening
*  Yeah, and he's got to sit there and it's a new skill really
*  Oh, it's totally new skin for me like in the competition that I experienced
*  I always the only competition I had other than inside the gym
*  You know training partners is fighting and that's all fast stuff. It's all like explosions and movement
*  So anytime where there's danger and and and anxiety and fear your body's geared up to go quick and move quick
*  But with hunting it's the opposite when you're drawing back on an animal all that anxiety like you better get that quick out of your head
*  Yeah, there's no quick. There's execute and calmness stay in the zone
*  Nothing is exists other than the process of executing the perfect shot. It's the same thing with shooting
*  You know you have you draw fast you move fast you draw fast
*  I mean as soon as you punch out that weapon you gotta go boom and like you just gotta let that thing go
*  Yeah, you used to see guys myself included like you ever shot head plates before yes
*  Like yeah, you know there's six head plates
*  You'd see me or some someone else they miss one and if they don't if they don't let that go right then
*  Everything falls apart the wheels fall if you if they miss one
*  And then they try and shoot usually I would just miss one and just keep shooting like it didn't even happen
*  I maybe go back and get it where you kind of have to go back and get it, but
*  If you go
*  I miss that oh, it's just a total and complete another disaster great video that Tim Kennedy put off of him shooting on the range
*  And you know he puts dummy rounds and with regular rounds and he hits the dummy round and click and he's a look at that
*  trigger control
*  Trigger discipline because like there was no flinch. There was no nothing. It was just click. There's no movement
*  It was perfect. You know which is what you're trying to achieve
*  What you're trying to achieve you're trying you know the last thing you want to see is click
*  Remember when I first started shooting rifles like that's what I would I was I would experience that thing we're anticipating the right you know 30
*  a
*  Win mag
*  300 win mag so it's got a lot of kick to it. You know it's a boom. It's like a loud loud kicking gun so
*  There was no round in the chamber
*  And I pull it and I saw myself doing them like you bitch like you better learn how to stop doing that one thing
*  That's interesting is learning how to shoot a bow
*  Radically increase my accuracy with a rifle. Oh, yeah, radically yeah because it's so
*  Still there's so much stillness and everything's freehand right you're very rarely shooting a rifle at an animal freehand
*  Usually trying to find a rest unless it's like inside of you know 60 70 yards
*  You're probably gonna try to arrest you're not gonna shoot a 300 yard shot with a rifle freehand
*  But with a bow everything's freehand so with a rifle
*  I just knew that all it was just squeeze squeeze squeeze let it go off just let it go off squeeze squeeze squeeze boom
*  Like when I started shooting at a Terran tactical shooting on the range the easiest thing for me was a rifle
*  I was like oh god all I have to do is just squeeze and the trigger will go off
*  I'm so used to a bow where there's so many moving parts and using your back
*  And you're letting it go off a surprise shot it made a big difference in my rifle accuracy
*  Yeah, that was when uh when Dudley was teaching me how to shoot and Andy was there too
*  So Andy was like translating for me. He's like hey what he means
*  He's translating it to seal
*  pistol shooting and they're kind of like
*  Communicating to each other and then Andy said hey what he's saying is like you know frontside focus
*  I was like okay cool got it. You know and I was awesome to have have freaking Dudley
*  I know the first person that ever shows me anything about archery is Dudley saying hey
*  Here's a bow and here's exactly how to shoot you idiot, and I'm like. Thank you. It's pretty goddamn lucky
*  Yeah, I mean we're both real lucky in that regard
*  I learned how to bow hunt from cam Hanes and John Dudley
*  It's pretty lucky those are those are like the world champions. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's uh
*  That's Jordan and Kobe Bryant or Jordan and LeBron James completely yeah 100% yeah
*  It's we're very fortunate, and it's um there's something about
*  hunting too that once you it's
*  It seems like when you're looking at on the surface it seems so straightforward
*  And then once you start doing it. It's very much like martial arts. We like God damn
*  There's a lot of layers to this shit. There's so many layers
*  you know and then when you're hanging out with a guy like cam or
*  A guy like Dudley, and you hunt with them, and you see them hunt you go. Oh like this is I get it
*  This is a black belt. Oh, yeah, this is some Mundial's champion here. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it is
*  So so crazy yeah, so crazy to see those guys in action and just to be like listening to what Dudley's telling me about
*  What a freaking elk is gonna do yeah?
*  Yeah, I'm like well. I guess that's just about to happen. Oh, and it just happened. Yeah
*  It's madness and then with Dudley too. It's like he's so into cooking it too. He's so good at cooking
*  It's like you get the whole lifestyle thing from him you get like this learning how
*  The the art of archery which really is an art form
*  It's an art form just like martial arts are and then this moment of keeping your shit together in the execution of a shot
*  And then the big payoff when that does happen and then the harvesting the animal carrying it out
*  And then the meal that meal afterwards when you've had a successful hunting trip
*  It's like god damn when we were in camp in Utah and Dudley made that neck that neck roast
*  With with jalapenos and the bell peppers and holy shit
*  But it was also so good cuz you knew what went down
*  You know you were there when he shot the elk and it's all it's all so crazy
*  It's it's it's so satisfying that I can't imagine it not being a part of my life and not in that meat not being a part
*  of my diet
*  Changes you yeah, so it's it's too bad that it's not more available to people you know
*  Yeah, it's not it's hard. It's there's a high bar for accessibility
*  It's it's very and we got real lucky. Oh for sure we get to hunt at the Deseret Ranch in Utah
*  Which is this incredible place? It's a private property. It's all wild animals. There's no fences, but it's private property
*  So there's not an overwhelming number of people like there's a lot of guys that they try to go into public land
*  and
*  Unless you're willing to hike in 20 miles and there's a lot of guys that are willing now to hike in 20 miles because
*  There's now this culture of these really fit backpack hunters like these Aaron Snyder type dudes
*  Who put these fucking heavy packs on and they just go they they're training for this moment all year round
*  Like Aaron has this crazy setup in his gym where he has this
*  elevated treadmill and then each the treadmill on each side has
*  Like a like an Olympic bar and you lift the bar
*  So you're holding weight and you're going up this elevated treadmill my Jesus fucking Christ man
*  But that's that's what you have to do if you want to be mountain fit to be able to do that
*  And that's the barrier for entry to go and do these public land hunts
*  Everybody stops at the trailhead everybody gets out of their car
*  And then how far are you gonna go because he's willing to go 20 fucking miles in are you willing to go 20 miles in?
*  Yeah, it's gonna take eight hours and then come 20 miles back out with a moose on your
*  That's like that's the totally legit
*  Yeah, totally legit as legit as it gets yeah, and most of those guys all had to learn themselves
*  They ought to teach themselves and you know, they've all we know we're real lucky that like we get this amazing coaching
*  So we're getting is these junk even though there's so many layers to it. We're both kind. I mean, I've been doing it now
*  I've been hunting for eight years bow hunting for I guess six six ish
*  Total rookie, you know, I'm still like a blue belt or maybe maybe I'm like getting ready to be a purple belt
*  Maybe I might get my purple belt soon, but you know you go out with those guys
*  They're fucking 10th degree black belts and it's like there's even though there's
*  You know this this barrier for entry it is still possible
*  It's still possible, but it's just like jujitsu
*  It's like when you when you talk to that blue belt you like keep fucking going yeah, and you can make it you can do
*  This you know speaking of which I?
*  Have to at least bring this up a little bit to clarify a little bit what I did to John Dudley on the jujitsu
*  Here's the only part that you're missing missing a little bit right so I'm giving him
*  his wife
*  Like a like a jujitsu private so you know his name is there why Andy's there?
*  Little dud was there so it was getting worse. He broke his neck in front of his wife and his son
*  So I'm just completely you know I'm chillin and okay. This is this this is that and
*  I'm not even I'm not even doing it like this is that we in one weekend Andy
*  John and me we did we did archery which I had never done before
*  Then we did jujitsu which John had never done before and then we went on the wind tunnel which John had never done before
*  You know cuz Andy's like a sky god parachuting blah blah blah and so we did those three things
*  It was kind of like a cool weekend. I mean that's kind of an epic weekend really let's be honest, so it's jujitsu time
*  So I'm like okay cool, so I'm going over. Hey. This is the guard. This is the mountain going over all the basic stuff
*  I'm I'm I'm just giving the basic overall kind of concepts so I get done with that
*  You know and I'm done like I'm done. I I'm just done. I'm like okay. You know great
*  It's good introduction and then Dudley is
*  Like well, let's go a little bit
*  And I'm like does the wrong language. I would have pulled them aside come here so so he's like
*  Let's go a little bit and even that you know what I'm totally cool with that of course he wasn't I?
*  He wasn't mean and he would wasn't thinking he was gonna be it wasn't it. He's he wants the experience
*  Yeah, yeah, I shouldn't have even said let's go a little bit
*  He was like he was like hey can we can we try it you know something like that just being cool?
*  And I'm like absolutely man no problem
*  so
*  So I lay down on the ground right and I'm like
*  He says well, what should I do? I go you know just attack me
*  So I laid on my back. I'm like just attack me and
*  Guess what he did what he did he freaking attacked me. He like came at me and
*  Dudley's a big strong athletic guy six. What is he six five at least yeah, so he
*  He grabs, and I'm chillin you know I'm just like okay cool. He comes at me
*  I think I think you like grab me and so I kind of replaced guard and then I sweep him and
*  I'm out and so I'm mounted and all this is just pretty chill, and I put in a
*  Ezekiel choke right which I have a little yeah, no G is equal to I have a little have a little good technique for doing it
*  But no big deal, so I put in the Ezekiel choke. He's this is the thing that I really
*  Wish I should have explained more because we hadn't rolled I
*  Wasn't like hey when you start to feel like you got if you got to tap out, right?
*  He knew to tap out, but I kind of figure everyone knows how to tap out so I put the choke in on him right well
*  He doesn't know what to do so he he's grabbing me, and he's pulling he's squeezing me
*  So he's on the bottom. I'm mounted. I've got the Ezekiel choke in and in order to defend himself in his own mind
*  He's squeezing me into him
*  Which the way I do my Ezekiel choke it hurts. I mean it compresses the choke even more and so
*  What are you doing?
*  Basically I put my hand I make a fist and I put my fist in my sternum
*  And then I you know grab the forearm here, and then arch my shoulder so there's the neck right here it closes it right
*  So it's putting the fist into the fist into right it. It's a it's a trach. It's an air choke. It's gnarly
*  And so I'm just doing this and you can see that hole and you shrug
*  And you shrug but as I'm doing this he's panicking and pulling me into him
*  Oh Jesus, and he'd only did it for a second and then he turned any taps out
*  I was like yeah, you know and I wasn't I was just like oh you know boom and then he taps
*  And then the rest of the stories, I guess I didn't know a lot about the rest of this
*  I didn't know any of the rest of the story cuz he didn't want to see
*  Like a baby yeah fractured like his hyoid bone, and then it built calcium up around it
*  So he calls up Andy one day, and he goes dude. I think I got throat cancer
*  Cuz there's something growing in my throat
*  And he goes the doctor gets an x-ray, and he's like hey
*  Did you do something to your neck because there's a there's a hairline fracture?
*  That's not now calcium deposit around it, and he's like oh, I know what happened, so I
*  guess
*  in my defense
*  I
*  Just get him in like a head and arm dude. It wasn't that it wasn't like a big deal. It wasn't it wasn't crazy
*  It wasn't crazy. It was just normal be like if if you grab somebody that showed up here
*  It's like hey, you know hey
*  Can you roll with me you'd be like oh cool, and you put him in a kind of whatever presented itself
*  Maybe you'd arm lock them
*  Maybe you do a camera problem is when you get used to doing certain types of chokes
*  And then you're doing it to someone who doesn't especially that where you got a fist yeah
*  And I this is I guess this is the only thing
*  Make no mistake about it even though. I was just chilling. He was not he was going level 7 berserker mode
*  Hey, he's such a good athlete
*  You know the other thing about people that have never done jiu-jitsu when they're doing it with someone who's a black belt
*  They probably feel like they can just kind of go crazy
*  And you'll just absorb it and deal with it and so they just try it
*  Let's see what happens when I go crazy, so now he holds this over my head
*  One day I'm like I'm like
*  We're up in Montana, and I said hey, man. He's like he's just like he was at my house
*  He's all thanks for having us over. I go, bro
*  You you know you taught me how to do this you brought me up here you take me hunting like you're doing all this awesome
*  Stuff man. I you know you're the man dude. I really appreciate it goes. Yeah, and you know what you did for me like
*  What he goes broke my neck
*  I
*  It's awful, bro
*  It's all good now though right. Oh, yeah, so not bothering him anymore. Oh, I don't know about that I
*  Thought you meant it's all good between us. It's all good between us. He just said we do bower free
*  I think every time he swallows and things about you know he coughs. Oh, no he coughs
*  Hopefully I mean I haven't talked to him about it
*  I don't like to bring it up a lot
*  But so there's something in there that's fucking with his throat something in there is making him cough
*  So they'd have to probably get in there and scrape it so while we're hunting he would be like
*  And then he'd look at me
*  I'm just thinking of such a such a horrible person
*  It's you know I was I always say like
*  You know I've Dean Lister. I've been been Dean Lister's training partner for 20 something years
*  Up until recently he never hurt me, and I never heard him never I mean until recently
*  Yeah, cuz he ended up hurting me and he ended up hurting me in the dumbest possible way I
*  Show up to class this was like
*  This is over a year ago cuz I it hurt my archery for a while I
*  Show up to class late right and he's teaching and we're just gonna roll
*  but I come out and he's like finishing the class and
*  I'm cold and I'm just just getting on the mat and he's says oh, let me show let me show something
*  he goes here lay down and he gets a
*  He gets a straight like he gets an Americana on me or a Camaro, but anyways
*  He's like hey try and get out by straightening your arm and the whole class is watching
*  He goes try and get out by straightening your arm um and I go okay cool
*  And so he puts me across he gets across side he puts the think it wasn't I think there's an action of a Camaro
*  He says all right now try and this is in front of us. He goes like straight-arm
*  He's about to straight. He's about my arm is here
*  He's about to straight he wants me to try and get out by like doing almost like a hitchhiker escape or something
*  so he says uh
*  He says try and get out by straightening your arm. I go okay. I straight my arm, and he just in a millisecond
*  You could hear it
*  armlocks me
*  Totally destroyed my arm. No not totally it was injured very bad the first time in my life
*  I had to get a sling this bro this guy comes over to me Dean Lister
*  And he goes bro, and he's all he's such a nice guy. He's all I'm so sorry
*  And he goes I didn't know your elbow wasn't very flexible. I go bro. It's an elbow elbows aren't flexible their bone, dude
*  D needs a DNA test cuz I know he's at least 86 percent neonatal
*  Yeah at a minimum the way his neck and shoulders move together
*  You can see that dude with like a big club for sure and a total total
*  Mutant and a savant on the jujitsu mat yeah a complete savant on the jujitsu mat
*  Well, he's the literally the missing link
*  He's the link I shouldn't say the missing like the link to jujitsu expanding into the leg lock modern jujitsu
*  It's 100%
*  Mr. Honour and that the statement that he made to John Dana her has become world famous because data hurt said it on my podcast
*  He said Dean Lister said to him. Why would you enjoy? Why would you ignore 50% of the human body?
*  Yeah, and Donna her being the fucking genius that he is was like why would you enjoy? Yeah?
*  Would you so
*  Most of the like you know all the all these new things that are coming out now, right? Yeah
*  You know you see Gordon Ryan just insane all these guys that are really attacking legs now
*  And by the way, just like Dean Gordon's not only good at attacking legs. He's good at everything but I
*  Was asking Dean because I watched you know Dean's done all these moves to me for years, you know and
*  Just just over and over again right this is what we do. It's what we've been doing
*  We've been doing it since he won 80 CC when when Eddie beat Hoyler when Dean won
*  when he beat cockerego in the finals with
*  What they now call 50-50 which he and I called
*  Cockerego after that we called that cockerego. No one started doing it for another many many probably ten years
*  Regularly I was there that year. Oh, yeah, and I wasn't there that year. I was I was there when Eddie
*  Won in San Diego. We were all I competed in San Diego Dean competed in San Diego and Eddie competed in San Diego for the trials
*  Eddie won. Yeah
*  Dean won I lost to
*  Big country Roy Nelson. Yeah. Yeah, and I did because I wasn't very tactically smart. I
*  Scrambled to position and I tried to get a
*  Matter of fact, I got a crucifix because that was kind of one of my go-to moves get a crucifix
*  And I'd get a choke from there when I should have taken the back and gotten points and I didn't and Roy Nelson
*  Who is a great guy and he's a total stud
*  he I got the crucifix position and he like
*  Powered out of bounds. And so then and he beat me because he's a much better wrestler than me and
*  awesome at jujitsu, too. Anyways
*  When he won that like we were doing this stuff. So
*  anyways
*  right, like probably
*  Six months ago or three months ago. I was asking Dean I said hey Dean are you starting to see things that you?
*  Didn't know right when your watch because he watches, you know
*  I said are you starting to see jujitsu things that you didn't that you didn't know like footlock stuff and he's like
*  He's like yeah about three or four months ago. I started seeing some things that I didn't think of so
*  That's how long it took people to get to and then start to develop their own stuff, which which is pretty crazy
*  Well, it's fascinating that once the game moved into this sort of leg lock heavy
*  style that so many guy like Craig Jones and Gordon Ryan and this
*  You know Gary Tone and there's so many of those guys that you're seeing this game getting tighter and tighter with leg locks
*  Yeah
*  and
*  John Donahue examines everything too because Donahue his body is broken. He can't really compete anymore
*  I mean he has an artificial hip. He's got an artificial knee
*  His body's really fucked up and his the other knee is really unstable
*  So he can roll but he can only roll very controlled with guys who understand his physical limitations
*  And you can see how he understands positions. You can get a lot out of rolling with him
*  There's a great video actually of Gordon Ryan rolling with John Donahue and obviously they're not using strength
*  They're just flow rolling
*  but you see how
*  Tactical he is and how ahead of every position he is and how his deep understanding of it
*  And part of it is because he's teaching these guys and he's teaching them from position
*  Where he can't really do it himself. He can do it, but he can't can't compete. He can't roll, right?
*  Right, but but but he has the mind for it
*  So he's seeing it from the outside and he's also this fucking really genius human being
*  So he's able to break this down and then he has this core group of
*  Badasses that understand what a great pleasure it is to have this genius teach you
*  I mean, it's not a coincidence that that whole Hens Oh Gracie team has become
*  One of the biggest threats like that. The whole team is filled with fucking murderers. Yeah, and they're
*  just to again emphasize the point is
*  Leg locks are a part of the game and
*  There was a time period where people thought that leg locks would change the game completely
*  and at a certain point the defenses for the leg locks become known and
*  All of a sudden you have to go back to the other parts of jiu-jitsu
*  And that's why you see guys like toning right?
*  He doesn't always win with heel hooks, but you have to address them or you will lose, right?
*  And yeah, those guys it's really cool to see those guys coming up
*  I mean, it's such an underwire can't say in it coming up like I'm like like there but I'm watching this development
*  Yeah, which I was that kind of ground zero with Dean Lister and the crazy thing is
*  Dean Lister
*  Hey, he has like a like a crazy savant mind where I would
*  create
*  one thing for every
*  Whatever for every 20 things that Dean created
*  It's probably like Eddie and I don't know Eddie as well as you do
*  But just the creative part of his brain is what the most powerful thing was
*  Yeah, and then once people saw it they're like, okay now we can build upon this
*  Yeah for Eddie
*  It's a hundred percent the creative part of his brain also the fact that when I met Eddie he hated lifting weights
*  He wouldn't lift weights because I would try to get him lift weights. I'm like, come on. Let's look place
*  Shit like you can go live weight
*  So so he was this little tiny guy and he had to rely on technique
*  So he had to rely on trickery plus he was a musician, right?
*  So he's always this creative guy and he smoked a lot of weed too
*  So he was always thinking about things outside the box
*  And he's also this guy that doesn't like people telling them and he's wrong. So like, you know, you can't do it that way
*  He's like, oh really? Hmm. Let's see if I can and then he would find a way to do it and you know, and
*  He just developed all these like weird
*  entries into things and these weird setups that people didn't see coming and
*  Once he sort of improved upon these and then started expanding upon them and then developing that whole 10th planet system
*  I mean really it's insanely creative system. That's just developed based on his
*  Ability to just think outside the box
*  Jeff Glover at my training in my dream for a long time teaching
*  He's the same thing where he's small he's crazy flexible
*  He smokes a lot of weed
*  And like he would just do wild things wild things. I was at a dude
*  I was at I was actually at ADCC and I was with my son. My son was probably like
*  nine or something and
*  Where they're watching and Jeff Glover is about to compete. This is before I really was friends with Jeff
*  Was he doing that donkey guard thing back then he was doing everything he the donkey guard hadn't become super popular
*  But he was kind of in the beginning stages of it. So I'm sitting there next to my son and we're at ADCC
*  So it's it's a small thing, you know, I go I and I said to my son, you know, I watch this guy
*  That's about to come out. He's crazy and
*  Glover comes out and he'd like just he falls on his back flips inverted guard and starts like just going
*  Insane just doing insane things and you know, the rest of the matches are two guys, you know playing patty cakes
*  Look for the takedown Glover comes out falls down freakin just doing all kinds of wild stuff and then submits the dude in
*  30s 38 seconds and
*  My son looks me he goes he goes I thought you meant like crazy
*  He goes I didn't know you meant crazy and I go. Yes
*  He thought you meant like brutish. Yes, broodish crazy. He didn't think I meant
*  Just weirdly that what that weird creative thing is
*  Yeah, that's one of the best things about learning jujitsu from a small person like those small guys
*  They figure out how to get around things. I mean there's been a bunch of you know, Hoyler Gracie is a great example of it
*  too Eddie
*  Glover. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's why I'm never a good
*  That's why I'm a bad person to introduce people to jujitsu, right?
*  Because they just think oh, yeah, of course you're a gorilla, you know, you outweigh me by 40 or 50 pounds
*  Yeah, I love I used to always have Jeff Glover on standby at my gym be like, oh you don't oh, yeah
*  Okay, go train with that guy over there. See what happens and when Jeff goes against a like a big strong guy
*  You're gonna get some yeah, they've really get so
*  Disappointed themselves. It's so sad. He said he said the easiest people for him to roll with
*  We're big like muscular guys really he says the easiest people for him to roll with our big muscular guys like big muscular guys
*  I love I love roll with them. They're so easy. That's so crazy because most people get injured. Mmm rolling
*  Flexible now his I think is I think his neck's jacked up. No, oh is it now?
*  Yeah, that's the thing that gets everybody is the goddamn neck
*  The net, you know because the very few guys really strengthen their neck correctly either
*  I think the neck is one thing that you absolutely should strengthen
*  I think you can get away with not lifting weights and doing jujitsu
*  But I don't think you can get away with not strengthening your neck for very long. Yeah, that's a
*  It's one of those things and it connects you to the rest of your freaking body
*  You also use it you use it more than you think, you know, especially me
*  I was my my favorite technique is probably head and arm choke
*  And you're using your neck to secure that arm and once you develop a feel for holding that arm in place with that neck
*  That neck gets a workout man
*  You know you really you use it a lot more than you think and if you can strengthen your neck
*  It's just it's such a big advantage
*  It's also a big advantage in avoiding getting hurt because it strengthens the whole chain from the top of your spine all the way down
*  You know, that's why I'm such a big fan of that iron man. I just used it right now
*  I'm right before the podcast. I was doing it. I do it every fucking day man. I put that I have one
*  I bought one love it. They emailed me a bunch of like bro. How do you like it?
*  Can also man between that and you know
*  There's a few other back exercises and stuff that I think are
*  Critical strength in the lower back too because it's another thing that guys always get jacked is their lower back
*  Yeah, you know the weird thing is people people people's necks get jacked up regardless
*  Like there's people that go through life doing whatever paperwork and they end up with a bad neck
*  Yeah, neck is a vulnerable thing
*  So if you don't take care of it, especially when you are abusing it when you are getting choked when you are not tapping
*  It's one of those things that judge people on their necks on the size of their neck
*  Yeah, if I see someone little skinny neck, yeah
*  We do in man. Yeah, do some good. It's not just doesn't seem like it would be a good thing to have
*  It's that's the thing that holds your head on. I can't wait
*  For the future when your neck is all jacked up and you go in and they just put you in surgery for two hours
*  And you come out you got a metal spine
*  I'm gonna be the first person I'm I'm right in line
*  You want to give me a metal spine or any metal components inside my body? You're down with that. I'm 100% down
*  Let's make it happen. He's got a fake disc and he's got a titanium articulating disc which we're lower back
*  His his lower back had been so smashed and suppressed that
*  His you know, that's one of the things that's why men when they get older
*  They they shrink is your discs get squished to the point and they start touching you get
*  Stenosis do you think you can go too far with flexibility that it starts to injure you over the long term?
*  Well, I don't think you can go too far with flexibility but flexibility without strength perhaps because maybe that in
*  Flexibility like maybe you'll get like some muscle damage, you know when you're trying to push too far
*  That'll prevent you from getting disc damage. Maybe this is speculation, but I think it's critic
*  It's just so critical to strengthen your back man
*  I mean, I'm always doing reverse hypers and I do all these different like back extensions
*  I just think strengthening that whole column and yoga in particular and then the neck the iron neck
*  I just think that whole thing
*  It's like too many guys just rely on their workouts to strengthen that and they don't take it as like hey
*  I really like doing jujitsu. I really like doing Muay Thai. I want to put in the time to work out these areas
*  How's that he's back now?
*  It's not a hundred percent
*  It's still fucks with him a little bit, but he's rolling again, but he's got a fake discs a disc
*  It's a titanium disc that they replace the smushy part with this thing that rolls and moves
*  But it still creates some inflammation whenever you look I know I had Ronnie Coleman here last week
*  I know I listened to and his whole back is all fused and it's horrible man
*  I mean he can't walk and you know, he's the king greatest Olympian of all time. I mean, he's a fucking amazing
*  Pro bodybuilder eight time. Mr. Olympia. I watched the documentary. Yeah, did you see the documentary?
*  I didn't I didn't really good man. Really just what a good guy great guy
*  Nice guy be nicer couldn't be and in pain in fucking agony
*  It's still working friendly and all wouldn't wouldn't have it any other way and he talks about the the days that he like he was talking
*  about squatting 800 pounds and that
*  Like he said he was gonna do it for two reps and after the two reps
*  I could have gotten more and to this day he thinks he should have got more
*  That's what we were talking about earlier. That's keeping up at night. That's why he's a champion
*  I mean that really is that that's what made him a champion. Did you watch the vid the
*  Westside versus the world documentary? No, I didn't but I got to interview Louie
*  I have another piece of his equipment to that belt squat machine
*  Okay, which is amazing it puts all the weight on your on your hips versus on your back
*  He's a fucking wild dude wild I want to go out there and hang out
*  Oh, he would love you man. He would love you. He's you would love him too, man
*  He's that is who Louie is and he's got this fucking gym filled with barbarians
*  Oh, yeah, just all they're doing is just trying to lift the maximum amount of weight they can lift
*  It's insane my kid my kid watch that and hit you know, I think he's just all about it now
*  Right side
*  Him and his little buddies talking about Louie Simmons
*  Go heavier. I mean Jamie and I were in his office interviewing him. That's where we did it
*  We actually oh you went out there podcast at Westside. Yeah, I was in Columbus doing stand-up and I just had to interview
*  I just knew I knew just like I want to get the guy in his gym, too
*  It's just fucking amazing gives a tour of the gym and then we did a podcast at his desk. It was awesome
*  What a rare human being
*  Yeah, they don't make them like Louie Simmons
*  But also a genius like here's a guy who figured out like his disc was fucked up and they were like we're gonna fuse you
*  And he's like, well, let me think of this something made it compress
*  I'm gonna figure out something to make it decompress and strengthen that area and that's where the reverse hyper came from which I think
*  Should be a staple in every gym that reverse hyper machine for strengthening the lower back and then an actively decompress
*  And I've never found anything better and that's all in Louie Simmons Simmons mind. It came out of his own brain because of his injury
*  that he came back from
*  and was
*  Squatting whatever 729 world record at whatever 62 years old
*  Yeah, but I wouldn't recommend any things he does
*  I mean, here's a guy who got his biceps reattached and then blew it out because it was too annoying
*  To not be able to work out. So he just went back to working out and pop snap back off
*  They all cold but he's got no biceps just pulls back
*  Crazy animal get his shoulder redone
*  They gave him an artificial shoulder goes back to the gym and they like you're gonna max out today
*  They met his friends made him max out after his shoulder surgery with an artificial shoulder like okay
*  Like just that's just the culture. Yeah, the culture is it doesn't matter
*  I don't matter in the in the documentary one of the guys was saying my goal
*  Was to hurt Louie when he came in the gym my
*  Was to hurt him. I wanted him to get hurt
*  I wanted to push him so hard that he got hurt that is then this is one of his buddies
*  Yeah, one of his friends one of his training partners. My goal was to hurt him. That's that culture though
*  I mean, that's how you develop such a legendary place you have to have
*  The sensibilities are beyond what a normal person would consider a prudent thing to do
*  Yeah, and if people the people that could withstand that kind of pressure became champions now became world record holders
*  It's all about the mind Jaco. That's what it knows one you we just did three hours, dude
*  Let me give you a kovat test now. It's 330. Let's get some. All right, let's get some. Thank you, brother
*  Bye everybody
*  You
