# Joe Rogan Experience #1878 - Roger Waters
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. I'm a gigantic fan, so it's a real honor. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=12.0s)]
*  And it's very nice to know that you could actually play pool. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, we've only played two rikes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I could see. I could see how you move the ball around. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=23.0s)]
*  You've got to get a little warmed up. You know, we just started. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, it is true that if you start playing pool against somebody you don't know and you discover that they do understand that control of the cue ball is everything. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=38.0s)]
*  And that's something you think, oh, well, maybe we could have a game. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=39.0s)]
*  Well, as soon as you looked at the table and said, these are very unforgiving pockets, I was like, oh, you know. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=42.0s)]
*  A little bit, yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's an honor to have you in here. I'm very excited. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=51.0s)]
*  But second of all, you're in the middle of a lot of things. You've got your tour. You've got a lot of controversy going on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=56.0s)]
*  It's I really enjoyed that conversation that you had with CNN because that kind of conversation is rare to see on air and see someone as informed as you are to have these opinions and express them so honestly and bravely. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=63.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=80.0s)]
*  It was a very interesting conversation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Well, I've known Michael a bit for a year or two. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=83.0s)]
*  And he actually my last kind of engagement with him with Michael's McConaughey I'm talking about, right, the interview, which when I was playing in Miami a few years ago, and the local Jewish community decided that I shouldn't be allowed to use local school children to sing another brick in the wall part too because all during the war. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=88.0s)]
*  And in all tours that I did, I always use local children, preferably from, you know, undernourished communities to come and sing with me between eight and 12 of them every night and they would come in, having having listened to the song a bit, and I would rehearse them at five o'clock in the afternoon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=112.0s)]
*  And then boom, I'll post eight they're on stage singing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=137.0s)]
*  And they get very excited and obviously, but it's a wonderful thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, for them but also for me and also for the band. Have these children come and perform with us on stage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=146.0s)]
*  And the mayor of North Miami Beach or wherever it was came under some pressure from the local community. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=154.0s)]
*  And they did and they weren't allowed to play so I got some other kids but what was the objection that I'm an anti semi. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Obviously I'm not an anti so let's get that clear straight away if you don't mind. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=169.0s)]
*  Because I'm obviously not you can study my record going back as far as you want. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=175.0s)]
*  So that yeah that's it but that's always the objection because because I support BDS and because I have for the last 16 years or so. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=183.0s)]
*  BDS? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=191.0s)]
*  You know what BDS is Boycott Divestment and Sanctions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=193.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=196.0s)]
*  It's a movement that was started in 2005 in Palestinian Civil Society and it stands for Boycott Divestment and Sanctions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=197.0s)]
*  And so it's a movement to try and shine a light on the predicament of the Palestinian people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=207.0s)]
*  Particularly in the occupied territories but also I guess in Israel itself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=214.0s)]
*  Using those using boycott divestment from companies that like Caterpillar or Hewlett-Packard people like that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=221.0s)]
*  Who deal in the illegal settlements in the occupied territory and sanctions well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=231.0s)]
*  There is not many people out there who are powerful enough to impose sanctions on other people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=239.0s)]
*  And most of those with that much power are allies of the Israeli government and so wouldn't do so. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=246.0s)]
*  But anyway that's what it is by and large. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=254.0s)]
*  And since then we have made great strides in that movement and it's much bigger movement than it was. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=257.0s)]
*  And in consequence the sort of battle lines have been drawn but it's got more intense. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=263.0s)]
*  And it's slightly less gentlemanly sport than it was 16 years ago in my experience. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=272.0s)]
*  So 16 years ago you were allowed to have different opinions about conflicts. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=279.0s)]
*  Well no but nobody knew about the conflict. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=286.0s)]
*  It was largely unknown that there was a problem at all in the Holy Land. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Certainly by most of the public in this country and where I'm from in the UK as well and in me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=296.0s)]
*  I mean I had accepted back in 2005 or six one of those years to do a gig in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=304.0s)]
*  I was asked in the middle of a European tour. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=313.0s)]
*  Hey Rog they want you to go and do a gig in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=315.0s)]
*  Is that and I went you know I didn't I didn't think twice about it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=318.0s)]
*  So that's where I was then. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=322.0s)]
*  So I'm not blaming people for not having known about designers projects since 1948 and everything that had happened. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=324.0s)]
*  Although I was vaguely aware of the Yom Kippur war the 67 war and the 75 war and so on and so forth. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=332.0s)]
*  I knew a little bit about the history but I wasn't really au fait. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=341.0s)]
*  And that's how I learned because as soon as I said I would do that gig I started to receive emails from supporters of BDS. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=346.0s)]
*  Although it was only five or six months old at the time mainly from North Africa to start with. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=356.0s)]
*  But then I got an email from Omar Guti who is who was one of the sort of founding forces behind the beginnings of BDS. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=361.0s)]
*  And he tried to persuade me to cancel the gig in high combat which had sold out of course in a few minutes you know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=373.0s)]
*  And eventually I was persuaded to cancel that gig. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=381.0s)]
*  But as an act of compromise as I thought I feel as if I'm repeating a speech that I've all made already which I am. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=386.0s)]
*  I've said this often before anyway. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=397.0s)]
*  So I moved the gig to an ecumenical agricultural community called Wahat As-Salam in Arabic and translated into Hebrew it's Nevi Shalom. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=400.0s)]
*  So something about peace where Muslims and Christians and Druze and atheists and all live together in a community [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=413.0s)]
*  and all their children all go to the same school and they all mix together and they live peacefully and grow chickpeas mainly. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=424.0s)]
*  As an example to the rest of us if you like. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=431.0s)]
*  So we did a gig there in the open air and it was huge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=434.0s)]
*  Sixty thousand Israelis came. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=440.0s)]
*  What I didn't realize at the time of course was of course they were all Israelis because Palestinians aren't allowed to travel. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=444.0s)]
*  So there couldn't be any Palestinians there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=449.0s)]
*  They would need special permission you know to cross through checkpoints and things which they wouldn't get. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=452.0s)]
*  So we did this gig and at the end of it and it was lovely. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=458.0s)]
*  They were extremely enthusiastic. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=464.0s)]
*  They knew the work very well and it was very pink fly and all of that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=466.0s)]
*  And lovely food backstage and it was a warm summer evening. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=474.0s)]
*  At the end of it I thought I'm going to say something. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=478.0s)]
*  It was euphoric at the end of the gig. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=481.0s)]
*  And I said so I made a little speech and I went you are the generation of young Israelis who need to make peace with your neighbors. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=484.0s)]
*  Start talking to the Palestinian authority and the blah blah blah and whatever and they went from Pink Floyd to nothing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=494.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=503.0s)]
*  It was like steel shutters had come down behind the eyeballs of every one of those 60,000 young Israelis. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=504.0s)]
*  They were gone. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=512.0s)]
*  And I was staggered by that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=515.0s)]
*  And I was really shocked really really really shocked. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=520.0s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=524.0s)]
*  And I saw it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=525.0s)]
*  I went back the next year and traveled extensively in the occupied territories until you go there and you see it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=526.0s)]
*  You cannot believe what a shock it is. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=533.0s)]
*  You know things that you wouldn't believe possible anywhere on the world like different roads for people with different religion. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=537.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=544.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=545.0s)]
*  Yeah really. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=546.0s)]
*  Can you imagine you're going from Austin to Dallas and you can only go on the road if you're Christian. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=547.0s)]
*  If you're not a Christian you can't go on the road. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=556.0s)]
*  So if you're if you're atheist or some other thing you're not allowed to drive on the road. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=560.0s)]
*  You have to go on back roads and they're mainly and they're all filled up with boulders and there are checkpoints everywhere. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=565.0s)]
*  So the local indigenous people are not allowed to use the roads. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=571.0s)]
*  And you see that and when you see it you think I don't believe this but you get to believe it as you drive around and all the checkpoints and they have to go this way. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=576.0s)]
*  Only people with yellow license plates can go through here which means that they're Jewish Israelis. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=586.0s)]
*  And it's mind-numbingly fills you with despair when you see it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=592.0s)]
*  You think how can this possibly be happening? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=601.0s)]
*  You know this is it's 2007 or whenever it was. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=604.0s)]
*  How can this be happening in the world and nobody where I live knows about it? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=608.0s)]
*  Or if they do they don't care how can they not care? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=613.0s)]
*  And I say you might bring it up here and say how would you feel if you weren't a Christian and that meant you couldn't use the road? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=617.0s)]
*  I mean it's so weird that it's hard to get your mind around believing that that is the case but it is. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=625.0s)]
*  And that is why it's called apartheid. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=632.0s)]
*  And in those days you couldn't use the word apartheid in relation to Israel. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=636.0s)]
*  It was completely verboten in 2006. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=641.0s)]
*  You could not use the word. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=645.0s)]
*  You would have been strung up in the press and everywhere else and accused of being a Holocaust denier and this and that and Hitler and whatever. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=647.0s)]
*  Now it's very difficult for anyone to have a conversation about Israel and Palestine without using the word apartheid because it is in the lexicon. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=656.0s)]
*  And the problem is far more in the light and we are looking at it more and there's more information for all of us about it than there was then. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=669.0s)]
*  That is the work that BDS has done and so it has made progress and I'm glad it has because what I desperately hope to live to see is a holy land. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=679.0s)]
*  I don't care what it's called. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=693.0s)]
*  From the River Jordan to the sea where the people all have equal religious and political and social rights. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=696.0s)]
*  All of them equal. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=703.0s)]
*  And so that's what I work for in the movement and maybe we should talk about something else because I'm if you wind me up I might. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=705.0s)]
*  Well I'd be happy to wind you up. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=715.0s)]
*  I mean the definition of apartheid is yes it is. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=717.0s)]
*  It's segregation. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=720.0s)]
*  I mean that is segregation clearly. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=723.0s)]
*  What is the oppression of one ethnic group by another ethnic group. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=724.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=727.0s)]
*  For those reasons for the fact that they're different ethnic group. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=728.0s)]
*  So the South African model clearly applies except that the South Africans who survived the South African model all say that the Israeli model is far worse than the white South African model was the white South Africans at least tried to build. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=732.0s)]
*  Well they tried. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=749.0s)]
*  They've poured money in for a start trying to keep the black population quiet which they failed to do. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=750.0s)]
*  But both Desmond Tutu before he sadly died and Mandela obviously as well both came out completely and said this is a lot worse than all conditions were in South Africa before apartheid. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=757.0s)]
*  So just discussing this and having compassion for the plight of the Palestinian people that made them categorize you as anti-Semitic. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=769.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=778.0s)]
*  Did anyone have and I'm sure someone must have talked to you about this segregation. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=779.0s)]
*  Did anyone have any kind of argument that they wanted to bring to you as for any justification of that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=784.0s)]
*  You mean from the Israelis. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=791.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=792.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=793.0s)]
*  That's why they call me anti-Semitic. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=794.0s)]
*  That's why they label anyone who criticizes the apartheid policies of the state of Israel without criticizing the Jewish religion or any Jewish person. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=796.0s)]
*  I mean the fact that a lot of the people who are in the government are of the Jewish faith means that they can somehow feel they can conflate criticism of the apartheid policies with the general criticism of an anti-Semitic criticism of the Jewish people or people. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=808.0s)]
*  Well they nice try fellas but it won't wash. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=826.0s)]
*  That's not what it is. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=831.0s)]
*  And most of us who get labeled as anti-Semites are not. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=832.0s)]
*  And like Jeremy Corbyn for instance the guy who was removed from the Labour Party in England on the grounds that he was accused of being anti-Semitic. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=837.0s)]
*  He's left wing and he's pro-Palestinian pro the idea that they should have human rights. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=849.0s)]
*  The Palestinian people who after all the huge majority of the indigenous people in the Holy Land back in the start of the 20th century before the start of the Zionist enterprise which didn't really get going until 1920 although the idea was happening in the late 19th century in the 1880s and 1890s. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=856.0s)]
*  I can't remember the guy's name now but he was a Russian who thought up the idea of a return to the promised land as it's called. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=885.0s)]
*  Out of all the people that perform music and travel and are as prominent as you are you're probably one of the most outspoken and informed when it comes to issues on foreign policy and human rights. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=896.0s)]
*  When did this become a big part of your life and when did discussing this publicly become a big part of your life? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=911.0s)]
*  Well it became a big part of my life the day my father died I think. I mean I wouldn't know because I was only five months old. My father as you might or may not know died at Anzio on the 18th of February 1944 and I was born September 43 so I was only a few months old. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=920.0s)]
*  But when I started to understand some of this was when he didn't come home and start picking me up from school when I was a little kid and then all through my childhood I was brought up by my mother, my brother, my big brother John and I were brought up single handed by my mum who was a school teacher but she was also very left wing. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=941.0s)]
*  She's an interesting woman because she came from a very kind of middle class family in London. Funny enough they lived in Golders Green which was sort of well known for being a Jewish community in North London. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=970.0s)]
*  Her father ran a business that was sort of middle man in fancy goods, toys and things like that so there was a big warehouse in London. But my mother went and she went off to a boarding school, girls school so she was very brought up in a very fairly straight laced English Christian middle class way. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=985.0s)]
*  She then trained as a teacher and her first teacher training was in a town called Bradford which is in the north of England, far north of England in Yorkshire. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  And it was a huge eye opener to her. There she was, first winter comes along, it's really cold, there's a foot of snow on the floor and she suddenly notices that half the kids in her class are walking to school with no shoes. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1023.0s)]
*  And something went bing. This would have been in 1935, 36 something like that. And she suddenly went what? And she started to look into social conditions there in the industrial north. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  And even then in the mid to late 30s she understood that there were inequalities in the context of the society that she lived in that she felt a personal need to do something about and she became extremely left wing. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1057.0s)]
*  Anyway, cut to later on. So our front room was always a Labour Party committee room and she was always off in the evenings canvassing elections and dragging me and my brother to British China Friendship Association meetings in the evening. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  But she was always very careful and clear with us that she would, I remember one day she said to me and my brother when we'd come back from a meeting, interestingly enough at the Friends Meeting House which is the place the Quakers meet, wherever it is in the world it's always called the Friends Meeting House. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1095.0s)]
*  And we'd been watching films of K-pop clad Chinese soldiers fighting against Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist puppet government and blah blah blah blah blah blah. And she said you know where we've been tonight don't you Roger? And I said no. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  And she said we've been at the Friends Meeting House that is where the Quakers meet. She said well as you know I'm an atheist so I can't subscribe to their religious beliefs but I will say this they are very very good people. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1131.0s)]
*  That's stuck with me. I can still recount that story now because it's so important. You don't have to subscribe to people's beliefs. You can, I can be a radical atheist and you can be a Hindu. The important thing is that we're good people. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1146.0s)]
*  That we have hearts and that we care about our brothers and sisters and my mum did. I'm going to tell you one more mum story and then I'll stop about mum because this is the most important bit. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1163.0s)]
*  I was 13 years old. I had just gone through a phase where I suddenly realised I was going to die. I don't know if all adolescents have this existential crisis in their young, in early puberty but I did. And I thought F me. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1177.0s)]
*  Am I going to die? This is scary as shit. It might have been that or it might have been something else but anyway something was worrying me and it was probably more some kind of political thing that I'd latched onto maybe through her. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  And she looked at me and she said alright I'm going to give you some advice now. Come on then mum. All through your life you're going to be faced with difficult questions and you're going to have to figure things out. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  This is my advice. When anything crops up, so it could be Israel Powerstone, it could be anything, it doesn't matter what it is, you must read, read, read, read, read. That's what Smokonish was telling me. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  He hadn't. He'd only read one side. That's the difference between Michael Smokonish and me. I've tried to look at all sides of these things so I know a bit more what I'm talking about. Anyway she said read, read, read. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1240.0s)]
*  And very important, learn everything you can about the subject that's troubling you. And importantly look at it from both sides. If there's another opinion make sure you study that as well. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1252.0s)]
*  It'll take some time, it'll be hard work, but when you've done that the work is over. You have done all the heavy lifting. The rest of it is easy. And I went, what is the rest of it mum? And she looked at me and she said the rest of it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  Well that's simple. You do the right thing. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1283.0s)]
*  Sounds like you're an amazing mum. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1289.0s)]
*  Amazing, amazing. Imagine giving, every young adolescent should be given that advice by a parent or someone they respect. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1291.0s)]
*  Because it's, that's been jangling around in my head ever since. Not every day but very often I remember it. And I tell it to anybody who cares to listen as well. Because it was so important. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1300.0s)]
*  It's incredibly important and not said nearly enough. It's rare. That's what's amazing. Like it sound, it resonates. It sounds so powerful and true and yet rare. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1316.0s)]
*  Yeah but what happens then, if we're sitting down the pub and I tell you that story and we've got all night, one of us will have another drink and then we might start talking about the philosophical implications of how you decide what's the right thing to do. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  Because some bloke listening to this wherever, it doesn't matter where they are, who's Zionist and who believes in the Zionist enterprise in Israel and in the Occupy Territory, in fact in the whole of the promised land, let's call it the promised land. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  It's dangerous to call it the promised land because then you start getting biblical. Promised? Who was it promised to? I was promised to the Israelis. Whoa, sorry I didn't mean the promised land, I meant the Middle East. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1364.0s)]
*  What do you mean the Middle East? That was made up by Sykes and Pico after the First World War. So but you do get into the thing of wow, now this really is a fascinating conversation. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1377.0s)]
*  The right thing to do should we start talking about now and what's going on in the world now and what the right thing to do might be. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1390.0s)]
*  I mean you said a few minutes ago that I've been a bit controversial, particularly recently. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  And part of the controversy is about the Ukraine and what's the right thing to do. All I've done about the Ukraine is to try to lend what little weight I have to put that tiny bit of power I have in my shoulder to the wheel of encouraging anybody I can get to listen to stop the war, including Putin. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1407.0s)]
*  I've written to Putin, I wrote to Putin four or five days ago because people were saying, why don't you tell Putin he, well just hold on a minute. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  If you want to join this conversation you have to do a bit of research. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1443.0s)]
*  Well, you don't have to, obviously. You can believe. But you should. You should. It would be wise. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  If you took my mother's advice, you would before you expressed an opinion about what's the right thing to do. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  And also when you're thinking about it, if you want my advice, you will constantly put yourselves in the position of that young Ukrainian man or woman on the front line and that young Russian man or woman in the front line and their parents and their uncles and aunts and their brothers and sisters and the misery and pain. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  And the lack of anything good at the end. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1483.0s)]
*  And the more and the more it escalates, the more we send arms, the more Putin, the less. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1488.0s)]
*  The only thing that they can do is start to talk to one another, just like JFK and Nikita Khrushchev did in 1962. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was kept secret for years and years afterwards because JFK didn't want to look like a wimp. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  He didn't want to look as if he'd, but he did. He and Nikita Khrushchev spoke on the telephone often. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1517.0s)]
*  And at the end of it, they did a quid pro quo deal where JFK said, I'll take all our medium range missiles out of Turkey and wherever else it was. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1524.0s)]
*  Turkey was the main one. If you take your missiles out of Cuba. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  So they put their hands across the ocean and shook hands and that was the end of it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1539.0s)]
*  And they did it. And they kept their word. They kept their word to that bargain. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1544.0s)]
*  And that led on to the later conversations between Reagan and Gorbachev and the nonproliferation treaties and all the other things that made our planet a little bit safer from the possibility of nuclear catastrophe. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  Not safe, but a little bit until now. And now by the second, it gets more and more and more and more dangerous as this thing is allowed to escalate. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1563.0s)]
*  So I'm making my position entirely. All I'm interested in is a ceasefire and for talks to begin. That's all. Nothing else. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1576.0s)]
*  What did you say to Putin when you wrote to him? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1583.0s)]
*  I said that friends of mine think that I said, I need to pull the letter up if you want to really hear it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1586.0s)]
*  But sure. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1594.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  I tell you one thing I said before I pull it up because it will take a minute. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1598.0s)]
*  Was that I said some friends of mine, because I have a guitar playing friend in England who wrote to me, why are you trying to suggest peace and a ceasefire? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  This man has to be, he's a monster. He's going to invade Poland and then he'll invade the rest of Europe. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1610.0s)]
*  And then and unless we stand up to him now, we're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1618.0s)]
*  will start World War III. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  We know that the Ukraine situation is complicated, and it's been 20 years in the making, and it's, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1650.44s)]
*  well, I won't go into the American end of it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1658.92s)]
*  I mean, I will. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1662.52s)]
*  If you've got a minute, I will. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've got plenty of time. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1665.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  I had Tulsi Gabbard on the other day. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1668.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1669.56s)]
*  She's great. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1670.56s)]
*  Good. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1671.56s)]
*  We discussed this very thing, and we discussed the United States when they orchestrated a [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1672.56s)]
*  coup in Ukraine and how NATO has been moving their weapons closer and closer to the Russian [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1679.8799999999999s)]
*  line. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1687.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1688.24s)]
*  And that this is instigating. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1689.24s)]
*  And they've been saying all along, you're breaking the agreement that was made between [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1691.6s)]
*  Baker, who was Secretary of State in 1990, and Gorbachev, where Gorbachev said, okay, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1696.28s)]
*  I will agree to the reunification of Germany so long as NATO doesn't move one inch closer [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1702.56s)]
*  to the Russian border than the eastern borders of Germany. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1707.92s)]
*  And they went, fine, agreed. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1711.08s)]
*  And they've reneged on it completely since then. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1713.2s)]
*  I think what was very important in the conversation that you had with CNN is not that Russia is [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1715.16s)]
*  good and that we should support Russia. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1720.0s)]
*  There was none of that. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1724.42s)]
*  What you were essentially saying was that we have to be honest about what the United [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1725.5s)]
*  States has done. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1729.48s)]
*  And that narrative is never discussed. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1731.02s)]
*  When he was talking about the dangers of China, and you brought up the fact that China hasn't [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1733.42s)]
*  invaded anyone in over 100 years. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1737.46s)]
*  How can you say that when you know about all the interventionist foreign policy decisions [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1740.44s)]
*  that the United States has made overseas, and you look at what China has done? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1745.14s)]
*  Well they have actually. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1748.74s)]
*  They invaded Tibet in 1959. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1749.74s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1751.54s)]
*  That's true. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1752.54s)]
*  It's a huge thing and it's something that I'm going to bring up because it's something [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1753.6599999999999s)]
*  I've only learned about recently. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1757.58s)]
*  Finally enough, I learned about it from my friend Eric Rappert, who's a very well-known [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1759.18s)]
*  chef in New York. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1763.8999999999999s)]
*  And he's a Buddhist. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1765.82s)]
*  And so he travels to Bhutan at least once a year. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1767.44s)]
*  And he was recently in India having meetings with people who were... [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1771.02s)]
*  And we were talking about it, about the predicament of the Tibetan people. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1777.22s)]
*  What I never understood was that Tibet is one third of the land area of China. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1782.8200000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1789.8200000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1790.8200000000002s)]
*  You didn't know either. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1791.8200000000002s)]
*  Is that big? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1792.8200000000002s)]
*  Apparently, yeah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1793.8200000000002s)]
*  And I haven't... [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1794.8200000000002s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1795.8200000000002s)]
*  I haven't yet kind of... [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1796.8200000000002s)]
*  Look, this was a few days ago. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1797.8200000000002s)]
*  I haven't checked it all out and looked on the map. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1798.8200000000002s)]
*  But yes. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1802.3400000000001s)]
*  I would have never imagined. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1803.3400000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1804.3400000000001s)]
*  But when you think, why the hell did they... [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1805.3400000000001s)]
*  Who wants, you know, hundreds of square miles of mountains and things? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1807.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, the Chinese, because it's not just mountains, it's water, which is hugely important. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1812.14s)]
*  The Himalayas, all the glacial streams, they feed water, not just to India, okay, and Pakistan, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1818.38s)]
*  but also to the northeast of the whole of China as well. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1827.3000000000002s)]
*  Plus, apparently, and not surprisingly, it's packed with everything that you make chips [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1834.3000000000002s)]
*  out of. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1840.82s)]
*  Of course. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1841.82s)]
*  It's packed and packed with this absolute... [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1842.82s)]
*  I nearly said it's a gold mine. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1845.7s)]
*  Well, it's not a gold mine. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1847.22s)]
*  It's a mineral mine. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1848.42s)]
*  It's a mineral mine. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1849.42s)]
*  It's everything that everybody who cares about making money in the world desperately needs [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1850.42s)]
*  and wants. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1855.9s)]
*  So it's a fascinating subject. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1858.42s)]
*  Well, particularly China, right? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1860.42s)]
*  Because China's so involved in the Congo and extracting these minerals. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1862.1s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1865.1s)]
*  But to their credit, they didn't invade and kill everybody like the Europeans did back [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1866.4599999999998s)]
*  in the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th century. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1872.1s)]
*  They actually went, you know, would you like to borrow some money? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1876.4599999999998s)]
*  Which is more of an American ploy. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1880.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's more of a kind of modern way. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1882.3799999999999s)]
*  And if people... [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1885.5s)]
*  And who knows what they do if the people say, nope, no thank you, we're good. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1886.9399999999998s)]
*  But they said thank you. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1892.58s)]
*  They said thank you, yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1893.58s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1894.58s)]
*  You know, yeah, should they be... [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1896.06s)]
*  Yeah, of course they should. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1898.6999999999998s)]
*  They should be allowed to do business with whoever they want. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1899.6999999999998s)]
*  I believe in the idea of what's called free trade up to that point. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1902.34s)]
*  There has to be a fair crack of the whip of everybody. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1909.22s)]
*  And by and large, when multinational corporations want to invest in underdeveloped countries, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1912.06s)]
*  they want to do it on their terms. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1919.78s)]
*  And they don't want the people who live there to get anything out of it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1922.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I've been involved in a court battle for at least 10 years now with Chevron because [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1925.94s)]
*  of the pollution that they caused in the Amazon. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1932.3000000000002s)]
*  In northeast Ecuador with a friend of mine called Steve Donsiger who was sent to prison [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1936.94s)]
*  for acting on behalf of these people. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1945.7s)]
*  I know I'm digressing. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1948.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, the Donsiger case is atrocious. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1950.02s)]
*  It's a terrifying case because there's no reason why they had that man in prison. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1953.3s)]
*  And there's no reason why they keep him under house arrest. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1958.4599999999998s)]
*  Well, there is a reason. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1961.02s)]
*  Yeah, right, but no righteous... [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1962.02s)]
*  No legal reason. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1964.3s)]
*  No legal reason. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1965.3s)]
*  No. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1966.3s)]
*  Righteous, that's interesting because that comes back to my mother and doing the right [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1967.3s)]
*  thing. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1971.62s)]
*  Obviously, the right thing to do, if you were the law in the United States, would be to [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1972.6599999999999s)]
*  look at the facts of the matter and come to the conclusion that Chevron should give the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1978.78s)]
*  $9.5 billion to the people whose lives they've destroyed making money. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1985.5s)]
*  Or Texaco was the company who actually did it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1991.1s)]
*  But things being what they are, that's not the way the law works. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1994.6599999999999s)]
*  The law operates to support whoever can afford it, actually, which in this case is Chevron. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=1998.3s)]
*  They still haven't paid a penny and they're still fighting and they will go on fighting. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2004.3s)]
*  And speaking of somebody who's supporting the other side, who doesn't have bottomless [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2009.98s)]
*  pockets, it's hard. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2013.66s)]
*  It's hard to find that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2016.3s)]
*  The amount of money that they spend on it is... [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2018.62s)]
*  Because they're worried of a domino effect that if they lose this case, then they're [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2022.94s)]
*  going to lose the case in Nigeria and they're going to lose the case in Australia and suddenly [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2027.54s)]
*  they can see the whole pack of cards beginning to collapse. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2032.58s)]
*  Well, it should collapse. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2035.58s)]
*  Pay up. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2036.74s)]
*  You've made enough profits out of the indigenous people all over the world. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2037.74s)]
*  Which is a scary precedent that they were able to arrest Dawson Girl like that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2042.66s)]
*  That they were able to keep him in jail the way they did it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2046.26s)]
*  Yeah, and it was completely corrupt. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2049.1s)]
*  Back in 2014, they produced a RICO trial, which is organized crime. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2052.42s)]
*  It's regulations or something against organized crime. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2058.5s)]
*  So they pretended he was a gangster on a fraudulent mission and they brought this case in the [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2063.1s)]
*  Southern District of New York. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2068.58s)]
*  Incredible that they could do it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2072.54s)]
*  Incredible that the media is ignoring it too. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2075.54s)]
*  This isn't something that people are absolutely outraged about. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2078.18s)]
*  Isn't the media ignoring it? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2081.34s)]
*  On the media with the possible exception of you. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2083.6200000000003s)]
*  And some others who have great podcasts as well, but are independent of the mainstream [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2087.2200000000003s)]
*  media. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2092.1000000000004s)]
*  The media only has one message, which is support the status quo. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2093.1000000000004s)]
*  All of us work for whoever it may be and we don't need to get all conspiracy theory about [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2098.38s)]
*  secret societies. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2105.46s)]
*  We know it's the very, very wealthy half of 1% who tell everybody what to do. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2106.54s)]
*  They're called the ruling class because they are the ruling class. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  And we all do what we're told by the media, who by and large repeat the same mantra over [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2118.7s)]
*  and over again. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2124.2599999999998s)]
*  So it's a bit tricky. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2126.3s)]
*  Yeah, well the media has failed in their objective dissemination of information. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2128.3s)]
*  That doesn't exist anymore. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2134.98s)]
*  They're bought and paid by the advertisers and the advertisers are enormously powerful. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2136.8199999999997s)]
*  And so things like that that are inconvenient realities, like the Dozinger trial, that just [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2142.3799999999997s)]
*  swept under the rug. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2149.0s)]
*  Which it should be outrageous. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2151.2999999999997s)]
*  It should be something that's on... [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2153.06s)]
*  Well it is outrageous, of course. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2154.74s)]
*  But I did a gig a few weeks ago in DC and played to, I don't know, 16,000 people or [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2157.46s)]
*  something. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2163.14s)]
*  And the next day I dragged myself out of bed and boshed over to the steps of the DOG, knowing [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2164.2599999999998s)]
*  full well what I would find, which is my friend Randy Kragliko and a van with a sign on it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2171.46s)]
*  And about 40 of the same activists I've seen at every gathering in support of Steven Donsiger [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2177.66s)]
*  and his freedom for the last 10 years. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2185.1s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2188.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2189.74s)]
*  And I actually made a little speech that day and was saying, you know, I would be happy [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2191.3399999999997s)]
*  if there were four million of us here. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2196.66s)]
*  And there should be, standing under that memorial, the Washington Memorial in front of the Capitol, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2199.18s)]
*  and saying, what happened to democracy? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2205.1s)]
*  Where is the rule of law that we all pretend we care about? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2208.74s)]
*  Where are the freedoms and liberties and this and that and the other? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2212.9399999999996s)]
*  We've sort of disappeared under a roller coaster of consumerism, you know, as we know. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2218.74s)]
*  So while we're having our little meetings, people are wandering by like, they don't even [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2224.4599999999996s)]
*  know we're there. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2229.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2230.2599999999998s)]
*  And they have no idea what we're there for or what we're talking about. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2231.2599999999998s)]
*  So yeah, it's extremely frustrating. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2235.3399999999997s)]
*  But luckily, there are those 40 or 50 people and they have hearts of gold, all right? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2237.9799999999996s)]
*  And they will not shut up, however few of them there are. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2245.54s)]
*  And luckily, Yoya as well, and I can come on here and talk about these things without [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2249.82s)]
*  being dismissed as a crank or a conspiracy theorist. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2255.5s)]
*  I don't know if you saw, but I did an interview with Rolling Stone because I remember Rolling [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2259.5s)]
*  Stone when it was a magazine that was sort of about rock and roll. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2264.7s)]
*  But it also had a kind of semi-progressive liberal stance to it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2268.7s)]
*  Well, not anymore. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2275.58s)]
*  It's changed hands and well, it doesn't matter. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2277.02s)]
*  I had Yon on yesterday. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2279.66s)]
*  Oh, did you? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2281.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2283.54s)]
*  I miss Yon. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2284.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2286.1s)]
*  He was the heart and soul of that. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2287.1s)]
*  He was the heart and soul of Rolling Stone. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2289.18s)]
*  And he still is a progressive hippie at heart. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2290.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course he is. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2293.54s)]
*  I mean, talking to him yesterday, it's just he bleeds it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2294.54s)]
*  And his daughter is called India, as is mine. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2298.66s)]
*  Mine's a bit older because I remember him coming to me one day and saying, is your daughter [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2302.98s)]
*  called India? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2306.3399999999997s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2307.3399999999997s)]
*  He said, oh. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2308.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the first girl I think of is called India too. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2309.3399999999997s)]
*  Anyway, your Putin letter. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2313.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm not avoiding you. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2316.2599999999998s)]
*  No, I know you're not. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2319.1s)]
*  You just pulled it up. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2320.1s)]
*  I just wanted to keep it on track. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2321.1s)]
*  I just want to see where I can find it. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2322.1s)]
*  I may have to say I know what I'm going to do. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2324.06s)]
*  I'm going to go into Word and search for it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2327.06s)]
*  Do you know if he received this? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2331.06s)]
*  Well it was open. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2335.18s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2336.18s)]
*  I'm sure somebody will have told him about it. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2337.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2339.22s)]
*  I'm absolutely certain. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2340.22s)]
*  But obviously he hasn't responded to it. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2341.22s)]
*  I mean, he is, you know, he's the president of Russia. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2343.22s)]
*  There's no reason why he would. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2348.38s)]
*  So it's not in there. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2351.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2352.2999999999997s)]
*  Let me do a search. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2353.2999999999997s)]
*  Letter. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2354.2999999999997s)]
*  I'll just say letter and see what comes. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2355.7400000000002s)]
*  Open letter to Vladimir Putin. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2358.6600000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2360.9s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2361.9s)]
*  There it is. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2362.9s)]
*  Jamie actually pulled it up on the screen. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2363.9s)]
*  Jamie actually pulled it up here. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2364.9s)]
*  Oh, did she? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2367.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2368.9s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2369.9s)]
*  So, dear President Putin, since the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine on February the [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2370.9s)]
*  24th this year, I've tried to use my small influence to encourage a ceasefire and a diplomatic [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2376.78s)]
*  settlement that addresses the security needs of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2382.26s)]
*  In that endeavor, I've written two open letters to Mrs. Elena Zelenskaya, the wife of the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2388.1800000000003s)]
*  Ukrainian president. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2392.46s)]
*  I can give you those letters as well. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2393.46s)]
*  These letters are readily available on the internet. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2396.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm increasingly asked to write to you too. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2398.1800000000003s)]
*  So here goes. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2400.5800000000004s)]
*  First, would you like to see an end to this war? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2401.5800000000004s)]
*  If you were to reply and say yes, please, that would immediately make things a lot easier. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2405.0200000000004s)]
*  He has, by the way. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2410.0200000000004s)]
*  He said yes, please. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2411.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2412.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2413.78s)]
*  He made a long speech with the accession speech of Donetsk and Lugansk and Kyrgyzstan and [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2414.78s)]
*  the other bit of Ukraine that had the referendum and the people said, can we be part of Russia, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2422.94s)]
*  please? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2431.14s)]
*  Anyway, that's what that's about. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2432.14s)]
*  So, if you were to come out and say, oh, yeah, if you were to come out and say, oh, yeah, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2433.14s)]
*  also, the Russian Federation has no further territorial interest beyond the security of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2441.86s)]
*  the Russian speaking populations of the Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2446.18s)]
*  That would help too. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2450.82s)]
*  I say this because I know some people who think you want to overrun the whole of Europe, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2452.3s)]
*  starting with Poland and the rest of the Baltic states. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2457.18s)]
*  If you do, fuck you. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2460.46s)]
*  And we might as well all stop playing the desperately dangerous game of nuclear chicken [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2462.54s)]
*  that the hawks on both sides of the Atlantic seem so comfortable with and have at it. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2468.3399999999997s)]
*  Yep, just blow each other and the world to smithereens. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2473.94s)]
*  The problem is I have kids and grandkids and so do most of my brothers and sisters all [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2478.18s)]
*  over the world and none of us would relish that outcome. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2482.9s)]
*  So please, Mr. Putin, indulge me and make us that assurance that he hasn't done yet. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2486.66s)]
*  But I have no doubt that it's part and parcel of what he is now saying publicly. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2492.62s)]
*  All right, back to the table. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2497.98s)]
*  If I've read your previous speeches correctly, would you like to negotiate a state of neutrality [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2499.82s)]
*  for a sovereign neighboring Ukraine? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2505.26s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2507.34s)]
*  Assuming such a peace could be negotiated, it would have to include an absolute binding [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2508.98s)]
*  agreement not to invade anyone ever again. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2514.2200000000003s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2516.94s)]
*  I know, I know the USA and NATO invade other sovereign nations at the drop of a hat or [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2518.46s)]
*  for a few barrels of oil, but that doesn't mean you should. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2524.54s)]
*  Your invasion of Ukraine took me completely by surprise. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2528.62s)]
*  It was a heinous war of aggression, provoked or not. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2532.1s)]
*  When Mrs. Zelenska replied to me via Twitter, I was very surprised and mightily moved. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2536.94s)]
*  If you were to reply to me, I would mightily respect you for it and take it as an honorable [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2543.22s)]
*  move in the right direction towards a sustainable peace, yours sincerely. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2549.2599999999998s)]
*  So what did Putin say in terms of wanting a resolution? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2554.58s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to look up his accession speech because I'm not going to [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2558.66s)]
*  start trying to quote Putin in translation without some words in front of me because [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2563.7799999999997s)]
*  I could get it wrong. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2569.58s)]
*  He said one thing that could be seen as combative, which I can remember, he said, he said, I [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2572.98s)]
*  want to come to the table, I want to ceasefire, I want to negotiate peace, not dictate peace, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2579.46s)]
*  negotiate peace with the Ukraine, with Zelenska. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2586.58s)]
*  He said, but the will of the people in the Donetsk, Lubansk, Kyrgyzstan and whatever [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2592.42s)]
*  the one is whose name I can't remember, is in violet. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2599.74s)]
*  That is not up for discussion. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2603.18s)]
*  Zelenska in response said, I will not negotiate with Russia until Putin has been removed. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2605.74s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2615.7s)]
*  And you go, Mr. President, Zelenska, are you, I mean, that's, that really is. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2617.1s)]
*  That's an insane thing to say. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2623.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's poking in the eye with a sharp stick and it's not helpful at all. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2625.42s)]
*  No. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2629.98s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2630.98s)]
*  It's also not likely to happen. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2631.98s)]
*  I think it's extremely unlikely. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2634.3s)]
*  There's nothing unites people more than an existential attack upon what they consider [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2636.1800000000003s)]

*  as my mother would say. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2664.2599999999998s)]
*  My mother used to say that about the Americans because she came here for two years on an [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2665.34s)]
*  exchange when she was a student and she spent the summer near Akron in Ohio at a Girl Scout [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2670.3s)]
*  camp and then she spent another few months in Texas. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2679.54s)]
*  So that was her thing. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2682.38s)]
*  And I'll never forget, she used to say to me, you know, Roger, the Americans, they're [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2684.0600000000004s)]
*  really very interesting people. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2692.94s)]
*  He said they're very good people. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2694.82s)]
*  They're very good hearted people. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2697.14s)]
*  They look after you. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2700.5s)]
*  They're very, very hospitable and very, very good in that way. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2701.5s)]
*  She said, but they are also very naive. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2706.02s)]
*  And I thought, wow, I mean, this is from years and years and years ago. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2710.3399999999997s)]
*  I wrote a poem. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2715.06s)]
*  I'm going to show I'm going to show this. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2716.06s)]
*  I pulled this up earlier. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2718.06s)]
*  So if you don't mind, please, there's a poem that pertains to this that I wrote. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2719.44s)]
*  How do I find this? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2725.1s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2728.1s)]
*  Oh, brilliant. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2731.1s)]
*  I found it immediately. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2732.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2735.1s)]
*  So I was I wrote this just after G.W. Bush was elected for the second time. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2739.1s)]
*  And it's just called America. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2751.46s)]
*  It used to be called Why Cannot the Good Prevail? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2753.56s)]
*  I need to wet my whistle. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2756.16s)]
*  Or I should run out of spittle before I get to the good bits. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2761.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2765.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can keep those. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2766.0s)]
*  OK, here we go. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2768.0s)]
*  It's short. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2771.0s)]
*  America Why cannot the good prevail? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2774.56s)]

*  Wow. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2880.56s)]
*  It makes me almost emotional to read that because I wrote that 18 years ago now. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2883.16s)]
*  But the idea of a younger generation coming up and saying enough with this bullshit. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2889.0s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2894.92s)]
*  This is who we are. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2896.92s)]
*  We are the good neighbor to rebuild the barn. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2898.6s)]
*  That's who we want to be. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2901.68s)]
*  I think the young people do have good hearts and good intentions. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2905.52s)]
*  The narrative is so cloudy and it's so difficult to sort out what's actually going on versus [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2912.44s)]
*  what you're being told that people just sort of lose interest in it, except for the very [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2918.84s)]
*  few that are very driven and very disciplined and really do spend the time to look at things. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2924.36s)]
*  Those people ultimately usually wind up becoming activists or very involved at least. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2929.92s)]
*  Many of them cling to their activism till their dying day, like me for instance. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2937.44s)]
*  But I know so many. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2943.16s)]
*  And they're men and women that you just want to hug. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2945.64s)]
*  You just want to go, oh my god, you're so dogged but also brave. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2950.64s)]
*  And you've got such a big heart that you care about people enough to make a fuss. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2960.84s)]
*  It makes a difference. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2967.8s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't feel like it does, but that signal does get out there. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2969.48s)]
*  And the people that have that signal, as small as their audience might be, occasionally that [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2975.48s)]
*  signal will reach someone else and they'll spread it. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2982.76s)]
*  It's like, I mean this is alright. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2988.08s)]
*  Luckily we've got time. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2991.2799999999997s)]
*  We've got all the time in the world. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2992.56s)]
*  Which is huge because that jogs a bit of my brain that wants to say, gone then, if you [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=2994.0s)]
*  could paint a picture of the future, what might it include? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3001.12s)]
*  What would be the first step? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3004.6s)]
*  You're the king of everything. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3006.2s)]
*  What's the first thing that you do tomorrow? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3008.56s)]
*  You've got to take money out of politics, number one. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3010.6s)]
*  Citizens United, gone. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3014.12s)]
*  Number one, take money out of politics. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3016.6s)]
*  Because the decisions that are being made are not being made in the best interest of [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3018.52s)]
*  the people, they're being made in the best interest in the people who have money. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3021.68s)]
*  Quite right. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3025.88s)]
*  Well I'm with you on that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3026.88s)]
*  That's the number one thing. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3027.88s)]
*  That's the number one reason why we get involved in wars that we have no business in. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3028.88s)]
*  I mean Eisenhower warned us about that when he was leaving office with that speech about [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3034.88s)]
*  the military industrial complex. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3038.92s)]
*  I don't know if you noticed, because I sent you a stick of my show, but before we do the [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3040.72s)]
*  song Sheep, the last thing, it says, Orwell was right to warn us in Brave New World in [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3045.8s)]
*  1984, and Aldous Huxley was right to warn us of the coming dystopia in, yeah, no, Aldous [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3051.6000000000004s)]
*  Huxley in Brave New World. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3058.6000000000004s)]
*  And Dwight D. Eisenhower was right to warn us in his military industrial speech. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3060.4s)]
*  I was right to warn us in my song Sheep. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3066.0s)]
*  And then we play it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3070.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3071.48s)]
*  Well I'm really excited to see your show tomorrow night, but one of the things that's so cool [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3072.8s)]
*  about your show is that you do, you have all of these messages that are tied into the music, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3076.36s)]
*  and you have this incredible visual accoutrement, this gigantic thing that goes along with your [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3084.28s)]
*  show. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3091.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3092.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's, yeah, there's no question that visually and sonically it's impressive, and [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3093.88s)]
*  also I use my, almost, that's not my whole body of work, but a small bit of things that [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3100.08s)]
*  go back to the beginning of when I started writing songs and things, so we play about [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3106.4s)]
*  half of Dark Side of the Moon and, but of course all the stuff from Dark Side of the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3111.52s)]
*  Moon, it was all about the same stuff that I'm banging on about now, so it's all kind [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3116.08s)]
*  of, it's all very relevant, but I'm very interested in what you said, I'd like to pursue that, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3121.2799999999997s)]
*  because you're so right about that. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3127.6s)]
*  Alright, what's the second thing? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3129.36s)]
*  Well money in politics is number one, right? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3131.7999999999997s)]
*  So the only reason why people would get involved in politics without money is to try to make [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3134.96s)]
*  the world a better place, and you would, I think you would, you would recruit more people [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3140.12s)]
*  that have good intentions, and you would make it less attractive to people that are just [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3146.52s)]
*  looking to make money. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3151.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3152.72s)]
*  I mean you look at what's going on, like Nancy Pelosi just shot down this thing where [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3153.72s)]
*  it bans Congress from trading in stocks, she shot down something to ban insider trading, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3157.6000000000004s)]
*  well there's only one reason to do that, because you want to keep making money insider trading. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3162.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3166.6000000000004s)]
*  You're talking about a woman who's on the last days of her life, who's worth hundreds [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3167.6000000000004s)]
*  of millions of dollars, like why do you give a shit lady? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3170.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3173.76s)]
*  Like you talk about lost in the game. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3174.76s)]
*  Well maybe because she's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3176.36s)]
*  Well you got your money. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3179.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3181.88s)]
*  You've got it all, like how are you even going to spend all that? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3182.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3185.96s)]
*  She's 80 something years old, right? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3186.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3188.96s)]
*  If you're lucky would you get 20 years left? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3189.96s)]
*  But how any of them? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3191.96s)]
*  You get 200 million dollars? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3192.96s)]
*  It's not about spending, it's about power. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3193.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3196.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3197.48s)]
*  I gather you spoke to Zuckerberg a few weeks ago. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3198.48s)]
*  Zuckerberg, Bezos, Gates, I don't care who they are, they're hugely rich American oligarchs, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3201.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm sure it's true of Russian oligarchs and Chinese oligarchs, they amass the huge amounts [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3209.1600000000003s)]
*  of money because it gives them power. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3213.7999999999997s)]
*  Then they buy newspapers and television stations and whatever, so they become part of the system [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3215.7999999999997s)]
*  of propaganda to keep us all in line. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3223.04s)]
*  And I actually wrote a sketch about, I know you're in comedy, I wrote a sketch about Zuckerberg, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3228.3999999999996s)]
*  unfortunately it's not in the show. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3237.44s)]
*  But I'll tell you what it was because it's unlikely that it'll get into the show now [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3243.92s)]
*  and I was writing it about being down here. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3247.52s)]
*  The show originally when I wrote it was about them up there in the cloud and I actually [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3251.28s)]
*  had a city on a cloud floating about, it's gone now, it's now a penthouse so it's attached [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3256.12s)]
*  in the show. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3261.12s)]
*  And I write about them up there, the oligarchs up there, they're up there in the penthouse [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3263.84s)]
*  now and one of them is Zuckerberg. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3268.2000000000003s)]
*  So I wrote a little sketch and it's about, go away! [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3270.04s)]
*  And then the door opens and a flunky comes in and it's Zuckerberg and he's sitting there [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3282.08s)]
*  at his desk in front of his computer working and he goes, get out! [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3285.92s)]
*  I don't know if he speaks, I'm sure he doesn't speak like that because I've heard him speak [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3292.16s)]
*  and he's a bit self-spoken. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3295.4s)]
*  Yeah he's very self-spoken. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3296.88s)]
*  And the flunky says, but sir, Mr. Zuckerberg sir, it's really important, I have to speak [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3299.12s)]
*  to you. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3304.12s)]
*  And then he tries again and Zuckerberg's just screaming out. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3306.16s)]
*  I think Zuckerberg at one point says, I've told you never to interrupt me when I'm grading [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3308.96s)]
*  co-eds! [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3314.16s)]
*  See? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3315.16s)]
*  When you're what? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3316.16s)]
*  Grading co-eds. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3317.16s)]
*  Oh. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3318.16s)]
*  Could you grinned at least. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3319.16s)]
*  I like that. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3321.64s)]
*  So whatever. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3322.64s)]
*  And he says, anyway, I'm going to stop acting because I can't use up my voice really, I [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3323.64s)]
*  shouldn't be. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3328.64s)]
*  And the flunky says to him, we've run out of space to store the money. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3330.08s)]
*  And Zuckerberg screams at him, buy another fucking island! [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3336.4s)]
*  Get out! [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3340.24s)]
*  And then he throws his laptop away and it goes through the window and comes down and [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3341.24s)]
*  lands in the Netherlands. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3345.8799999999997s)]
*  So that was my little sketch and I'm sorry I didn't manage to find a space for it in [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3347.78s)]
*  the show because I kind of like it. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3352.02s)]
*  Do you think it's possible for someone to become that insanely wealthy and not be greedy? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3354.5s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3360.94s)]
*  And you can't do it without killing people actually is my belief. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3363.1400000000003s)]
*  How so? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3367.38s)]
*  Like with Zuckerberg? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3368.38s)]
*  Well I don't know because I don't know the history well enough. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3369.38s)]
*  Well he created this social network and it became wildly popular. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3372.6200000000003s)]
*  And he's now in cahoots with the FBI and the CIA and has cozy meetings with them deciding [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3376.5s)]
*  who to allow to communicate with their brothers and sisters and who to censor. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3382.2599999999998s)]
*  Well we discussed that on the podcast. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3386.74s)]
*  Did you? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3388.22s)]
*  What did he have to say about that? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3389.22s)]
*  Well because I brought up the Hunter Biden story because I brought up censorship in social [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3390.22s)]
*  media and he said that the FBI had contacted Facebook and told them to be wary of a lot [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3393.9s)]
*  of Russian disinformation that was going to happen right before. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3399.86s)]
*  Russiagate! [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3405.14s)]
*  Hooray! [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3406.14s)]
*  It's even invaded our afternoon. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3407.14s)]
*  They can fuck off. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3411.2599999999998s)]
*  Well if I ever hear about Russiagate again, in fact I did hear about it again. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3415.18s)]
*  Where did I... [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3419.62s)]
*  I read something about it. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3421.14s)]
*  Oh that doesn't matter. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3422.74s)]
*  Well the fascinating part of that is that it's not true. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3424.74s)]
*  That's the fascinating part. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3428.06s)]
*  The fascinating part is that there wasn't Russian disinformation in regards to that [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3429.06s)]
*  laptop. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3433.42s)]
*  That's not what was going on. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3434.42s)]
*  It was an actual real laptop from a man who is at the time the vice president's son who [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3435.42s)]
*  had a serious drug problem and was kind of off the rails and he left this laptop at a [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3442.3s)]
*  repair station and it turned out inside that laptop was a bunch of crazy shit. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3447.6200000000003s)]
*  And it's real. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3452.6600000000003s)]
*  And they were saying that this was Russian disinformation which would be the most wildlessly [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3453.94s)]
*  slanderous thing, wildly slanderous thing that Russia has ever done. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3459.06s)]
*  Like create a laptop and fill it with the son of the vice president like pornography [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3464.2599999999998s)]
*  and bribery and all this crazy shit that's supposedly in that laptop. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3470.24s)]
*  So the FBI contacts Facebook and tells them that there's going to be some Russian disinformation [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3475.6s)]
*  leading towards the election. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3483.5s)]
*  And I don't believe he specifically said that that laptop was a part of it but they certainly [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3486.3399999999997s)]
*  were insinuating that. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3492.02s)]
*  And then they decided to limit the engagement that people had with that. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3493.68s)]
*  That's very vague. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3498.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what he was saying when he said that but my perspective was now imagine if [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3499.8799999999997s)]
*  you are him and you're running something like Facebook. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3505.1s)]
*  You are, first of all, you're insanely busy. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3509.06s)]
*  And if you have trust and faith in the FBI and the intelligence agencies, you definitely [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3512.62s)]
*  don't want to be distributing disinformation from a foreign company or a foreign country [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3518.74s)]
*  that's trying to undermine our election. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3523.8599999999997s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3526.48s)]
*  Well, he didn't censor it the way Twitter did, which I think is pretty egregious. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3527.48s)]
*  But what he did do is limit its engagement. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3531.7s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3534.06s)]
*  The problem with that term, like limiting the engagement, like how are you doing that? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3535.5s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3539.66s)]
*  You tell me what you do and they don't. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3540.7s)]
*  They don't tell you what's involved in whatever at least limited engagement protocol they [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3542.7s)]
*  have, whether it's censorship or it's I don't know what you want to call it because you [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3550.46s)]
*  could put it on, you could put that story on your page. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3554.66s)]
*  It would just limit the amount of people who see it. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3558.06s)]
*  But I don't understand how you're doing that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3560.8599999999997s)]
*  And I don't think they want to reveal that either. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3562.98s)]
*  Well, the fact is, in my view, what's really dangerous is that this prick has any hand [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3565.94s)]
*  at all in deciding what any of us read about anything. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3572.38s)]
*  He shouldn't have, he should not have his finger on the delete button on anything that [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3577.82s)]
*  goes through Facebook, in my view. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3582.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, you could say there might be rules that say you can't have people saying [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3584.5800000000004s)]
*  you should go out and murder children. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3589.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3592.42s)]
*  But anything and certainly anything to do with foreign policy, for instance, anything [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3594.42s)]
*  to do with the Ukraine war, you can't have Metta deciding what we should believe about [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3598.38s)]
*  that. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3604.42s)]
*  It's bad enough that the whole of the print section of mainstream media and all television [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3605.42s)]
*  has decided what we should believe about the Ukraine. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3610.06s)]
*  So they're all completely happy to tell us that Russian soldiers have been raping babies [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3614.1800000000003s)]
*  to death. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3620.98s)]
*  You know, and then three days later, you find out that it's unattributable. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3622.02s)]
*  And where did that story come from? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3626.1s)]
*  And it came from some nebulous site somewhere in the Ukraine. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3628.06s)]
*  But nevertheless, it's already been printed and it goes somewhere into the consciousness. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3633.22s)]
*  You build up this thing of this is we can really hate these people enough so that people [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3637.46s)]
*  are now saying we should just kill them all now. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3643.82s)]
*  We should start the nuclear war now. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3646.1s)]
*  A prick on Twitter yesterday said it, Thiemann or something his name. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3649.14s)]
*  I only know that because I've seen the tweets. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3653.02s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3656.9s)]
*  That we should actually go to war? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3657.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3658.9s)]
*  Go to nuclear war and wipe them all out. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3659.9s)]
*  Because he said we've been threatened. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3663.02s)]
*  The only thing to do is to wipe them out now. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3664.9s)]
*  What is this person's position in life? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3667.38s)]
*  I'd have to look it up on Twitter. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3668.9s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3670.74s)]
*  Was it a journalist? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3671.74s)]
*  Was it a? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3672.74s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3673.74s)]
*  Do you know what it is, Jimmy? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3674.74s)]
*  Have a look. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3675.74s)]
*  That's such an insane perspective. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3676.74s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't got my phone. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3677.74s)]
*  I wonder how many people say things like that just to get attention and likes and just to [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3679.4199999999996s)]
*  get views because I think that's a big part of what Twitter is. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3683.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like look at me. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3685.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm going to say something outrageous. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3687.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, you could be right about that. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3688.8599999999997s)]
*  You probably I'm sure you are right. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3690.74s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot of look at me involved in a lot of these posts that go out. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3692.5s)]
*  And also a lot of what will think what will people think of me, which is the whole if [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3698.5s)]
*  you think about it all of this, if it all developed from the beginnings of Facebook [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3703.74s)]
*  and for whatever that site was that Zuckerberg started with grading coeds, that's sort of [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3707.8599999999997s)]
*  the beginning of it and the FOMO and the this and that and sending pictures of yourself [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3714.2999999999997s)]
*  to your friends and caring what your schoolmates think about and all of that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3719.14s)]
*  And it blowing up into something that is far, far, far more important than your mother telling [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3723.5s)]
*  you read as much as you can, get educated, make sure you know what you're talking about [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3730.98s)]
*  and do the right thing, which is because none of them are telling us to do that. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3736.74s)]
*  They're telling you one by if your mother ran Facebook, that would be great. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3740.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the world would genuinely be a better place. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3744.46s)]
*  It would definitely be better, except she'd never do it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3746.74s)]
*  Of course, because she'd go, Roger, if you think I'm going to waste my time with something [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3749.42s)]
*  as flimsy as Facebook, you've got another thing coming, darling. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3753.2599999999998s)]
*  But what I tried to get from him and what I wanted to try to understand is like, what [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3757.3799999999997s)]
*  is it like when you create something that literally is just a social network? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3762.1s)]
*  You're just supposed to be socializing with people and sharing photographs, which is pretty [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3766.54s)]
*  innocuous. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3770.54s)]
*  And then it becomes something that can influence elections and foreign policy and the way the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3771.54s)]
*  world is viewed and the way narratives are spun. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3776.54s)]
*  And it's a daunting task. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3779.54s)]
*  And especially when you didn't set out to do that in the beginning, nor did Twitter. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3782.2599999999998s)]
*  Twitter set out to just be something where you just post, oh, I'm going to the movies [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3786.3s)]
*  today. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3789.5s)]
*  And then it became what it is now because people realize, well, this is a tool to distribute [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3790.5s)]
*  information. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3796.02s)]
*  And you can just put up anything. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3797.22s)]
*  And now should we just limit that information? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3799.58s)]
*  And that's what they've decided to do. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3803.18s)]
*  They've decided to take this moral and ethical position and impose their own ideas on what [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3804.46s)]
*  should or should not be said. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3811.66s)]
*  But all based at some point on their position that they want to go on getting richer and [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3813.94s)]
*  richer and richer. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3819.22s)]
*  And they want matter to be the biggest company in the world and to own everything else. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3820.22s)]
*  And then they really will rule the world. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3824.3s)]
*  That's the I think that's the mental aberration. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3827.2200000000003s)]
*  That's the very technology or excuse me, every corporation. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3831.7400000000002s)]
*  They want to continue growing and getting bigger. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3835.6200000000003s)]
*  And you have shareholders and they demand that you make more money next quarter than [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3838.5400000000004s)]
*  you made this quarter. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3842.46s)]
*  And if you don't, you are not doing your responsibility. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3843.7000000000003s)]
*  Funny enough, there's groups of Chevron shareholders are going to the AGM now and telling them [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3846.6600000000003s)]
*  to pay the indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador the money they owe them [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3851.44s)]
*  because they don't sleep at night. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3856.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, that's great. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3858.28s)]
*  Which is great. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3859.08s)]
*  That is really important. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3860.0s)]
*  Well, that's what you would want from people that have that much fucking money. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3861.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3865.04s)]
*  To say, hey, you know, like I'd rather have a little bit less and be able to sleep. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3865.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3868.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3869.4s)]
*  But you know, if you I've never been to Davos and I never will because the World Economic [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3870.28s)]
*  Forum seems to me to be a can of worms that I don't want to get within. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3875.96s)]
*  That's a scary can of worms. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3880.4s)]
*  We have a photo of Klaus Schwab in the bathroom. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3881.6400000000003s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3883.92s)]
*  The one where he's wearing the crazy outfit where he looks like he's in Star Wars. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3884.84s)]
*  We have a giant metal photo of him. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3888.76s)]
*  He started Davos, right? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3890.32s)]
*  Yeah, he started. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3891.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, he's the one that's, you know, you will own nothing and you'll be happy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3892.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, I read that. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3896.52s)]
*  Well, that's what he is is almost like a character in a movie. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3898.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you would if it was a movie, you would go, well, that's too over the top. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3902.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3905.4s)]
*  There's no way there's a guy with a German accent that's telling the world how to live [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3905.6800000000003s)]
*  and they get all the billionaires to come and meet with him and decide what to do with [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3909.2s)]
*  with the future of food and health care. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3914.12s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3916.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, that Davos, the World Economic Forum is like a bad movie. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3918.16s)]
*  It is. It's like a really badly written Hollywood movie. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3923.3599999999997s)]
*  It's bizarre that you would just go tear it up and throw it away. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3927.12s)]
*  Well, they're all flying there to talk about climate change and private chats. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3930.52s)]
*  I mean, it's so ridiculous. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3933.48s)]
*  Like my friend Bono. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3935.16s)]
*  Yeah. I met him once. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3936.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I met him. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3938.36s)]
*  We're going to tell you I shouldn't tell you. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3940.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to tell you this because it's faintly ironic and people will want to hang me for it [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3941.84s)]
*  because it doesn't well, you can make up your own mind because you might think it's brilliant. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3947.6000000000004s)]
*  And people do sometimes write to me and say, why are you such an asshole? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3953.0s)]
*  Why aren't you more like Bono? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3956.88s)]
*  So here I am. I am going through an FBO. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3959.76s)]
*  So I've just got off a private plane in Zurich. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3962.96s)]
*  And suddenly there's Bono and he sidles up to me and whatever. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3966.8s)]
*  And he was that grin he's got. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3969.96s)]
*  And it starts sort of trying to make small talk. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3972.6400000000003s)]
*  I know I know very well what he's doing. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3975.1200000000003s)]
*  He's going to Davos. He's flown in for Davos. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3977.44s)]
*  So that's why he's there for Davos. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3980.6800000000003s)]
*  But what I didn't tell him. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3982.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to this is going to sound like boasting, and it is. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3985.6000000000004s)]
*  The reason I'm there is because I've just been to northern Iraq and been across to northeastern Syria [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3990.32s)]
*  and picked up two kids from Trinidad with their mother and flown them to Zurich. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=3995.64s)]
*  And then we're flying them back to Trinidad because their father joined ISIS and stole the children [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4000.96s)]
*  and took them there. And then obviously he was killed. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4006.16s)]
*  And my friend Clive Stafford Smith said, what are we going to do about these two kids in Camp Roche in northern Syria? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4009.3199999999997s)]
*  And it was one Christmas and it was 2019. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4015.96s)]
*  And I thought, what am I going to do? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4020.48s)]
*  Am I going to go and sit by a roaring fire in Switzerland and occasionally go skiing? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4023.48s)]
*  Or am I going to go to Syria and try and rescue these kids? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4030.6800000000003s)]
*  So we went to Syria. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4034.52s)]
*  But I thought it was I thought it was a really interesting meeting because I've never understood this whole thing of, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4036.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, George W. Bush is a good bloke. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4043.0s)]
*  I go and visit him on his ranch in Texas. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4046.32s)]
*  He killed a million people, not on his own. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4048.8s)]
*  Obviously, the rest of the neocons were with him, Paul Wolfeowitz and Dick Cheney and, you know, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4051.4s)]
*  Bill Kristol and all the rest of them. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4056.36s)]
*  They were all in it. And Tony Blair, let's not forget, they were all in it together. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4058.5200000000004s)]
*  They all did it together. They all knew it was a lie. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4063.0400000000004s)]
*  They all knew it was nonsense. They all knew they were doing it to steal oil or whatever they were doing it for. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4065.6000000000004s)]
*  But it certainly had nothing to do with 9-11 and it had nothing to do. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4070.2000000000003s)]
*  And so obviously, I still boil with rage. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4074.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't ignore 100 million dead. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4076.8s)]
*  You can't. You just can't go, oh, well, that was 17 years ago. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4079.5200000000004s)]
*  Forget about it. Forget about it. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4083.5200000000004s)]
*  You know, you can't. Well, I can't. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4086.36s)]
*  But obviously, Bono can. I assume. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4088.5600000000004s)]
*  Otherwise, why is he going to visit George Bush? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4091.6800000000003s)]
*  Anyway, I know that I probably shouldn't have told you that story or said any of that stuff. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4095.6400000000003s)]
*  I think I mean, if you really wanted to find out what a person like that is like, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4101.24s)]
*  that would be an incentive to go visit George Bush, to find out whether or not that does hang on his conscience. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4106.08s)]
*  Like, what is it like to talk to him? That's interesting. Yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4113.28s)]
*  I would do that. I would do that just to talk to him, try to figure out, like, what do you, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4116.68s)]
*  how do you feel knowing that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4120.5199999999995s)]
*  But you wouldn't get a straight answer from him, would you? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4125.04s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what you would get. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4127.36s)]
*  I've seen the paintings of his feet that he did in the bath. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4129.0s)]
*  It's bizarre paintings, right? I would. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4133.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're weird. And it's like you. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4135.84s)]
*  I mean, obviously, I'm armchair psychologist here, but I'm looking into him like that's a man that's very troubled. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4138.36s)]
*  That's a man that I mean, the weight of the world and the deaths that were caused by the decisions that he made as a president. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4145.08s)]
*  Yeah. And the amount of American lives were lost, the amount of Iraqi lives were lost, the way the world has changed, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4154.08s)]
*  the way the world thinks of America post 9-11 is so different. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4161.28s)]
*  There was a window of time right after the attacks on the World Trade Center where the whole world was united with America. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4166.08s)]
*  Like, and that was that was squandered for money. Yeah. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4175.759999999999s)]
*  That was squandered. That was squandered when we invaded Iraq. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4179.44s)]
*  That was squandered when, you know, people had this real true understanding of what the motivations really were. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4182.32s)]
*  The fact there weren't really weapons of mass destruction and that we saw the devastation and the lost lives and the way the world looks at us is incredibly different. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  From September 11th, 2001 to today, it's just a complete polar shift. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4202.679999999999s)]
*  The interest. Yeah, you're completely right, of course. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4209.16s)]
*  But and the interesting thing as well is that on February, I believe it was Valentine's Day or the 15th or something. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4211.4s)]
*  There were 20 over 20 million people all over the world in the streets saying there are no weapons of mass destruction. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4218.76s)]
*  What are you thinking about? This is insane. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4227.96s)]
*  Hans Blix has already told you there's nothing there. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4231.400000000001s)]
*  They've hunted and hunted and hunted. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4234.400000000001s)]
*  Colin Powell stood up and lied in the United Nations knowing full well that he was lying. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4237.16s)]
*  He can't. He must have had access to all the information. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4242.96s)]
*  They all knew and whatever. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4245.88s)]
*  And yet, you know, and yet you're going to do this thing. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4248.16s)]
*  My theory would be if you go and see George Bush, he's still alive. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4251.16s)]
*  Yes, he's still alive. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4256.28s)]
*  Well, if you go and see him, you could drive there from here. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4257.6s)]
*  Why don't you drive over there? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4260.68s)]
*  I think they'd probably shoot me. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4262.28s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to just drive to George Bush's house. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4265.92s)]
*  Well, they let Bono in. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4268.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, he probably had a meeting in advance and assured them of his intentions. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4269.92s)]
*  And he's going to go over there and sing Ordinary Love. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4273.72s)]
*  And well, my theory would be that he never escaped from the dynasty, you know, from his genes, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4276.280000000001s)]
*  whatever, from that family, because it's a supremely toxic background to come out of. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4282.88s)]
*  I Bush, Sr. All that bullshit about getting out of the CIA. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4289.68s)]
*  Yeah. And getting rid of the Vietnam syndrome. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4294.04s)]
*  Yeah. That's why Desert Storm or whatever the first one was called. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4296.68s)]
*  Yeah. Happened and all of that. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4301.52s)]
*  All of that history is fascinating reading, but it's also completely insane. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4303.12s)]
*  It's completely insane and it's terrifying. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4309.32s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4311.4s)]
*  It's terrifying that when you see the Eisenhower speech and you realize, like, well, that's it in motion. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4312.08s)]
*  That's it in action. You're seeing it right there. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4317.92s)]
*  That is the military industrial complex making decisions. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4320.72s)]
*  It's no more insane than what's going on right now. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4323.64s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4326.8s)]
*  And this is where when during my show, I touch on this occasion because in my show, as well as you will see tomorrow night, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4328.64s)]
*  I sing two bits of a new song called The Bar. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4337.76s)]
*  And I make absolutely certain that the audience understand what the song is about. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4341.68s)]
*  It's about this place that I carry around inside me. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4347.320000000001s)]
*  And I said, we all have it if we can find it in us, in our hearts or in our soul. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4350.360000000001s)]
*  And it's a place where we can converse with others and share a pain. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4355.92s)]
*  Do this. Have a conversation about things and share our feelings. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4359.36s)]
*  OK. And even if we're lucky enough, share our love with other human beings in the world in a place that's safe. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4364.8s)]
*  And I call that place The Bar. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4371.68s)]
*  OK. Why am I telling you this? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4374.16s)]
*  I tell you why I'm telling you, because what I've discovered doing these shows and I've done about 30 of them or a few more in the United States [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4378.4s)]
*  is that people get it. The audience gets it. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4385.48s)]
*  You can see them getting it. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4388.719999999999s)]
*  And in a way, what is good about it is that singing those three verses that I do of that song, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4390.879999999999s)]
*  it gives them permission to disagree with me and yet not feel they have to stand up and wave their fists and walk out. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4398.12s)]
*  Because because they've understood what I'm saying, it's all right to disagree about things and have different opinions about. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4405.719999999999s)]
*  But we have to allow one other to express our opinions. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4413.0s)]
*  And it may be that we'll meet somebody who's. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4417.24s)]
*  You know, who who understands more about things, you know, if you meet the Dalai Lama, you're going to learn something from them. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4421.28s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm the Dalai Lama, but you know, there are things we can learn from other human beings. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4428.4s)]
*  Yes, that without going on Facebook or picking up our phone and, you know, and whatever. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4434.84s)]
*  Anyway, I'm not making much sense. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4442.72s)]
*  No, you are making sense. But I think that's one of the great things about your show is that you combine this amazing music [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4444.280000000001s)]
*  that has this incredible history to it with all of these messages and with all of these visuals. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4451.08s)]
*  I think you got a lot of attention during the Trump administration because of the flying Trump pigs and all the other visuals you did. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4458.2s)]
*  People loved it. But then when you put up a photograph of Biden and said he was a war criminal, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4465.280000000001s)]
*  then people like, wait a minute, you're on the wrong side now. What are you doing? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4472.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let's see what happens, shall we? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4476.5599999999995s)]
*  Before we come to a final conclusion about, as I said in the Smokonish interview, I said there's something criminal there. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4478.4s)]
*  It is criminal not to be trying to end the war in Ukraine, but just by trying to pour weapons into it, just pouring weapons into the Ukraine. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4486.84s)]
*  Ukrainian people can't beat Russia in a war on the ground, however many weapons you give them. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4497.08s)]
*  They're just cannon fodder. That policy shows that Joe Biden and Anthony Blinken and the administration [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4502.64s)]
*  and whoever is pulling their strings to go all conspiracy theory for a minute, couldn't give an F about the Ukrainian people. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4510.44s)]
*  They couldn't care less how many of them. They've said so. I saw what's his name? Not McConnell. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4518.96s)]
*  Lindsey Graham. I saw him in an interview the other night going, we are going to help the Ukrainians fight to the death. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4525.0s)]
*  He said it in an interview on a television station. And you go, what, their death? Well, I mean, I didn't I wasn't there. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4534.64s)]
*  So I could not. But that's what he means. Yeah. Let them fight. Who cares? They never cared about a Ukrainian before. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4543.84s)]
*  Why should we care about them now? Well, the answer is because it suits the geopolitical aspirations of the people who by the election that you were talking about. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4550.2s)]
*  They're weakening Russia so that they can become the unipolar, you know, the hegemony can produce again. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4561.2s)]
*  This they can rule the world. They want to rule the world. They said so back in the 90s. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4567.639999999999s)]
*  Paul Wolfowitz told Wesley Clark in the Pentagon, yeah, face to face, we are going to destroy seven countries in the next five years. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4574.24s)]
*  Wesley Clark's gone public about it. We all know it because he's told us all. And people go, well, so what? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4586.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that speech where he discusses that. But let's let's play that because it's very powerful. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4593.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. People pull up that Wesley Clark, the the discussion where he talks about the seven countries, how they laid it out. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4599.56s)]
*  And a lot of that has already been put into motion. Absolutely. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4608.400000000001s)]
*  Syria's almost gone. The Yemen's pretty well gone. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4613.6s)]
*  Iran is the big Somalias gone. I can't remember what the others were. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4617.76s)]
*  But we'll find out. That was an eye opener for people because you're you're listening to a general. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4622.400000000001s)]
*  And he's discussing this. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4629.32s)]
*  Well, the general is relating the story told to him by an undersecretary of state at the Pentagon. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4631.719999999999s)]
*  Right. Whatever Wolfowitz was at the time. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4638.44s)]
*  I can't remember. Right. So you're listening to someone who is one of the people that actually gets to discuss these things with the people that pull the strings. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4641.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And he's relaying it to us. So let's play. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4649.799999999999s)]
*  So this is retired U.S. General Wesley Clark. Wars were planned. Seven countries in five years on YouTube. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4653.32s)]
*  I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4661.96s)]
*  I went downstairs just say hello to some of the people on the joint staff who used to work for me. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4666.08s)]
*  And one of the generals called me and he said, sir, you got to come in. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4670.719999999999s)]
*  You got to come in and talk to me a second. I said, well, you're too busy. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4673.76s)]
*  He said, no, no. He says, we've made the decision. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4676.2s)]
*  We're going to war with Iraq. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4680.24s)]
*  This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, we're going to war with Iraq. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4682.36s)]
*  Why? He said, I don't know. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4686.799999999999s)]
*  He said, I guess they don't know what else to do. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4692.4s)]
*  So I said, well, did they find some information collect connecting Saddam to Al Qaeda? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4695.88s)]
*  He said, no, no. He says, there's nothing new that way. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4700.799999999999s)]
*  They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4704.24s)]
*  He said, I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4707.5199999999995s)]
*  but we've got a good military and we can take down governments. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4710.959999999999s)]
*  And he said, I guess if the only two you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4714.839999999999s)]
*  So I came back to see him a few weeks later. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4721.639999999999s)]
*  And by that time, we were bombing in Afghanistan. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4725.12s)]
*  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq? And he said, oh, it's worse than that. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4727.36s)]
*  He said, he reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4730.959999999999s)]
*  He said, I just he said, I just got this down from upstairs, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4733.72s)]
*  meaning the secretary of defense office today. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4737.0s)]
*  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4738.68s)]
*  starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4745.400000000001s)]
*  Wild, wild. Yeah. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4752.76s)]
*  Just wild to hear him lay that out. Yeah. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4756.08s)]
*  Because it's conspiracy theory. But what? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4759.72s)]
*  It's not history. Right. But actual. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4762.92s)]
*  Yeah. And yet it disappears into the ether. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4766.6s)]
*  Like it doesn't matter. It's not important. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4770.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they were. Yeah. But what? Yeah. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4773.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, who cares? I care. I care. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4775.0s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine if you were Somalian or Lebanese or Syrian. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4778.64s)]
*  Well, look at the Iraqis. Libya is a failed state now. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4783.32s)]
*  It's an incredibly dangerous place. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4786.400000000001s)]
*  And they have open slave trade that you could watch on YouTube. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4788.24s)]
*  Yeah. There's a lyric in a new another new song of mine, one of the other songs I wrote in in lockdown [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4792.16s)]
*  that talks about, I'd say, in Timbuktu or in the Republic of the Congo or other states where. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4799.28s)]
*  Some things I can't remember, I'd have to look it up, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4811.2s)]
*  but it's saying for the old slave trade to merge seamlessly with the new. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4813.92s)]
*  So I'm making that point that that this foreign policy is reintroducing slavery to the world. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4820.4400000000005s)]
*  Reintroducing the slave trade in Africa, North Africa, West Africa and the Middle East. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4829.36s)]
*  That's what it's doing. And and people seem to think it's all right. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4836.8s)]
*  But what's the end? What's it for? Why? What is it? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4841.64s)]
*  Even if you can't in. I've written another letter to somebody which I haven't posted yet. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4846.240000000001s)]
*  But it's oh, I know it's to a counselor in the Ukraine who has made who has declared me persona non grata in Krakow, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4853.320000000001s)]
*  which is a big town very near the Polish Ukrainian border, because he claims I'm a Putin apologist. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4862.04s)]
*  All my asking everybody that I can get to listen to me to make peace, to stop the war, to start negotiation or whatever. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4870.639999999999s)]
*  For them, I'm you know, all they want to do is kill every Russian that they can get their hands on. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4879.44s)]
*  Well, why did I bring that up? I'll remember in a minute. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4886.88s)]
*  And when I do, I'll tell you, because it's to do with the whole thing. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4890.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, no, I can't remember. I've lost it. But it will come back to me. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4895.04s)]
*  That's how my brain works. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4899.0s)]
*  How what is your creative process when when you sit down to write music, when you sit down to compose songs like how? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4902.84s)]
*  How do you go about that? I always used to say for years and years, I used to I don't go about it. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4912.68s)]
*  Oh, I haven't in the past. In the past, my answer would always be I don't do anything until I get a pregnant. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4920.28s)]
*  Feeling and I can't describe the feeling, except that I know that I'm about to give birth to something. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4928.96s)]
*  So that's as close as I can get. It's weird sort of fog of nothingness that feels as if it might clear and I might see something or something might pop out. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4936.6s)]
*  And very often after that, I put myself in in a physically in the same room as a guitar or a piano and with a legal pad and a bar. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4949.04s)]
*  And hey, so sometimes something pops out and I go, oh, that's interesting. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4959.76s)]
*  And then I work on it more recently when Covid happened, I did two things. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4964.28s)]
*  One, I wrote some songs that had been bubbling a bit. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4968.8s)]
*  And that might it might be just a little guitar riff or a chord sequence or something. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4972.16s)]
*  And then I might play it. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4977.08s)]
*  And then my brain is a very fertile place for ideas and for lyrics and for the way lyrics scan against bits of music. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4978.36s)]
*  So it comes kind of quite easily once I've had a first idea. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4989.28s)]
*  I did that. But also, I I thought I've got a couple of years of this. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4992.44s)]
*  I've been meaning to write a memoir. So I'm going to do it now. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=4999.84s)]
*  So one day I got this out and I went, well, go on then, you prick. Go on then. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5005.4s)]
*  Clever clogs. So I opened a word document and I went and I started to write. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5011.36s)]
*  And before I knew it, I'd written ten thousand words and I went and I was probably a bit drunk. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5016.839999999999s)]
*  And so I went and I went back a couple of days later and I went, bloody hell, it's prose and it's quite funny. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5021.839999999999s)]
*  But it's deep as well. And it's actually rather moving. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5029.599999999999s)]
*  And so I had a eureka moment, you know, I mean, I could write prose. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5033.72s)]
*  I couldn't believe it because I love prose. I mean, I love to read books. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5038.72s)]
*  I love books. But you never sit down intentionally to write like that. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5044.8s)]
*  I never sit down like, you know, professional writers. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5050.12s)]
*  Sometimes they say I get up at six every morning, have a cup of coffee and a piece of bacon. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5052.84s)]
*  And then I go to my room and I write until 1230. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5057.56s)]
*  And then I have a bottle of champagne and pass out and whatever it is they do. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5061.6s)]
*  But they have a routine. Yeah, I don't have that. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5066.160000000001s)]
*  So I work when I think or I might be drifting past the piano and sit down and go, oh, that's it. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5069.04s)]
*  And I might even reach for a pen and write a chord sequence or something down. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5076.240000000001s)]
*  So it's a very it's not it's not it's it's not a regimented protest process at all. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5081.4400000000005s)]
*  When you're as busy as you are in touring and all these things, how do you find time to create? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5088.96s)]
*  Do you do you allocate time to create or just sort of like let? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5096.04s)]
*  No, when I'm touring, I get back to the hotel. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5099.6s)]
*  We have a trough. We have a golden trough after the show, which means that there's always food and drink for everybody. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5103.84s)]
*  And then I normally would get to the get up to my room at two o'clock in the morning or something. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5110.6s)]
*  And then usually I put the stick of the show into the side of the laptop and then I might look at a bit of it. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5117.04s)]
*  And if I didn't look at it, then I look at it the next day and I make notes. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5123.4s)]
*  I changed the show every day. Really? Yeah. Every day. Yeah. Wow. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5127.08s)]
*  And I go in the next to the next show with notes. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5133.12s)]
*  What are you playing? And there may be visual notes or the text or the but I'm changing it constantly. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5137.08s)]
*  I had it was my production manager, Chris Kansy, lovely man, been working with him for umpteen years. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5143.5199999999995s)]
*  It was his birthday yesterday. And I went and had a small glass of wine with him. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5149.599999999999s)]
*  And we were talking and he said we did two hundred and eleven wall shows when we did the wall. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5155.12s)]
*  We did it for nearly three years starting in 2010. And I said, oh, yeah, he's reminiscing. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5163.08s)]
*  And he said, do you know what I remember? And I said, what's that? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5170.08s)]
*  He said the two hundred and eleven show was in somewhere or other. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5172.72s)]
*  I don't know where it was. And he said, and you came in with notes and changed the show on the two hundred and eleventh show on the last show. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5177.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. And that was it. We were never going to do it again. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5188.360000000001s)]
*  So I'm a bit obsessive. Well, that's why it's so great. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5191.72s)]
*  I mean, partly, yeah. Yeah, I don't think there's any other way. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5195.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's this huge excitement to go that we could do this or we could do that. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5198.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, it would be better if that word was changed or if we did this or if we changed that. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5203.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, so well, that speaks to the ethic of what you're trying to do, that you're tweaking it to the very last show of a tour. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5208.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I'm going to talk to you just for a second about prose. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5214.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I told this to Chris Hedges the other day, but I'm going to tell it to you as well, because that's what's jogged my memory. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5220.92s)]
*  You know that thing when you're reading a book, OK, and you've got it on your bedside table or whatever and you read it or any time it doesn't. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5226.96s)]
*  You could be lying on the beach and it's a great book. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5235.04s)]
*  It's a really great book. And you get to about 10 pages from the end and you find yourself putting it down quicker because you don't want it to finish. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5238.12s)]
*  I do this anyway, and you love people who read, I think, will know this experience. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5247.44s)]
*  So you keep putting it down because you don't want it to finish. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5252.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I wrote a poem about my experience with Cormac MacArthur's All the Pretty Horses. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5257.08s)]
*  I don't know if you've read that novel, but if you haven't, you should. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5262.96s)]
*  It's a fantastic book. And I was feeling like that about it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5265.719999999999s)]
*  So I wrote a poem and I sent it to him. He never replied. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5270.12s)]
*  But that's fine. I wasn't really expecting a play. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5273.04s)]
*  And it's just called On First Reading All the Pretty Horses. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5276.68s)]
*  And I'll try and remember it. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5280.280000000001s)]
*  There is a magic in some books that sucks a man into connections with the spirits hard to touch that join him to his kind. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5283.72s)]
*  A man will eke the reading out, guarded like a canteen in the desert heat. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5295.400000000001s)]
*  But sometimes needs must drink and then. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5302.48s)]
*  And then the final drop falls sweet. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5312.5199999999995s)]
*  The last page turns the end. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5316.5199999999995s)]
*  I know I fucked it up because I think I lost. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5321.08s)]
*  It's all right. You got the point across. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5323.12s)]
*  Yeah. Cormac MacArthur. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5325.24s)]
*  And of course, I haven't read that book. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5328.04s)]
*  I said it's you know, it's like and the river runs through it. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5329.36s)]
*  And her just went, oh, the last paragraph of the river runs through it. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5331.92s)]
*  You know that book. Yeah. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5336.88s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know what I brought that I do because we were talking about writing. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5339.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And so during the pandemic, when you had all that free time, that's when you started writing prose. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5343.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I've written a book. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5350.12s)]
*  It's done 500 pages long. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5353.32s)]
*  I'm pretty well. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5355.08s)]
*  I mean, we're starting to put it in a proper order and figure out, you know, whether I need to write anymore or what I need to do. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5357.68s)]
*  So and when you wrote that, did you have a process like a writer does where you just get up every day or just do it whenever the. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5366.4s)]
*  No, I because I was in lockdown. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5371.88s)]
*  So I was in the same house all day every day that I would if I wasn't sort of doing anything else, which I most of the time I was. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5374.08s)]
*  I go, where was I? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5380.8s)]
*  Just pull the laptop over and write another chapter about something different or. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5384.04s)]
*  Leaving all the Pink Floyd stuff to last, obviously, you know, for obvious reasons, hard things to write about stuff. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5390.8s)]
*  So you just leave it alone for a bit. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5398.6s)]
*  What's the biggest breakup in probably rock history? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5400.400000000001s)]
*  Don't you think? I mean, it's it's I don't know. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5406.16s)]
*  It's up there. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5408.280000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe I don't. I'm not very up on rock history. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5410.0s)]
*  Because I'm not very interested in most popular music. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5414.32s)]
*  I mean, there are certain people that I'm great fans of that mainly the sort of the writers, the singer songwriters, you know, like so Dylan and Neil Young. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5418.24s)]
*  And but I won't start a long list because I probably could. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5429.24s)]
*  But it's that end of the spectrum that I'm more interested in than I'm not really interested in loud rock and roll. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5434.08s)]
*  And which some people are and they love it, but I couldn't care less about ACDC or Eddie Van Halen or any of that stuff. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5443.28s)]
*  I just think who you know, I don't go who because obviously I know the name. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5450.32s)]
*  Right. You know, and I'm sure Eddie's brilliant and a great guitar player and wonderful. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5455.08s)]
*  I just just doesn't interest me. Right. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5460.28s)]
*  But look out, Marl. There's a white boat coming up the river. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5464.32s)]
*  You know, what was that called? The powder powder monkey, I think, which is on Russ Never Sleeps, something like that. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5468.679999999999s)]
*  I kind of have to take a deep. I have it. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5475.4s)]
*  You know, it's like, wow, what did he just say when the first shot hit the dock? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5478.48s)]
*  So you don't really consume rock and roll music? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5485.12s)]
*  No, I'm too busy working on my own stuff. Wow. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5488.36s)]
*  Seems to be working out, though. Well, whatever the process is. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5492.88s)]
*  It's filled in 79 years. Yeah. Sort of, you know. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5496.16s)]
*  And it's still I'm still I'm really excited about it. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5501.44s)]
*  I love it. These are the best shows I've ever done by far. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5505.48s)]
*  Really? I've made a real breakthrough. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5509.839999999999s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever sort of managed to communicate with an audience in a way that is satisfying. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5512.52s)]
*  What's different? I've opened my heart. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5518.56s)]
*  I'm vulnerable. And yet, because I've done that, they they're responding and in consequence, I become bolder. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5522.52s)]
*  You know, the more you risk, the more you potentially lose, but also the more you potentially gain. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5531.92s)]
*  When you share your share your heart with somebody, they can either, you know, step on it or give you a bit of theirs back. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5539.04s)]
*  Well, so many performers, particularly musicians, they put up this wall. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5550.76s)]
*  There's this wall of image and what they're projecting. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5554.56s)]
*  And you get this rock and roll show. You get this superstar. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5559.0s)]
*  And then you're the audience and there's not the connection is only that you love them. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5563.44s)]
*  They appreciate you. You love them. Good night, everybody. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5569.28s)]
*  But in showing vulnerability and trying to establish true connection, you feel like that's where you've made this breakthrough. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5574.4s)]
*  Yeah. And it's risk taking as well. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5582.719999999999s)]
*  So I sing a song unashamedly about nuclear war at the end of the show when everybody's just watched the second half of Dark Side of the Moon and they're all, you know, really happy and quite rightly because the band, my band is really good. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5587.24s)]
*  And and so everybody's very moved. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5604.76s)]
*  I take the risk of saying, you know, there's something that we that is a lot more important than any of this. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5608.48s)]
*  We are teetering on the edge of an annihilation. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5614.32s)]
*  And they're and they've arrived at a point in the show then where they go and they're but they also go, let's listen to what he has to say. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5617.759999999999s)]
*  And some of them even know the song, which is from the final cut, which was the last record I made in 1983 with Pink Floyd. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5627.36s)]
*  And then we do it. And they and a lot of the audience respond. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5635.28s)]
*  They want to show me that they understand and that they care and they stand up and that when when everybody's being blown to bits and it's the end of the world in the song and we it's visual as well. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5639.44s)]
*  It's beautiful animation that Sean Evans has made, who's my collaborator in all things visually in the issues. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5651.2s)]
*  And and the people sort of get it, but it still is. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5659.88s)]
*  It's pretty somber because there's there's nothing really rah rah or rock and roll about. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5663.24s)]
*  Nuclear war, nothing, but you can't ignore it. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5670.4400000000005s)]
*  And when I say, you know, if you run into Joe Biden in the street, you might just tap him on the shoulders. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5675.16s)]
*  Shouldn't we get rid of nuclear weapons? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5682.08s)]
*  Why not spend our time? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5685.04s)]
*  Let's talk to Putin about that. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5686.88s)]
*  And also China, all the nuclear power. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5688.96s)]
*  Let's let why don't we all get together and say, listen, these are too dangerous. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5691.400000000001s)]
*  Can we all agree now we've had them since nineteen forty five and they've done nobody any good. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5696.92s)]
*  Can't we just get rid of them so we don't have to worry about them? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5703.04s)]
*  The problem is they would worry that someone wouldn't. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5706.24s)]
*  And that person would have the nuclear. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5710.28s)]
*  Well, somebody maybe wouldn't. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5712.2s)]
*  Well, we've got them part part of the worry about the big accident is falling into wrong hands. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5714.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. You know, and that's a perfectly legitimate concern, in my view. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5720.5199999999995s)]
*  It is. Is it possible, do you think, to put that genie back into the bottle, though? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5725.28s)]
*  Yeah, of course. It can be done. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5729.76s)]
*  I think so. Yeah. All it requires is the will of the will of the people to persuade. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5731.44s)]
*  But again, it's like you, you can't do it until you can separate until you get rid of Citizens United. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5736.28s)]
*  You can't do it until you take money out of politics. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5743.16s)]
*  You certainly can't do it over here in the United States, whether they could do it in Russia or, you know, Russia's autocratic state. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5746.599999999999s)]
*  So who knows when people bring up Russia and or China with me, you know, I say, you're talking to the wrong bloke. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5753.599999999999s)]
*  I don't speak Russian. I don't speak Chinese. I've never lived there. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5762.0s)]
*  I know a little bit about the United States and about the United Kingdom and less, but a little bit about I speak Greek. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5765.44s)]
*  So I know a bit about Greece. And, you know, we learned French when I was at school. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5772.4s)]
*  And there are our neighbors who we hate across across La Manche. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5777.2s)]
*  But I can't without speaking Russian and Mandarin. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5781.4s)]
*  How can you possibly know what's going on? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5785.639999999999s)]
*  And also, how could you know in the context of their culture? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5788.639999999999s)]
*  Like, you don't totally understand their culture unless you speak their language. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5791.76s)]
*  Exactly. That's exactly right. Language is so important. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5795.2s)]
*  That's why it's no surprise that Chomsky, you know, is his work in linguistics was the thing that brought him to the notice of other academics and intellectuals back in the 50s. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5800.2s)]
*  But and he's right, because, you know, linguistics has always been hugely important. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5811.24s)]
*  Linguistics is the basis of all philosophy. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5818.32s)]
*  And unless you speak the language that the philosophy is being described in, you can't begin to take part in the conversation. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5821.759999999999s)]
*  One thing I have to ask you, because I can't forget this, the synchronization with The Wizard of Oz is bullshit. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5830.36s)]
*  Is it bullshit? Yeah, of course it is. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5843.08s)]
*  I mean, it may not be. It may be that if you do what they say, it may be if you do what they say, but has nothing to do with us and any of us. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5845.16s)]
*  Nothing to do with anyone in Pink Floyd or anyone who wrote or recorded any of the music. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5855.36s)]
*  It's something that somebody thinks. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5861.08s)]
*  So it's a it's a coincidence of some time. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5864.96s)]
*  Maybe it's cosmic coincidence. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5868.28s)]
*  I do like the story, though, of the cop in Louisiana following a bus and it was weaving about the road a bit. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5870.92s)]
*  And and so he pulls it over young motorcycle cop, puts the bike up on the stand, opens the door, nearly falls over. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5879.68s)]
*  There's so much smoke coming out through the bloody door. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5888.04s)]
*  He goes in, it goes through and he's trying to find people, you know, with dope, because it's just full of marijuana smoke. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5890.56s)]
*  Eventually gets to the back of the bus where there's a private compartment. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5899.0s)]
*  He opens the door and goes in and there's Willie Nelson. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5902.08s)]
*  And the story is that Willie Nelson is listening to Dark Side of the Moon and watching The Wizard of Oz on the TV. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5905.56s)]
*  And I don't believe it for a minute, but I like the story. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5914.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even want to investigate that. I want it to be true. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5917.28s)]
*  I don't want to find out it's not true. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5920.52s)]
*  But if you I've watched it, I've watched The Wizard of Oz listening to The Dark Side of the Moon while high on marijuana. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5922.24s)]
*  And if it's not on purpose, it is a cosmic coincidence because it's kind of amazing. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5930.32s)]
*  It's kind of amazing how it it just flows. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5937.96s)]
*  If only I smoke dope, I could join you in that experience. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5941.92s)]
*  You don't smoke at all? No. Never? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5945.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Ever. Yeah. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5947.88s)]
*  I tell you why, because I used to smoke cigarettes a lot and way, way too much. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5950.68s)]
*  And particularly when I was working, I changed smoke literally. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5958.320000000001s)]
*  So I'd smoke three packs at least a day of Marlboro Reds. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5961.200000000001s)]
*  And I gave up eventually. And I gave up like in the late 60s. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5965.72s)]
*  But I didn't really give up. I gave up smoking rolled cigarettes. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5972.16s)]
*  I continued to smoke cigarettes with tobacco and hashish in them. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5977.4s)]
*  So I pretended I'd stopped smoking. But I hadn't. I was addicted. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5982.04s)]
*  That's a big thing in England. Spliffs. Spliffs. Yeah. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5987.2s)]
*  When I was over there, I was fascinated by that. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5990.96s)]
*  I was like, why do you guys have cigarettes in your marijuana? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5993.4s)]
*  Like, what is this? But it's pretty good. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5996.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I did it because I was addicted to nicotine. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=5998.719999999999s)]
*  And then in 1975, I realized that that's what I was doing. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6002.4s)]
*  And after that, I never smoked dope again. I didn't like it. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6007.32s)]
*  I don't like being stoned. I don't like the feeling. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6010.16s)]
*  It makes me paranoid. That's what I like about it. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6012.96s)]
*  What? Being paranoid? Yeah, I like it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6017.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. I enjoy the feeling of vulnerability sometimes. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6019.759999999999s)]
*  Wow. Well, good for you. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6024.5599999999995s)]
*  Chacun a son go as the French have it. I don't like it. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6026.799999999999s)]
*  I'm paranoid enough already without smoking dope. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6033.24s)]
*  Oh, I am too. But occasionally, I think just the there's an understanding [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6036.04s)]
*  of vulnerability that comes through marijuana that I enjoy. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6044.0s)]
*  It's sort of a perspective enhancer for me sometimes. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6049.92s)]
*  OK. Well, good for you. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6052.96s)]
*  But, you know, with Dark Side of the Moon and with The Wizard of Oz, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6055.44s)]
*  the combination, pretty incredible. All right. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6060.64s)]
*  Good. We got that out of the way. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6064.08s)]
*  So when you guys like in the early days of the band, what was like? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6067.52s)]
*  That's always the connection with rock and roll and drugs. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6074.4800000000005s)]
*  Like this is like that's the narrative. Yeah. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6077.92s)]
*  Was that in the early days of Pink Floyd? Was that the case? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6080.52s)]
*  It wasn't really relevant. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6084.8s)]
*  I mean, during the time when I was smoking hash every day was 1970, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6087.4400000000005s)]
*  71, 70. So it's pre pre Dark Side is when we were making medals. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6092.88s)]
*  So it's echoes and things. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6098.400000000001s)]
*  But I don't I don't think it had I don't think it impinged [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6099.68s)]
*  on my burgeoning writing career, if you like, when I was, you know, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6103.8s)]
*  starting to write songs because Sid. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6108.8s)]
*  Went crazy in 1967. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6113.72s)]
*  And so by 69, he wasn't we weren't seeing him anymore. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6119.24s)]
*  He disappeared completely. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6123.32s)]
*  And was that because of LSD? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6125.08s)]
*  Or was it? No, I don't think so. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6128.48s)]
*  But, you know, that's the narrative, right? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6130.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's the narrative or one of the narratives. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6132.16s)]
*  It may be because he he was mixing with people [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6136.88s)]
*  who were doing acid on a regular basis, I think, in 67. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6140.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm sure he did too much. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6145.04s)]
*  He did too much of it. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6147.56s)]
*  Was he teetering on the edge of what might be called schizophrenia [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6148.96s)]
*  at the time? I think so, probably. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6152.56s)]
*  A lot of the things that he was saying, and it was right [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6156.08s)]
*  at the beginning of us getting our first record in any chart, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6159.04s)]
*  which was on line. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6163.88s)]
*  No, it was after on line. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6165.88s)]
*  It was in when C.M.E. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6167.28s)]
*  Play came out and we were beginning to do TV shows in England. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6168.68s)]
*  And he went very odd. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6172.84s)]
*  And he started I remember him at Top of the Pops [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6175.6s)]
*  in the dressing room one day. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6178.84s)]
*  He had hair a bit like that painting on the wall and going [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6181.72s)]
*  so off and then going looking worried and a bit frightened [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6185.84s)]
*  and then going, John Lennon doesn't have to do this. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6191.120000000001s)]
*  You know, which was kind of wacky. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6196.4400000000005s)]
*  This was like three quarters of the way through the Beatles' [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6199.28s)]
*  career, because they only had that one decade, really. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6201.879999999999s)]
*  And so he had misgivings about being on a miming pop show. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6206.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, and said, this is what we've worked towards [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6212.799999999999s)]
*  for the last four or five years, is to be on Top of the Pops [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6215.839999999999s)]
*  and make a few quid, you know, buck up, boy. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6219.839999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6222.679999999999s)]
*  And he said, well, I'm going to do this. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6223.679999999999s)]
*  Two quid, you know, buck up, boy. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6225.88s)]
*  Let's get on with it. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6228.2s)]
*  And but he never did buck up from from sort of that moment on, really. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6230.36s)]
*  He wrote a few more songs, but nothing of any any real note. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6236.4800000000005s)]
*  And he just got more and more and more detached until he was [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6241.84s)]
*  completely wacky and not making any sense. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6246.2s)]
*  And we made I mean, I made a lot of attempts to find out what was wrong [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6249.0s)]
*  and to involve his family. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6255.24s)]
*  You know, he had older brothers who I would ring up and say, hey, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6257.32s)]
*  there's something really wrong with Roger, as they called him, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6259.88s)]
*  because he wasn't his name was Roger Barrett, not said that. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6263.84s)]
*  I said, he's not well, I think. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6267.84s)]
*  And one of the brothers actually came to London and went and saw him [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6269.84s)]
*  and called me up and went, he's fine. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6273.0s)]
*  You know, he's had some troubling times, but he's actually fine. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6275.36s)]
*  And I went, Alan, he's not. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6278.24s)]
*  He's not. I trust me. I live with him. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6279.76s)]
*  You know, anyway. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6282.56s)]
*  And we tried to get him to a shrink [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6285.200000000001s)]
*  so on a number of occasions, but he would never go in. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6288.8s)]
*  And then he just got weirder and weirder. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6291.96s)]
*  Like in what way weird, like what was in communicative, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6294.320000000001s)]
*  not making any sense at all. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6297.68s)]
*  Not making any. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6300.64s)]
*  It's like I actually mentioned one of one of the periods, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6301.4800000000005s)]
*  one of the moments is in the show, because it's just it's in when we play [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6305.360000000001s)]
*  Wish You Were Here and I do wish he was here. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6310.12s)]
*  And I mean, he's partly what that song's about. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6313.16s)]
*  And Shine on You Crazy Diamond is just completely about Sid. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6316.12s)]
*  But we were I told the story in text in the show and it goes, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6321.24s)]
*  we'd been to a meeting at the Capitol Tower in Los Angeles. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6326.28s)]
*  And Sid and I were walking down the street after it. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6330.28s)]
*  And we stopped at the traffic light at Hollywood and Vine, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6335.48s)]
*  Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street in Los Angeles. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6338.68s)]
*  And he looked at me and smiled and he said, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6342.200000000001s)]
*  it's nice here in Las Vegas, isn't it? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6345.200000000001s)]
*  Well, we were in L.A. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6347.400000000001s)]
*  So he already had no idea where he was even like that. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6349.200000000001s)]
*  But then he I say in the thing, you'll see it the show, it says, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6354.0s)]
*  then his face darkened and he looked down at the ground [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6357.96s)]
*  and spat out one word, people. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6361.92s)]
*  And that sort of encapsulates what it was like. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6365.12s)]
*  Nothing made any sense. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6368.88s)]
*  Disjointed, blank, disjointed, you know. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6371.36s)]
*  And there we were all young or very young and trying to make our way. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6376.28s)]
*  And and. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6380.92s)]
*  By that time, Dave had already joined the band to play guitar [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6384.2s)]
*  and because Sid could didn't play and not saying he couldn't. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6387.88s)]
*  Well, he couldn't really, because both of us, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6391.04s)]
*  both of us made so his solo records with him, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6394.200000000001s)]
*  helped produce his solo records after that point. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6398.16s)]
*  And he was it was pretty kind of disjointed [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6401.400000000001s)]
*  and difficult to get him to do anything. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6405.56s)]
*  Did he continue to deteriorate further after that? Yeah. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6408.4400000000005s)]
*  And then he went home to live in Cambridge [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6411.6s)]
*  and he lived a very solitary life. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6414.16s)]
*  Now, I spoke to his sister, Rosemary, after that. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6415.96s)]
*  And I said, could it does it make any sense, you know, to go and visit? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6419.0s)]
*  No, don't do that. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6423.16s)]
*  And she told me, I said, why not? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6424.92s)]
*  And she said, well, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6426.36s)]
*  he gets very agitated [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6428.72s)]
*  and upset when if he's reminded of what happened before, whatever this is, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6432.32s)]
*  he doesn't like it. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6439.36s)]
*  He doesn't want to see people from his past. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6441.4400000000005s)]
*  He'd rather be left alone. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6444.32s)]
*  And he did. And he used to paint a little bit [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6445.56s)]
*  and live just on his own in Cambridge until he died [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6448.76s)]
*  when he was 60. Wow. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6454.24s)]
*  So I don't know what else to say about it, really. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6459.68s)]
*  It was tragic, obviously. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6463.08s)]
*  And but but. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6467.12s)]
*  Those of us who were in Pink Floyd at the time experienced it as a [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6469.8s)]
*  existential threat as well. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6474.56s)]
*  Fuck me, what we're going to do, he writes the bloody songs. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6478.8s)]
*  Well, I wrote about 20 percent of them before. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6482.04s)]
*  But they were not the acid songs were the things that were different. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6485.280000000001s)]
*  They had that weird English romanticism about them. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6489.120000000001s)]
*  You know, they were beautiful. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6492.8s)]
*  I've got a boat. You can write it if you like. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6494.8s)]
*  It's got a basket, a bell that rings and things that make it look good. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6496.92s)]
*  I'd give it to you if I could. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6500.4800000000005s)]
*  But I borrowed it. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6502.04s)]
*  That's so quirky in terms of its meter, the way the lyric attaches [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6503.8s)]
*  both to the melody and and to the [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6510.6s)]
*  time signature and the tempo of the thing is remarkable. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6514.64s)]
*  And it wasn't just, you know, there were lots of quirky little songs like that, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6521.0s)]
*  all of it, all in a very English romantic tradition and whatever. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6524.64s)]
*  So how could we possibly survive? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6528.72s)]
*  If the guy writes the songs in the band goes crazy, you're fucked, basically. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6531.36s)]
*  Unless somebody else learns to starts to write. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6536.56s)]
*  Luckily, I did. I did start to write. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6539.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not I don't mean to laugh because he was a huge loss. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6545.04s)]
*  And I did love him. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6549.56s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, sometimes there's comedy and loss. Yeah. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6551.32s)]
*  But what was it like to make that transition to for you [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6555.8s)]
*  to make that shift in responsibility to start writing and to? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6559.28s)]
*  Well, it all comes back to my mum, really, because we made in 1970. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6563.32s)]
*  We made a record called Medal. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6569.759999999999s)]
*  And on one one side of it is a very long track called Echoes. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6571.44s)]
*  That is sort of me. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6576.719999999999s)]
*  Thinking a bit more metaphysically about. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6579.5599999999995s)]
*  Our trip, you know, as humans from ancient times, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6583.04s)]
*  overhead the albatross with blood, it was all a bit kind of romantic [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6587.8s)]
*  and science fiction. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6591.360000000001s)]
*  It was a bit Marvel comedy. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6592.84s)]
*  You know, it had kind of attachments to Dr. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6594.84s)]
*  Strange, who was a no Dr. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6598.6s)]
*  Strange mentioned in the lyrics. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6600.76s)]
*  I mentioned Dr. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6602.2s)]
*  Strange in other songs that I was writing at that time. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6603.08s)]
*  But it has one verse in it that defines everything I've done since. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6605.88s)]
*  And the verse is this. It goes. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6610.68s)]
*  Two strangers passing in the street [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6614.0s)]
*  by chance to passing glances meet. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6617.240000000001s)]
*  And I am you. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6620.280000000001s)]
*  And what I see is me. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6621.8s)]
*  And will we something will they call us to move on and whatever? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6624.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's the important couplet [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6628.92s)]
*  is to recognize your connection [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6633.200000000001s)]
*  with your brother or sister, whoever they are, wherever they are. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6637.04s)]
*  So to say to make to make that attachment [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6641.400000000001s)]
*  and to make a declaration that we're all in this together. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6644.88s)]
*  So that's why I sing songs about the potential descent [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6648.68s)]
*  into a nuclear holocaust to my audiences in, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6653.84s)]
*  well, tomorrow, Austin, Texas. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6658.2s)]
*  It's just me saying, I see you. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6661.4400000000005s)]
*  But and that's what the bar is all about as well. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6664.400000000001s)]
*  That's what the vulnerability is. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6667.8s)]
*  He's saying, I recognize that we're all African. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6669.72s)]
*  When you say that to a crowded room of Italian journalists, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6672.28s)]
*  they all look at each other. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6676.72s)]
*  He's a crazy, we're not African. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6677.92s)]
*  We're Italian. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6680.72s)]
*  No, we you're misunderstanding me genetically. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6682.12s)]
*  You know, we now we have the genome. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6686.16s)]
*  Yeah, we can stop worrying about race. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6688.36s)]
*  There isn't any. There's no race. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6691.24s)]
*  We just look different. Yes. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6692.639999999999s)]
*  But we're not. We're not at all. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6694.32s)]
*  Isn't that isn't that reassuring? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6697.44s)]
*  It is to me. It's fascinating. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6699.4s)]
*  It's fascinating. It is reassuring. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6701.44s)]
*  And one of the beautiful things about art and particularly music [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6704.0s)]
*  is that you can get a message like that across. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6707.44s)]
*  And because people love the music and they listen to it over and over again, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6711.92s)]
*  they'll remember your concert. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6715.24s)]
*  It'll resonate and it becomes a part of the way you think. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6716.48s)]
*  It enhances the way people think. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6721.0s)]
*  And that idea, like like like a positive mind virus [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6723.76s)]
*  will grow in your head. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6729.04s)]
*  Well, we hope so. It does. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6731.16s)]
*  It's a bit like when I sing us and them now, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6733.08s)]
*  I stop playing my bass when we get to with without [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6735.92s)]
*  and who denies what the fighting is all about. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6739.28s)]
*  Because I wrote that in 1972. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6742.48s)]
*  Wow. OK, that line. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6745.44s)]
*  And it's still fucking true. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6748.28s)]
*  That's crazy. You know, so you wrote that line during Vietnam. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6750.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6753.68s)]
*  I was a small boy. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6756.48s)]
*  Forward he cried from the rear and the front rank died. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6757.76s)]
*  So that's like that's another version of the bravery [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6761.5599999999995s)]
*  of being out of range, which I wrote in 1990. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6764.4s)]
*  So I wrote 1990. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6767.12s)]
*  I wrote the bravery of being out of range. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6768.639999999999s)]
*  So that's 20 years after I wrote us and them. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6770.88s)]
*  And us and them is only about two strangers passing in the street [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6775.04s)]
*  because there is no us and them. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6779.32s)]
*  It's all us. Right. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6780.88s)]
*  And so but the people with the money who buy the elections [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6782.28s)]
*  that you were describing in the Citizens United [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6787.12s)]
*  bit of our conversation, they would have us. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6789.88s)]
*  They own all the newspapers and the TV state, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6792.64s)]
*  and they would have us believe that the us and them is real [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6795.04s)]
*  and that we are good and they are evil. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6798.96s)]
*  That's why we've got to kill them all. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6802.4s)]
*  Yeah. And they sell that lie. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6804.8s)]
*  And some people believe it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6807.48s)]
*  Intelligent people believe it. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6809.4s)]
*  That was what was so disturbing about that conversation [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6810.76s)]
*  that you had with the gentleman on CNN. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6813.04s)]
*  Right. Was that that was an us versus them conversation. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6815.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6818.64s)]
*  I'm not sure Michael McConnish is a gentleman. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6821.88s)]
*  What do you call him? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6826.04s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't have him in my club. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6827.32s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6829.64s)]
*  That was Scratch Show Marks. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6832.32s)]
*  He's a guy working for a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6833.76s)]
*  I know. I mean, that's what CNN is. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6837.44s)]
*  I know. Yeah. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6839.92s)]
*  I mean, that's if you want to work there, that's what you do. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6841.16s)]
*  You know, you want to be a baker. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6843.88s)]
*  You got to work near an oven. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6845.24s)]
*  Go out, show marks, I believe, said, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6847.12s)]
*  I wouldn't want to join a club that would have to remember. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6849.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Did you know something like that? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6852.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I agree with that. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6854.08s)]
*  There was a thing called the intellectual dark web that was [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6856.360000000001s)]
*  a bunch of us that were like sort of different thinkers online. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6859.56s)]
*  And they grouped us all together and called the intellectual dark web. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6865.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh, fuck, no, I'm not. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6869.360000000001s)]
*  So I started calling it the intellectual, the international dark web. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6871.96s)]
*  I started I started calling it all sorts of different things to mock it. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6876.8s)]
*  And well, good. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6880.64s)]
*  Much to the secret chagrin of some of the people that were involved in it. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6881.68s)]
*  But ultimately, it's kind of stopped. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6884.360000000001s)]
*  People stopped talking about it. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6886.12s)]
*  But it was like, listen, don't make a club. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6887.320000000001s)]
*  Just don't do it. Just don't. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6890.160000000001s)]
*  It's just don't even don't even pretend. Yeah. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6892.160000000001s)]
*  It's just people. Yeah. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6895.400000000001s)]
*  It's just humans. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6897.0s)]
*  So lump us in together. Then it's just. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6897.96s)]
*  Yeah, clubs are a problem because they're always exclusive. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6900.72s)]
*  Yeah. One way or another. Yeah. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6903.92s)]
*  So there's plenty of exclusivity in the world. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6907.12s)]
*  We don't need more of it. Yeah. Yeah. True. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6909.64s)]
*  Well, that's one of the beautiful things about music, right, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6913.6s)]
*  that it unites people. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6915.76s)]
*  And one of the beautiful things is that it unites people [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6917.400000000001s)]
*  with different political philosophies, different religious backgrounds, different. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6920.4800000000005s)]
*  If you enjoy music and enjoy art. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6925.04s)]
*  Yeah, it brings people together in a very unique way [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6929.16s)]
*  because they have a they have the connection to this work. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6932.16s)]
*  They have a connection to this thing that this band or this person has created. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6936.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's beautiful. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6940.04s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6942.400000000001s)]
*  Now, it is. You're absolutely right. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6943.84s)]
*  And I don't know why, but I saw a picture of Boeckard [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6946.360000000001s)]
*  the other day because. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6953.360000000001s)]
*  Um. Oh, I know. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6955.6s)]
*  Do I know? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6960.240000000001s)]
*  I was watching a documentary about Buster Keaton and so on. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6961.360000000001s)]
*  How did Boeckard get into that? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6964.56s)]
*  Well, maybe it wasn't maybe that was another thing, but I couldn't look at. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6967.04s)]
*  I was thinking how unbelievably handsome and and elegant [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6970.56s)]
*  Boeckard is sitting there with his knee crossed over like that, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6976.0s)]
*  you know, with the cigarette and whatever. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6979.240000000001s)]
*  Doug Bogart, Doug Dirk. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6981.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's an English actor. Sorry. Sorry. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6984.16s)]
*  I should anyway. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6986.639999999999s)]
*  He was he was in a movie. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6990.4s)]
*  He's death invent. Yeah, there he is. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6991.84s)]
*  An answer. Yeah. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6993.76s)]
*  Well, at the at the opening of Death in Venice, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=6995.32s)]
*  he's sitting in a deck chair on the Lido and it's [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7000.16s)]
*  Marla's Fourth Symphony or is it his fifth fourth? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7005.48s)]
*  I think it's the it's the adagio from Marla's Fourth Symphony. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7008.44s)]
*  And it's just like you just go when you hear that music with those shots, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7012.4s)]
*  him on the Lido and there's a boat going across the Grand Canal [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7018.08s)]
*  or something like that, you just go. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7021.8s)]
*  So so I find classical music often more moving than [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7024.88s)]
*  almost any of the pop music that I'm attached to. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7030.12s)]
*  But if it's if it's [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7033.4s)]
*  if it's popular music, it's for me anyway, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7035.68s)]
*  it's more likely to be Billie Holiday [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7039.48s)]
*  than anything contemporary. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7042.599999999999s)]
*  And I was reading a bit. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7045.24s)]
*  I was reading about [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7047.48s)]
*  God bless the child. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7050.719999999999s)]
*  And I read for the first time the story about [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7052.639999999999s)]
*  because she wrote the lyrics to God bless the child. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7055.48s)]
*  And it's a true story. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7057.799999999999s)]
*  Billie Holiday goes to borrow money from her mother. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7059.2s)]
*  Who won't give her any because she's skin. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7063.36s)]
*  She says she wrote what's skin out of cash broke. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7066.56s)]
*  Oh, she's broke. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7071.56s)]
*  So she goes and tries to borrow money from her mother. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7072.76s)]
*  Who's get the hell out of here or whatever she says to her. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7075.400000000001s)]
*  So Billie Holiday writes God, God bless the child who's got his own. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7078.88s)]
*  Mama may have and Papa may have, but God bless the child who's got his own. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7084.280000000001s)]
*  And when you listen to that lyric, not knowing that it's literal story [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7088.96s)]
*  of her trying to borrow mother from money from a parent. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7095.4800000000005s)]
*  I made up all kinds of stuff about it. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7100.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7102.52s)]
*  Right. God bless the child who's got his own. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7103.92s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7106.120000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7106.88s)]
*  And trying to figure out and then I read now I'm so it takes me. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7107.76s)]
*  I'm 79 years old and I read that's what it was. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7110.96s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7114.0s)]
*  Anyway, what's interesting, because it means different to different people, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7116.64s)]
*  they they attach meaning to things. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7120.76s)]
*  Yeah. And they decide like and they'll have discussions about it, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7122.92s)]
*  much like connecting Dark Side of the Moon to The Wizard of Oz. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7126.88s)]
*  It's like people have decided that there's and it adds to the lore [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7130.240000000001s)]
*  of what the art is. Yeah. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7135.4400000000005s)]
*  No, that's right. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7137.8s)]
*  And I love kind of enigmatic lyrics in in things as I love lyrics [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7138.52s)]
*  that are very direct. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7145.2s)]
*  I was talking about Neil Young earlier, you know, how I lost my friends. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7146.64s)]
*  I still don't understand. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7150.16s)]
*  They got lost in [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7151.44s)]
*  something station so became Pog Bench Mutations in the way they were waiting [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7154.799999999999s)]
*  away, which is an absolute direct. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7159.36s)]
*  But me, I just headed north to where the pavement reads, the road [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7162.0s)]
*  and all that stuff, narrative songs like that. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7165.96s)]
*  But there are also there's also a lot of stuff that is open [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7169.16s)]
*  absolutely to interpretation. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7172.799999999999s)]
*  One I liked of my songs that I like to hear people talking talking about [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7175.28s)]
*  or don't, but I would notice it's like the second verse of Wish You Were Here [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7178.92s)]
*  goes, did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7183.32s)]
*  hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7187.76s)]
*  And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7192.52s)]
*  Well, there's so many ideas all wrapped up in that in those words. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7197.16s)]
*  I know what they mean for me, but a lot of people sometimes [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7202.96s)]
*  either misinterpret or they interpret them in ways that mean something to them. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7207.919999999999s)]
*  I think I think also they attach it to meaning that applies to their own life. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7211.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7216.32s)]
*  Which is cool. Yeah, it is cool. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7219.24s)]
*  It is going there's songs that become an anthem for a period of time in people's [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7222.12s)]
*  lives. And when they hear that song, it just immediately connects them. Yeah. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7227.12s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7234.36s)]
*  It's funny that Hey Teacher Leave Them Kids Alone, which is now been taken up in Iran [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7235.32s)]
*  in all in all the protests in the in the streets because of the beating to death of [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7243.4s)]
*  what's her name? Amsar. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7250.759999999999s)]
*  Amini is the girl's name who died for incorrectly wearing her headscarf, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7255.639999999999s)]
*  incorrectly wearing her hijab. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7261.48s)]
*  It's fascinating what an uprising has come from that all over the world. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7263.5599999999995s)]
*  I saw this massive protest in New York City and countries all over the world. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7268.4s)]
*  Yeah. And in Iran, it's it's it's wild right now. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7272.92s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't go on yesterday to check it out, but they're still killing people in [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7277.4s)]
*  the streets. Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7282.599999999999s)]
*  The government. It's a tricky situation because. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7286.599999999999s)]
*  Obviously, I'm against the idea of a theocracy under any terms, just as much of [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7290.28s)]
*  the Iranian mullahs, the Ayatollah, as I am against the Israeli state, which is [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7297.28s)]
*  another theocracy and and whatever. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7303.28s)]
*  But but I'm also very wary of and not that it hasn't stopped me making videos and [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7305.719999999999s)]
*  sending my support to the protesters and saying because it's separate from the [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7312.719999999999s)]
*  politics of the thing, because there's a lot of there's a lot of talk that is [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7316.52s)]
*  encouraging the destruction of Iran in the right wing of politics in the United [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7323.52s)]
*  States. What Wesley Clark was talking about on there, because they are on the list. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7329.6s)]
*  Right. They're going to be just there on the list of countries that need to be [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7333.8s)]
*  destroyed. And and obviously anyway, what am I trying to say? [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7337.4800000000005s)]
*  But I so I had to make the decision when friends in Iran said to me, look, they've [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7341.84s)]
*  just done this, do something. So I started making videos immediately. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7345.84s)]
*  So of course, hey, I told I leave them kids alone has become big catchphrase in Iran [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7349.400000000001s)]
*  and they're using it. And it was, you know, it started off. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7356.0s)]
*  I was all my work was banned in apartheid South Africa because the kids in the [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7360.16s)]

*  Leave those kids alive. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7367.12s)]
*  It became a protest anthem for them there. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7369.8s)]
*  So I'm really happy. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7372.64s)]
*  I'm really happy that it's fulfills that function in different parts of the world. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7373.76s)]
*  And whenever it does, it's it's always against an errant authority of one kind or [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7378.64s)]
*  another, which again, which again is sort of the story of my life. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7385.360000000001s)]
*  I don't care who you are or what country you rule. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7389.72s)]
*  If you're in authority and you get in it wrong and and not adhering to the [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7394.320000000001s)]
*  Universal Declaration of Human Rights from Paris in 1948, I'm against you. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7401.360000000001s)]
*  And the rest of it, I don't care about really, but I care about that. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7406.64s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, most countries, when they get to a position of power, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7410.8s)]
*  don't adhere. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7415.72s)]
*  No, they don't. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7417.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the it's almost like the default setting. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7418.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7420.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is almost a default setting. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7421.799999999999s)]
*  It would be nice to see to allow a bit more leeway, particularly say in Latin [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7424.719999999999s)]
*  America, took the new Colombian administration or the new president of [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7430.0s)]
*  Chile or the whatever. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7435.44s)]
*  If we leave them alone and let them get on with it, whether or not they might [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7436.679999999999s)]
*  develop societies where they can be a part of the world, they can be a part of [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7442.08s)]
*  societies where they don't feel that they need the heel of the jackboot to [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7448.44s)]
*  retain to maintain control of her. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7455.48s)]
*  You know. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7457.28s)]
*  So it's hard to know because we the West, the UK and the United States and and [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7458.84s)]
*  the rest of NATO have interfered mightily in experiments in other ways to address [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7466.12s)]
*  social responsibility of governments in other economic models, say like in [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7472.5599999999995s)]
*  Venezuela or in Chile or places where we attempt to depose the duly elected [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7479.639999999999s)]
*  democratic government. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7485.28s)]
*  Isn't it almost ironic that the one country that was founded within the last [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7488.12s)]
*  few hundred years to escape from the control of a dictatorship became the [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7493.679999999999s)]
*  country that intervenes in more countries government than any. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7499.12s)]
*  Yeah. It's pretty wild. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7504.32s)]
*  If you really think about the origins of the United States. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7505.96s)]
*  Yeah. But what's what's what's really what's really interesting is, yes, it is [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7508.6s)]
*  very, very interesting. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7514.12s)]
*  It's fascinating. But if you read the Constitution, you've probably read your [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7515.44s)]
*  Constitution more carefully than I had in the Bill of Rights and the whatever and [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7519.36s)]
*  the way the Electoral College was set up. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7523.88s)]
*  It was sort of set up so that the people never really have a chance to have any [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7526.04s)]
*  power in it. It's set up to be ruled by the elite who created and wrote the [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7531.64s)]
*  Constitution. But what I was going to say was what was I going to say? [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7536.04s)]
*  Isn't it? Yeah. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7541.24s)]
*  But it's interesting as well that the media is so powerful and so sewn up and [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7542.6s)]
*  says the same thing in context. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7549.36s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans, all of it together, which is no, we're the good [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7551.48s)]
*  guys. Yeah. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7556.44s)]
*  And somehow it gets ignored that the United States of America has interfered [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7557.76s)]
*  in more elections and have been involved in more coups and invaded more countries [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7563.28s)]
*  and deposed more democratically elected. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7568.2s)]
*  Yeah. Not least the government of the Ukraine in 2014. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7571.04s)]
*  And it's not it's like it. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7576.4s)]
*  None of it ever happened, you'd think. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7578.44s)]
*  Yeah. We wave the flag and it no, we're good. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7580.36s)]
*  Everything's great. No, it's not. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7584.32s)]
*  It just it just isn't. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7586.5199999999995s)]
*  We just have so much momentum in this country for the dissemination of [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7589.4s)]
*  propaganda that to like put a halt to that and start objectively analyzing the [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7595.0s)]
*  United States role and all these foreign conflicts and where money has played [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7599.96s)]
*  a part. And what are the motivating factors for us to getting get involved in [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7604.84s)]
*  this and who stands to profit and what are the what are the forces behind this [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7609.24s)]
*  to expect that from mainstream media at this point? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7613.88s)]
*  It's like, you know, they they're almost like, well, that's just not what we do. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7618.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, the unfortunate thing is, and without wishing to decry all journalists [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7622.8s)]
*  everywhere, but most of them in the mainstream media, the problem is that if [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7627.5199999999995s)]
*  you speak up against the story that they're selling on behalf of the ruling [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7633.2s)]
*  class, you get fired. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7640.12s)]
*  You get fired. Yeah, you're gone. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7641.36s)]
*  Just happened to Katie Helper from the Hill. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7643.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. She she agreed with Rashida to leave the Israeli isn't apartheid endeavor, [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7645.92s)]
*  which it obviously is. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7651.0s)]
*  You're fired. You're not allowed to say that. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7652.2s)]
*  So it's it's it's really problematic. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7655.24s)]
*  And it may well be that in journalism school, they they may well teach people now [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7658.44s)]
*  that you have to be really careful to toe the line. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7662.92s)]
*  You can only say what they want you to say. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7667.36s)]
*  You can't. That I nearly said little prick, but the guy from Rolling Stone, [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7669.12s)]
*  he's not from Rolling Stone, who interviewed me the other day. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7674.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no, no, no, not Michael. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7678.76s)]
*  This was this was Rolling Stone. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7680.56s)]
*  This was like two days ago. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7682.4s)]
*  I was a bit under under the collar about it two days ago because it was a hatchet [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7684.32s)]
*  job. If you if you don't believe me, read it. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7689.04s)]
*  But I know you do believe me. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7692.16s)]
*  I believe you. Anyway, this kid. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7694.16s)]
*  Yeah, we were having a conversation. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7697.5599999999995s)]
*  I was talking to him about something where there is a narrative and we we. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7699.2s)]
*  Yeah, I will. I'll just say this one. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7704.88s)]
*  OK, and it it's. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7706.92s)]
*  It's about Syria and it's about false flag and it's about chemical weapons [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7710.5599999999995s)]
*  and it's about Duma and it's about April the 13th and it's about [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7715.08s)]
*  the OPCW and it's about the inspectors, Ian Henderson and Inspector Bean. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7718.32s)]
*  It's about the whole narrative and about how it was taken eventually [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7724.639999999999s)]
*  to the Security Council by Aaron Marte from Gray's Own and others and blah, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7728.0s)]
*  blah, blah. So that so there are two narratives. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7732.16s)]
*  One is a sad, gassed people, which is the officially accepted narrative. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7734.84s)]
*  And the other is that he didn't. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7739.639999999999s)]
*  It was a false flag by the by Al Nusra and Al Qaeda, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7742.0s)]
*  who were in Duma in control of the place on the day it happened, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7746.36s)]
*  but left the next day because they'd already given up. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7749.96s)]
*  And the Assad government actually sent the buses to take them all away, saying, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7753.719999999999s)]
*  let's not fight in the streets. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7758.36s)]
*  You've lost. You can go anywhere. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7761.12s)]
*  So this kid said, started accusing me because. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7763.679999999999s)]
*  I've done so much reading and research into this particular subject, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7769.5199999999995s)]
*  and I've been in a lot of trouble since 2018 [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7774.4s)]
*  because I stood up on stage in in in Barcelona [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7778.2s)]
*  and expressed my misgivings only because the United States and the UK [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7783.64s)]
*  and the Republic of France were about to go and bomb Syria in reprisal [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7787.88s)]
*  for a chemical weapons attack that there was a huge amount of [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7794.16s)]
*  doubt about. All I did was I stood up on stage and said, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7799.04s)]
*  could we just wait and find out what really happened? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7802.5199999999995s)]
*  See what the OPCW says and whatever before we go bombing a foreign [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7806.679999999999s)]
*  sovereign country? No, they didn't. They went bomb Syria anyway. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7811.24s)]
*  So why am I telling you this? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7814.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, because he just shouted me down in the conversation. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7817.2s)]
*  Shouted you down. Yeah. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7819.96s)]
*  Just just said and accused me in the post thing [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7821.639999999999s)]
*  of being a conspiracy theorist and having weird ideas about. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7825.679999999999s)]
*  How old was this gentleman? [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7830.16s)]
*  Not old, old enough to know better. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7831.84s)]
*  He's called James Ball. Yeah. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7835.24s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't describe his break. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7838.96s)]
*  I said he was a little prick. Yeah. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7840.8s)]
*  And so he was shouting anyway. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7846.360000000001s)]
*  Well, you can listen to it. OK. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7848.76s)]
*  You know, anyway, but we never resolved anything. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7850.2s)]
*  That's the problem. The thing is that, you know, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7853.28s)]
*  oh, and he claims to run something called [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7855.76s)]
*  the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7858.84s)]
*  Oh, really? And you buy this [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7864.4s)]
*  story of the Duma chemical as if it was absolutely the truth. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7868.28s)]
*  And you know it. How do you know? [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7873.04s)]
*  Oh, I know people in, you know, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7875.12s)]
*  the smacks of Bellingcat and Elliot Higgins and all of that stuff. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7878.04s)]
*  And the intermingling of the security services, [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7882.2s)]
*  both in England and on the South of the and probably in Russia. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7886.16s)]
*  And God knows where else, you know, none of this is you can't believe anything. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7889.639999999999s)]
*  You really do have to read everything and you have to read the small print [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7895.72s)]
*  and you have to look in if you want to know the truth about things that happen. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7900.96s)]
*  When you're doing something like that, you're reading both sides [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7904.88s)]
*  and you're trying to get an objective assessment of what actually happened. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7908.16s)]
*  How do you discern? How do you? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7912.48s)]
*  Well, well, you have to read everything. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7915.52s)]
*  And particularly you have to read the documents [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7917.84s)]
*  that are leaked by whistleblowers. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7921.8s)]
*  There were new documents as late as 2020 from the OPCW [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7924.72s)]
*  from from a further person who came out and said, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7930.040000000001s)]
*  we I'm going to give you these documents now because they show [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7933.56s)]
*  that what you're saying is true. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7936.72s)]
*  And they show that in Henderson's misgivings about the official OPCW document, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7938.8s)]
*  which was an absolute made up job. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7945.0s)]
*  The guy who runs the OPCW now is called Arias. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7947.84s)]
*  OK, and they they produced a final report on Duma that said [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7951.88s)]
*  it is likely that these people died of chlorine poison [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7956.48s)]
*  from a canister drop from a helicopter or whatever. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7960.68s)]
*  None of the evidence points to that. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7964.24s)]
*  It all points to the fact that that nobody quite knows who killed these people. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7966.88s)]
*  But the evidence all points to the fact that the canisters [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7973.679999999999s)]
*  that were that were found at the site were put there, were placed there, [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7977.0s)]
*  were left there. They were not dropped from the air. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7981.32s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want to go through the whole thing. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7985.2s)]
*  And it's, you know, again, if you want to know about it [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7987.5199999999995s)]
*  or if anyone out there wants to know about it, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7990.36s)]
*  you should read Aaron Marte's articles in the gray zone. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7992.8s)]
*  That's the first place to go. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7995.84s)]
*  And then you should read, I've forgotten his name, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=7997.92s)]
*  but the guy who actually started the OPCW, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8000.32s)]
*  who was fired because he started asking questions. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8003.2s)]
*  You should read what he has to say about it. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8007.48s)]
*  This is the guy who started the, you know, [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8010.0s)]
*  the OPCW, the something for protection of chemical weapons. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8014.32s)]
*  I can't remember what the O stands for. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8020.32s)]
*  Anyway, I'm going to stop talking about it. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8022.36s)]
*  So this this person who shouted you down, they had not read all this. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8024.16s)]
*  No. So they had this narrow minded perspective, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8029.8s)]
*  this one one side perspective, which is the mainstream narrative. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8033.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they and if you question it, they say you're a conspiracy [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8036.360000000001s)]
*  theorist and a Putin apologist and a Russian bot. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8040.28s)]
*  And this they just call you names, call you names and laugh at you [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8044.400000000001s)]
*  as if you're an idiot. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8048.4400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, which obviously I'm not. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8050.64s)]
*  And I had read an awful lot more than this, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8054.52s)]
*  which is why we couldn't have a conversation about it, [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8056.68s)]
*  because he hadn't read any of this stuff. I've read it all. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8059.400000000001s)]
*  Well, you always have to be when someone starts shouting you down [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8063.08s)]
*  and they haven't read the other side of it. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8066.280000000001s)]
*  That's never a good sign. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8068.280000000001s)]
*  No, it's never a good way to show the veracity of your argument. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8069.68s)]
*  No. Well, and it's public so people can listen to the conversation. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8073.4800000000005s)]
*  But they may go. But he and somebody else from Rolling Stone. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8077.64s)]
*  The very next day, I yesterday, they came. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8082.56s)]
*  They recorded a conversation between the two of them [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8085.759999999999s)]
*  before playing a recording of the conversation I'd had with the little prick. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8088.96s)]
*  And and that conversation they had was 10 minutes of hatchet job. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8094.2s)]
*  I can't believe he said that about the Jews. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8099.96s)]
*  You know, that sort of thing. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8102.599999999999s)]
*  Are you trying to make up make up the story that I'm an anti-Semite? Right. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8103.639999999999s)]
*  Again. Yeah. And load that onto. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8108.24s)]
*  I wonder why people do that. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8110.96s)]
*  Do you think they do that to just support their own argument, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8112.44s)]
*  to try to make it look like it makes more sense what they're saying [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8115.5599999999995s)]
*  and then calling you a conspiracy theorist? [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8119.16s)]
*  So just for their own ego? [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8121.4s)]
*  Is it? No. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8124.28s)]
*  Do you think that this is something that they're being encouraged to do [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8125.32s)]
*  by the publication? [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8128.48s)]
*  Well, the anti-Semite thing, if I could take that for they do it [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8129.599999999999s)]
*  because they have no argument. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8132.679999999999s)]
*  There is no position. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8134.599999999999s)]
*  There is no defense for the apartheid state of Israel [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8136.719999999999s)]
*  and its occupation of the Palestinian land. None. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8140.32s)]
*  And so by calling you an anti-Semite, they just stop the conversation [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8144.759999999999s)]
*  dead in its tracks because that's an indefensible position. Exactly. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8147.84s)]
*  Yeah. And you can't and you're not allowed to say, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8151.88s)]
*  I'm not right. You're not allowed to. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8155.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you once put the star of David on the side of a pig in a show. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8159.24s)]
*  Yeah, but I also put this hammer and sickle and the crescent and whatever [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8162.719999999999s)]
*  and a dollar sign and, you know, yeah. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8167.16s)]
*  No, but you put the yeah, well, it's a symbol of an oppressive state. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8170.32s)]
*  You know, yeah, your I am lumping you in. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8175.36s)]
*  But you're not it's not like just you. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8179.2s)]
*  Right. But that's that is just me criticizing the policies of your government. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8182.599999999999s)]
*  And I'm afraid the star of David does represent the nation [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8188.0s)]
*  that is committing the crime of apartheid every day [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8192.16s)]
*  and murdering Palestinians every day, men, women and children every single day. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8196.0s)]
*  So. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8203.08s)]
*  And I'm unapologetic about it. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8206.800000000001s)]
*  But at the time, when it happened, which was in 2013, I think somebody complained [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8209.64s)]
*  and I thought, God, this is more trouble than it's worth. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8215.2s)]
*  I actually took it off after a few gigs because I was sick of it. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8217.72s)]
*  And at the time, the ADL said, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8222.36s)]
*  well, we don't approve of everything he does, but he's not an anti-Semite. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8225.6s)]
*  But by God, they've changed their mind now. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8229.0s)]
*  They they, you know, they constantly and it's not just me, obviously. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8231.52s)]
*  They say it's mere anyone, anyone [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8236.480000000001s)]
*  who dares to suggest that there's something bad about their policies. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8240.68s)]
*  And so that's why the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8246.36s)]
*  is so bad and so dangerous and why the guy who wrote it has said, I'm sorry. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8252.44s)]
*  It's been taken completely out of the context that I meant it. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8258.6s)]
*  He's called George Steve or some forgotten his name, sadly. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8262.92s)]
*  But he said he stood up in public on many occasions [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8267.16s)]
*  speaking to academics and, you know, colleges and whatever and said, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8271.04s)]
*  I really apologize for writing this [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8275.64s)]
*  because it's been taken in completely the wrong way. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8278.56s)]
*  And I wish I'd never suggested it. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8282.0s)]
*  I was, you know, influenced by people I shouldn't have been influenced by. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8285.36s)]
*  And it's bullshit. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8290.28s)]
*  The guy wrote it, but they've got they're off and running. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8291.84s)]
*  And so but it has to be it has to be walked back from the IHRA, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8295.88s)]
*  the International Holocaust Remembrance Association Alliance, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8301.8s)]
*  sorry, Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8306.64s)]
*  You can't take a word and change its meaning completely. Right. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8311.72s)]
*  Oh, you can. But you'd have to get everybody [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8315.599999999999s)]
*  anything to do with dictionaries to agree to change the meaning. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8318.24s)]
*  If you want anti-Semitism to mean criticism of the Israeli government, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8323.24s)]
*  you have to say this isn't like the anti-Semitism that we talked about, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8327.2s)]
*  which is where you where where you're down or criticize [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8331.720000000001s)]
*  or say bad things about Jewish people or the Jewish faith. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8336.0s)]
*  That's what anti-Semitism means to me. Yes. And to everybody else. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8341.480000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't you put the idea that you can't that Israel can be behave [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8346.12s)]
*  like people in the past behave towards Jews in northern Europe. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8351.400000000001s)]
*  No, it can't mean that. It cannot mean that. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8357.2s)]
*  No, it can't. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8362.04s)]
*  To criticize your behavior now is not anti-Semitic. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8363.480000000001s)]
*  It's something else. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8367.560000000001s)]
*  It's being it's being in favor of equal human rights for Palestinians. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8368.960000000001s)]
*  So it's being in favor of the Palestinians having rights [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8374.52s)]
*  is not anti-Semitic. It's pro-human rights. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8379.08s)]
*  It's pro-human being. Yeah. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8383.400000000001s)]
*  It's pro the culture of the world. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8385.4s)]
*  Yeah. When when you did that show in Florida and they the Jewish group [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8387.359999999999s)]
*  removed the children from the show, did you replace them with other children? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8392.44s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine those poor kids who were going to come and do the show. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8395.8s)]
*  Would have been an amazing experience for them. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8399.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm in contact with quite a lot of the kids [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8403.48s)]
*  that have worked with us in shows. Yeah. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8405.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because some of the stories, you know, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8408.76s)]
*  particularly in South America, where they were a bit [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8412.76s)]
*  bit needier than in Europe, they were by and large fairly all right. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8415.320000000002s)]
*  But in the United States, we did a thing. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8419.04s)]
*  They've just come back to me. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8424.68s)]
*  We had these kids who were a bit older than usual, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8426.12s)]
*  and they were in Oakland up in the Bay Area. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8429.84s)]
*  And there were black kids, all black kids. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8433.84s)]
*  You know, and the boys had sort of almost had mustaches [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8436.48s)]
*  and they were surly and uncooperative [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8439.64s)]
*  and really, you know, very difficult to work with and didn't want to. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8445.6s)]
*  You know, and it was hard work. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8452.56s)]
*  And I can remember feeling a bit negative towards these people. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8455.0s)]
*  Anyway, they did it and they did the show and they were fine and whatever. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8459.279999999999s)]
*  And like a week later, there was a phone call came in another city [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8463.56s)]
*  into the production office and it was a guy on the phone and he was talking [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8468.0s)]
*  to one of the girls in the office. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8472.8s)]
*  And he wanted to talk about these kids and she was busy and went, Yeah, what? [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8475.56s)]
*  What? You know, and he said, Well, hold on a minute. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8480.039999999999s)]
*  Don't get short with me. I want to talk to somebody. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8482.76s)]
*  And I didn't talk to him. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8486.92s)]
*  I didn't talk to him. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8489.039999999999s)]
*  And I didn't talk to him, but somebody just went, Oh, well, hold on. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8491.08s)]
*  Who is that? Oh, it's Sean from Oakland. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8495.4s)]
*  Whatever. I brought the kids to the show. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8497.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Hi, Sean. How are you doing? [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8499.76s)]
*  He said, Good, but I think I need to say something. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8501.880000000001s)]
*  Could you pass this on to Roger? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8504.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He said, Because I could see it was difficult working with my kids. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8507.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8511.68s)]
*  He said, Well, I want to tell you about those kids. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8513.68s)]
*  He said, None of them has two parents of those 12 kids, boys or girls. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8516.320000000002s)]
*  They either have a mother or a father, but none of them have both. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8523.480000000001s)]
*  If they have a mother, she's a hooker and she's a junkie. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8528.6s)]
*  If they have a father, he's in prison. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8532.960000000001s)]
*  So if they were a bit uncooperative, I can I can feel myself getting emotional. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8536.52s)]
*  That's why. Wow. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8542.28s)]
*  And he said, The other thing I want to tell you is this. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8544.04s)]
*  He said. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8552.240000000002s)]
*  Nothing like that has ever happened to any of those children before, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8559.160000000002s)]
*  and they've talked about nothing else since they came and did that show. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8563.640000000001s)]
*  That's the first thing that they've ever done that they're proud of. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8569.560000000001s)]
*  Those kids. Wow. I know. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8574.480000000001s)]
*  I think I was in Chicago. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8580.400000000001s)]
*  That night, I tell you what I can tell you, I don't know why. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8584.92s)]
*  Yeah, I do know why I'm telling you, because you were, you know, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8587.480000000001s)]
*  we were having an open conversation. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8589.76s)]
*  I think I was in Chicago. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8591.6s)]
*  Steve Bing, do you know who that is? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8593.160000000002s)]
*  He's a rich bloke from L.A. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8595.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Got left a ton of money and he was in film production and this and that. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8597.12s)]
*  And he was a strange bloke. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8601.320000000002s)]
*  He killed himself in the end. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8602.52s)]
*  Somebody told me that the other night. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8605.36s)]
*  I said, do you know that Bing threw himself off a 27 story building? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8607.0s)]
*  When did that happen? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8610.76s)]
*  I don't know. A few weeks ago, I think, or months ago. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8611.720000000001s)]
*  I honestly don't know, because I hadn't spoken to Steve for years. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8614.32s)]
*  So I don't know. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8620.12s)]
*  He had more money than sense, and he did a lot of. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8621.560000000001s)]
*  Drunk junk. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8625.12s)]
*  Anyway, that's not the thing, but he happened to be in Chicago [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8627.800000000001s)]
*  and came to the gig in Chicago. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8631.4s)]
*  And when I and when I heard this news about these kids in Oakland. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8633.359999999999s)]
*  So I said, you should send them some money, Steve. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8638.72s)]
*  You're rich to this group of kids in Oakland so they can maybe do something [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8641.119999999999s)]
*  theatrical, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8646.48s)]
*  And and he said, well, you've got my why don't you send them some money? [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8649.8s)]
*  And so I think we sent them either 50 or 25 grand each. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8655.88s)]
*  And I was really glad that so they got a check for 50 or 100 grand. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8661.56s)]
*  I don't know what it was. I can't remember. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8665.96s)]
*  But they did. And I never spoke to the guy again. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8668.72s)]
*  And I have no idea what happened to the money. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8671.039999999999s)]
*  And I don't know. But I do remember when I heard him say [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8673.08s)]
*  that's the most important thing that's ever happened to these children. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8677.199999999999s)]
*  It's amazing, isn't it? [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8681.72s)]
*  You touch those lives, however briefly. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8682.84s)]
*  And that's and you brought it up because you talked about the kids in North Miami [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8686.24s)]
*  who weren't allowed to sing with me because some prick had told the mayor [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8690.4s)]
*  that I'm an anti-Semite, some probably very worthy feeling, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8695.0s)]
*  you know, local Jewish community associational. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8700.52s)]
*  And I'm sure they believe it. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8704.32s)]
*  They probably think I'm bloody, you know, gobbles or somebody. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8705.72s)]
*  Well, it's a very defensive position that's taken up by many people [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8709.4s)]
*  where any criticism of the policies of Israel is anti-Semitic. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8713.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like an absolute, almost a binary thing. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8717.4s)]
*  It's either you're on or off. You're either with us or against us. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8721.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, luckily, I mean, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8724.679999999998s)]
*  I have lots of, you know, close friends [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8728.359999999999s)]
*  who are in organizations all over the world [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8732.039999999999s)]
*  who are actually Jewish people in Jewish voice for labor. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8737.48s)]
*  I won't mention the names, but [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8740.839999999998s)]
*  cloak become close friends of mine. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8743.72s)]
*  So it's a weirdly divisive thing that anybody should think [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8746.32s)]
*  that the settler colonial project in Palestine has anything to do with Judaism. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8751.52s)]
*  It shouldn't have, you know, if you're going to be a settler [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8758.32s)]
*  colonialist nation and subjugate the indigenous people to death. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8762.56s)]
*  Well, OK, but you can't do it under the cloak of your religion. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8769.4s)]
*  And so you can't criticize this because of my religion. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8776.48s)]
*  As I said to you before, how would that be if we suddenly [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8779.92s)]
*  decided the United States was a theocracy and only Christians could have rights? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8783.32s)]
*  What? What? Yeah. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8789.24s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, it would be insane. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8793.64s)]
*  It's it's somehow well, it's removed from our just [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8795.6s)]
*  it's not discussed publicly. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8801.96s)]
*  It's it's also removed from our view. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8803.6s)]
*  It's not something that we see. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8805.44s)]
*  We're not over there. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8807.0s)]
*  So unless you go and I've had friends that have gone over there [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8808.16s)]
*  and Abby Martin in particular, who's come on the podcast and said, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8811.0s)]
*  talked about the atrocities that are committed there [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8814.560000000001s)]
*  and even attacks on journalists and murdering of journalists. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8817.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Over there by Israeli troops. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8821.08s)]
*  And, you know, she just gets mercilessly attacked for for talking about this. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8823.880000000001s)]
*  She even interviewed people on the street in Israel [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8829.24s)]
*  and asked them questions about Palestinians and got these horrific responses. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8832.24s)]
*  Yeah. Dehumanizing the othering of those people. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8837.119999999999s)]
*  I know them both. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8841.24s)]
*  I know Mike and Abby very well. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8842.16s)]
*  And I believe you. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8844.24s)]
*  And I've heard those stories from her as well. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8846.199999999999s)]
*  Well, they are. It's a small country and they're a long way away. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8849.36s)]
*  And the press is completely well, it's not actually funny enough. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8853.8s)]
*  There's one independent paper called Haaretz in in in Israel. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8858.64s)]
*  And a close friend of mine, who is an Israeli Jew, writes articles for it. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8863.359999999999s)]
*  And they're very humane and the very but somehow they just get [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8868.8s)]
*  brushed aside into his name's Gideon Levy. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8872.519999999999s)]
*  If you ever want to look up somebody who's making sense [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8875.72s)]
*  from from, you know, that side of the tracks or that part of the world. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8879.8s)]
*  Gideon's your man. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8884.64s)]
*  And I don't know why. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8886.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8889.199999999999s)]
*  It's very hard to shine a light brightly enough that people go, oh, I get it. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8889.88s)]
*  Yeah. And particularly if the leader of your great country is going, [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8896.039999999999s)]
*  I don't want to hear anything. I'm not interested. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8900.679999999998s)]
*  I will be the greatest supporter of Israel. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8903.92s)]
*  One three million percent that there's ever been ever in the whole history [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8907.72s)]
*  of everything, whatever they do. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8913.119999999999s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8916.28s)]
*  There's no political consequences for saying that, though. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8917.28s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8919.6s)]
*  You can say that and there's zero political consequences. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8920.72s)]
*  But if you do talk about the Palestinian people and their rights [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8924.76s)]
*  and the plight of the Palestinians, then you are connected to Hamas. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8928.8s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're connected to this terrorist organization. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8933.52s)]
*  And it doesn't matter about those people. Yeah. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8937.08s)]
*  It's the narrative is support of Israel equals you're on the right side. Yeah. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8940.4s)]
*  Yeah. Regardless of how their policies impact individual human beings [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8945.84s)]
*  through no fault of their own, just happen to be born Palestinian [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8951.16s)]
*  and been stuck in this apartheid state. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8954.76s)]
*  And that's the other thing is that they, you know, [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8958.52s)]
*  it's very binary in that way. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8963.28s)]
*  It's like you're there with Israel or you're with Hamas. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8964.68s)]
*  You're with this terrorist organization that puts its people in danger purposely [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8967.960000000001s)]
*  and uses them as cannon fodder so they can gain support internationally [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8972.2s)]
*  and does all these human rights atrocities and launches missiles at Israel. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8976.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, I know. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8983.08s)]
*  I hear all of this just the same as you do. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8984.68s)]
*  But they're just human. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8987.560000000001s)]
*  Well, they're also the democratically elected government of Gaza. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8989.240000000002s)]
*  Hamas. OK. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8993.52s)]
*  And there is an armed wing and whatever. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8995.28s)]
*  But if you actually read international law at all, [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=8997.720000000001s)]
*  the Geneva Conventions and occupied people have an absolute legal [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9000.76s)]
*  and moral right to resist the occupation. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9005.6s)]
*  And this is a fact that is not banded about when they talk about [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9009.960000000001s)]
*  firing rockets into Israel, which almost never do any damage [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9015.08s)]
*  because they're very ineffectual. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9019.04s)]
*  But it's and then another thing that is a great worry [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9020.960000000001s)]
*  to the Palestinian community is that the Israelis seem now to have a policy [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9026.4s)]
*  of pushing them, murdering so many of them that they are absolutely trying [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9032.4s)]
*  to create another interval so they can make it an armed conflict [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9037.76s)]
*  where they're a thousand times, ten thousand times more powerful [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9042.92s)]
*  than the Palestinian people who they are hoping will arm themselves [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9048.88s)]
*  and the young people gather together in bands and try and have [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9052.88s)]
*  an insurrection and armed into so they can just kill them all. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9056.04s)]
*  When you say that Hamas is the democratically elected leaders of Palestine, [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9059.76s)]
*  how corrupt, I didn't say of Palestine, I said of Gaza. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9064.56s)]
*  Excuse me, of Gaza. Yeah. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9067.24s)]
*  How corrupt is that election? [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9068.76s)]
*  I have no idea. I wasn't there, but it was in 2011. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9072.88s)]
*  I think it was the house. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9076.6s)]
*  There've been an election since then. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9078.88s)]
*  I don't know how you would organize anything in Gaza, which is a prison. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9080.24s)]
*  Right. It's got borders. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9084.92s)]
*  The Israelis control who comes in and goes out. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9086.68s)]
*  They open fire on Palestinian fishing boats again yesterday. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9088.960000000001s)]
*  So I can't really answer that question because I'm not there. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9094.48s)]
*  And and I don't know. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9098.56s)]
*  Does anybody have a clear path of resolution that makes sense [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9099.880000000001s)]
*  for that area where they could sit down and come up with some sort of humane, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9104.800000000001s)]
*  logical, compassionate way. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9109.28s)]
*  To mitigate some of these problems. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9112.52s)]
*  Does anyone? Yeah, I do. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9115.0s)]
*  What is your you do? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9116.68s)]
*  You give equal human rights to people. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9118.880000000001s)]
*  And you would have to stop the occupation and stop one group of people [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9121.44s)]
*  oppressing another group of people. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9126.44s)]
*  You would have to accept the principles [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9128.28s)]
*  of Paris 1948 and everything would develop from that. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9131.880000000001s)]
*  Then you could have a process. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9137.48s)]
*  You could all get on a plane and go to Oslo and have meetings. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9139.28s)]
*  They did that once before, but nobody stood by anything that was agreed in Oslo. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9142.44s)]
*  It was just a delaying process to consolidate [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9147.68s)]
*  the occupation of Palestine, i.e. the settlement building, [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9151.92s)]
*  the private roads, all of that stuff. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9156.28s)]
*  But yeah, but you would need the will. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9159.12s)]
*  You would need the will of the Israeli government, and then it could move forward. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9162.36s)]
*  Is there any discussion from the Israeli government or from Israel [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9167.560000000001s)]
*  about the human rights of the people of Gaza? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9171.84s)]
*  None. None. They're implacable. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9174.72s)]
*  All they want is for Liz Trust to move the [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9177.76s)]
*  UK embassy to Jerusalem and compound the problem, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9181.12s)]
*  just like Donald Trump did when he did that. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9185.4s)]
*  And he exacerbated the problem beyond all measure, because it's like, oh, look, [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9188.48s)]
*  the the president of the United States has said, it's all right [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9193.48s)]
*  for us to annex the Golan Heights and occupy the whole of what was left of [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9198.12s)]
*  Palestine in 1967 and establish an apartheid state. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9202.880000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump says it's OK. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9207.92s)]
*  Even though the whole international community up until that time had said, no, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9210.560000000001s)]
*  Jerusalem, it cannot be [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9215.84s)]
*  all combined under the control of the state of Israel. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9220.2s)]
*  That is not what we all agreed in 1947, and it's not what was. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9225.4s)]
*  And so the occupation in 1967 of East Jerusalem was illegal and still is. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9230.039999999999s)]
*  All the settlements in the occupied territory are illegal [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9237.76s)]
*  and under not not just under international law, [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9242.4s)]
*  but under the Fourth Geneva Convention as well. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9246.16s)]
*  And it's also illegal not to allow the refugees to return into Israel as well. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9249.8s)]
*  You can't do it. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9255.04s)]
*  It's illegal. But the fact that international law, as we know, [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9257.44s)]
*  because the United States isn't a party to the Treaty of Rome. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9261.0s)]
*  That they said, well, we're not we didn't sign any of those treaties, [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9267.08s)]
*  so we're not subject to international laws. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9271.2s)]
*  So. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9274.36s)]
*  And. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9276.36s)]
*  The United Nations Charter is a wonderful document, but unfortunately, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9278.44s)]
*  the United Nations came in the ashes of the Second World War [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9287.12s)]
*  and included within its charter is the fact that the five [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9291.720000000001s)]
*  permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, France, England, [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9297.68s)]
*  China and Russia all have the power of veto of any resolution. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9305.44s)]
*  So the United Nations actually has no teeth if you have the power of veto. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9313.52s)]
*  So you get anything to do with Israel is always vetoed. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9318.640000000001s)]
*  Any resolution that says they better stop behaving badly [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9323.12s)]
*  and do the right thing, as my mother would say, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9326.28s)]
*  is always vetoed by Israel, the United States, the Marshall Islands, [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9330.28s)]
*  Australia and a couple of other odds and sods. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9334.72s)]
*  It's always the same five or six people. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9338.24s)]
*  Well, who who support or rather who don't support resolutions [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9341.56s)]
*  in the General Assembly that say Israel should behave better. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9348.039999999999s)]
*  So it's very difficult. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9353.519999999999s)]
*  Thank goodness it exists and that people are allowed to stand up [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9355.0s)]
*  on their hind legs and make speeches. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9358.96s)]
*  And thank goodness that they can make alliances that are outside [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9361.32s)]
*  the control of this of the Security Council. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9365.08s)]
*  But they can't make it. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9368.199999999999s)]
*  They can't exert any pressure. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9369.64s)]
*  There's no they can't make sanctions or they can't. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9371.519999999999s)]
*  They can't exert pressure, which is so it has no teeth. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9376.72s)]
*  But it is a great forum still for discussion. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9379.919999999998s)]
*  I actually spoke not to the General Assembly, but I spoke to the [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9384.08s)]
*  Human Rights Committee of the of the General Assembly of the United Nations [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9389.08s)]
*  in 2000 on the 29th of November 2012. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9395.12s)]
*  I put a suit and tie on and I called them Your Excellencies. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9401.36s)]
*  It was the weirdest. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9406.800000000001s)]
*  It's on YouTube. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9407.720000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you can if you want to see what I said, you can find. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9408.6s)]
*  What was that like? [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9411.24s)]
*  I loved it. Yeah, it was really great. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9412.68s)]
*  You know, and the and the the ambassador with this bloke came up in a suit, [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9416.92s)]
*  but with a funny collar and he put his hand out and he went, [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9422.76s)]
*  I want to thank you and blah, blah, blah. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9427.6s)]
*  That was a great speech and whatever said something. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9430.04s)]
*  And he wandered off and I said somebody who was there, you know, and they say, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9432.800000000001s)]
*  oh, he's the ambassador to the United Nations from Iran. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9437.44s)]
*  And I went, wow, how cool is it to meet such a person even? [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9441.12s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9446.6s)]
*  They've never invited me. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9450.68s)]
*  Well, I think that's a one and done type situation. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9453.88s)]
*  It is, but it's, you know, if if I hadn't done that, it would be on my bucket list [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9456.0s)]
*  to go and talk in an august gathering of people like that. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9461.96s)]
*  And they clapped as well. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9467.52s)]
*  When I'd finished, I was only calling for peace, just like I'm with Ukraine. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9471.0s)]
*  Yeah. My platform is no different. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9475.48s)]
*  Paris, 1948. Come on, that's that's all we have to do. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9477.36s)]
*  What a weird world we live in. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9481.68s)]
*  We're calling for peace is controversial. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9482.8s)]
*  Yeah. And you can get you say you're considered a traitor. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9484.92s)]
*  Very strange. Yeah. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9489.64s)]
*  Well, people are just so that there's so much confusion [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9491.48s)]
*  as to how the world actually works. Yeah. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9497.44s)]
*  And there's so much confusion as to like what the clear solution is. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9499.56s)]
*  And what you're saying is a clear solution to be a good person, to do the right thing. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9504.88s)]
*  Yeah. And to apply that to the whole earth. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9509.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the problem is, or a big problem here, as I've said many times before, [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9512.8s)]
*  is that that group, including Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld and Cheney [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9519.24s)]
*  and Bill Kristol and the rest of them, the whole near [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9524.64s)]
*  Concord has no interest in doing the right thing. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9528.88s)]
*  They want to rule the world. Right. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9533.199999999999s)]
*  That's all they care. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9535.039999999999s)]
*  And keep making money and never give any power to the people [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9536.4s)]
*  and make certain a democracy never appears anywhere in the world. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9540.16s)]
*  They want to be in charge of everything and keep everything going just as it is. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9545.119999999999s)]
*  They want Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of them [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9549.76s)]
*  to get richer and richer. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9553.12s)]
*  And they don't give a fuck about the rest of you or me. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9554.800000000001s)]
*  They don't care. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9558.52s)]
*  You know, they they probably find it hard to believe that we haven't [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9560.320000000002s)]
*  revolted, that there hasn't been a revolution. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9566.12s)]
*  Do you think they find it hard to believe that they find it hard to believe? [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9569.6s)]
*  Yeah, but they know. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9573.2s)]
*  No, probably not. I find it hard to believe. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9574.44s)]
*  But we're all, you know, throw the dog a bone. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9577.480000000001s)]
*  Right. Give him a phone. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9579.92s)]
*  Check out your Facebook likes. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9581.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9582.4s)]
*  Everything will be all right. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9585.16s)]
*  Let them kill Assange, you know. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9587.24s)]
*  The Assange thing is bizarre. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9590.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's the most bizarre. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9592.08s)]
*  Yeah, because there's there's no case. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9594.119999999999s)]
*  No, for doing it for what they're doing to him. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9598.8s)]
*  And initially it was like some sexual thing. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9601.72s)]
*  And now it's it's. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9604.56s)]
*  Ambiguous. The little prick wanted to argue with me about that as well. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9608.64s)]
*  What did you want to argue? [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9612.4s)]
*  Well, this is a guy. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9613.6s)]
*  This is a guy who claims to run something [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9614.64s)]
*  which I haven't had time to look into called the Bureau for Investigative [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9617.92s)]
*  Journalism, and he doesn't give a fuck about Julian Assange being murdered. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9623.32s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9628.279999999999s)]
*  By this trust. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9629.0s)]
*  Slow murder. Slowly. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9630.6s)]
*  Yeah. Tortured. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9632.0s)]
*  Boris Johnson and the whole of the English judicial system [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9633.039999999999s)]
*  and with the connivance of or at the behest of the U.S. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9637.199999999999s)]
*  government who want him dead. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9641.44s)]
*  They want him hung up like a magpie in the hedge as a warning. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9643.720000000001s)]
*  And it bloody well will be a warning. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9648.560000000001s)]
*  Can you imagine going to journalist school? [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9650.4s)]
*  And I know one thing I mustn't do. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9652.52s)]
*  Don't leak anything that's very important. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9655.28s)]
*  Oh, don't publish it. Yeah. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9657.68s)]
*  He didn't leak any. Right. He just published. Right. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9659.2s)]
*  It's it's amazing how little support there is for him and how [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9663.92s)]
*  how much you just you don't hear anybody outraged. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9668.2s)]
*  It's just it's nothing. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9675.640000000001s)]
*  And even if someone is in support of him being arrested [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9677.08s)]
*  or him being deported to the United States, there's no good argument. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9682.12s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9686.2s)]
*  Think about all the things that people have gotten away with. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9687.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look at this fucking Galeen Maxwell thing. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9690.04s)]
*  Yeah. Galeen Maxwell. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9694.240000000002s)]
*  This I've said this before. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9696.640000000001s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9697.560000000001s)]
*  She's the only person ever to be tried and arrested [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9698.08s)]
*  and put in jail for sex trafficking to no one. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9702.720000000001s)]
*  There's no list. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9709.6s)]
*  Where's the list of the people that she sex traffic to? [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9711.36s)]
*  Well, the problem is, we know that their head state, [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9715.640000000001s)]
*  billionaires, wealthy people, famous people. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9718.640000000001s)]
*  King's brother. Yeah. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9722.2s)]
*  King's brother. Where's this list? [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9723.640000000001s)]
*  Where's the list of people? The list is not existent. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9726.0s)]
*  So you're trying her and convicting her for a crime [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9728.4s)]
*  where if you're if you're sex trafficking, [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9732.64s)]
*  that means you're trafficking to someone and that someone is an American citizen [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9736.359999999999s)]
*  or a British citizen, that is an illegal act. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9741.039999999999s)]
*  So who are these people that have committed this illegal act? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9744.08s)]
*  Because they're responsible as well. Right. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9747.599999999999s)]
*  So who are these people and how is there no discussion of this? [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9749.519999999999s)]
*  Well, there's no discussion because Jeffrey Watsons face [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9753.84s)]
*  hung himself in his prison cell. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9756.76s)]
*  Which is insanely bizarre. Right. That one. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9761.56s)]
*  That's insane. Oh, the cameras just happen to not work. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9765.2s)]
*  How convenient. Yeah. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9768.12s)]
*  There's ligature marks around his neck and a fractured neck bone. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9769.76s)]
*  No worries. Yeah. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9772.72s)]
*  That's what happens when you hang yourself. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9773.880000000001s)]
*  We were having a cup of coffee. Yeah. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9775.48s)]
*  Or whatever it was. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9777.8s)]
*  I confess, I don't know a huge amount about the Jeffrey Epstein affair. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9778.84s)]
*  I know too much, unfortunately. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9783.16s)]
*  I've read too. It's a very disturbing thing. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9785.04s)]
*  But the most disturbing thing is that there's no list. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9786.8s)]
*  Like this is that that's a real crime. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9790.72s)]
*  Right. Well, isn't the story the anecdotal? [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9794.4s)]
*  The anecdote is, isn't isn't it that [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9797.76s)]
*  isn't Andrew supposed to have given somebody 12 million quid to go away? [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9803.8s)]
*  Yeah. And to get off the list. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9808.44s)]
*  Supposedly, it's hard to know whether or not that's true. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9811.32s)]
*  But for sure, there's money's been exchanged. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9814.76s)]
*  Influence has been exchanged. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9817.119999999999s)]
*  Maybe people are just they're not throwing any bones. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9818.279999999999s)]
*  Like there has to be a large group of people that were involved in this. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9821.32s)]
*  And there's none that are being exposed, which is quite fascinating. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9825.119999999999s)]
*  Because I guess if you did get exposed, if someone said, hey, [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9829.56s)]
*  you know, blah, blah, blah, ahead of this bank, [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9833.8s)]
*  we have evidence that you were having sex with underage girls. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9836.36s)]
*  That person could say, OK, what about Bill Clinton? [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9840.04s)]
*  What about this guy? What about that guy? [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9843.04s)]
*  He was there, too. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9844.6s)]
*  And then the House of Cards comes down. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9845.4s)]
*  So Bill Gates, Bill Gates, hard to imagine. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9848.0s)]
*  Not just Bill Gates, but Bill Gates after Jeffrey Epstein [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9851.4s)]
*  had been arrested and convicted for statutory rape. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9855.4s)]
*  Right. I mean, he'd already he had that very light slap on the wrist. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9860.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Did he? [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9866.4s)]
*  As I said, it was the first arrest. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9867.8s)]
*  There was a first arrest. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9869.599999999999s)]
*  And then he was convicted and he got this very light sentence. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9871.439999999999s)]
*  And then I believe there was a journalist. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9875.72s)]
*  I forget who the journalist was, but one journalist [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9878.32s)]
*  who kind of tracked this down and hounded this story [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9882.119999999999s)]
*  until it became exposed publicly. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9885.599999999999s)]
*  And then then he got rearrested. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9887.88s)]
*  And then he got arrested and tried for other crimes. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9890.56s)]
*  And then once he was in jail, that's when they, you know, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9892.599999999999s)]
*  suicide of them. Yeah. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9896.76s)]
*  It's a wild story. Yeah. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9899.960000000001s)]
*  But just the fact that there's a place like that, there's an island [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9902.880000000001s)]
*  that he owned like, where is this guy getting this fucking money? [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9906.92s)]
*  To to own an island and the island is for sale now. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9911.880000000001s)]
*  I think it's one hundred million dollars or something like that. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9915.16s)]
*  Like, where did you get that money? [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9917.560000000001s)]
*  You know, and then the the CEO of Victoria's Secrets [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9920.76s)]
*  gives them a 60 million dollar mansion in Manhattan. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9924.44s)]
*  Like, what? And then you find out that these other CEOs [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9927.480000000001s)]
*  have given them a hundred million, a hundred fifty million, fifty million. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9930.84s)]
*  Like, what? What's what is this? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9934.92s)]
*  Some bizarre in intelligence operation. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9938.16s)]
*  Like, what is this? Like, what are they doing here? [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9941.76s)]
*  You sound like a conspiracy theorist. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9944.76s)]
*  I am a conspiracy theorist. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9947.32s)]
*  So I'm well, look, some of them are real. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9949.0s)]
*  I'm not a outrageous or illogical conspiracy theorist for the most part. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9951.44s)]
*  I believe you. But there's a lot of conspiring. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9957.44s)]
*  The idea that conspiracies don't exist. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9962.12s)]
*  Well, what about Enron? What about what about the Iraq War? [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9964.12s)]
*  What about there's so many conspiracies that you can prove easily. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9967.16s)]
*  They've turned out to be true and just follow the money in power. Yeah. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9971.800000000001s)]
*  It's a weird world we live in, Roger. Sure shit is. It is. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9982.44s)]
*  I'm living in, but I confess I'm living somewhere in the moment at [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9986.6s)]
*  at right now. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9991.24s)]
*  And I don't mean we shouldn't talk about the Ukraine anymore, [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9994.04s)]
*  but that's kind of mostly what I think about is the Ukraine. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=9997.4s)]
*  Well, it's the most the most potent possibility [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10001.640000000001s)]
*  for the destruction of mankind. Yeah, it is. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10006.4s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10009.52s)]

*  and their Twitter bio and causing for an escalation, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10015.32s)]

*  to Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden, you know, and and Mr. Zelensky and Mrs. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10030.52s)]
*  Zelenska. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10036.32s)]

*  Hmm. It's interesting, isn't it? [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gEso2nkXQ&t=10050.24s)]
