*  My friend calls them love sponges. It's the best way to describe them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=46.0s)]
*  Perfect creations. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=50.0s)]
*  Hang out with us. We're going to be in here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=52.0s)]
*  Dude, first of all, I'm in your book right now. I just started it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=54.0s)]
*  It's insane. How the fuck did you even get the idea to do what you did? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=57.0s)]
*  How does this take me through? Take me through the first like seeds of the thoughts that had you go to the Amazon? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=63.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, I like I remember I remember very far back. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=70.0s)]
*  I remember being a kid and like going to the Bronx Zoo and looking. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=76.0s)]
*  They had they had an exhibit. I think it was in like the House of Reptiles where there's all these scientists [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=79.0s)]
*  and they're holding like a giant snake and they're doing research and they're protecting these places. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=83.0s)]
*  And so I always had it in my head that like I want to see these places before they're gone. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=88.0s)]
*  I grew up with a lot of like environmental stress. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=92.0s)]
*  I really felt like this message of like we're losing the rainforest. We're losing elephants. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=94.0s)]
*  I was like, I just how did you develop that feeling? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=98.0s)]
*  I mean, my parents would, you know, read me Jane Goodall's books as a kid. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=103.0s)]
*  And again, things like the Bronx Zoo, Steve Irwin, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=107.0s)]
*  and I loved I grew up, you know, and having access to like New York and New Jersey. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, what is such incredible forests there? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=116.0s)]
*  It's really the New York, New Jersey forest thing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=118.0s)]
*  Like people for whatever reason don't live around there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=121.0s)]
*  They think New Jersey is like some vast wasteland. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=124.0s)]
*  New Jersey is like more bears per capita than anywhere else in the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's amazing forest there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=131.0s)]
*  I grew up like, you know, and then like you by like 13 years old, I was like, you know, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=134.0s)]
*  I had like a hunting knife and I would do one match and I'd bring my golden retriever into the woods. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=138.0s)]
*  And we'd do like a mini solo two nights, you know, and I have to make a fire with that one match. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=142.0s)]
*  And it's like I was always doing shit like this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=147.0s)]
*  So you always had like a call to that kind of life. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=149.0s)]
*  I always just rivers, streams, forests, tracking bears, trying to figure out where the where the fox's hole is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=152.0s)]
*  Like I like spending time with animals in nature. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=158.0s)]
*  And then like it just drove me crazy that no matter how deep I would go, you know, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=161.0s)]
*  in eastern forests, you always like come out the other side. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=166.0s)]
*  And I always was just like, I want to find somewhere where it's like truly wild, like where there's no limit to it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=169.0s)]
*  Like what's what's the max? What's the highest you can turn this thing? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=175.0s)]
*  And I was terrible in school, failed all my classes, severely dyslexic, all that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=179.0s)]
*  And so I tried actually my wonderful parents were like, you do know that you can take a GED, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=183.0s)]
*  skip the last two years of high school and go straight to college. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=187.0s)]
*  And I was like, I did not know that. So I did that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=190.0s)]
*  And then as I was doing that, I just said, you know what? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=193.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to the Amazon rainforest. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=195.0s)]
*  I had a professor that showed me a piece of wood and he made a joke like, oh, this is probably like Teague from the Amazon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=197.0s)]
*  And like, I was like, oh, yeah, I got to get down there before it's too late. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=201.0s)]
*  That's what it was. That is what it was. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=206.0s)]
*  I got to get down there before it's too late. Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=209.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like they're telling you that there's Jurassic Park. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=211.0s)]
*  There's literally anaconda dragons in these in these monster swamps and there's Harpie Eagles taking howler monkeys. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=213.0s)]
*  And there's all this incredible bustling life and it's all vanishing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=219.0s)]
*  I was like, I want to see it before it's gone. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=222.0s)]
*  The greatest show on earth. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=224.0s)]
*  And so how much of an understanding did you have about the Amazon, about how to get around? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=226.0s)]
*  How to it seems like you just kind of just dove in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=232.0s)]
*  I did dive in. I found the most remote research station I could find. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=236.0s)]
*  And of course, nobody wants to take it like a 17 year old kid from from Brooklyn, from New Jersey and put them in the rainforest. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=240.0s)]
*  I had no qualifications. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=246.0s)]
*  But I went with people that were doing research on macaws and I was out there for weeks at a time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=248.0s)]
*  But the luck was that I met this guy named JJ Wanhulu Durran, local SAE Indian, grew up in the forest barefoot and met the dude. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=254.0s)]
*  The dude has libraries of information in his brain, medicinal plants, how to track animals, places in the forest that nobody knows about. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=264.0s)]
*  And then he just started. He was just like, you're funny. You really love this shit. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=272.0s)]
*  He's like, let's go out all night. We don't come back until we find three snakes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=277.0s)]
*  He was terrified of snakes. He's like, let's go find three snakes because he was like, why? Why? Why does this gringo keep catching snakes? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=280.0s)]
*  He's like, what the hell is the matter with you? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=285.0s)]
*  And so he was teaching me everything. And then I was just like, look, this is how you do snakes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=287.0s)]
*  This is how you figure out if they're venomous. This is how you handle a snake. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=292.0s)]
*  I could teach him one thing. He taught me the entire Amazon rainforest. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=295.0s)]
*  So he didn't know. I mean, he must have known what venomous snakes there were, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=299.0s)]
*  No, because what they'll do is they'll be like, oh, that red one, it's venomous. They chop it in half. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=304.0s)]
*  That's not how you identify a snake. That's like saying like every, you know, it's like identifying cars by color. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=309.0s)]
*  Like it doesn't make any sense. OK, right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=314.0s)]
*  It's with snakes you can have, like, for example, like an Amazon tree boa. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=316.0s)]
*  You can have one mother giving birth to like a rainbow of babies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=320.0s)]
*  They'll be like gray ones, green ones, yellow ones, like all these different morphs. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=323.0s)]
*  And so people will be like, oh, those those red ones, they'll get you. Those are coral snakes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=327.0s)]
*  Like, no, you know, I just it's a constant battle with the locals. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=331.0s)]
*  I'm always like, do you think this is venomous or not? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=335.0s)]
*  And they're like, hmm. And I'm like, would I be holding it if it was venomous? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=337.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, yeah, that's crazy that they don't know. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=342.0s)]
*  But I guess it's like safer to assume that they're all venomous or anything bright colored is venomous. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah. And again, the jungle is a place where there's a lot of stories. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=349.0s)]
*  And so, like, you always hear stories about like who got bitten by a snake and this happened, who got, you know, that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=354.0s)]
*  And so like they have the snake Loro Machaco, which is they know it's a green snake. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=360.0s)]
*  That's all that like the average lager or the average gold miner knows. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=364.0s)]
*  I was just like literally two weeks ago, I was out in the jungle and I was out and it was raining. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=368.0s)]
*  And there was a Loro Machaco next to my head with flicking its tongue next to my head. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=372.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, cool. I got to bring this back and show them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=375.0s)]
*  So I very carefully caught this viper and brought it back. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=378.0s)]
*  And they're like, that's not it. That's the bow. And I was like, oh, God, I can't help you people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=381.0s)]
*  I'm literally showing it to you. But the rule is just kill every snake. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=385.0s)]
*  So I've always been like this like ambassador for snakes trying to get people to be like, you know, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=389.0s)]
*  black snakes and gopher snakes and garter snakes. And you show them to kids. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=393.0s)]
*  Snakes are wonderful. Like I love snakes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=397.0s)]
*  They're a part of the whole ecosystem, especially in something as complex as the Amazon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, when I lived in the Hollywood Hills, people would always complain about coyotes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=403.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'd say, yeah, yeah. But how many rats do you see? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah. You don't see a lot of rats. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=411.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's the reason why that the coyotes are the cleanup system. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah. Later, I got to show you the video I took yesterday, the day before yesterday. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=418.0s)]
*  A coyote walking through my front yard in New York. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=422.0s)]
*  In the middle of the day. They're everywhere now. They're everywhere. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=424.0s)]
*  It's wild. Big one. Have you ever read Coyote America? No. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=427.0s)]
*  It's a really good book by this guy, Dan Flores. He's been on the podcast a couple of times. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=430.0s)]
*  He was my friend Steve's professor in college. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=434.0s)]
*  And he stayed in touch with this guy and he's a wildlife historian. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=437.0s)]
*  And he wrote a book about coyotes. And it's the story is insane. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=441.0s)]
*  Like coyotes, they're originally persecuted by the gray wolves. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=446.0s)]
*  The gray wolves were extirpated and killed off by the people that settled. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=450.0s)]
*  And then coyotes, when they were prosecuted, what they would do is they expand their range. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=454.0s)]
*  So they're in every single city in every state now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=460.0s)]
*  And that's only over the last few decades. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=464.0s)]
*  I mean, the fact, I mean, I think in a lot of places you can hunt a coyote like daytime, nighttime, anytime, with like any method. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=467.0s)]
*  The thing is it does the opposite of what it's intended to do. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=473.0s)]
*  Because when you kill a coyote, then the females, when they do roll call, they realize a coyote is missing and they have more pups. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=476.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a wild animal. No, it's a really, it's a really clever to know they're crazy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=482.0s)]
*  This one comes trotting across my front yard every day. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=487.0s)]
*  And it's like I went I opened my front door and I went, whoo, I just stopped and looked at me and I just like took a picture on my phone. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=489.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, it was crazy. New York City. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=495.0s)]
*  Coyotes. It's an amazing animal. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=498.0s)]
*  But so so when you went down there, what kind of gear did you bring? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=503.0s)]
*  Like how how prepared were you for this? Completely shoestring budget shoestring. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=508.0s)]
*  But yes, student dropped out of high school, saved up money from working at like the YMCA. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=513.0s)]
*  Like I went down there wearing jeans and a T-shirt. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=517.0s)]
*  Like did you plan on trying to find some sort of a job? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=520.0s)]
*  Like what were you going to do for food? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=523.0s)]
*  So this was the thing I went down there as a volunteer just to experience it, you know, like and then and then basically as I became friends with JJ, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=525.0s)]
*  it was like he was like, could you could you come back? He's like, you have access to like gringos and people that travel. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=534.0s)]
*  He's like, bring us tourists. He's like, we're trying to protect this river like now while it's still completely pristine. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=539.0s)]
*  And at the time I was like, well, that sounds great. So I started bringing people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=545.0s)]
*  We started Taman do expeditions. And so it was like small time just bringing some tourists to the jungle, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=548.0s)]
*  showing them around, taking them on night walks, doing stuff like that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=553.0s)]
*  But it was a very much like there wasn't a plan. I knew what I loved. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=557.0s)]
*  I didn't have a plan. I wasn't like, I'm going to be a jungle keeper. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=562.0s)]
*  Like I just went down there and was like, this is amazing and I want more of it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=565.0s)]
*  And then, you know, at that age, people are like, you know, what are you going to do for a job? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=569.0s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know, but I'm going back to the jungle. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=572.0s)]
*  And then it was as, you know, then as we saw more of the forest getting destroyed, as we were, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=575.0s)]
*  the trans Amazon Highway cuts straight across the Amazon rainforest. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=582.0s)]
*  You can drive from like Rio all the way to Lima. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=585.0s)]
*  And so for the first time in history, they opened up a land trade route through the heart of the Amazon rainforest. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=587.0s)]
*  And the final segment of the trans Amazon Highway was over the Madre de Dios River, which is right where we work. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=594.0s)]
*  And so we saw the amount of cars in our region go from like 400 a day to like 800 a day to 2000 a day. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=602.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden these offshoot roads and all of a sudden the burning and all of a sudden places that used to be pristine and wild. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=608.0s)]
*  All of a sudden we're seeing this horrific burning, ancient trees cut down, entire ecosystems wiped out. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=614.0s)]
*  And so then at that point I'm going, OK, it's not a joke anymore. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=620.0s)]
*  We someone's got to do something about this. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=623.0s)]
*  And then, you know, you look and you realize you're in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. There is no one. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=626.0s)]
*  There's no help coming. Like these these ecosystems are going to be bulldozed if nobody does anything. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=630.0s)]
*  So what regulations, if any, are in place? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=635.0s)]
*  Obviously, there's people that are going to violate those. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=641.0s)]
*  But are there regulations that are designed to protect those areas? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=643.0s)]
*  Is there is there like some sort of a process that someone has to go through before they start cutting logs? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=647.0s)]
*  Like the thing is, there's national parks, there's protected areas, there's indigenous reserves. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=652.0s)]
*  I mean, we're in the country of Peru and it's like there there's plenty. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=658.0s)]
*  There's a lot of protected land. Peru has done an amazing job of protecting a lot of its rainforest. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=661.0s)]
*  They have the most crucial part of the Amazon because the western Amazon, it's where the Andes Mountains, the cloud forest into the lowland Amazon, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=665.0s)]
*  the most mega biodiverse terrestrial habitat that's ever existed. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=672.0s)]
*  They've done a great job of protecting it, but there's still millions of acres that are just jungle. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=677.0s)]
*  And you're at the edge of human presence on our planet. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=683.0s)]
*  So you're talking about like, OK, so you have a little city and you have the police and you have the forestry department, you have whatever else. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=685.0s)]
*  The things around the city they can deal with. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=691.0s)]
*  But if you tell them that two days upriver, way out there, there's somebody cutting some forest that technically shouldn't be cut, they don't care. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=693.0s)]
*  They're not going to put resources towards going out there. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=702.0s)]
*  They're not they're not going to risk getting shot. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=705.0s)]
*  They're not going to risk getting bitten by a bushmaster while they travel out into the jungle. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=706.0s)]
*  There's just not on anybody's radar. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=710.0s)]
*  So unless it's near them and was in their jurisdiction, nobody does anything. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=714.0s)]
*  And as we've as we found out now, even when it is in their jurisdiction, half the forestry department just got arrested in Peru for actually helping the loggers. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=718.0s)]
*  They had sort of like infiltrated. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=726.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then, of course, down there, you still have uncontacted tribes and you have places where there's giant anacondas and you have different territorial reserves. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=729.0s)]
*  It's just like it's such a weird landscape that the idea of like enforcement, like when we've had problems, when we've had issues where we have to bring law enforcement out there, we have to bring them out there. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=736.0s)]
*  We have to get the boat, the gasoline, the food, provide them with you know, it's like we have to like basically take them on a tourist trip out into the jungle and be like, no, go do police work. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=748.0s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=756.0s)]
*  And so like when you hear this stuff, you know, like, which, again, what we actually actually have to have to eventually we have to tell we have to tell the people this story. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=758.0s)]
*  How we got here. How did like what made you reach out to me when you did? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=766.0s)]
*  Well, I had seen a clip of yours that we talked about. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=772.0s)]
*  What was the clip? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=777.0s)]
*  So, yeah, that was the that was the 2019 clip. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=778.0s)]
*  That was when the the Amazon fires went mega viral. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=781.0s)]
*  And excuse me, I threw up a video of me in the fires just like screaming and crying and being like this is happening every fucking day and screaming and it went viral. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=785.0s)]
*  It went viral. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=797.0s)]
*  And at that time we had created jungle keepers and we had tried to protect. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=798.0s)]
*  So we had a little bit of rainforest we were protecting. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=802.0s)]
*  I think we had like one or two Rangers. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=804.0s)]
*  And then you shared it on your Instagram and then it hit this level. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=806.0s)]
*  It like went to the next level of virality. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=811.0s)]
*  I remember it because my cousin Michael called me and he was just like Joe Rogan just shared it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=814.0s)]
*  And I was like, that's that's not there's no way that happened. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=817.0s)]
*  And he's like, no, it did. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=819.0s)]
*  And the the amount of attention that we got from that led to eventually people reaching out. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=821.0s)]
*  This guy Dax to Silver reached out and he was like, hey, listen, you guys every year with the burning forest and the loss of habitat. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=828.0s)]
*  And he's like, I want to help. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=835.0s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=837.0s)]
*  What is what is what do you need to make this work? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=838.0s)]
*  How do we save this ring for there? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=841.0s)]
*  It is. Yeah, that's that's the clip. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=842.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=843.0s)]
*  We're going to welcome to the fucking Anthropocene. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=844.0s)]
*  And what what puts those fires out the people actively try to put those fires out of this wait till it rains. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=857.0s)]
*  No, the people start them. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=862.0s)]
*  That's that's the funny thing is it is it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=863.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to stay here long because this fire is spreading, but everything behind me right now is the forest that I've been working to protect for the last 13 years. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=865.0s)]
*  It's burning like this every day. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=872.0s)]
*  There are literally millions of animals in this forest that cannot escape right now. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=874.0s)]
*  And if you think our planet can survive this every day in the Amazon, you have another thing coming. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=878.0s)]
*  We have all the resources to protect this, to stop what's happening behind me right now. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=883.0s)]
*  And people let it happen every day. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=887.0s)]
*  Welcome to the fucking Anthropocene. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=890.0s)]
*  So when they're starting these fires to make clear cuts so they can raise cattle, like what are they doing? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=891.0s)]
*  Yes, it's it's basically their space. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=897.0s)]
*  So we're going to use it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=899.0s)]
*  And so, like, ideally, a person, if they wanted to use that forest, you could harvest the ancient hardwoods there and make millions off of it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=900.0s)]
*  You could use that forest to do like multi-tiered agriculture where you're producing tons of produce. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=908.0s)]
*  These are people that are coming in. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=914.0s)]
*  They're just clear cutting the forest. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=916.0s)]
*  They're planting like cacao, papaya, grass for cows. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=918.0s)]
*  Like it's it's literally burning down your house to to cook us a meal. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=922.0s)]
*  And who owns that land? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=927.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=929.0s)]
*  A lot of it is indigenous land. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=930.0s)]
*  A lot of it is that they call it like Brazil nut concessions, where it's just like areas where like you're supposed to be harvesting Brazil nuts. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=932.0s)]
*  But a lot of times it is private land. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=938.0s)]
*  But people there there's people coming from other parts of South America. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=941.0s)]
*  And they're just coming in and they're clearing these areas and it's happening fast. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=945.0s)]
*  And no one is there to protect. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=948.0s)]
*  There's not enough resources to keep an eye on. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=950.0s)]
*  It's just the vastness of it all. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=952.0s)]
*  There's a there's a vacuum in conservation. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=954.0s)]
*  There's a problem with conservation. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=956.0s)]
*  No one's going to pay you to go protect to go out into the wildest places on earth and protect these things. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=957.0s)]
*  Like for the most part, it's very difficult. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=964.0s)]
*  You can go get a job as a conservation biologist. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=966.0s)]
*  You can go study things academically. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=968.0s)]
*  But to go and actively do the work of protecting a rainforest or protecting a marine area that's sensitive, that's crucial to species, it's very difficult. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=972.0s)]
*  And so that's why that whole story was so important was because I was, you know, by that point, I was like 14 years into doing this with no support, no funding, no backing, no nothing. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=981.0s)]
*  It was just me and the local guys, machetes and bare feet. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=991.0s)]
*  And then after that video went viral, after you shared it, we got contacted by Dax. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=994.0s)]
*  And then he basically was like, look, I'm he started a company called Lightspeed and then he transitioned into conservation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1000.0s)]
*  And so now he's helping the Sea Shepherd and he's helping the Nature Conservancy in Canada. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1006.0s)]
*  And he's Jungle Keepers was his first project. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1010.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden we could actually do it. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1012.0s)]
*  And so now these local people who used to be loggers and gold miners, we were like, yo, do you want a job protecting this forest? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1014.0s)]
*  And so like guys have been cutting wood for like the last 15 years, guys have been like fighting the uncontacted tribes. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1022.0s)]
*  All of a sudden we were like, do you want to just like, you know, help us patrol, just protect it, do nothing. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1028.0s)]
*  And they're like, do nothing. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1032.0s)]
*  And we get paid and benefits. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1033.0s)]
*  And it's and it's a huge success. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1036.0s)]
*  Like we were protecting 50,000 acres now, millions and millions of heartbeats in there like spider monkeys, troops of giant river otters, jaguars, Harvey Eagles. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1038.0s)]
*  I mean, just more biodiversity than you could list. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1048.0s)]
*  And we need to protect 300,000. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1050.0s)]
*  I need to protect 300,000 acres in the next year because now there's like Chinese machinery coming in where they're coming in with those those giant earth moving things that like take out the trees. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1052.0s)]
*  And so it's just like this this race against time because we have this incredible treasure trove of biological, incredible wealth. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1062.0s)]
*  Medicines running through every every one of these things. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1072.0s)]
*  I mean, there's there's there's you go out with the local people and if you have something wrong with you, there's a sap for that. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1075.0s)]
*  They can cure an ear infection. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1080.0s)]
*  They can cure whatever it is. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1082.0s)]
*  If they want to go fishing in the stream, they have Barbasco. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1083.0s)]
*  They have a route that they can crush, throw it in the stream. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1085.0s)]
*  It'll stun the fish. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1087.0s)]
*  You take the ones you want, take it out and the other fish will swim away. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1088.0s)]
*  It's like they have a pharmacy that we don't have access to. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1091.0s)]
*  Yeah, that fish thing is wild. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1094.0s)]
*  This thing is my friend Ronella did that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1096.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1098.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1099.0s)]
*  How do you say those guys names from Guyana? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1100.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Yanomami. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1103.0s)]
*  Yeah, he went with them and they did that thing with the fish. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1104.0s)]
*  They grind up the plants and they throw it in the water and the fish just conked out. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1107.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1112.0s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1113.0s)]
*  It's like magic. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1114.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like magic. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1115.0s)]
*  It's like a cheat code in the video game. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1116.0s)]
*  So this is a dangerous proposition, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1117.0s)]
*  Because clearly the people that are moving into these areas, they want to burn things down and grow things. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1120.0s)]
*  And someone who gets in the way of this is getting the way of their financial success. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1128.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1133.0s)]
*  In the case of gold mining, there's a picture in there, Jamie, I think it just says gold mining. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1134.0s)]
*  I went down there with Matt Gutman and we did this thing where we got into the gold mining areas where that's a whole other thing where they're clear cutting the rainforest for gold mining. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1140.0s)]
*  That's like this. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1149.0s)]
*  That's the Western Amazon. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1150.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1152.0s)]
*  So they just gutted it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1153.0s)]
*  There is a sandstorm behind me in that picture and they are that's the Amazon rainforest and there's a desert there now. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1155.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1161.0s)]
*  You can see it from space. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1162.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1163.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, you go there. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1164.0s)]
*  This is like sort of this machine gun limit where you drive towards this area and then they have guards and inside there they have these see this at that big hose going out. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1167.0s)]
*  They have to cut the forest, burn the forest, suck up the land and then the gold comes in the sediment in the sand. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1175.0s)]
*  And so they have to use mercury to bind the gold out of the sand and then they burn that off, which then is going into the atmosphere and raining back down. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1181.0s)]
*  I mean, this is like this is this is horrendous and the police can't stop it because you have to go in there with like the military. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1188.0s)]
*  The police will just get killed if they go over there. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1195.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1197.0s)]
*  So, yeah, we got we got in there this one day with some Russian gold miners. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1198.0s)]
*  It was very strange and actually. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1201.0s)]
*  You got in there to investigate. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1203.0s)]
*  We got in there. We went in there with with with Matt Gutman's crew and we actually we actually filmed in the gold mining areas, which no one does. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1205.0s)]
*  And while we were in there, one of the Russian gold miners was like, hey, man, listen, he goes, you're that guy with the Instagram, right? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1214.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck you talking about? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1219.0s)]
*  And he goes, you see those guys over there? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1221.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1223.0s)]
*  He goes, they just said your name. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1224.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and then, yeah, like a week later, those guys pulled up. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1226.0s)]
*  And it was annoying because the guy like acted like he had a gun, but he didn't show me. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1231.0s)]
*  And he was like, hey, no more posts about gold mining. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1234.0s)]
*  And I was like, the gold miners follow me on social media. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1237.0s)]
*  Like, are you fucking serious? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1240.0s)]
*  But no, that that area is dangerous. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1242.0s)]
*  Our Lord, how to be terrifying. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1244.0s)]
*  Um, yeah, I mean, for a second, I was like, is this is this is it happening? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1246.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1251.0s)]
*  Because the way they pulled up, you know, I was like walking on the street and they like they like, you know, cut me off, you know, and they're like, hey, Paul Rosalie. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1252.0s)]
*  Paul Rosalie. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1258.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and our lawyer or the guy that used to be the lawyer for jungle keepers, his father was very vocal locally about the gold miners and standing up to them. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1259.0s)]
*  And they just whacked him just that easy. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1269.0s)]
*  No consequences. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1272.0s)]
*  No, no consequences. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1274.0s)]
*  A really good friend of mine on the river. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1275.0s)]
*  His father had moved out deep into the jungle like 20 years ago and raised his two boys out there. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1279.0s)]
*  And then when this trans Amazon Highway came through, they saw the logging and the burning and they wanted to live at the edge of the world. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1285.0s)]
*  They wanted to be deep in the jungle. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1293.0s)]
*  And so old man Satuko is like, you know, we're going to we got to figure something out, either move deeper or move away or whatever. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1295.0s)]
*  And like they were trying to figure out what to do. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1302.0s)]
*  And there's this one summer I spent a lot of time with his son. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1304.0s)]
*  His name was also Paul. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1306.0s)]
*  And he got he got murdered by gold miners, too. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1308.0s)]
*  And so like it's just like it's just a war zone. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1312.0s)]
*  And then and then you have some of our some of our guys now who are conservationists who used to be loggers who have shot at the uncontacted tribes and been shot at by arrows. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1314.0s)]
*  One of my Rangers has a scar on his head from a seven foot arrow from the uncontacted tribes. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1325.0s)]
*  There's a picture of that, too. I think it says uncontacted Ignacio. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1332.0s)]
*  Yeah, so they use the river cane and then they take bamboo and they get an incredible edge on the bamboo and they can it's like they temper it over the fire. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1336.0s)]
*  So the river cane doesn't weigh anything. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1345.0s)]
*  So they make these monster arrows and they can actually like nail a spider monkey out of the trees from like 40 meters. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1347.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. So check this out. So this is one of my Rangers Ignacio. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1353.0s)]
*  He's local indigenous and that's the scar on his head from the arrow. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1357.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was trying. So the uncontacted came out and they were pretty fresh. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1361.0s)]
*  You're going to have a scar on your head. That's that's a good spot. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1365.0s)]
*  That was good. Yes. Someone's got a picture of it when it happened. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1367.0s)]
*  But he was he was saying they were trying to they were trying to push bananas because these people don't know. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1370.0s)]
*  You know, these people are out there and they're naked and they're in the jungle and they've been there for, you know, a few hundred years. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1375.0s)]
*  And he was there and he was actually working for the Ministry of Culture and he was like, let me try and be friendly. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1379.0s)]
*  Let me try and like extend an olive branch. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1385.0s)]
*  And so he's trying to push a boatload of bananas towards them. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1387.0s)]
*  And the scariest thing was they were they didn't want anyone to understand them. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1391.0s)]
*  And so they were actually speaking in Capuchin monkey monkey calls. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1394.0s)]
*  And he's out in the middle. He's brave. This guy. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1398.0s)]
*  And he went out to the middle of the river and he pushed this thing and he said he saw the arrow coming straight at his eyeball and he just moved his head to the side. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1400.0s)]
*  And it just gave him that cut him right to the skull. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1406.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's that one. And then there should be one more where he's just looking right at us. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1409.0s)]
*  But yeah, he's he's he's lucky. He's really lucky. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1413.0s)]
*  He's got worse stories than that, too. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1418.0s)]
*  One time he was he was at a remote guard post and the tribes came and he'd already gotten I think he'd already gotten shot. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1421.0s)]
*  And he said he went up into the roof and like hid in the rafters like and wrapped himself. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1428.0s)]
*  And he said it was the middle of the day and he was baking and he said he could hear the young contacted tribes underneath him. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1432.0s)]
*  And he was like trying to make the decision of do I kill myself like a dog in a car in this heat like he knew he was going to die or do I go down and let them rip me apart? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1438.0s)]
*  And it was like it was just the most terrifying story. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1447.0s)]
*  How did he get out of it? He waited it out. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1449.0s)]
*  I mean, he'd already been shot in the head. So he was like, I know what's going to happen if I go down there. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1452.0s)]
*  Wow. Also, then I'm also going to get I'm going to get everyone's going to come after me for calling them uncontacted. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1456.0s)]
*  Apparently, that's an outdated term. Apparently, the correct parlance these days is voluntarily isolated indigenous nomadic persons. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1461.0s)]
*  Let's stick with unconscious. We just call them contact. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1471.0s)]
*  We just call them contact. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1473.0s)]
*  Fuck you, man. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1474.0s)]
*  Fuck you for making me remember all that shit. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1475.0s)]
*  So silly. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1480.0s)]
*  Uncontacted is not a pejorative. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1481.0s)]
*  No, it's just and then people like, well, they technically have contact if they shot your friend. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1484.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, well, sort of, I guess, I guess peripheral. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1488.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1492.0s)]
*  It's it's got to be horrifying for them, right? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1493.0s)]
*  I mean, if they've been there for thousands and thousands of years living like that and then slowly but surely they see this encroachment of machines and how much they understand of this Western culture that's infringing upon them. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1496.0s)]
*  I don't it's weird because these guys that they don't have they don't have boats. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1508.0s)]
*  And so, like, they don't have like the wheel, like all these like simple inventions, like they've just they don't they don't work with metal. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1513.0s)]
*  And so I believe that the current theory says now that basically these people were living extremely isolated around the time of the Industrial Revolution. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1520.0s)]
*  They were already very remote. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1530.0s)]
*  And then when you had the demand for rubber, the Amazon was the only place that you could get rubber. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1532.0s)]
*  And Henry Ford found out when he did Fordlandia, you can't make a plantation out of rubber. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1537.0s)]
*  It'll get leaf blight and die. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1542.0s)]
*  So the only way to get rubber was to start a full scale genocide where they sent down these rubber barons that beat and whipped the native people and sent them out into the jungle to go collect rubber from the rubber trees for gaskets and hoses and everything that we needed. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1544.0s)]
*  These are the people that fought. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1559.0s)]
*  These are the people that remained unconquer, unconquered, stayed back further in the deepest parts of the forest. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1561.0s)]
*  And so you think these people's grandparents, grandparents must tell them that those outsiders will set you on fire. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1568.0s)]
*  They will skin you alive. If you see one of them, kill it before it kills you. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1574.0s)]
*  So they must be just running scared. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1577.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1580.0s)]
*  It is really fascinating that there are still people living essentially the exact same way they were living thousands and thousands of years ago. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1583.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1590.0s)]
*  They have a couple of machetes that they stole off some friends of mine. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1591.0s)]
*  Like they sacked this village one time and they took pots and machetes. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1594.0s)]
*  They killed all the animals. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1597.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're they're very strange to deal with. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1600.0s)]
*  Like there was a guy who had started leaving them like bananas and then he left them like a shirt. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1602.0s)]
*  You know, he would just very carefully because they don't they can't speak. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1608.0s)]
*  They don't speak Spanish. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1610.0s)]
*  They don't even speak like Piro like or anything like or Yine is the dialect that we deal with on our river. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1611.0s)]
*  And they murdered him too. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1617.0s)]
*  And like he was friends with them for a few years and no one has an explanation. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1620.0s)]
*  I just spoke to a eminent anthropologist about this. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1623.0s)]
*  I was like, what was the reason for that? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1626.0s)]
*  And he's like, no one knows. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1627.0s)]
*  So he had made some sort of contact with them and was he had regular contact things. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1629.0s)]
*  Yeah. Was he in contact physically with them? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1634.0s)]
*  I think like he would be in the same space like he could have spoken to them if he could speak to them. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1636.0s)]
*  But I think it was sort of like like I leave you this and then I back up and then they would come forward. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1642.0s)]
*  And then, you know, it would be like this very, very careful exchange. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1646.0s)]
*  And that went on for a few years. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1650.0s)]
*  And then everyone was like, oh, there's this guy and he's been able to develop this. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1651.0s)]
*  It was like it was special. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1655.0s)]
*  You know, it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't in any way it wasn't like a bravado thing. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1656.0s)]
*  It was like he was actually trying to be like, can we make friends with these people? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1661.0s)]
*  Can we can we can we make a relationship here? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1665.0s)]
*  Maybe bring them in. Maybe do they want to come in? Are they scared? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1668.0s)]
*  Do they need help? Maybe we could just help them with some stuff. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1670.0s)]
*  And then they found him with seven foot arrows in him. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1674.0s)]
*  So no explanation, no explanation. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1679.0s)]
*  So, yeah, the one time that I saw them, I ran for three days. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1683.0s)]
*  I like ran downriver. I jumped in my boat. I went all night. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1686.0s)]
*  I just I absolutely I realized I'd gone. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1689.0s)]
*  I'd made a wrong turn and ended up somewhere I shouldn't have been. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1692.0s)]
*  And I was completely alone because then that was after the the the learning days and the jungle keepers days came the days where the locals were like, OK, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1695.0s)]
*  so, you know, the jungle like start going out on your own. See if you see if you could really do it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1702.0s)]
*  Go survive. And I and I personally wanted to see if I could experience living. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1706.0s)]
*  I wanted to know it's like it's like being told you can go to Mars and walk around all by yourself. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1712.0s)]
*  Well, you're out in the Amazon for a week by yourself and you camp it on a beach and you wake up and you walk upriver and you camp on a beach and you wake up. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1717.0s)]
*  To me, it was almost like the world melted away. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1726.0s)]
*  It was like that Will Smith movie where you're the last person on Earth. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1731.0s)]
*  It's like you you you are in this jungle paradise where there's macaws and there's jaguars and the animals up there don't know what a human is. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1734.0s)]
*  It's like the Galapagos. You are in a place where animals are unfamiliar with the shape of a human. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1741.0s)]
*  So they don't mind. And there's giant anacondas like it's different. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1747.0s)]
*  It's different out there. There are still places where from century to century nobody goes and the animals have no idea. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1752.0s)]
*  When you're out there, it gets it gets really freaky. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1758.0s)]
*  Like I noticed my brain losing touch with like like I would start to get worried like like it was this just my reality now. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1761.0s)]
*  Could I go back? You know, you're so far out there and the Amazon's friendly. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1770.0s)]
*  The Amazon's not the jungle itself. There's nothing that's going to eat you. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1774.0s)]
*  A jag's not going to eat you. And unless you go swimming in a lake at night, a black came in or an anaconda is not going to mess with you. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1777.0s)]
*  And it's like piranha tastes good. They actually you know, that's like how you survive. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1782.0s)]
*  So it's like it's pretty chill as a wilderness experience until something goes wrong. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1787.0s)]
*  And so you get a big thunderstorm and the river rises 20 feet and there's entire trees that's as thick as school buses flying down river in the rapids. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1791.0s)]
*  Then then you're in trouble. That was one of the scary things about your book. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1798.0s)]
*  The way you describe that when trees fall that they're so intertwined that acres of land might fall. Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1801.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I everyone has what's the most dangerous thing in the Amazon? Is it the snakes? Is it the jaguars? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1807.0s)]
*  It's like, dude, Jack, you don't even see a jaguar when you hear a pop like that big cannon shot pop with like an old tree pops in the you run. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1813.0s)]
*  You run because when that comes down, it's laced into the canopy with the other trees. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1822.0s)]
*  And so it's going to pull down other things. I was with lagers one time and they were cutting a tree and it was going to go that way. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1828.0s)]
*  So we were standing behind it. And I'm always like, OK, I got to document this. I got to document this. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1834.0s)]
*  So this tree is going to fall away from us. And this tree is probably about as thick as this room. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1839.0s)]
*  And this tree, you know, talking about 160 foot tree and this tree starts falling over. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1843.0s)]
*  And it grabs another tree. And we all realized it at the same time. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1848.0s)]
*  But the other tree broke and snapped in our direction. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1852.0s)]
*  And there's like a 30 foot shard of timber, like a fucking oak tree flying at us. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1855.0s)]
*  And we all just scattered and then all like it was just like the world ended. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1860.0s)]
*  There was there's vines and giant things coming down, entire entire trees falling out of the sky and flying and splinters. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1863.0s)]
*  It was cataclysmic like it was it was out of control. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1870.0s)]
*  I would never, ever, ever stand that close to a tree falling in the Amazon again. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1873.0s)]
*  I put a GoPro on it and run away. Wow. Jesus Christ. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1876.0s)]
*  I would argue that that's crazier than the moon. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1884.0s)]
*  You know, like you say, going to Mars and running around. There's nothing on Mars. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1887.0s)]
*  You're just going to see a bunch of dirt. It's going to be sad. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1891.0s)]
*  It's going to be like going to the Death Valley. Yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1893.0s)]
*  But there's no people ever. Yeah. It's just nothing. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1896.0s)]
*  What you're seeing is almost more crazy because there's so much life and it's so alien to you. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1900.0s)]
*  You know, it's nature and it's a part of the earth that we live on. Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1906.0s)]
*  But it's not a part of the earth that we live on where humans are. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1910.0s)]
*  So that's why it's so fascinating and unique about the rainforest. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1913.0s)]
*  It's so wild. And so like that's where like our thing with, you know, even with the anacondas, it was like, you know, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1917.0s)]
*  it started with the snakes and they'd be like, you know, teach us about the snakes. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1923.0s)]
*  And then after a while, I was like, guys, where are the anacondas? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1927.0s)]
*  You know, like this is supposed to be the Amazon. Where the hell are they? Yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1930.0s)]
*  And so they're like, well, once a year we go on these like hunting expeditions up rivers. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1933.0s)]
*  They're like, come with us. And as this family of brothers, JJ has like 17 brothers and they're like, come with us. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1937.0s)]
*  It's literally just a dugout, a canoe, like a little, you know, 16 horsepower motor. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1943.0s)]
*  And you just go up for 10 days, 12 days to places where you go, where are we? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1946.0s)]
*  And they're like, no, no, no, it doesn't have a name. We're just on river. You just out. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1951.0s)]
*  And so, you know, we hunting and fishing and we're just like surviving off the land, going up the thing. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1956.0s)]
*  And then we started catching the anacondas basking on the sides of the river. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1961.0s)]
*  And so we just started jumping on these snakes, grabbing them by the neck. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1964.0s)]
*  The first one I did, I fucked up though. The first anaconda I ever caught. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1968.0s)]
*  The first anaconda I ever caught, I really fucked up because I was like, OK, I know how to catch snakes. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1973.0s)]
*  I've handled big snakes. I know what I'm doing. You know, they were going to come in from the bottom. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1977.0s)]
*  I was going to come in from the top. I ran in and I grabbed the snake by the head and she went and wrapped my hands and my wrists are together. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1982.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit. Oh, no. I was like, now I can't get out of this if I wanted to. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1988.0s)]
*  And the next coil came over my shoulders. And it's a 200 pound snake. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1992.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm going to get a 200 pound snake. So I'm on my knees. And so I went to scream JJ and all I got, I got nothing out. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=1996.0s)]
*  And so I'm sitting there wrapped in an anaconda with my clavicle like turning into a V. My shoulders were almost touching. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2003.0s)]
*  And I could feel my ribs just about to go. Oh, boy. And three of my friends jumped on. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2009.0s)]
*  They started untying it from the tail and everything like that. But I came that close. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2014.0s)]
*  Like, oh, boy, I really fucked up. Oh, boy. Look at the size of that thing. Is that the one? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2017.0s)]
*  That is not the one that is. Oh, look at the size of that thing. And that's not even that's not even as big as I get. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2024.0s)]
*  How big is that one? That one is 18 feet, six inches. That's so big. That's so big. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2030.0s)]
*  This one. This is the largest scientifically wild caught verified anaconda that we have in scientific literature. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2037.0s)]
*  I mean, there's people have records of bigger ones. I've seen bigger ones. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2044.0s)]
*  This is we named her Eleanor after my grandmother. That's the 18 foot one. This is the 18 feet, six inches. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2048.0s)]
*  She was 220 pounds, but she was hungry. She was. Look at the size of that thing. Yeah. Yeah. My God. Yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2053.0s)]
*  So if if that one that got a hold of you, that's not this one. It's a different. No, that one. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2060.0s)]
*  The one that got a hold of me was, you know, five feet shorter than this one. This this this thing is a dragon. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2065.0s)]
*  This thing is like the crack. And there's no way. No. What? How big do they get? That's JJ, by the way. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2070.0s)]
*  I keep talking about. OK, so here's my measurement. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2074.0s)]
*  And actually, somebody recently sent me a video of you and Forest Galante. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2078.0s)]
*  Yeah. Talking about this, about how big can an anaconda get? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2082.0s)]
*  Me and JJ were out on this place called the floating forest one night. And. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2085.0s)]
*  You know, I was trying to like I was thinking about like getting on the cover of National Geographic. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2090.0s)]
*  I was thinking about like, you know, getting attention at that time. Right. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2094.0s)]
*  And but we we we had gone deeper down the Amazon rabbit hole than like anyone had ever gone. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2097.0s)]
*  We found this place, the floating forest where you're walking on on rafts of floating grass and you're walking past treetops. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2103.0s)]
*  So there's a forest underneath the lake, but you're walking on the surface of it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2110.0s)]
*  And the Anacondas love it. Wow. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2114.0s)]
*  Because they can sit on these on these grassy islands. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2117.0s)]
*  And if anything comes, the whole thing is like a giant tympanic membrane. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2120.0s)]
*  As soon as something takes a step, they're like threat and they go down. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2123.0s)]
*  And just like any big fish, just like any ancient giant crocodile, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2126.0s)]
*  those shrewd old motherfuckers that have been there for a century. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2130.0s)]
*  That's where they live. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2133.0s)]
*  And so we were out there like two o'clock in the morning and we're walking on these grassy rafts. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2135.0s)]
*  And JJ is going, this is anaconda. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2139.0s)]
*  And I went, that is not anaconda because the grass was pushed down, but it was like it was this big. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2142.0s)]
*  I was like, this can't be anaconda. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2147.0s)]
*  He's going, this is he goes, if it was a crocodile, he goes, you'd see the, you know, the feet. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2150.0s)]
*  I was like, it just can't be. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2154.0s)]
*  And then at like middle of the night, the stars are shining in the, in the black water and everything. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2155.0s)]
*  And we're by the tops. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2161.0s)]
*  We're in the canopy of a forest on top of a lake. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2162.0s)]
*  And we see two anacondas. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2165.0s)]
*  One of them is so big that I would say it was probably twenty four, twenty five feet. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2167.0s)]
*  Gigantic. That was an 18 footer. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2171.0s)]
*  Then there was like another like a 16 footer on it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2174.0s)]
*  And my first response was we have to catch this snake. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2176.0s)]
*  And so I jumped on it. I just didn't think about it. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2179.0s)]
*  I just jumped on this snake. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2182.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2185.0s)]
*  And so the snake and, you know, I always say like, you know, Pixar, it didn't happen, but this was the middle of the night. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2187.0s)]
*  I jumped on the snake. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2193.0s)]
*  And as I'm holding it, the one measurement I have is that I was holding onto the snake and my fingers couldn't touch. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2195.0s)]
*  That's how that's how big this thing was. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2200.0s)]
*  And so it dragged me to the edge of the grass. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2202.0s)]
*  What? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2205.0s)]
*  That big. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2206.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2207.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2209.0s)]
*  Your fingers couldn't touch. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2210.0s)]
*  So like, oh my God. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2212.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2214.0s)]
*  Do that so big. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2216.0s)]
*  So fucking big. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2218.0s)]
*  And people said, oh, did it eat something? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2219.0s)]
*  It was like, no, that was that was that was how big the snake was. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2221.0s)]
*  And I know because when she got to the edge to the edge of the grass, I dipped in head for this snake could have turned around and just eat me. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2223.0s)]
*  She didn't. Her head was like bigger than a Rottweiler. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2230.0s)]
*  It's bigger than Marshall's. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2232.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2234.0s)]
*  But she dove into the water. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2235.0s)]
*  Her idea is just escape, you know, stay alive. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2236.0s)]
*  So she goes down and I my face poked into the water and I was like, fuck that. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2238.0s)]
*  You know, you start you look straight down into hell down there. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2243.0s)]
*  And I was sitting there holding onto the grass with this giant anaconda rushing by me, you know, 25 feet of anaconda slithering past me. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2246.0s)]
*  And I put my hand on her. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2253.0s)]
*  And as she went by, my hand eventually went and then her tail slipped by me. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2255.0s)]
*  And I was just just alone in the dark in the Amazon. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2258.0s)]
*  And I just seen this dragon. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2263.0s)]
*  And then I turned around and what the fuck happened to JJ and JJ is just standing there and he turned completely white and he was just his circuits were blown. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2265.0s)]
*  He was like. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2273.0s)]
*  And I was like, you could have helped. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2274.0s)]
*  You could have helped. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2277.0s)]
*  So can you just help me out here? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2279.0s)]
*  So the tree tops essentially there's water under the tree tops. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2281.0s)]
*  So you're walking on the tree tops. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2285.0s)]
*  So how deep is the water below you? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2287.0s)]
*  Like 30, 40 feet. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2289.0s)]
*  So you're essentially walking on grassy islands, floating vegetation. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2291.0s)]
*  Is it like in this video? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2296.0s)]
*  So, yes, similar to. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2298.0s)]
*  So, yes. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2299.0s)]
*  And thank you for not playing the sound on this because but yeah, it's basically exactly like this. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2300.0s)]
*  It's see those islands over there. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2305.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's floating grass. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2307.0s)]
*  And so this is actually how we caught the big one. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2308.0s)]
*  You know, everyone starts to see J.C. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2314.0s)]
*  You see JJ. JJ has unlocked everything. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2316.0s)]
*  JJ is like, there's an anaconda. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2318.0s)]
*  There's an anaconda. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2319.0s)]
*  Nobody else saw it. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2320.0s)]
*  And then I'm the only person that's willing to fuck with the head. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2321.0s)]
*  And so they get the boats. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2325.0s)]
*  This is literally how we caught the biggest anaconda's ever been caught. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2327.0s)]
*  So the camera guy was like, get the fuck out of here. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2331.0s)]
*  And I just remember in this moment being like, do I really want to do this? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2333.0s)]
*  Do I really like that? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2337.0s)]
*  Do I really want to do what I signed up to do? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2338.0s)]
*  Do you see it in the ground? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2340.0s)]
*  I can see it here. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2341.0s)]
*  I can see it here. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2342.0s)]
*  And I'm just going, please, I wish I could turn back. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2343.0s)]
*  And so for the people just listening, you're standing on the edge of the boat. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2345.0s)]
*  You jump off into the grass and you run. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2348.0s)]
*  And and thankfully, I have a good. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2352.0s)]
*  Yeah. GoPro on. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2355.0s)]
*  Yep. And then you see there's my team. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2356.0s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2357.0s)]
*  Everybody jumping in. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2359.0s)]
*  So we had all these people that have all handled big snakes before coming in. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2360.0s)]
*  And see, I don't have the head. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2365.0s)]
*  We didn't have the head. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2367.0s)]
*  JJ had the tail. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2368.0s)]
*  JJ got the tail. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2369.0s)]
*  This guy, Jonas, had the tail. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2371.0s)]
*  Mosin had the tail. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2372.0s)]
*  Lee had the tail. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2373.0s)]
*  Everybody's holding on to the snake. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2374.0s)]
*  We're using the boat to keep ourselves up. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2375.0s)]
*  And then I got the head. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2377.0s)]
*  And then as soon as I get the head. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2378.0s)]
*  I know I'm going to get wrapped again. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2381.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2383.0s)]
*  I mean, this is like, look at this. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2384.0s)]
*  This is like. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2386.0s)]
*  And this is the 18 footer. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2388.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the 18 footer. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2390.0s)]
*  Look at the size of this thing. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2391.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2393.0s)]
*  When people like, why don't you catch the 25 footer? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2394.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, look at this. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2395.0s)]
*  And just like I'm seeing how big this thing is. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2397.0s)]
*  It's unbelievably big. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2400.0s)]
*  And the idea that something was almost 10 foot bigger than this. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2404.0s)]
*  And much thicker around. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2405.0s)]
*  Much, much thicker around. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2406.0s)]
*  This girl was skinny. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2407.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2409.0s)]
*  In a second, they'll show us walking with her. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2410.0s)]
*  That is so wild. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2412.0s)]
*  And you get a sense of really how big she is. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2413.0s)]
*  And you got to keep a hold of that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2415.0s)]
*  That bitch can swallow your head. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2417.0s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2419.0s)]
*  Look at. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2420.0s)]
*  What is that feeling like? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2421.0s)]
*  Where you're holding onto the snake. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2423.0s)]
*  You're holding onto the snake. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2425.0s)]
*  What is that feeling like? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2427.0s)]
*  Where you're holding onto the head of that thing. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2431.0s)]
*  No, it's completely, completely wild. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2432.0s)]
*  And it was just, I honestly, in that moment, it was like, you want your best friends there. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2434.0s)]
*  Because man, that was, that was scary. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2439.0s)]
*  That was very scary. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2441.0s)]
*  And so what is the plan? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2442.0s)]
*  What do you do with this once you capture it? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2443.0s)]
*  Do you measure it and then let it go? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2447.0s)]
*  So for this one, here, look, there's a shot. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2448.0s)]
*  There's a shot coming up where we kind of have her stretched out for a second. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2450.0s)]
*  But with this one, we put a radio transmitter down her throat. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2453.0s)]
*  And we were able to track her movements to learn about the home ranges of female anacondas. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2456.0s)]
*  So she swallows it? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2461.0s)]
*  It's just like a big pill. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2462.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2463.0s)]
*  How big? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2464.0s)]
*  Like a Zippo lighter? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2465.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2468.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2469.0s)]
*  Look at that head. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2470.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2471.0s)]
*  Look at the teeth. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2472.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2473.0s)]
*  They were like, that's the queen of the Amazon. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2474.0s)]
*  But yeah, she was old. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2476.0s)]
*  She had so many scars. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2478.0s)]
*  And so we measured her 18 feet, six inches. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2479.0s)]
*  And then the Friendly People Discovery Channel changed it to 19 feet, six inches on the show, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2482.0s)]
*  which was always interesting. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2486.0s)]
*  How dare they. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2487.0s)]
*  How dare they. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2488.0s)]
*  That sounds like Hollywood. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2490.0s)]
*  Just got to juice it up just a little bit. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2491.0s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2492.0s)]
*  Just turn it up. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2493.0s)]
*  It's impressive enough, you folks. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2494.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2496.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2497.0s)]
*  It's so immense. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2498.0s)]
*  I just can't believe there was one that much bigger than that. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2502.0s)]
*  What is the folklore? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2503.0s)]
*  Like, what do they say when they say what's the biggest one? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2504.0s)]
*  I mean, I have people that told me that they found a 60-foot anaconda. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2508.0s)]
*  That guy's a drunk. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2512.0s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe he's telling the truth. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2515.0s)]
*  Pixar didn't happen. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2518.0s)]
*  Remember the movie Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2520.0s)]
*  I remember that there was one. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2523.0s)]
*  John Voight had the worst Brazilian accent ever. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2525.0s)]
*  It didn't even sound Brazilian. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2529.0s)]
*  I got to actually watch that movie. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2531.0s)]
*  I really feel like I should. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2532.0s)]
*  It's a terrible movie. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2533.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2534.0s)]
*  Oh, it's terrible. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2535.0s)]
*  It's terrible, but it's great. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2536.0s)]
*  It's like one of those. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2537.0s)]
*  I think it was like. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2538.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with a good bad movie. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2539.0s)]
*  I want to say it was like 90s, right? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2540.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2542.0s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2543.0s)]
*  It's a dumb. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2544.0s)]
*  But the actual big anaconda. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2547.0s)]
*  Look at the size of it. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2549.0s)]
*  The one that's coming behind Ice Cube. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2550.0s)]
*  The actual big anaconda was like. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2552.0s)]
*  That. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2555.0s)]
*  I've seen that image before, yeah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2556.0s)]
*  John Voight. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2557.0s)]
*  Geez. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2558.0s)]
*  You should hear his Brazilian accent, too. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2561.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2563.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2565.0s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2566.0s)]
*  Wait, does he two people at once? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2567.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2568.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2569.0s)]
*  It's a movie. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2570.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2571.0s)]
*  One person is not scary enough. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2572.0s)]
*  It's going to be tied together somehow. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2573.0s)]
*  You and your family. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2575.0s)]
*  Tied together somehow. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2577.0s)]
*  The snake reps. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2578.0s)]
*  So they say they've seen a 60 foot one. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2579.0s)]
*  But sure. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2582.0s)]
*  Do they have an age limit? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2583.0s)]
*  Like, do they? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2585.0s)]
*  It seems like when they get to a certain size, nothing's hunting them. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2586.0s)]
*  No, they're a predator disease or old age. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2589.0s)]
*  No. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2592.0s)]
*  So in the Amazon, the cool thing with the Amazon is it's the greatest natural battlefield [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2593.0s)]
*  on Earth. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2598.0s)]
*  It's literally just this churning death march. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2599.0s)]
*  Life is like a momentary stasis in this recycling of death. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2602.0s)]
*  And it's like, you fight for it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2606.0s)]
*  A snake that's getting big like that one that we just caught, like Eleanor. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2609.0s)]
*  So we learned that she moves around this swamp and has a home range. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2612.0s)]
*  And then eventually after a few months, she passes the transmitter. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2615.0s)]
*  She'll poop out the transmitter. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2618.0s)]
*  But one of the guys on the team, Pat, is actually I think through Acadia University. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2620.0s)]
*  We've been continuing this. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2624.0s)]
*  And we've learned that there are so many more anacondas than we thought. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2626.0s)]
*  And everyone said the traditional literature said that they're ambush predators, that they only wait. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2630.0s)]
*  And it's like, no, they're going to places where there's mineral licks in the Amazon. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2635.0s)]
*  And they stake out them. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2639.0s)]
*  They're more strategic than we thought. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2641.0s)]
*  Oh, so they wait for the animals to lick the minerals. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2645.0s)]
*  So there's places where there's like a salt deposit. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2646.0s)]
*  I've never heard of it before. It's coming there for the salt. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2648.0s)]
*  But the anacondas will go upstreams and strategically target those places. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2650.0s)]
*  And so one time we saw an anaconda eating a peccary, which is for everybody that doesn't know, it's a wild boar. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2655.0s)]
*  Like a javelina. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2661.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I was at a stream trying to take a picture of a butterfly. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2662.0s)]
*  And I heard this click, click. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2665.0s)]
*  And I looked down and there's like a 16-foot anaconda. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2667.0s)]
*  And it just bent this peccary in half. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2669.0s)]
*  And it was just looking at me. And it was like, and then it split. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2671.0s)]
*  And so once a snake leaves its meal, it's very unfortunate. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2674.0s)]
*  Because if a snake leaves its meal, it's not going to come back to it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2677.0s)]
*  So the snake left because we had gotten unknowingly, we got too close. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2679.0s)]
*  So we had wild boar that night. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2682.0s)]
*  We just threw it on the barbecue. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2685.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2688.0s)]
*  Speaking of eating things, Jamie, could you, there's a, I think it's just called monkey head. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2689.0s)]
*  I've been dying to show you this. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2694.0s)]
*  Can I ask you a question though? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2695.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2696.0s)]
*  How old do they get? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2697.0s)]
*  Like the one that you got that was 18 feet, how old do you think she was? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2698.0s)]
*  The thing is they have indeterminate growth. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2701.0s)]
*  So you take a baby anaconda, they're live born by the way, not in eggs. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2703.0s)]
*  And so you get a brand new slimy little anaconda. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2706.0s)]
*  And they come out and their food for like the jabby roost storks, for other caiman, for even fish. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2709.0s)]
*  The fish are brutal, man. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2717.0s)]
*  I just, I caught a baby caiman the other day. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2718.0s)]
*  He had no toes because the piranhas were eating his toes off. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2721.0s)]
*  But the anaconda is interesting because it has this outsized impact on the whole ecosystem. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2724.0s)]
*  Because they start off basically as prey. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2729.0s)]
*  They're just these little two foot worms. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2731.0s)]
*  But then as they grow, then all of a sudden they can eat bigger things. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2733.0s)]
*  Then they can eat the caiman back. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2736.0s)]
*  Then they can start eating the birds. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2737.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're eating capybara. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2739.0s)]
*  And then you get to the big mamas where they're the top of the ecosystem. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2741.0s)]
*  They're the top of the food chain. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2744.0s)]
*  And so you have like black caiman, anaconda, jaguar, harpy eagle, giant rib rogers. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2745.0s)]
*  And like those are your like, you know, top contenders for apex predator in the Amazon. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2750.0s)]
*  The harpy eagle is amazing. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2754.0s)]
*  What a wild looking creature. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2756.0s)]
*  Their talons. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2758.0s)]
*  They're so big too. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2759.0s)]
*  Is that the biggest eagle? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2760.0s)]
*  I don't think it's that. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2762.0s)]
*  I think the Philippine eagle or the stellar sea eagle. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2763.0s)]
*  But the harpy is just unreasonably large. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2767.0s)]
*  Like when you see them, you go that that's what that is. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2770.0s)]
*  And they eat a lot of monkeys. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2773.0s)]
*  They eat a lot of monkeys. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2774.0s)]
*  And so one of the ways to tell when there's a harpy eagle around like we'll be walking through the jungle and you just find a pile of bones. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2775.0s)]
*  Because up in that nest 150 feet up, they're just dropping monkeys and sloths and the babies are ripping them apart. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2781.0s)]
*  And then they just chuck the bones out. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2787.0s)]
*  So you'll see like a little boneyard in the jungle. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2788.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2790.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2791.0s)]
*  It doesn't last too long because nothing lasts long. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2792.0s)]
*  It just keeps recycling everything. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2794.0s)]
*  But when I was a kid, you know, in the rainforest books, they'd say 50 percent of the life in a rainforest is up in the canopy. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2796.0s)]
*  And it's like, you know, silly, like, yeah, bullshit. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2802.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2804.0s)]
*  There's more stuff up there than there is down there. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2805.0s)]
*  So when you're walking in the Amazon, you're under 150 feet of green. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2809.0s)]
*  Three percent of the sunlight is hitting the ground. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2813.0s)]
*  Most of the action is happening above you. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2815.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2817.0s)]
*  The birds, the monkeys, the bats, the snakes, the frogs, everything is moving up there. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2818.0s)]
*  There's cactuses and bromeliads and vines and it's all interconnected. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2822.0s)]
*  And there's this whole network. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2826.0s)]
*  The Amazon canopy keeps changing the like when you say how many species are on earth and it's like they're like, we really don't know because nobody nobody can spend time up in the Amazon canopy. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2827.0s)]
*  There's people that have used hot air balloons. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2837.0s)]
*  There's people that have used giant nets. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2839.0s)]
*  You can climb up with a rope, but then like you're kind of limited to one tree. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2842.0s)]
*  I just we just spent the last two months building the tallest tree house in the world. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2846.0s)]
*  It's like above. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2851.0s)]
*  See, can you get can you do treehouse? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2853.0s)]
*  It's it's it's insane. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2855.0s)]
*  I slept up there for one night. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2857.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2858.0s)]
*  Look at this coming out of the mist. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2859.0s)]
*  I just slept up there for one night. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2860.0s)]
*  And in the morning, I couldn't believe what I saw. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2862.0s)]
*  We woke up and it was like what they tell you in the rainforest books. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2866.0s)]
*  It was like there was like three species of monkeys, like 15 different species of birds. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2870.0s)]
*  There was things just moving all over the place. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2874.0s)]
*  There's a little treehouse, little. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2876.0s)]
*  It takes like 10 minutes to walk up there. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2879.0s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2881.0s)]
*  Yeah, apparently it's the tallest treehouse in the world. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2882.0s)]
*  It's in the middle of the Amazon now. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2884.0s)]
*  And we had so how many feet up is it? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2887.0s)]
*  I think it's about I think the floor is about 110 feet up. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2889.0s)]
*  And how long did it take to build this thing? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2892.0s)]
*  Couple of months took like three months. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2895.0s)]
*  Actually brought in some expert treehouse builders. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2896.0s)]
*  These guys, the treehouse community and they that's insane. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2898.0s)]
*  They build treehouses all over the world. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2900.0s)]
*  But this one it was like we had to figure out like how do you even build a stair? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2902.0s)]
*  The staircase was half the project. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2905.0s)]
*  How do you build a staircase to get up to the top of this tree? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2907.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2910.0s)]
*  You guys did an amazing job. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2911.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2912.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2913.0s)]
*  I want to go. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2914.0s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2915.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2916.0s)]
*  The solar panels. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2917.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2918.0s)]
*  So you get electricity up there. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2919.0s)]
*  That's fucking bad ass. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2920.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2922.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's really still there right now. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2923.0s)]
*  Still there. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2925.0s)]
*  No, like it just got there. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2926.0s)]
*  You see how fresh that wood is. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2927.0s)]
*  It's like it's not even done. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2928.0s)]
*  Like I left there to come here. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2929.0s)]
*  You sleep there when you're there. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2933.0s)]
*  That's your spot. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2934.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2935.0s)]
*  Me and my girlfriend just slept up there and woke up. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2936.0s)]
*  You talking to a girl and going up there. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2938.0s)]
*  She must be an angel. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2942.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2944.0s)]
*  Dude, if you if you're going to hang out with me, there's a lot of snakes, a lot of climbing. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2945.0s)]
*  Oh, I can imagine. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2948.0s)]
*  You got to go to the treehouse. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2949.0s)]
*  But now when you wake up in the morning and look out from there, it's got to be insane. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2951.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the sun coming up in the east and you have like red apocalypse, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2955.0s)]
*  beautiful mist coming off the jungle and you have spider monkeys like excited because that's a fig. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2960.0s)]
*  That's a ficus. And so everyone's excited to eat. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2966.0s)]
*  So all the animals are coming to the treehouse. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2969.0s)]
*  And so you have like howler monkeys, spider monkeys, capuchin, squirrel monkeys. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2971.0s)]
*  I can't even name all the birds for you. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2975.0s)]
*  It just take too long. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2977.0s)]
*  But there's just it's like cacophonous. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2978.0s)]
*  Like I couldn't talk to you because we wouldn't be able to hear each other. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2979.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2982.0s)]
*  And then you scream and there's like fruit falling on you and animals are shitting all over the place. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2983.0s)]
*  And there's like leaf cutter ants are starting up their day. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2987.0s)]
*  And there's like bullet ants fucking around being like, who can I who can I take down today? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2989.0s)]
*  Like it is wild. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2993.0s)]
*  But it's like that's why we were like, OK, we got it because otherwise you climb up on a rope and you're like holding onto a branch and you look around and you go down. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=2994.0s)]
*  This is like now you now you can go up there and like take it in. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3001.0s)]
*  And it's a whole other world. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3006.0s)]
*  And so you have solar panels. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3008.0s)]
*  So do you have batteries up there? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3009.0s)]
*  Do you have like how are you running that? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3011.0s)]
*  Well, one of the guys on my team, Stefan, is a complete psychopath and an intense problem solver. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3013.0s)]
*  He put solar panels, hot water, a bathroom. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3019.0s)]
*  So this is now this isn't just a treehouse. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3023.0s)]
*  This is like a luxury treehouse, a bathroom, like running water, a shower. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3025.0s)]
*  So you have solar panels. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3030.0s)]
*  So this is now this isn't just a treehouse. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3032.0s)]
*  This is like a luxury treehouse, a bathroom, like running water, a shower. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3033.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3038.0s)]
*  So you have pipes that go down the side of the. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3039.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3041.0s)]
*  So this pipes. The idea is that like you can't bring a high volume of tourists into a pristine rainforest. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3042.0s)]
*  And like tourism is a major help for for helping us protect this place. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3047.0s)]
*  So it's like we went with like the African model, like the guys I work with in Africa at Vepa. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3051.0s)]
*  They were like, you know, they work on a hunting reserve and the owner of the reserve explained it to me like this. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3055.0s)]
*  He was like, look, no one's going to pay thirty thousand dollars to take a picture of a buffalo, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3060.0s)]
*  but they might pay thirty thousand dollars to shoot a buffalo. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3064.0s)]
*  And that like stuck in my head and it was like, how do we how do we get less tourists at more value? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3067.0s)]
*  And it's like build the tallest, most remote, comfortable luxury treehouse in the world. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3071.0s)]
*  And it's like, so now so now we can invite people up there and be like, you can like literally live stream like Wi-Fi. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3077.0s)]
*  We got we got Starlink up there. We carried some Starlink out there. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3082.0s)]
*  Yeah. So when you messaged me, I was out there. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3085.0s)]
*  I was out there. That's how I got it. I got it on Starlink. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3088.0s)]
*  I was out in the jungle and I was like, oh, shit, guys. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3090.0s)]
*  I got to go back to the U.S. for a minute. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3093.0s)]
*  Wow. So you could have like the ultimate experience going to you could make a bunch of those. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3095.0s)]
*  Yeah. And people would pay an insane amount of money to go there. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3104.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's the idea. So we're going to see if it works. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3108.0s)]
*  Because since the beginning, like when I started with JJ, it was like we bring people to the jungle. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3111.0s)]
*  You camp out with us. You live in the tent with us. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3116.0s)]
*  And it was like the market for that is like really small. Right. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3119.0s)]
*  There's like six people that want to do that. Nobody wants to do that. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3122.0s)]
*  And like and the people that do want to do it, ask them in the morning if they still want to do it. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3125.0s)]
*  They don't. And so so making it so that people can actually come and see the Amazon rainforest in a way that's that's like safe and bug free and air conditioned and everything else. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3129.0s)]
*  And it's like you can just wake up and look at it all. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3139.0s)]
*  It's like so it's that it's a it's a it's an amazing thing. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3142.0s)]
*  I can't believe that I got to sleep up there. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3145.0s)]
*  So it's like it's it's pretty cool. That's insane. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3148.0s)]
*  Yeah. So back to the Anaconda. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3151.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out how old they get. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3155.0s)]
*  They get old, man. I think I think like I would say 70. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3158.0s)]
*  So because when you have like a ball python, you're talking like 30 years or something like that. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3162.0s)]
*  But do they know that they have a lifespan? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3166.0s)]
*  Is that a thing that happens with them or they just keep going? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3168.0s)]
*  There's some animals that live on Earth. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3171.0s)]
*  Like, I think there's a shark that's older than the United States that's still alive. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3174.0s)]
*  It's like a type of what is it a Greenland shark? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3180.0s)]
*  There's a type of shark that's literally from like the seventeen hundreds. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3183.0s)]
*  Yeah. Still living. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3187.0s)]
*  They also pulled a spearhead out of a I want to say a right whale where the same thing. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3189.0s)]
*  And they dated that spearhead back to like the eighteen thirties or something. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3194.0s)]
*  How long the Greenland sharks lives like science. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3198.0s)]
*  That's when the Greenland shark lives at least two hundred fifty years. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3200.0s)]
*  They may live over five hundred years. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3203.0s)]
*  And that thing is just down in the black abyss, just moving, just blind, just swimming around. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3206.0s)]
*  When our grandparents were alive, it was just doing that. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3211.0s)]
*  Yeah. People were riding horses. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3214.0s)]
*  That thing's just swimming around. The Internet comes around. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3216.0s)]
*  It's still swimming. Chat GPT still swimming. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3219.0s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3222.0s)]
*  I just wonder how old Anaconda's get. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3224.0s)]
*  So the folklore about them, the 60 foot ones, like I wonder if that's real. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3226.0s)]
*  I wonder if they just keep growing. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3231.0s)]
*  I think I wouldn't be surprised if they're well into the thirties. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3233.0s)]
*  If you told me that somebody found a 35 foot Anaconda, I'd be like, absolutely. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3236.0s)]
*  What is the world record that they've ever discovered? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3239.0s)]
*  I don't know. Again, we have the scientifically verified. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3241.0s)]
*  Captured 18 six is not that big. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3245.0s)]
*  Not as big. I've seen bigger. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3248.0s)]
*  I know other people that have seen like people at trust that have seen bigger. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3249.0s)]
*  There's bigger Anaconda's out there for sure. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3253.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's no way to know. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3256.0s)]
*  There's so much territory. Yeah. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3258.0s)]
*  There's so much territory because in between those rivers is just eons of unbroken forests. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3261.0s)]
*  Like we have to worry about the Amazon. It's being cut down. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3268.0s)]
*  But there are still places that unreal. That's a dick pic. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3270.0s)]
*  That's the one that keeps popping up. There's only a few pictures online. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3276.0s)]
*  The largest ones that's like 30 feet. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3279.0s)]
*  So is that a perspective thing? Like someone holds a fish in front of them like this. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3280.0s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. And that's why I said that. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3283.0s)]
*  Because like they're holding that so much closer to the camera and that's a retic. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3286.0s)]
*  So that's Indonesia. That's somewhere in Southeast Asia. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3291.0s)]
*  Still big. It's still big, but it could be like 11 feet, which is kind of a puppy still. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3294.0s)]
*  So there's other ones where it shows like an Anaconda wrapped around a giant tractor. Are those fake? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3300.0s)]
*  I think those are fake. There's one though where they're cutting an Indonesian farm worker out of a reticulated python. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3305.0s)]
*  That's real. 100 percent. I mean people do get eaten by snakes. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3310.0s)]
*  I mean that's not you know, it's like that. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3314.0s)]
*  Like I remember because like when I was like, I say even up until like five years ago, it would always be like, are these videos real? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3316.0s)]
*  And then like two years ago or so they're like, watch this. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3321.0s)]
*  And like you see the guy fall out of the snake and you're like, OK, that one's real. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3325.0s)]
*  It does happen. It does happen. How often does it happen? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3329.0s)]
*  How often does it happen? Is it something that they worry about or is it just like a very rare occurrence of someone being in the wrong place at the wrong time? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3332.0s)]
*  You got to be pretty I mean as a human, you got to be pretty stupid to get eaten by an Anaconda. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3338.0s)]
*  You got to be doing something really stupid. Really? Yeah. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3341.0s)]
*  I mean, because like you're walking through the jungle, like you know, you know not to go up to your chest in certain swamps. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3344.0s)]
*  Dude, I was I was just feeling walking around knowing this giant snakes around beat up your chest and water. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3353.0s)]
*  Fuck out of here. Forget the giant snakes. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3360.0s)]
*  When you fall into that nightmare soup at two in the morning and you're and you get that black water on you and there's there's things going up your pants. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3361.0s)]
*  There are insects in the water. There are tarantulas walking on the water eating the frogs. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3369.0s)]
*  It's like you are in a festival of sex and death when you're in the Amazon night. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3374.0s)]
*  Like it is falling into that water. Like when we go in there to do research, we're like looking at frogs and shit. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3379.0s)]
*  And it's like we put our socks over our pants to like make sure because otherwise shit gets up there. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3384.0s)]
*  One girl got bitten like 16 times by this giant aquatic water spider thing that went up her leg just going like Morse coding her just like got got got got got got just like pumping venom into her. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3390.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. How bad she had fucked up. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3399.0s)]
*  I emotionally I think it was worse than the pain because the pain gave us some Benadryl and she like slept it off. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3403.0s)]
*  But like she was just like God, it was so horrible. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3407.0s)]
*  She was like I was like slapping my leg trying to get this thing to stop biting me and it was just getting more scared. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3409.0s)]
*  So it was biting her more and it's like you don't even know what it is. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3414.0s)]
*  Oh, it could be a new species. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3418.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3420.0s)]
*  You don't even know what it is. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3423.0s)]
*  No, we find stuff. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3425.0s)]
*  I don't have a real accounting of all the different species. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3426.0s)]
*  No, no, no, they don't. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3429.0s)]
*  And so like people say all like a bullet ant is the most painful insect bite. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3431.0s)]
*  And it's like, dude, I've been bitten by stung by bullet ants like eight times. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3434.0s)]
*  They hurt. They suck. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3437.0s)]
*  But I found a caterpillar that was like, you know, again, maybe like two zippos. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3438.0s)]
*  And I had it on a leaf and I was trying to put it in a terrarium and the leaf like bent under the things. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3444.0s)]
*  It was like yellow. It kind of looked like Trump's hair. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3450.0s)]
*  And it like fell on my hand and I was plunged into immediate like electroshock like pain waves. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3452.0s)]
*  Way worse than a bullet ant. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3459.0s)]
*  Way worse. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3461.0s)]
*  Whatever this caterpillar did to me fucked me up for days. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3462.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3464.0s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3465.0s)]
*  Some kind of venom. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3467.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, under under then then I like I really got scared because then I was like, OK, do I have to get out of the forest? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3468.0s)]
*  So like we went in with like forceps and like moved the hair and like underneath the hair. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3474.0s)]
*  It has like these like Christmas tree barbs and the hair is covering those barbs. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3478.0s)]
*  Yes. Something something like that. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3482.0s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3484.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that thing. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3485.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, that that was I was not laughing like when we get bit by a bullet ant, we're like, oh shit. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3486.0s)]
*  Like your day is over. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3493.0s)]

*  No, this is another one. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3499.0s)]
*  This is in Florida. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3501.0s)]
*  This is a pus caterpillar. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3503.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3505.0s)]
*  In Florida. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3507.0s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3508.0s)]
*  So is that an invasive species? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3509.0s)]
*  So many of those in Florida. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3511.0s)]
*  Most venomous caterpillars in the U.S. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3513.0s)]
*  So what does it say? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3515.0s)]

*  It says it's like a bee sting. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3521.0s)]
*  Only worse pain immediately rapidly gets worse from being stung. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3523.0s)]
*  It can even make your bones hurt. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3526.0s)]
*  So does that exactly what got you or something? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3529.0s)]
*  No, something something in that family, something related to that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3532.0s)]

*  They're not that big. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3558.0s)]
*  I caught one that's a little bit too big. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3559.0s)]
*  And she like I couldn't get an arm over her. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3561.0s)]
*  I had her by the neck and I couldn't get an arm over her tail because her tail was like over here. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3563.0s)]
*  And she thrashed out. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3567.0s)]
*  And I stupid, stupid, stupid. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3568.0s)]
*  I like grabbed one of her. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3570.0s)]
*  You just let her go. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3571.0s)]
*  You know, there's no reason for this. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3572.0s)]
*  I just I grabbed like a hind leg and I was like, oh, I'm going to read. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3574.0s)]
*  She just came around and just nailed me and snapped my watch in half. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3577.0s)]
*  Like she just like put a nail through the watch I had, which was great because it saved me. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3581.0s)]
*  And then I still have this like something in my arm in my hand, just like a bone knot. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3585.0s)]
*  But like then her other tooth went in there and came out there and it's like, it's just stupid. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3592.0s)]
*  Now more careful when I catch crocs. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3596.0s)]
*  How big is that caiman? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3597.0s)]
*  They're fairly small in that family, right? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3599.0s)]
*  Well, you have the we have four species where we are. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3603.0s)]
*  We have the smooth fronted. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3605.0s)]
*  We have the dwarf, which are both like, you know, like three feet, five feet. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3606.0s)]
*  And then you have spectacled, which can get up to like, you know, eight, nine feet. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3609.0s)]
*  And then you have black caiman that can be 18 feet long. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3612.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3614.0s)]
*  Well, black caiman is a real black caiman is a real thing. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3615.0s)]
*  Really? Oh, yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3617.0s)]
*  Eighteen feet long. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3618.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3620.0s)]
*  No, like a black caiman skull is like, oh, my God. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3621.0s)]
*  They're huge. Let me see what that looks like. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3623.0s)]
*  I always thought I was under the impression that caimans were the smaller ones. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3625.0s)]
*  I didn't know they got that big. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3628.0s)]
*  You know, black black caiman looks like an alligator. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3629.0s)]
*  Like it's it's they're monsters. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3632.0s)]
*  A big alligator. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3634.0s)]
*  They get 18 feet long. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3636.0s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3639.0s)]
*  So you encountered those? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3641.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've encountered those. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3643.0s)]
*  I was what the fuck, dude. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3645.0s)]
*  Dinosaurs. Oh, they're huge. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3647.0s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3650.0s)]
*  There is one spot that we were we were exploring. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3652.0s)]
*  This is, again, one of those places where you're way past like the edge of civilization. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3655.0s)]
*  And we were we found this like swamp. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3658.0s)]
*  And again, it's always JJ that finds everything. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3661.0s)]
*  He goes, oh, no. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3663.0s)]
*  I don't know what he goes. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3665.0s)]
*  Look at these. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3666.0s)]
*  And there's like a drag mark. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3667.0s)]
*  Huge black caiman like monsters, like a two foot thick stomach. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3669.0s)]
*  And then these monster hands on either side, you know, the feet as it's walking. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3673.0s)]
*  And we're like following this thing and it comes to the water and floating in the water is the bodies of all these dead peccary, all these dead wild boar floating in the water. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3676.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what am I looking at here? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3685.0s)]
*  And we got a stick and we brought him in. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3687.0s)]
*  And we realized a whole herd of pigs had tried to swim across this water. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3689.0s)]
*  And this monstrous Godzilla black caiman had just gone and just push, push, push, just took down like 10 of them. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3694.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3701.0s)]
*  And so we just were like checking out his refrigerator like they were just there for later. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3703.0s)]
*  They're just like floating there. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3707.0s)]
*  So he's in the area. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3709.0s)]
*  He was in he was in the area. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3710.0s)]
*  We were like up to our knees. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3711.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I was like, we should probably we should probably go to. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3712.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3718.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3719.0s)]
*  No, like they're scary, big, like they're scary, scary, scary, scary. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3720.0s)]
*  Are those similar to the ones they have in like Costa Rica? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3723.0s)]
*  Costa Rica, I believe this is outside of my expertise, but I think you have American crocodiles and I think you have spectacle caimans there. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3726.0s)]
*  I don't think you have black caiman in Costa Rica. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3733.0s)]
*  We saw some big crocodiles in Costa Rica. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3735.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, man. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3738.0s)]
*  I mean, big for me. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3740.0s)]
*  I don't know how big they measure them, but they were we were on a boat trip and we're going down this river and you see him slide. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3741.0s)]
*  And you see him sliding into the water. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3747.0s)]
*  So there's ones that were sunning on the side and then you see him just slide in the water. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3748.0s)]
*  It was very creepy. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3754.0s)]
*  Because the water is brown and you can't see shit and you know they're there. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3755.0s)]
*  They don't bother you. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3759.0s)]
*  I just stepped on a came in the other like a small one. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3761.0s)]
*  I stepped on a came in the other day and I was like, you know, he freaked out. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3763.0s)]
*  OK. Costa Rica crocodiles. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3766.0s)]
*  They weigh between eight hundred and twelve hundred pounds. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3768.0s)]
*  They get between 13 and 16 feet long. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3770.0s)]
*  Yeah. Those are the ones that we saw. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3773.0s)]
*  So that's a different kind of American crocodile. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3774.0s)]
*  So it's the same as the ones that they have in like Florida. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3776.0s)]
*  Is that that true? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3779.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3781.0s)]
*  That's not very Costa Rican crocodile. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3782.0s)]
*  Something different. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3784.0s)]
*  Can get very big indeed. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3785.0s)]
*  So so I think they're saying it's the same thing. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3787.0s)]
*  So they're saying because I know the American crocodiles, they're smaller than the alligators, but much more aggressive. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3790.0s)]
*  You know, they spotted Nile crocodiles in the in the Everglades. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3800.0s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3803.0s)]
*  No. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3804.0s)]
*  They've got a kill on site order for Nile crocodiles. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3805.0s)]
*  They've at least spotted one. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3808.0s)]
*  They don't know if it's breeding. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3810.0s)]
*  They don't know if it's more than one. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3812.0s)]
*  That's so much worse than Burmese pythons. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3813.0s)]
*  It's the Florida thing is so goddamn crazy. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3815.0s)]
*  It's so wild. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3819.0s)]
*  It's so wild. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3821.0s)]
*  What's happened down there that there's literally 99 percent of all the mammals are missing from the Everglades. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3822.0s)]
*  Ninety nine percent. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3828.0s)]
*  Ninety nine. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3830.0s)]
*  Google that. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3831.0s)]
*  They found four since the 90s. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3832.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3835.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3836.0s)]
*  So they found four over there. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3837.0s)]
*  But there. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3838.0s)]
*  So that's even worse because they're out there. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3839.0s)]
*  You know they're in there. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3840.0s)]
*  You know they're in there. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3841.0s)]
*  They found Nile crocodiles. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3842.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3846.0s)]
*  I guaranteed some asshole with a pet. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3849.0s)]
*  Let them go. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3850.0s)]
*  Now they're breeding. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3851.0s)]
*  Oh, but that's so much scary. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3852.0s)]
*  I mean, it's all scary. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3853.0s)]
*  The smash power that they have to take down a wildebeest to rip the head off a zebra like I played a video on my Instagram that I found of one snapping a pig in half. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3854.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3862.0s)]
*  It just has the. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3863.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3864.0s)]
*  Just snap. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3866.0s)]
*  And just chucks down the leg. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3867.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3868.0s)]
*  But see if you can find that statistic on the Everglades that there's 99 percent of the mammals are missing. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3869.0s)]
*  I think it's true. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3875.0s)]
*  I think it's true. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3876.0s)]
*  I think it's 99 percent of all the raccoon. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3877.0s)]
*  99 percent of all the deer. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3879.0s)]
*  Everything because the fucking crocodiles ate them all. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3881.0s)]
*  Well, it's everything. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3883.0s)]
*  It says it's because the pythons. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3885.0s)]
*  But could be 99. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3886.0s)]
*  Look at that study published Monday in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found the sightings of medium sized mammal mammals are down drastically as much as 99 percent. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3887.0s)]
*  In some cases in areas where pythons and other large invasive large non-native constrictor snakes are known to be lurking. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3898.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3906.0s)]
*  So the people that I know that have been there say it's over the last few decades is drastic. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3909.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3913.0s)]
*  You don't see anything anymore. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3914.0s)]
*  You just see the snakes and you see alligators. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3915.0s)]
*  What's like Guam? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3918.0s)]
*  Guam had that problem with the snakes. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3919.0s)]
*  They they there was on the island of Guam. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3921.0s)]
*  They had a monstrous snake problem. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3923.0s)]
*  But there that's the funny thing with the jungle is like it's everything is so there's so many there's so many predators. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3924.0s)]
*  Everything is eating each other. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3932.0s)]
*  So it's like you don't have any one thing. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3933.0s)]
*  The balance is in Amazon. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3935.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3936.0s)]
*  In the Amazon. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3937.0s)]
*  That's the thing about the invasive species that get introduced into an ecosystem that you know nothing is there to eat them. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3938.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3945.0s)]
*  These Python hunters that are finding these massive pythons in the Everglades is it's so crazy to watch how many of them there are and how they keep finding them. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3946.0s)]
*  I see like kids on social media going out and like literally like finding Burmese pythons. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3956.0s)]
*  Everyone can do it. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3961.0s)]
*  They say there's a half a million of them at least in the Everglades. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3962.0s)]
*  I mean it's it's warm. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3965.0s)]
*  It's wet. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3966.0s)]
*  There's wildlife. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3967.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3968.0s)]
*  It's just like it's fucking something to do with that. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3969.0s)]
*  How do they do that now? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3973.0s)]
*  It's like they're so invasive. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3974.0s)]
*  They're so in the system. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3976.0s)]
*  How could they possibly eradicate them? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3978.0s)]
*  There's there's I mean cane toads in Australia. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3980.0s)]
*  I mean there's there's so many examples of this where we've transported something or I think it was well I think it was cats. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3983.0s)]
*  In New Zealand devastated house cats. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3990.0s)]
*  Australia as well. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3991.0s)]
*  They brought them in to kill off other things and they just devastated ground nesting birds and anything else. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3997.0s)]
*  No like tragic. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3998.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=3999.0s)]
*  It's really sad. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4000.0s)]
*  But what can they do? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4001.0s)]
*  What at this point the Everglades are so high. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4002.0s)]
*  Higher Florida men's to go out. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4005.0s)]
*  They think they are doing right. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4007.0s)]
*  They are doing that. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4009.0s)]
*  But a reward on them. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4010.0s)]
*  But how much of a dent can they even put in it one on one. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4011.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a reward. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4014.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a problem that you can really solve because if you get those big ones but then it's like there's there's so cryptic snakes are so cryptic like again that what we've learned about anacondas is like they're they can be around you and you don't know it like they'll go in the sand in a river and they'll like stick their nose up and they'll just be resting and they'll be like I ate last week. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4015.0s)]
*  I'm just going to chill here. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4027.0s)]
*  And so like we'll be walking up a stream and if that snake like one snakes have like radio transmitters in them we're like oh my god they are so cryptic. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4028.0s)]
*  We have none of the equipment required to find them. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4036.0s)]
*  So like the babies. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4038.0s)]
*  They're in the leaf litter. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4039.0s)]
*  They're in the swamps. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4040.0s)]
*  They're like that. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4041.0s)]
*  We're never going to get them out. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4042.0s)]
*  Like that's just the way it is now. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4043.0s)]
*  Like I think I totally think that they should try as much as possible. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4045.0s)]
*  Poor poor Florida wildlife. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4049.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4050.0s)]
*  But realistically. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4051.0s)]
*  What are you going to do. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4052.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4054.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4055.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4056.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4058.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4059.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4060.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4061.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4062.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4063.0s)]
*  What are you going to do. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4065.0s)]
*  They're eating alligators. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4066.0s)]
*  No I'm sure you've seen that. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4067.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4068.0s)]
*  There's like a picture where it like exploded outside. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4069.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4070.0s)]
*  They're trying to eat alligators are too big. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4071.0s)]
*  You know like 12 foot alligators. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4072.0s)]
*  We need to find someone to explain to the pythons what size alligator is the proper size alligator that is so gangster though try to eat something bigger than you and it bursts out the side of your body. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4075.0s)]
*  Like how big do pythons get. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4085.0s)]
*  What is the biggest Python ever. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4087.0s)]
*  I think I think berms gets like 18 feet. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4089.0s)]

*  This was like at home. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4124.0s)]
*  And so yeah you see there's the tip of it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4126.0s)]
*  Oh bro. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4127.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4128.0s)]
*  So this is where you're already at home and you're getting it extracted. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4129.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4131.0s)]
*  See that's a big one. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4132.0s)]
*  That's as thick as like almost as thick as a pencil. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4133.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4135.0s)]
*  Look at that thing they're pulling out of you. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4136.0s)]
*  What does it feel like when it's in you. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4139.0s)]
*  Look at the size of that dude. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4144.0s)]
*  And they eat. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4145.0s)]
*  You know they eat it. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4146.0s)]
*  Plus it comes out Dr. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4147.0s)]
*  Pimple. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4148.0s)]
*  She would be proud. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4149.0s)]
*  Oh my. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4150.0s)]
*  They at night they wake you up because they'll start they'll start. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4151.0s)]
*  They start chewing on you. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4154.0s)]
*  They really suck. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4155.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4156.0s)]
*  And that's the only way to get them out is to pull it. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4157.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4158.0s)]
*  You got them all over your side and your arm. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4159.0s)]
*  How did you get them. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4160.0s)]
*  Apparently a fly catches a mosquito and lays its eggs on the mosquito or moths. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4162.0s)]
*  We think it's the moths in our region because usually every time I get bot flies it's when [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4168.0s)]
*  I'm doing such intense work that I don't have time to wash my clothes. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4173.0s)]
*  It's totally linked to how clean you are because like I'll take off a sweaty ass shirt throw [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4178.0s)]
*  it over a stick go to bed wake up and then be like boom throw it back on and go. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4182.0s)]
*  And then like a week later you get bot flies. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4187.0s)]
*  And it's like because the moths are covering your shirt at night and the mosquitoes are [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4188.0s)]
*  all they're all like the sweat. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4191.0s)]
*  And so you see all these bugs at night all over your shit. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4192.0s)]
*  There's just eggs in there. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4195.0s)]
*  There's just eggs and then it gets on your skin and it gets in there. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4196.0s)]
*  So like I was and then I and then like I wasn't sleeping and then like they kind of get infected [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4199.0s)]

*  I wish I could remember this. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4257.0s)]
*  There's a great book on parasites where they said something like the number of parasites [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4258.0s)]
*  for every species on earth how many parasites exist specifically for that. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4261.0s)]
*  And it's like there's more parasites than there are animals on earth and it's fuck. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4266.0s)]
*  It makes you it makes you not you know. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4271.0s)]
*  So that's a thing to have to deal with. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4274.0s)]
*  That's a thing to have to deal with. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4276.0s)]

*  No they popped out of his hole and he murked this thing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4303.0s)]
*  He just like bit it on the face. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4306.0s)]
*  He shoved its fangs right in its eyes and the mouse. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4307.0s)]
*  It was funny too because I was watching the mouse. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4310.0s)]
*  I did not see the tarantula and the tarantula jumped out and shoved its fangs into the mouse's eyes. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4312.0s)]
*  And the mouse went into like instant arrest. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4317.0s)]
*  Like it was paralyzed. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4319.0s)]
*  It just went straight out and didn't move and the tarantula was like and like pulled it down into its hole. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4321.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4326.0s)]

*  No. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4337.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4339.0s)]
*  God that is the worst way to go. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4341.0s)]
*  Thank God those things are as small as they are. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4344.0s)]
*  I found a video the other day and I put it on my Instagram of a giant toad eating mice. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4346.0s)]

*  And they can't even really crush them so it's probably just like. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4354.0s)]
*  Swallow it. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4356.0s)]
*  Stuff it in its mouth hole. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4357.0s)]
*  But it's so creepy to watch because you don't realize like how big their mouths are until you see them stuff a rat in there. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4358.0s)]
*  So it's someone some sick fuck had set this up. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4364.0s)]
*  They put the toad, this big giant yellow looking toad in like a fish tank with a bunch of rats running around. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4367.0s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4375.0s)]

*  Don't you get a notification when they pull shit down? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4391.0s)]
*  I think pretty soon there's going to be more people with tattoos of your face than not. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4393.0s)]

*  So look at this giant toad and these rats are running around trying to get free. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4417.0s)]
*  Watch when he grabs one. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4422.0s)]
*  No no no no no no no no. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4423.0s)]

*  It doesn't seem like a... [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4436.0s)]
*  It digests it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4437.0s)]
*  Just swallows it whole. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4438.0s)]

*  They just seem so... [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4451.0s)]
*  There's something about reptiles and frogs and turtles. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4452.0s)]
*  They just seem so heartless. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4455.0s)]
*  Just yeah. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4457.0s)]

*  Just... [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4461.0s)]
*  Dude we found a large... [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4462.0s)]
*  I forget what type of spider it was but it was eating a snake one night. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4464.0s)]
*  That was fun. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4467.0s)]
*  I love seeing the interspecies things. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4468.0s)]
*  You see a tarantula eating a mouse or you see a spider eating a snake. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4470.0s)]
*  And it's like this is just worse than it should be. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4476.0s)]
*  It always happens in the middle of the night too. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4479.0s)]
*  It's always like not when you want to see that shit. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4481.0s)]
*  Well I would imagine it makes you really appreciate civilization. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4483.0s)]
*  In some way. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4489.0s)]
*  At least the peace and quiet. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4490.0s)]
*  I guess not though because I guess you really appreciate that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4492.0s)]
*  I like where it's wild. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4495.0s)]
*  I like to see... [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4497.0s)]
*  I mean look the Amazon is so important that it's like to me of course as a conservationist I'm like we need all of these crazy creations to be doing that. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4500.0s)]
*  To create that ecosystem. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4509.0s)]
*  So to me that's very comforting. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4511.0s)]
*  Let all that crazy shit be there. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4513.0s)]
*  If you don't like it don't live there. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4515.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4516.0s)]
*  If you don't live in Connecticut. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4517.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4518.0s)]
*  But the wilder it is. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4519.0s)]
*  You go to the jungle in January and you go into a swamp and it's just a freak show. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4522.0s)]
*  It's just all of that. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4527.0s)]
*  And you just go through the swamp and there's all these frogs and snakes and night monkeys and anacondas and black cavemen and all this shit. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4529.0s)]
*  And you see eyes looking at you through the darkness and it's jaguars. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4535.0s)]
*  And it's like it is wild. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4537.0s)]
*  Are the jaguars something to be worried about? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4540.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4542.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4543.0s)]
*  I got woken up by a jaguar one time. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4544.0s)]
*  I was on one of those solos and I was in my hammock and the jag came up. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4545.0s)]
*  I was very lost and very alone and I was like on like day six or something of being lost. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4550.0s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4554.0s)]
*  No it wasn't that long of a solo. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4555.0s)]
*  But I was lost and I was scared. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4557.0s)]
*  How did you get lost? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4559.0s)]
*  Well as soon as you leave the river. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4560.0s)]
*  Like you could literally walk 15 feet and then be like I'm just going to come right back. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4562.0s)]
*  And the jungle will like blare with you. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4567.0s)]
*  You will you because it's all green. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4571.0s)]
*  So you just like think you know what you're doing. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4573.0s)]
*  Just like just last week I took people I wanted to cross from one trail to another trail and I was like I'm a guide. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4575.0s)]
*  I can do this. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4580.0s)]
*  And I came back out on the same trail like a half hour later and I was like yep that's what I meant to do. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4581.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4585.0s)]
*  Like happens to JJ all the time. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4586.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4588.0s)]
*  You cannot find your way in the jungle. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4589.0s)]
*  Do you use a compass? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4590.0s)]
*  Don't use a compass. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4591.0s)]
*  Why not? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4592.0s)]
*  Because actually apparently some of the iron content and some of the saps in the trees pulls the needle. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4593.0s)]
*  It doesn't work really well. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4599.0s)]
*  Even the trees are trying to trick you. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4600.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4604.0s)]
*  GPS is run out of batteries. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4606.0s)]
*  You know it's like it's like you really just you have to learn your your your bushcraft. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4608.0s)]
*  You have to learn how to navigate in the jungle. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4612.0s)]
*  And it's like there which is pretty much you have to get just amazing at dead reckoning and remembering your your course because it's so dense that like we play with people. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4614.0s)]
*  We go you know go see if you can go from here to there. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4626.0s)]
*  It's like they can't they can't go there. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4628.0s)]
*  They can't do that as soon as you leave the river. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4629.0s)]
*  So like I had gone out on this solo gotten lost gotten scared and then been like oh shit. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4631.0s)]
*  What if I just like into the wild did myself. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4636.0s)]
*  What if now I'm going to be the next kid that went died in the Amazon and like I like slept in a in the hammock. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4638.0s)]
*  But this is like as I was learning so I didn't realize that the hammock that I had bought had a mosquito net on top. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4644.0s)]
*  But the back was not mosquito proof so they could stick through. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4650.0s)]
*  So my back was being destroyed by mosquitoes as I'm trying to sleep and like a couple of nights of that. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4654.0s)]
*  And so I finally fall asleep and I wake up in the middle of the night and I hear breathing right next to my face. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4660.0s)]
*  And I like wanted to turn my headlamp on and I just hear like right here. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4667.0s)]
*  Like I could feel her breath and I was like six inches away from a Jaguars face. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4674.0s)]
*  And she just like you know and then left and she just came in. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4679.0s)]
*  She wanted to see what that was. She was like you're not going to move. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4686.0s)]
*  That's what you're not going to do. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4688.0s)]
*  She growled like right into my ear and then later on. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4690.0s)]
*  That one's cute. That's a cute picture. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4694.0s)]
*  That's a cute Jag. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4697.0s)]
*  Wow. And they vary in colors and the spots and everything right. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4700.0s)]
*  Like some of them are much darker. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4705.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well I mean yeah actually somebody recently was like where do you see Panthers? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4707.0s)]
*  And I went on this whole thing of like you know a leopard or a Jaguar just like you can have albinos. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4711.0s)]
*  You have a melanistic one. Yeah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4716.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4718.0s)]
*  So like people would call that a panther but a panther is not a real. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4719.0s)]
*  There's no animal that's a panther. It's like a Kleenex. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4722.0s)]
*  It's like it's a it's just another name for it. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4724.0s)]
*  That is so beautiful. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4727.0s)]
*  But a black Jag. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4728.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. Yeah. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4729.0s)]
*  Oh my God that's beautiful. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4730.0s)]
*  Yeah in South India they have the black leopards. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4732.0s)]
*  What an amazing looking animal. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4734.0s)]
*  Look at the muscles. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4736.0s)]
*  Yeah it's an amazing killing machine. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4737.0s)]
*  And so humans don't get taken out by them. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4740.0s)]
*  I can only really speak for our region of the Amazon but there's I haven't even heard a story about it. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4745.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4750.0s)]
*  No one like no one. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4751.0s)]
*  Our Jags are just we have like record numbers of Jags like I think they're listed as near threatened and we have like some of the strongest remaining Jaguar populations in the world. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4752.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4762.0s)]
*  And you barely see them. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4763.0s)]
*  We barely see them. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4764.0s)]
*  The last one I saw was two years ago and some people like go their whole lives without seeing them. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4765.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4770.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4771.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4772.0s)]
*  Well because people walk off into the jungle and they don't realize people people. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4773.0s)]
*  It's so funny living in the wild and seeing people show up there and it's like people come and they're like they smell like shampoo and cologne and bug spray and deodorant and they're just like if to an animal that has such better senses than we do they might as well just have like sirens on them. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4776.0s)]
*  And like you are this shiny glittering foghorn of attention in the jungle and like every animal is going to run away from you. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4793.0s)]
*  And so people are like how come you go out and you see so much stuff and it's like I only shower in the river. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4801.0s)]
*  I live out in the jungle. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4806.0s)]
*  I smell like they do. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4807.0s)]
*  Like I'm out there for weeks and it's like I'm not going and like shampooing my hair. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4808.0s)]
*  It's like and so like to these animals like they know when you're coming like a Jags just going to be like oh there's a human there. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4812.0s)]
*  Do you wash with soap when you wash in the river? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4818.0s)]
*  I do. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4820.0s)]
*  I do. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4821.0s)]
*  I do use a biodegradable soap. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4822.0s)]
*  You have to keep your skin clean or else you just get infections. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4823.0s)]
*  But like for the most part like my clothing everything like I don't use anything that's scented because of that because I want to be out there and and just blend in. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4826.0s)]
*  And that's whether I'm out in the field with elephants or whether you're out in Africa or India or whether you're in the Amazon. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4836.0s)]
*  I want to be sort of like included. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4842.0s)]
*  I want to blend in. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4845.0s)]
*  And so like not that long ago I was checking a camera trap. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4846.0s)]
*  And I heard I thought it was a we had students at our research station at the time and I heard like the leaves going and it was like September. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4848.0s)]
*  So the jungle was dry and I turned around and I was going to scare this person because I was like who walks that loud in the jungle like have you never you have no respect. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4856.0s)]
*  And I turned around my finger up and this Jag walked right by me on the trail and just kept walking and I was like. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4864.0s)]
*  Finger up and I was like okay. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4871.0s)]
*  Oh Lord. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4874.0s)]
*  But I took that as good because at least I was my my like scent trail was was so that he didn't know I was there. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4875.0s)]
*  I could see it on his face. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4882.0s)]
*  He didn't care. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4883.0s)]
*  He was like. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4884.0s)]
*  But I mean he was six feet away. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4885.0s)]
*  He didn't even break his stride. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4887.0s)]
*  He just walked by me. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4888.0s)]
*  I was like yo what's up. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4889.0s)]
*  They don't think of you as food so they just keep moving. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4891.0s)]
*  No and I think they're you know with big cats they're the mothers teach the young how to hunt and I think they're so oriented like with tigers they're so oriented on horizontal. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4893.0s)]
*  You know get the neck from underneath break the neck from up top and it's like when they see a vertical animal walking by I think they're like first of all I don't know what this is. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4902.0s)]
*  Second of all it smells weird third of all where do I even you know you got to be desperate to take that risk. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4910.0s)]
*  I don't think that I don't think that they lions are a different story but but with Jags with tigers with leopards. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4915.0s)]
*  I don't I've never ever felt any fear being around Jaguar like any fear I don't even take pictures of them I just enjoy it. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4924.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4931.0s)]
*  I let other people take pictures if I'm with people let them take pictures but I will not lift my camera for a Jack I'll just stand there and just. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4932.0s)]
*  Just take it in. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4938.0s)]
*  Yeah you get to see him so rarely I don't want to sit there finally seeing one and then put another screen in front of my face. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4939.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4945.0s)]
*  Look through it through some glass like. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4946.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4948.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4949.0s)]
*  Yeah that's our camera. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4950.0s)]
*  They started them. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4951.0s)]
*  That's from yours. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4953.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4954.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4955.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4956.0s)]
*  That is so majestic. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4957.0s)]
*  What an amazing animal. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4958.0s)]
*  Was glowing eyes. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4959.0s)]
*  Well that's the crazy thing you shine your headlamp into the into the night and then when things look back at you you got to wonder what it is. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4962.0s)]
*  Well when there's two eyes in the front you know it's true. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4972.0s)]
*  There's a front. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4974.0s)]
*  Yeah but some sometimes the deer but then the Jags do this thing where they move their head like this. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4975.0s)]
*  They're like they try and see around your headlamp. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4979.0s)]
*  They'll like do this little side to side thing like the deer. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4981.0s)]
*  They'll just blink at you. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4984.0s)]
*  They'll just blink. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4985.0s)]
*  And so you start learning the eye shines. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4986.0s)]
*  You start learning the you know because then you can be out there at night. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4987.0s)]
*  You look at something and people like oh shit dude it's a Jag. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4990.0s)]
*  And it's like not to do. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4992.0s)]
*  When you were saying that the uncontacted tribe were speaking in monkey calls. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4993.0s)]
*  How do they what are they doing. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=4998.0s)]
*  So JJ's dad used to tell us he said if you're ever out in the forest and something doesn't sound right. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5000.0s)]
*  He was like get out of there. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5010.0s)]
*  And he was like because they will use the tinamou calls like the undulated tinamou is like what are you going to do. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5011.0s)]
*  But like we know what that sounds like but we also know what it doesn't sound like. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5018.0s)]
*  And so like every now and then you'll hear one that's you know different. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5022.0s)]
*  And like we all get freaked out because we're like those. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5026.0s)]
*  That's how we do it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5029.0s)]
*  That's how JJ taught me to do it. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5030.0s)]
*  Like if there was a bunch of tourists right there and JJ wanted me to come over and like chill with him and we wanted to go hang. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5031.0s)]
*  He would just do that and get my attention. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5036.0s)]
*  And like I know that it's not a tinamou. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5038.0s)]
*  I know it's JJ. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5039.0s)]
*  And so it's like they've taken that to a whole nother level where they can communicate. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5040.0s)]
*  And so there was a group of guys who was upriver and they got surrounded. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5044.0s)]
*  They heard monkey calls coming from different directions and they realized that they were completely surrounded. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5049.0s)]
*  Like at least one of the guys who was saying was telling it to me he got in the water and like crawled like a turtle and like escaped. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5054.0s)]
*  And then the tribe showed up and then there's this whole showdown where they they actually shot one of the community members. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5062.0s)]
*  And then one of the guys who knows some of their language was saying that they it looked like they were mad with the guy that shot the guy. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5069.0s)]
*  They were mad with him. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5075.0s)]
*  They were like why did you do that? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5076.0s)]
*  Now there's going to be retaliation. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5078.0s)]
*  Like why did you shoot him? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5079.0s)]
*  And like there was like a whole discussion happening while these people were like huddled in the stream waiting to see if they got killed too. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5081.0s)]
*  So it's like I don't really you know when you get these loggers going in there it's like yeah we'll pay you to protect the rainforest. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5089.0s)]
*  And like you don't have to do this. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5095.0s)]
*  You don't have to be going into these these areas that are that dangerous. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5096.0s)]
*  So yeah so at this point now though part you know through all of this though we've established jungle keepers. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5101.0s)]
*  We have 50,000 acres we're trying to do 300,000 acres and if we can do that we'll basically be helping to establish one of the largest protected areas in the Amazon rainforest which will encompass these uncontacted people. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5109.0s)]
*  And they can stay uncontacted and they can stay safe and do whatever they want to do in the jungle guarding the secret pyramids and the giant ground sloths or whatever the hell it is that they do. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5121.0s)]
*  But we're close. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5134.0s)]
*  Now how many uncontacted tribes are they aware of? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5135.0s)]
*  I think there's like over a hundred different groups across the Amazon. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5139.0s)]
*  There's also varying degrees of and the other thing is the conversation so often gets turned to like they're you know violent and that they're people to live out in the jungle. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5144.0s)]
*  And I have no idea how they do it either because you know at night we need headlamps. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5154.0s)]
*  We don't have night vision. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5158.0s)]
*  All the animals have night vision. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5160.0s)]
*  So it's like what do they do that night? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5161.0s)]
*  They're able to make fire in the jungle at night every day. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5163.0s)]
*  If I gave you an entire book of matches, me and you, we sat down right now in the jungle. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5166.0s)]
*  I was like okay cool you got a machete and a book of matches. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5172.0s)]
*  First one to make fire wins. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5174.0s)]
*  We couldn't do it. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5176.0s)]
*  It's wet. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5178.0s)]
*  Everything is wet. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5179.0s)]
*  So how are they? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5180.0s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5181.0s)]
*  Are they doing bow drill? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5182.0s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5183.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5184.0s)]
*  We don't really know. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5185.0s)]
*  No. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5186.0s)]
*  We don't know how they do that. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5187.0s)]
*  We don't know how they stay infection free. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5188.0s)]
*  We don't know what they do with their old people. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5190.0s)]
*  We never see old people. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5191.0s)]
*  We never really see children. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5193.0s)]
*  And so like they move around and they we see like groups of men on beaches. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5194.0s)]
*  We see like that picture, that aerial picture where you see like a family group out. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5199.0s)]
*  That's in turtle season where you have turtles laying their eggs on the beaches and the tribes will come out because that's easy food. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5204.0s)]
*  You just pick up turtle eggs and eat them. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5210.0s)]
*  But there's so much that we don't know about their lifestyle. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5212.0s)]
*  And like people get so many things wrong. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5216.0s)]
*  Just you know if you leave them alone then they won't kill you. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5217.0s)]
*  If you know then people go they're Stone Age tribes. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5220.0s)]
*  And it's like well they're not Stone Age tribes because they're they're alive right now. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5222.0s)]
*  And you couldn't live out in the jungle but they can. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5225.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5228.0s)]
*  So it's like there's elements of their you know their botanical knowledge, their medicinal knowledge, their creation myths, their view of history. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5229.0s)]
*  I mean they're they're coming to reality from a whole different perspective than we are. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5236.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5240.0s)]
*  And there's really no way to get does anyone speak their language? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5241.0s)]
*  Do we know what language they all speak? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5245.0s)]
*  Is it universal? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5247.0s)]
*  Do they have different languages? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5248.0s)]
*  It's not universal. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5249.0s)]
*  And there was someone in our region who like captured a child from the uncontacted. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5250.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5256.0s)]
*  Raised him in a very remote community. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5257.0s)]
*  And people have tried anthropologists have tried. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5259.0s)]
*  They've been like hey so what was it like when you grew up? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5262.0s)]
*  And it's it's like it's dark. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5264.0s)]
*  He's just like I don't remember. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5267.0s)]
*  Like no one's been able to get any information out of him. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5268.0s)]
*  How old was he when they captured him? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5271.0s)]
*  I think like six. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5272.0s)]
*  Like under ten for sure. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5273.0s)]
*  Does he not remember? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5275.0s)]
*  Does he just not want to talk about it? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5276.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5278.0s)]
*  That's that's that's the these there's this is all there's all these underlying stories. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5279.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5285.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5287.0s)]
*  There's just there's just then last year at some loggers went to a place they shouldn't have gone and they got they got whacked and sort of like the you know the WhatsApp underground in Peru like everyone was sending each other pictures because one of the cops like sent to his family a picture of what the bodies looked like on like day six laying on the beach with arrows in them and shit. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5288.0s)]
*  And it was like oh my god. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5305.0s)]
*  It was like this. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5307.0s)]
*  It's just it makes you stay in bed at night. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5308.0s)]
*  You're just like I'm not going out. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5310.0s)]
*  But I mean yeah it's just it's a complicated topic because there's people that want to contact them. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5313.0s)]
*  There's people that want to leave them alone. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5319.0s)]
*  And then of course there's missionaries that are like they need the Bible. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5320.0s)]
*  What did you think about Lost City of Z? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5324.0s)]
*  I loved the book. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5328.0s)]
*  I wanted more from the movie. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5330.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5333.0s)]

*  Hollywood fuckery. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5336.0s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5337.0s)]
*  The book was fantastic. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5338.0s)]
*  And that guy was out of his mind. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5340.0s)]
*  Out of his mind. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5341.0s)]
*  Out of his mind. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5343.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5345.0s)]
*  Percy Fawcett. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5346.0s)]
*  But like the fact that he could go on those expeditions and not get infected. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5347.0s)]
*  I've been I've been I've been brutally like let me show you this picture. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5350.0s)]

*  Oh my god. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5359.0s)]
*  Like the jungle just gets into your skin. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5361.0s)]

*  You go like this and shit and so on. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5372.0s)]
*  I mean I almost died from that. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5374.0s)]
*  Like that was but I was staying in the jungle to like take care of an anteater. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5375.0s)]
*  But it's like. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5378.0s)]
*  How did you get free of that? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5379.0s)]
*  Like if you're in the jungle did you use antibiotics? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5381.0s)]
*  You go home. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5383.0s)]
*  You just go home. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5384.0s)]
*  I had to go home at that point. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5385.0s)]
*  I got to I remember I got to JFK and the guy you know he like looked down at my passport. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5386.0s)]
*  He goes yeah what were you doing in Peru? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5390.0s)]
*  And then he looked over at me and he goes buddy what the fuck? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5391.0s)]
*  And I was like I'm just trying to get back. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5393.0s)]
*  He like stamped it. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5395.0s)]
*  He was like go go go go go. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5396.0s)]
*  He's like go go to the doctor. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5397.0s)]
*  I can't I can't believe they let me through. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5398.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5400.0s)]
*  You could have been infected with some crazy plague. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5401.0s)]
*  Could have had like monkey Ebola. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5404.0s)]
*  It looked bad. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5405.0s)]
*  And I spent days in the hospital. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5406.0s)]
*  Like it was it was really really bad. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5408.0s)]
*  But for Percy Fawcett to not. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5410.0s)]
*  They would say like other people would be dying. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5412.0s)]
*  There was somebody I think the guy's name was Murray. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5415.0s)]
*  He came from the Shackleton XP. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5417.0s)]
*  He'd already been out with Shackleton. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5418.0s)]
*  So he was like I'm a real explorer. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5420.0s)]
*  And he lasted. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5421.0s)]
*  He didn't last any time with with with Fawcett. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5422.0s)]
*  Because Percy Fawcett was just like you can't keep up. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5424.0s)]
*  Go die. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5427.0s)]
*  You can go die with them with the mules. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5428.0s)]
*  Like he just wouldn't stop. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5430.0s)]
*  So my question is it's like did he go out and eventually get killed or did he eventually go out and like find the tribe that made him their king and just. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5432.0s)]
*  There's no knowledge. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5438.0s)]
*  There's no knowledge of it. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5440.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5441.0s)]
*  No one really knows what happened. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5442.0s)]
*  And they said in that book that over a hundred people have died looking for him since he left. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5443.0s)]
*  And the other expeditions that have gone out all of those have died too. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5449.0s)]
*  It's like yeah. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5452.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5453.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5454.0s)]
*  Look in his eyes. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5455.0s)]
*  Hard man. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5456.0s)]
*  That's a hard man. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5457.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5458.0s)]
*  That looks like a guy who could survive the Amazon. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5459.0s)]
*  He tells you to keep up. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5461.0s)]
*  Look at the fucking feral eyes on that motherfucker. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5466.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5468.0s)]
*  The story is so fascinating because now we know through the use of LIDAR that there really were complex cities in the Amazon. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5469.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5477.0s)]
*  Which is just incredible that the jungle just swallowed up all these very complex structures. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5485.0s)]
*  It's funny because somebody sent me a video of Graham Watkins Graham Hancock Graham Hancock saying how he was like yeah and he goes to the jungle is basically a human made garden. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5486.0s)]
*  And then of course I went and talked to like every scientist I knew because I was like come on. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5496.0s)]
*  And they're like look you know in the areas around the rivers there were complex. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5500.0s)]
*  There was no debating it. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5505.0s)]
*  There were complex civilizations sometimes larger than we think. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5506.0s)]
*  But in those areas you see a higher prevalence of like like he's like he said like they'll plant Brazil nut trees or plant you know whatever. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5510.0s)]
*  I don't think bananas were there at that point. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5517.0s)]
*  But where there was some gardening happening. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5519.0s)]
*  But what worried me then was like Smithsonian came out and put out like an article and they're like is the Amazon created by humans. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5521.0s)]
*  And it was like oh god no no no no no no no. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5527.0s)]
*  Then you're changing it from a designation of like this incredible complex wild ancient ecosystem to if people don't understand the context of what he's saying that that that people engineered it in places. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5529.0s)]
*  And then the headlines went to the Amazon was made by people and then you have people like Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro who's no longer in office but just being like well if we made it we can manage it right. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5541.0s)]
*  Let's go take it out. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5553.0s)]
*  And it was like I was like oh god. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5554.0s)]
*  I was watching him on your show and I was like oh be careful be careful. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5556.0s)]
*  It's like the work he does is great. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5559.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying but the implications of that narrative. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5561.0s)]
*  Yeah. And again 100 percent there are there are dude I mean there's there's you find pottery in places but it's always near the rivers. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5565.0s)]
*  Like there's evidence of ancient civilizations you want to hear the craziest thing. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5573.0s)]
*  One of my guys found a stone axe head. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5576.0s)]
*  Now here's the thing the uncontacted don't have rocks. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5580.0s)]
*  You won't find a rock on our river. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5583.0s)]
*  There's clay. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5584.0s)]
*  There are no rocks. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5585.0s)]
*  They found a stone axe head in the jungle at a site from the uncontacted. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5586.0s)]
*  But what that means is that the uncontacted tribe had a stone axe head that was that they've been holding on to since like Inca times. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5592.0s)]
*  And someone forgot at the camp. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5601.0s)]
*  And so you're talking about civilization carrying around something from a previous civilization that they don't know where they got it from. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5603.0s)]
*  It's like incredible. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5610.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5612.0s)]
*  Because you cannot find it. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5613.0s)]
*  There are there are no rocks like that on our river. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5614.0s)]
*  It was like a smooth gray stone shaped into like a blunt axe head with you know made you know you get to attach it to a stick. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5616.0s)]
*  And they found this on the beach and they'd been using it to like clean turtles. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5623.0s)]
*  But we don't have those rocks. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5628.0s)]
*  That's more like an Inca type of thing. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5629.0s)]
*  So this has been floating around through various people's hands in the jungle for decades centuries who knows. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5631.0s)]
*  And what do they think about where that came from. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5638.0s)]
*  It's lost technology that they don't understand anymore. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5641.0s)]
*  So the thing about the lost city is Z was that there was a previous expedition that had encountered these cities and these incredible. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5647.0s)]
*  Yes beautiful complex cities. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5657.0s)]
*  And they described how elaborate their clothing was and their culture their agriculture. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5660.0s)]
*  And so then when the next expedition went back there was no one there because they had killed everybody with diseases. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5666.0s)]
*  This is the yeah that's the theory right. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5672.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5675.0s)]
*  And I mean Oriana was the first person to like go descend the Amazon which the thing that always drove me crazy about that was that they came down the Andes made their way down the entire Amazon and then like looked at the stars figured out where Spain was built a whole other ship and sailed home. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5676.0s)]
*  Like. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5689.0s)]
*  Think about that for a second. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5690.0s)]
*  They built a whole. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5692.0s)]
*  You built a whole pirate ship and sailed to Spain based off the stars. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5693.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5698.0s)]
*  And like now like you look at us now and it's like are we smarter than that now. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5699.0s)]
*  Like how many people can find your way anywhere without. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5703.0s)]
*  What is your phone really. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5706.0s)]
*  You know what smart is is your ability to use information correctly. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5708.0s)]
*  Now what information do you have. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5713.0s)]
*  Like they had information that we don't have because they needed to be able to navigate using the stars and they didn't have to deal with the kind of night pollution that we have the light pollution we have at night is it's one of the greatest tragedies about modern civilization is that we've blacked out one of the most spectacular things you could ever see the thing that really centers us and humbles us which is the view of the stars. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5716.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5727.0s)]
*  I went to the Kik Observatory a few years ago and I was like oh my gosh I'm going to be a star. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5728.0s)]
*  And you go way way way up through the clouds and the view of the cosmos is like you are in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear view of the cosmos and you're in a spaceship with a clear [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5733.0s)]
*  glass windshield and you see everything. There's no light pollution on the island because they have diffused lighting for all their street lights specifically designed so that it doesn't fuck with the telescopes. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5763.0s)]
*  And so when you're up there, I'll never forget it. The one time that I went which was at least 15 years ago, maybe 16 years ago, that one time was so spectacular that it changed my view of like Earth in the relationship to the cosmos just by seeing it. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5773.32s)]
*  Because you see the Milky Way, you see everything, you see all the stars. It just took my breath away. I couldn't stop staring at it. I was like, this is insane. And then I was thinking, God, this is everywhere. This is what the ancients used to see before we figured out electricity and blunted it all. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5792.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5811.48s)]
*  And ruined our relationship with the cosmos visually because that's what every city does. When you look up at the night sky, you don't see jack shit in New York City. You see a star. Oh, there's the moon. That's it. What is up there is literally the most spectacular thing that humans could ever witness. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5811.8s)]
*  And it's there every night if you don't have light pollution and cloud cover. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5829.16s)]
*  So like you saying like it would be like almost like more stars than black. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5836.360000000001s)]
*  You see every fully man you see. It's incredible. So they're very careful at the observatory. There's no lights that get in the way of anything. So when you get outside of the building and there's just people lined up on the roads on the hills, they're just staring up at the sky. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5839.64s)]
*  Because it's perfect. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5855.76s)]
*  It's insane. It's insane. It's so many stars. It's everything. That's what it looks like. That's literally that's literally exactly what it looks like. That is with your naked eye with your naked eye, man. It's amazing. But it's this understanding that that's up there all the time. And you can't see it because of light pollution. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5856.56s)]
*  But see that to me is so much of what we're doing with nature right now where it's like we're dulling it down. Yeah, we live in this incredible reality. And it's like we're dulling it down. Like, like, in the Eastern Cape where I've been working with the guys from vet, Paul, like the elephants have smaller tusks or no tusks because of poaching. And it's like you're taking this incredible monstrous giant natural selection thing like that the ones that have smaller tusks are allowed to survive. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5878.719999999999s)]
*  Because they're targeted. Yeah, targeted for the big tussle. The big tusk ones are getting killed. So somehow in response to that, they're developing smaller tusks are less attractive to the point that they're even having no tusks. It's like it like genetically bottlenecked them so quickly because over the last hundred years, the humans were all going for the big tuskers. And now these monster tuskers like the really big ones where they touch the ground. There's only a few of them left. That is so wild. And so we and then moose like in Maine, they have [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5906.96s)]
*  smaller antlers and like, we're actually like, we're dulling down the magnificence of the universe. Like when you look at those pictures, you're like, why don't I see that picture if we saw that every night, right? How different we'd be how much more connected. Oh, yeah, it's it's so humbling. I feel like that's there's a thing about mountain communities, ocean communities, where you're you're confronted with nature that's on such a scale of beauty and magnificence that you're you're [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5936.96s)]
*  overwhelmed by it. And you're automatically humbled just by your environment and your surroundings. There's the same thing about oceans. You look down to the it's so humbling because it's so immense and there's so much power and energy and life. It's just like, wow, it just puts you in your place. And the sky is supposed to do that, too. There's a relationship that we have to the cosmos when you look up that is like, okay, yeah, this is this is the real mystery of life and of existence so that we we fly through infinity on an organic spaceship. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5966.96s)]
*  Every day. And that's what's really going on. It's not it's not stationary. It's literally spiraling through the universe. And and that exact sort of wonder is what I feel when I wake up in the jungle and you you dip your hands in and you drink the river. And then in the afternoon that you literally watch your sweat come off your forehead. You hold your hand in the sunlight and watch it go into the air and join the mist from the jungle. And then at four p.m. you get that thunderstorm and it comes back and that cycle is moving through you. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=5996.96s)]
*  And it's like you are so connected to nature there. You are so it's so apparent that like you you you can't not be in absolute awe. And like you see this. And again, we're out there. We see the stars at night like that where it's like you can see the Milky Way. It's a belt across the sky. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6026.96s)]
*  And there are these animals and these consciousnesses moving and it's all working together in this giant orchestra of the most complex life that's ever existed. And it's like you start to you know when you come home and then when you go back to a city you go what what what you guys are really missing out. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6042.96s)]
*  You know like you you feel so connected and locked in and you sort of like you said it puts you in your place. It reminds you that we're how how insane this reality is. Yeah. And that we're on this planet that we are so incredibly connected to. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6059.96s)]
*  And then you start to understand what happens when people get removed from that and how far off perception can go. Because when you're not what the jungle does is it brings you back to those chemical physical truths like removes the cataracts of society from your eyes. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6074.96s)]
*  So that you're confronted with whether or not the river is rising whether or not you know the sun is going to be when we're on an expedition it's like it rains for six hours and we freeze. You can get hypothermia. Then the sun comes out but the boat keeps moving. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6088.96s)]
*  And it's like well now your skin is peeling off and it doesn't matter what you believe in or who you are. It's like we all have to deal with the same reality. You got to survive. And that's where I feel good. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6100.96s)]
*  That's the rules of the game are the same. There's no debating it. It's like we all have to deal with the facts that nature is putting forward for us. And it's like the world makes a lot of sense when you're out in the wilderness the real world. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6111.96s)]
*  That's what people say that live like a subsistence lifestyle. They say there there's something about it that's that deeply resonates with being a human being. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6123.96s)]
*  You know there's a famous vice series that we have referenced on this show a bunch of times. It's called the vice guy to travel and they went to visit this guy. I want to say his name right. I think it's Heinemann court and he lives like way way way up in Alaska. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6133.96s)]
*  And he has some sort of they give him some sort of permission a long time ago to hold this cabin in this particular area but he's literally like the last one to be able to do that. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6152.96s)]
*  Yes and he lives up there just hunting caribou and fishing and that's all he does. And yes it was up with his wife in this tiny cabin that you know there's no windows. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6166.96s)]
*  And he has a generator and he's up there just eating caribou and hunting and living off of it. But he's a very intelligent guy. And when he talks about it's a really fascinating series because this guy is back when vice used to do like really cool. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6179.96s)]
*  Back when vice was edgy. Yeah well they were real. You know they were really doing cool stuff and this guy fucking flew out there on a little bush plane and hung out with this guy for like a week when their camp got attacked by grizzly. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6194.96s)]
*  He had to shoot this grizzly because the grizzly was coming in to raid the camp and like so it's the middle of the night he's chasing this guy with a camera and the guy's like firing a shotgun at a grizzly. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6208.96s)]
*  But I mean you have to be a type of genius to live out in that. Like you have to be such a problem solver. Yes. You know you're you're you're you have to be able to build your house you have to be able to do irrigation you have to be able to I mean just in the jungle it's like the problems you have to. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6217.96s)]
*  I mean I'm still such a novice it's like these guys like they're like can you drive a boat like yeah and they're like no no can you drive a boat which means can you disassemble the motor and put it back together because eventually that's what you're going to have to do. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6230.96s)]
*  And so it's like if you go take your bush plane and go live out in Alaska it's like well how long until you have to call someone for help. Right. We rely on other people so much and that's the beauty of being you get you get so humbled being out in nature because you go my god doing anything is impossible. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6240.96s)]
*  Even like making fire. Everyone goes oh I'm going to use a bow drill method and it's like all right cool what are you going to use and they're like oh this piece of paracord and this for a stick and I'm going to carve it and I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6256.96s)]
*  Where'd you get that knife where'd you get that paracord like start. It's tough. Start from nothing. Start from nothing you'll get nowhere. Just try and make rope. It's like mankind's like second invention it's like it's impossible. Just sit out in nature sometime just go sit out in nature and be like I'm going to make rope like functional rope enough that I can carry you know something. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6265.96s)]
*  You know do you find rope from uncontacted tribes that they've left behind. I have a piece. You have a piece. I have a piece. Really. Yeah. I found a piece on it. No. No. What does it look like. It's it's very very fine. So they weave it from balsa wood and so balsa you can pretty much cut the you know with a pick take your machete and just like cut into the tree and it grows really quick. You can peel the bark off of it and pretty much use that as rope. But if you want to take it a step farther you can tie that and then like braid it or tie it up and then you can just cut it off. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6289.96s)]
*  And then you can twist it and it has all these juices in it that that like solidify. You can make legitimate rope. I could make 15 feet of rope in like two hours. Really. Yeah. Oh yeah. Like it's it's legitimate rope too. Like you could haul a boat with it. You could use as bowstring. Oh totally. 100 percent. It's strong. Wow. But that you have to know that it's the balsa tree. Yes. When JJ again when JJ first taught me this the first thing I did was march up to a secropia tree and whack it with my machete and try start trying to get the bark off and the [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6319.96s)]
*  secropia ends like landed on my face and I came back and I was like what happened. And he was like idiot. That's obviously not a balsa tree. You know it took a long time. Took a lot of bites. One of the more interesting stories was when you would run out of water and you found a certain type of bamboo that absorbs water. And so you have to cut the bamboo drink the water out of the bamboo. Yeah. And that that's pretty common. If you see bamboo tilted over on the side it's pretty it's gotten heavy. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6349.96s)]
*  It's come over. Does it have holes in it where it's absorbing the water. Like how is it getting into the. Sucking it up through the ground. And then filling those those canisters. So that's what those canisters that's the purpose of those things. I don't know if that's the purpose. It's definitely saving water is a purpose of them. And so what we do is we can when we're out in the bush it's like you just you cut off one of those canisters and see up like a sweet little bamboo cylinder and then you tie it with balsa and throw it over your back and it's like you're carrying a map. It's like you just have this like a water bottle from the [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6379.96s)]
*  jungle. There are ways of getting things done. Then what you do is what JJ will do will go and will take you take a serrated knife. And when you walk barefoot you get that big callus on the back of your heel. You cut the callus off your heel stick it on a hook. Catch a few piranha cut them up into pieces catch some more piranha and then stuff the piranha into the bamboo. Take some leaves salt stuff the leaves in the bamboo and then throw the bamboo canister filled with piranha onto the fire. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6409.96s)]
*  Really. Oh my God. Oh my God it's delicious. Really. Oh my God. Yes because the bamboo flavors the piranha and then there's you know if you're with the guys they know other herbs that they can put on it but it's like oh God is that delicious. Wow. So much served at a restaurant. Yeah. With it with it started off of someone's foot. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6439.96s)]
*  A piece of your heel and the reason for that the reason for that is that again it's just like the fire. I do this when I bring students to the Amazon I go like OK let's make fire. Nobody can make fire. You go OK now we're going to go fishing. We'll give you hooks and you know and a line. Find bait. A moth is too like loose and they're not around in the daytime and then you're like OK well what do I what do I. There is there's no bait. Everything either is eaten or was eaten or is hiding or is camouflaged. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6458.72s)]
*  You can't find bait you know in the Amazonian soil underneath the tree roots is clay. So you're not going to dig and find worms. And so it's like it's a whole different game like it's this whole different like wilderness survival game down there. Wow. You can't just go fishing you can't just make fire like you have to learn how to do these things there first before that'll work and the slicing a piece of your cows that's common. That's a normal way to do it. It's it's a little bit of a flex like it's a it's a thing that like jungle guys do. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6488.72s)]
*  Like I'll do it like if there's like a bunch of loggers in a really like you know we're all like sitting there like I'll do it just to let them know because they'll be like oh gringo like and I'll be like oh yeah. My callous who can get more off their their their heel. You know and then we'll never everybody pulls out their knives and starts cutting their feet. Oh God that seems like they go horribly wrong. You do it carefully as a way to do it. You shave it off but like JJ gets these big slugs of callous off and then you can and it's strong. And so that's great because then like the little fish can't pick it off. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6518.72s)]
*  You throw it in you get a fish and if you can get a decent size fish then you stick that on a nice big hook and by morning you get yourself like a nice big fat catfish. So you work your way up the ecosystem with your heel eventually starting with your starting with your heel. Yes. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6548.72s)]
*  And is that is there another way to do it. Is there other ways that they do it when they fish. Is there like oh sure. I mean you can go up to again. I'm talking about like surviving. I mean you can go up to the edge of the river with your with your headlamp and curious fish coming. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6565.12s)]
*  Just whack with a machete. There's that. We also just you know I mean usually we had now now whether we're on a scientific expedition or whether we're bringing like tourists into the jungle or whether out with the jungle keepers rangers whatever we're doing we have we have a chef with us. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6578.5199999999995s)]
*  We have a cook with us. We can't always be cooking for ourselves now and doing our work. Right. So like you just steal some chicken skin throw that on the hook. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6592.719999999999s)]
*  But you're basically living off of the land when you're out there. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6601.12s)]
*  No to be honest we living off the land is something that we do when we go out on these like ceremonial hunts or when we go out on expeditions to like really uncharted places we like we practice that we and and and the elders in the community like we lost like that. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6605.12s)]
*  Like that the guy who used to do the ayahuasca ceremonies and JJ's community like we lost him during covid. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6620.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's like he knew things he knew methods that the younger generation doesn't know. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6627.5199999999995s)]
*  Like they have they have tick tock just like everybody else. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6632.5199999999995s)]
*  Like tick tock. Yeah. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6635.5199999999995s)]
*  Dude I told you gold miners follow me on Instagram like it's like and that's a security risk for me. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6637.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6641.5199999999995s)]
*  But like JJ's father once apparently killed an electric eel removed the nerve. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6642.92s)]
*  Again I don't know anatomically if this makes any sense but this is how the lore goes that he killed the electric eel removed the nerve that generates the electricity then cut his own arm open put the nerve in it and slapped a dead frog on top of it and then bandage that up. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6648.92s)]
*  And he said that that would give him strength until the end of his days. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6666.32s)]
*  He lived 87 years old alive in the jungle and healthy and he died one day at a barbecue just like he just like leaned over on his grandson smiled and died. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6670.32s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6678.32s)]
*  He was like healthy until he died. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6680.32s)]
*  He just turned off. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6682.32s)]
*  Huh. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6684.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6686.32s)]
*  So like they do stuff they have. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6688.32s)]
*  I had a I was doing some stuff with tigers in India and I picked up a disease called tularemia and I had this horrible patch of pus on my elbow and I went to every doctor I came home from India went to doctors in New York and for two months I was like in bed and I had no energy and I they put me on this antibiotics and that and this and that and these again like New York City infectious disease doctors couldn't heal this thing. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6689.719999999999s)]
*  I went to the Amazon JJ takes my arm looks at it goes oh so bad look at this he goes come with me we go into the jungle he cuts a tree takes the sap says drink some of this not too much he was like one drop of this down your throat. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6713.12s)]
*  I felt like it was going to close my throat and then he took the rest of the sap and he rubs it onto the wound and this is like a disgusting pussy thing that had been plaguing me for months. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6725.12s)]
*  It was better the next day. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6735.12s)]
*  Really. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6737.12s)]
*  It's better the next day. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6738.12s)]
*  He knew which tree to go to. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6739.12s)]
*  Now think about how many thousands of years are needed or at least centuries are needed in order for him to have that knowledge how many people living out in the jungle had to try how many things to have that medicinal knowledge handed down through the generations and then to be in the presence of a person that has that type of knowledge and to have access to it to witness it working. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6741.5199999999995s)]
*  And what specifically does that sap work on does it work on all kinds of infections and diseases or just the kind that you have. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6761.5199999999995s)]
*  No so we actually brought we tested it in a Petri dish and basically there's some of these saps that just murder infections like you can't get this bacteria to live with these saps. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6768.92s)]
*  So like people use like Neos like we don't use Neosporin in the jungle like it doesn't work. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6780.92s)]
*  What we do is we go to the Sangre de Drago tree like that works as soon as I see like a little something like a mosquito bite that just doesn't look right and it's like to get too much of my attention just go and put that on it immediately gone. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6785.92s)]
*  One time I like I slashed myself with a machete I had this huge wound I like you know I was thinking oh god this is going to get so infected and then JJ's nah just drown it and that stuff you'll be fine. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6797.32s)]
*  You won't get infections. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6806.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6808.32s)]
*  There's like miracle shit down there. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6809.32s)]
*  And is this widely known is this something that the scientific community is aware of? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6811.32s)]
*  I mean it's. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6816.32s)]
*  Yes and no. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6818.32s)]
*  I think what was it? [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6819.719999999999s)]
*  Captopril they made from from Bushmaster Venom in the 1990s and I think that I think it was Pfizer I don't know who it was. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6820.719999999999s)]
*  One of those companies made like you know a few billion dollars off of it but what happens is people will discover a compound in the Amazon and then export it. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6827.719999999999s)]
*  You know it'll be like you know thousands of years of wisdom from the ancient cultures handed down and then someone will give that knowledge out to a to a to a corporation and they'll take it profit off of it and then that's it. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6834.719999999999s)]
*  But it's like we at this point one of the things we're trying to do is work with the indigenous communities to try and help them to preserve that knowledge because we're also seeing now that as the roads come in and you have the problems with the fires and it's changing. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6845.12s)]
*  You know at the edge at the edge where the jungle is is is being destroyed. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6860.12s)]
*  They the younger people have to decide do they want to live the way their parents lived. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6865.12s)]
*  Fishing hunting howler monkeys eating howler monkeys or do they want to go out into the world and do something else and it's like let me start with like what else you know it's like it's a very very complex being at the edge of living in like a tribal subsistence community and then being confronted with like the modern world and they have like a cell phone and there's definitely a feeling you can definitely see a feeling of like being like left out like they feel like oh we're just sitting here in a river. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6869.5199999999995s)]
*  Whereas like I feel like people from our world would go like God they have it perfect they have all the fish they could ever want you know. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6897.92s)]
*  Have you ever taken someone from there and taken them on a trip to New York City. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6906.92s)]
*  I mean I guess they don't have passports. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6909.92s)]
*  Well some of my guys some of the guys on my team like that run jungle keepers are like super native but also kind of worldly like one of my guys this guy Roy he's a conservation chef and he's like almost famous he's been to Italy he's been to Virginia he like but he runs jungle keepers. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6911.92s)]
*  JJ I mean speaks perfect English and like does interviews with me on like ABC News and like so like these guys have Roy came to New York City. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6926.32s)]
*  Dude the craziest one is this guy there's a story about an anthropologist I think something I think it was Kenneth Goode I can't remember what his name was but he he went to the Yanomami married one of them brought them to the US she couldn't handle it because she was like I want to go back to the jungle but they had had kids together and I heard this legend. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6934.32s)]
*  Like when I was a kid and then that she had gone back to the jungle but that this anthropologist had had like Yanomami children that he raised on his own in the US and then last year I was at a dinner party and I met David Goode who is that guy he's the kid and so now he's going back to his people in the Yanomami villages. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6952.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah he went to go back to go find his mother and the first time he saw her she was naked. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6970.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6975.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah I was sitting at like a dinner party and he was like yeah this was a this was. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6977.719999999999s)]
*  His mother had abandoned him to go back to the jungle he's raised by his father. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6981.12s)]
*  The anthropologist. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6985.12s)]
*  And then how old was he when he went back to see his mother. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6986.12s)]
*  I think he was in his 20s. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6988.12s)]
*  And he has to go on an expedition up a river. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6990.12s)]
*  How old was he. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6992.12s)]
*  I think when he was a little kid I don't think she lasted long I don't think she liked our way of life she wanted to go back. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=6994.12s)]
*  Yeah and so now he's he's doing his PhDs he's awesome like he could sit here with us and like he's doing his PhD on the Yanomami Micromar. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7001.12s)]
*  I think that's his mother and he's studying their gut fauna. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7009.5199999999995s)]
*  Because their rates of cancer their rates of disease their rates of depression of course are like nothing compared to ours and so he's launching this massive study right now to do to find out why are they so healthy and why are we so fucked up. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7014.5199999999995s)]
*  I thought it'd be easier to find out why we're so fucked up. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7028.5199999999995s)]
*  But yeah he's got a crazy crazy story. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7033.5199999999995s)]
*  The the way they have an understanding of their environment and the plants and what to eat and what not to eat is just I would imagine talking if you could speak their language and like be immersed with them for a long time and get an understanding of what they know it must be amazing. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7035.92s)]
*  Well the great thing is that he he can that's that's what makes him so interesting is that he's he's doing it and he's working on it. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7052.92s)]
*  But think about how much we're losing in terms of like what you said the connection to the stars and then the the the realization on a daily basis that we're part of like this like this massive march of life and that we're connected to these systems and the rivers and the rain and like it sounds like so cliched almost say it but it's like when you're down there and you remember these like original truths. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7059.32s)]
*  And then you go like like there's such a dissonance between like when you wake up there are certain things you have to do like when I wake up in the jungle you have to go check the boat because the river might have eaten it and I like you you have to go work on your water system you have to go on the trails and clear them like it's like there's things that nature demands farmers know this you have to go check the boat. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7073.719999999999s)]
*  I feel like what's happening so many people it's just like we you know you wake up and you're like oh no what do I do what do I do now. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7083.12s)]
*  You know it's like you get so disconnected from the systems that we're a part of it's like it's it's it's angry you know it's like you're like oh my god I'm like what's going on here. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7089.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like it's like you get so disconnected from the systems that we're a part of it's like it's it's amputating us of the thing that connects us to whatever is running this machine like the gears that work the game. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7096.92s)]
*  Like you know you have to go work on your water system you have to go on the trails and clear them like it's like there's things that nature demands farmers know this you have to wake up and milk the cows like. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7107.92s)]
*  It's like you get so disconnected from the systems that we're a part of it's like it's it's amputating us of the thing that connects us to whatever is running this machine like the gears that work the game. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7116.32s)]
*  Like and that's what that these people still remember they're still connected to that reality and then none of these people are going are we living in a simulation they're like no they're like they know what reality is because they're living in it every day. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7127.32s)]
*  So I think that preserving these last wild places while they're still here like I truly believe that we're at the most crucial moment in history not because of nuclear war or anything like that but because never before has there been a global threat. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7139.719999999999s)]
*  Right now we're like we're on the cusp of we're going through this extinction crisis and you can talk about climate change but like our rivers and our ecosystems are being tested to the point where like our oceans are collapsing our rainforests are vanishing we're losing species faster than we can even count. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7155.12s)]
*  And we have all the knowledge and technology and ability to stop it we've seen that humpback whales they went down from like a hundred and twenty they were up at around a hundred and twenty thousand pre whaling and they went down to like five thousand. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7172.5199999999995s)]
*  And then we banned whaling and now they're back up to like a hundred and fifteen thousand humpback whales globally like they're back bald eagles they're back. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7185.5199999999995s)]
*  If you just stop annihilating these animals and murdering their habitats they will continue to make the ecosystems that have been our home on this planet for millions of years like they literally have made our lives possible. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7193.92s)]
*  And so like to me there is nothing more important and I think that when I was a little kid I actually think I had some semblance of an idea that my mission was I'm here to protect rainforest that's what I'm here to do. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7205.92s)]
*  And that's why I had to get there quickly before it was too late and I had the incredible luck of meeting a teacher who could unlock that world for me. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7221.32s)]
*  And now we have the chance the historical chance you talk about those sharks there are trees on the river that were there before the Spanish touched South America. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7231.32s)]
*  So the world wars everything that we know our grandparents all this that tree was a sapling standing there in the Amazon rainforest while pretty much everything that we're familiar with took place in history. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7241.719999999999s)]
*  And we have a chance to protect the incredible complex ecosystem of thousands of species that are living on this tree that can never be replaced. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7252.719999999999s)]
*  You're talking about a millennium tree with leaf cutter ants and reptiles amphibians birds mammals mosses lichens cactus everything living on this skyscraper of life and we can cut it down for nothing and grow some papayas or we can protect it. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7262.12s)]
*  And we have the chance to protect it and no one else is going to have that chance and as a global society it's like we can protect black rhinos before they go extinct. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7277.12s)]
*  This incredible ancient monstrous mega fauna animal that we have the privilege of experiencing. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7285.5199999999995s)]
*  There's no reason for this to happen that people falsely believe that their horns are medicinal when they're not. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7292.5199999999995s)]
*  And so it's like I think we are at the most exciting time with the most exciting opportunity because the natural world you know we could get through this and people will look back on our time and just go over there. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7298.5199999999995s)]
*  What were they thinking? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7308.92s)]
*  You know like the way like when the industrial revolution came around and they put all the kids in the factories and they were getting like crushed in the gears and choked out by smoke and it was like we just made regulations and fixed it. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7310.92s)]
*  It's like we don't need to be killing life on earth. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7318.92s)]
*  We can exist here and we and it is awesome. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7322.92s)]
*  We can fly and we can take photos and we have all this amazing technology we can leave our planet now soon. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7325.92s)]
*  All of this is possible but we have to remember the basic truth that we are inextricably tied to our ecosystems. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7331.32s)]
*  And there's no getting around that and so we have to protect them and so that's the mission that we're on and so incredibly the local people of the Amazon [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7342.32s)]
*  and everybody at Jungle Keepers and so like somehow that mission formed and then you became a part of that march when you retweeted that and helped us find Dax who helped us protect it and now we're like moving towards creating this giant protected area. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7351.719999999999s)]
*  Well this podcast I'm sure will energize that even further. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7370.719999999999s)]
*  So what can anybody do if they're hearing this and they're I mean obviously this resonates with everyone. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7374.12s)]
*  This is a your story is so incredible and just this calling that you have to that and the fact that it really has happened and you've become a part of protecting it. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7380.12s)]
*  What can anybody do that's listening to this? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7390.12s)]
*  Junglekeepers.com we have monthly donors we do trips to the Amazon we have ways to get involved with the local people that are now protecting their rainforest. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7393.12s)]
*  This is totally an indigenous led effort and it's you know I don't know how these other organizations work what I do know is that you know when I went down there and JJ was like we have to protect this. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7400.5199999999995s)]
*  We started Jungle Keepers as a way to just take guys that were loggers and give them a different job. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7414.5199999999995s)]
*  Give them a better life. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7419.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like everyone's winning we're saving the ecosystem we're giving these people better life. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7421.5199999999995s)]
*  When people support Jungle Keepers like we have like monthly donors and people they come and visit us in the field some people don't some people give us money and they're like look I don't ever want to go anywhere near the jungle but I'm glad it exists. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7423.92s)]
*  Now we're trying to take people up into the canopy and even that we're providing people with jobs as chefs and boat drivers and guides. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7435.92s)]
*  And taking a small sustainable amount of people into a really beautiful place instead of ruining it with trails and people and garbage it's like we're just going to do it right and keep it pristine and keep it wild. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7444.32s)]
*  So we're doing everything we can we're studying this place where we're working in every way possible to save the millions and millions and millions of heartbeats that are in every square acre. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7455.32s)]
*  Of this rainforest it's just like it's that feeling I get that feeling every time where it's like you said with the stars where you look out there and you just go this is so incredible that you feel like you've just been like energized by some some other force. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7463.719999999999s)]
*  You feel completely connected to everything and it's it's your do you're tapping into the mains you're connecting to like the thing that vibrates at all. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7477.719999999999s)]
*  It's a strange thing when you're in nature like that I've never been to the Amazon but in nature it's just in general there's a feeling that you get almost like you're on a substance like you're on you're you're connected to a vibe that doesn't exist in the urban world. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7485.12s)]
*  And not in the concrete jungle that we live in it doesn't it doesn't exist. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7502.5199999999995s)]
*  So when you go there it's also like oh this thing this thing that I feel is like you're you're you're tuned into it it's connected to you and we're not connected when we're in cities it's like this weird bluntness and dullness to it all. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7506.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah I think it's just it's throwing a fish back into water. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7522.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that we belong out there and I think that we've we've amputated ourself from that so when we go back out into wild places we're like yes. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7525.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah despite our evolution and the technological innovation we're still biologically that same creature that coexists with nature. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7530.92s)]
*  Which is removed from the experience for the most part. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7542.92s)]
*  Yeah which frustrates me I like I got it I got shell shocked man I've been jumping in a river for showers for the last few months and it's like let's take a shower in a cold tiled room the other day like I was like I took like a normal shower and I was shocked by it. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7545.92s)]
*  I was like where's where are the stars like. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7557.92s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7559.32s)]
*  What a weird how do you feel how long are you going to do this for do you have like a grand plan is this just your life now. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7561.32s)]
*  Well no you can't keep doing this like so like. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7568.32s)]
*  Yeah that's what I was thinking. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7571.32s)]
*  First of all when you start something like this like there's no there's no plan like you just start and actually you know I've heard actually I always I always thought of this thing and then I actually heard a clip of you saying it but it's like you know if you're going to go after something it's like pretend it's a what would the character in the movie be doing. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7573.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7589.32s)]
*  You know like if you're going after something and it's like in terms of being productive in terms of just continuing to chase the thing and it's like when you start something. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7591.32s)]
*  Like trying to stop the global march of of destruction of the wildlife it's like you you are going to fail. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7598.32s)]
*  The fact that we in this tiny little place are notching a win like that is that is incredible but it takes an extreme toll. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7607.32s)]
*  Having so much uncertainty that I'm going to leave here and fly back down there and go running into the Amazon fires and just broadcast that to everybody because that's what gets people excited. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7613.719999999999s)]
*  That's what gets people to understand what we're losing because you have to show them the beauty and then show it being destroyed and be like we can stop this and so like my my plan is I want to in the next year. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7623.719999999999s)]
*  Protect the rest of this river. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7633.719999999999s)]
*  Now how much do you have to worry about your own personal safety now because what you're talking about with the gold miners and this they know who you are and people know who you are now and the more you get this message out the more you're going to become a problem for them. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7635.12s)]
*  The gold miners yes but I stay away from the gold mining because I'll get whacked pretty quick over there. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7651.12s)]
*  The the loggers on the other hand I just make friends man these guys the last year there was a rainy night and we were all hanging out at the resource station and some loggers like showed up and they came in and we were like hey and like we like let them we had we had power we let them charge their phones we gave them some hot coffee and stuff and it was like we made friends with them we had some we had some drinks with them. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7655.5199999999995s)]
*  Now a few of them are working for me and it's like dude we just keep making friends and they protect us. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7677.5199999999995s)]
*  There's an understanding like they're just doing what they have to do. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7682.92s)]
*  They have to do to survive the loggers like the guys on the ground they're not bad guys. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7685.92s)]
*  Again a lot of them are really good friends. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7689.92s)]
*  They're just working. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7692.92s)]
*  They're just they're just working they're coming from other parts of Peru a lot of them have families and that maybe their father was a logger or maybe their friends was a logger and so like they go out and there's not a lot of stuff you can do out in the Amazon either a fisherman or a logger or something but if you're living that half life where you have to make your living off the jungle but then go buy a house in in town. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7694.92s)]
*  It's like that's a hard thing to you know and it's like or you could just sell it all and go get an office job or something. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7712.92s)]
*  It's like there's not a lot of great options for that. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7719.92s)]
*  So like they are in a tough position. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7721.92s)]
*  And so whether it's whether it's in the end that's the other thing that I'm in grand plan trying to look for is like a way of first of all getting conservationist paid because I know people all over the incredible conservationists all over the world who like are doing this work protecting species and no one's paying them to do it. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7723.92s)]
*  They're just out there doing the work and then allowing local people to find a way of like being supported in that transition since you don't have to be you know taking somebody that used to be a rhino poacher and making them a ranger. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7739.32s)]
*  You know how the rhino poaching works. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7756.32s)]
*  Let's let's go catch rhino poachers. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7758.32s)]
*  How fast can we turn people around to that and then make protected areas that are beautiful enough that we can bring people and then have them have jobs and it's like there's a there's a lot of things that we can do. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7760.32s)]
*  There is a solution to this and so finding that solution and exporting it. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7769.32s)]
*  So if we save this river if we're successful in saving this river the true change then will come in in sort of applying that to somewhere else. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7773.32s)]
*  Well then maybe there's a river in the Congo where that's going to happen. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7783.32s)]
*  We're going to lose all the beautiful pristine medicines and wildlife that's there and the herds of elephants. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7785.32s)]
*  Well we can we can figure out how do we do it here. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7790.32s)]
*  Let's do it there. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7793.32s)]
*  We can catch fire and it's like people more and more and more through this storytelling through social media through all this stuff it's like we're getting more and more support because people want to help. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7794.719999999999s)]
*  Nobody I don't think if you asked anybody if you said like what do you think about polar bears. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7803.719999999999s)]
*  I don't think anybody build you know be like I hate polar bears. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7807.719999999999s)]
*  I want them to go extinct. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7810.719999999999s)]
*  I don't think anybody's on you know not too many people are going to say that and say look we can save the ecosystems and all the beautiful things. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7812.719999999999s)]
*  I mean it's not that difficult. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7819.719999999999s)]
*  All we're doing is asking people to not cut down trees and the exciting thing is that now we're actually having success with that. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7821.12s)]
*  And it's because people are helping us get the message out it's because people are like sharing it and taking action. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7828.12s)]
*  That's why I asked you about Slash because he's been he actually reached out to jungle keepers and he was like dude I want to protect the river. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7834.12s)]
*  Oh that's awesome. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7839.12s)]
*  Yeah I got to see him play. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7841.12s)]
*  I was actually on stage. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7843.12s)]
*  It was insane. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7845.12s)]
*  I sat on the stage with my family and watched in Greece in Athens. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7847.12s)]
*  Three hour show insane. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7849.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's hot out there literally Slash was dripping sweat like it was like you're watching him play and sweat is flying off his body and falling on the ground. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7851.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean it's hot as fuck out there it's an outdoor show. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7862.5199999999995s)]
*  Three hours. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7864.5199999999995s)]
*  60 years old going hard for three hours. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7866.5199999999995s)]
*  I would love to see that. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7868.5199999999995s)]
*  It was incredible. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7870.5199999999995s)]
*  He loves snakes. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7872.5199999999995s)]
*  He loves snakes. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7874.5199999999995s)]
*  Huge lover of animals in general. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7876.5199999999995s)]
*  I just randomly ran into Axl Rose at a restaurant. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7877.92s)]
*  Did he just like point at you? [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7881.92s)]
*  No no I was with my friend Brian Murorescu who wrote the book The Immortality Key and it just happened to align perfectly where he was going to be in Greece when I was in Greece. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7883.92s)]
*  The Immortality Key is a book about the Illicinian mysteries and about how in ancient Greece they had these ceremonies that they would do where they were taking psychedelics. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7895.92s)]
*  And it's been proven now because of the wine vessels they did a study of the wine vessels and they showed that they have ergot inside of them. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7905.32s)]
*  And ergot is a fungus that creates an LSD like effect. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7914.32s)]
*  And so they know that they were mixing their wine with these potent psychedelics and having these ceremonies these intense sort of well guarded and secretive ceremonies. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7918.32s)]
*  And he wrote this amazing book on it and now it started a field of study at Harvard. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7930.32s)]
*  It's incredible and there's been a lot of scholarship on it and for the longest time it was dismissed like in the 1970s this guy wrote about it and he basically wrote him off as an intellectual. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7933.719999999999s)]
*  They're like this preposterous but now there's physical proof and people are much more open to the idea of the ancients using psychedelics. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7947.12s)]
*  So I just by sheer luck was in the same place with him at the same time and he took me and my family on a tour of these ruins. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7955.12s)]
*  It was incredible. So we're having dinner and we're you know it's getting late like in Greece they stay up late man. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7963.12s)]
*  They're eating late at night and drinking and we're like we're staying at this place that has a view of the Acropolis. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7968.12s)]
*  It's insane and my friend Brian comes back from the bathroom and he's like hey Axl Rose is here and I'm like that's crazy. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7973.5199999999995s)]
*  And we had to walk by him because the way to leave you're walking by his booth and so I was like do I say hi? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7981.5199999999995s)]
*  I guess I have to say hi. Like I hope he knows who I am. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7987.5199999999995s)]
*  And then I said hi and not only do I know who I am he knew some of my bits he was asking me about comedy and he asked me do you want to come to see the show? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7989.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like fuck yeah. So he invited us to the show. It was insane. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7996.5199999999995s)]
*  That's incredible. It was so cool. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=7999.5199999999995s)]
*  My youngest daughter is a huge Guns N' Roses fan so she freaked out. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8000.92s)]
*  Oh that's awesome. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8004.92s)]
*  My youngest daughter has an incredible taste in music. She loves Nirvana and all this weird stuff. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8006.92s)]
*  Do you listen to Kiss? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8011.92s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8013.92s)]
*  There's something so comforting about that. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8015.92s)]
*  When a kid is like I like the music. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8017.92s)]
*  She's got super eclectic interesting taste in music and she's always listening to new music. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8020.92s)]
*  That's one of the cool things about things like Spotify is you get suggested other songs. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8025.32s)]
*  You listen to a Bad Company song and all of a sudden they're suggesting a Pink Floyd song and you're listening to all this stuff that as a 13 year old with modern playlists you probably wouldn't be really introduced to. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8031.32s)]
*  And then they know what songs you like. They continue giving you. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8043.32s)]
*  Oh that sounds like that. How about one of these? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8047.32s)]
*  I do Go To Radio. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8049.32s)]
*  I'll find a song I love and then I'll do Go To Radio. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8051.32s)]
*  I keep hearting songs. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8052.719999999999s)]
*  I've discovered so much new music. So many new artists. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8055.719999999999s)]
*  That's really cool. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8059.719999999999s)]
*  That's a really cool aspect of today. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8061.719999999999s)]
*  So anyway this show was incredible. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8063.719999999999s)]
*  I didn't get to meet Slash. I only got to meet Axl. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8066.719999999999s)]
*  I met one of the other band members too. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8069.719999999999s)]
*  It was pretty dope. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8071.719999999999s)]
*  I'm going to take Slash to the jungle. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8073.719999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8075.719999999999s)]
*  He belongs there. He's so sweaty. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8077.719999999999s)]
*  If you saw him in Grease man covered in sweat. Holy shit he's talented. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8079.12s)]
*  I just want to see his fingers go. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8084.12s)]
*  It was incredible. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8086.12s)]
*  He's one of the best. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8088.12s)]
*  The band is so good. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8090.12s)]
*  You forget how many hits they have. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8092.12s)]
*  And then it was like three hours in. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8094.12s)]
*  Oh yes Patience. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8096.12s)]
*  Paradise City. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8098.12s)]
*  It was an amazing show. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8100.12s)]
*  It was an amazing show. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8103.12s)]
*  I've been a fan of them since the fucking 80s. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8105.12s)]
*  I used to lift weights to them in Revere Massachusetts in 1988. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8106.5199999999995s)]
*  So here I am. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8111.5199999999995s)]

*  Them. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8117.5199999999995s)]
*  I saw them recently too. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8119.5199999999995s)]
*  I saw the Stones about a year and a half ago here at the Circuit of the Americas. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8121.5199999999995s)]
*  They had this giant outdoor show. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8124.5199999999995s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8126.5199999999995s)]

*  It's like when I'm watching them on stage I was like is that really Mick Jagger? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8130.5199999999995s)]
*  He's right there. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8134.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like Ringo's still out there somewhere. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8136.5199999999995s)]
*  Well no that's like a few years ago they were like Chuck Berry died. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8138.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like Chuck Berry was alive? [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8141.5199999999995s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8143.5199999999995s)]
*  I remember that. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8145.5199999999995s)]
*  I was like wow I thought Chuck Berry was. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8147.5199999999995s)]

*  I mean I think that's the only use of breeding. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8512.32s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8514.32s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8516.32s)]
*  Why do you want that thing like that. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8518.32s)]
*  They're really cute. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8520.32s)]
*  You ever see that meme where they're like pug owners isn't he so cute and they're like the pug and it's like a picture of Steve Buscemi and that Adam Sandler movie with his eyeballs going different ways. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8522.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8524.32s)]
*  They're they're fucking Chihuahuas too some of them are their fucking tongues hanging out their eyes are sideways. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8526.32s)]
*  Yeah like why'd you do that. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8532.32s)]
*  Why did that. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8534.32s)]
*  It's a weird breed. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8536.32s)]
*  It is so it's so weird but but at the same time it's very I think it's great that we that we can't do that. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8538.32s)]
*  I think it's great that we can have this this incredibly loyal like I was just reading something that chimps don't take IQs from humans like dogs you know you look at your dog you just look at the leash you look at the door and they don't really. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8542.32s)]
*  They are so locked into us. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8555.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8557.32s)]
*  And like no other animal does that. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8559.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8561.32s)]
*  And like I've seen an elephant identify a pregnant person I saw an elephant walk up to a woman touch her on the stomach and then like call the other elephants and be like Yo this one's pregnant and they all started they knew shit that we don't know. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8563.32s)]
*  She was like this is cool she has a baby and they were like more careful. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8570.72s)]
*  The hell of a thing is so bizarre because they recognize each other after decades of being apart. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8574.72s)]
*  That they're so smart that I think when I look at an elephant I see. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8579.72s)]
*  A non human being I don't look at it like there's animals and there's cockroaches and there's dogs and there's rhinos and cows and all that shit that's fine when I look at an elephant. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8584.72s)]
*  I look at it and I'm like you they treat you like an animal. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8595.72s)]
*  But they shouldn't. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8600.72s)]
*  I've seen them do things that are so intelligent I've seen them be so compassionate that I think that we are just not smart enough to understand how smart that they are. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8602.72s)]
*  And just because they're not changing their environment and typing things and we just have a distorted idea of intelligence. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8611.72s)]
*  I think that we have like you said your intelligence is the ability to interact with your environment and survive in it. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8619.72s)]
*  And it's like they've gardened all of the habitat that they exist in like when you watch an elephant twisting branches and creating that environment and they're going and grazing around on everything and moving that forest. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8625.119999999999s)]
*  And there's mushrooms growing out of there's the piles of shit that they leave and it's just like there's so much elephant dung and there's so much complex structure. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8639.119999999999s)]
*  And the thing is as a human usually what we do is we watch either we watch elephants in the zoo. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8647.119999999999s)]
*  Where you're looking at basically like a mentally deranged elephant that's been kept in a box its whole life or you're in like a game drive vehicle and you drive up to elephants in the field and they're like shit humans and then they like walk off. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8652.52s)]
*  Very rarely do we get to see human elephants alone in nature problem solving. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8665.52s)]
*  And so like then you'll get these articles where scientists will be like we gave elephants like a key and a lock and so many of them couldn't figure it out. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8671.52s)]
*  It's like you're giving elephants a human problem to solve. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8678.92s)]
*  You're not giving them an elephant problem to solve. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8682.92s)]
*  One time I was with a I had a jeep and it had a whole thing of bananas in it and I was working with this elephant he was a he was a bandit. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8685.92s)]
*  He had been mugging banana guys there's a road that went through the jungle and this elephant was going out and he would stop them. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8694.92s)]
*  He would stop the truck and then the other elephants would come and they would mug the banana guy so by the time he got to where he was going he wouldn't have any bananas. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8701.32s)]
*  So the Indian Forest Department had to show up and they like shackled this poor elephant his name was Dharma and they like threw him an elephant jail. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8709.32s)]
*  I have a picture of elephant jail on there. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8716.32s)]
*  But he one day he caught me with bananas and he came up to the jeep and he was like yo bananas and of course I'm looking up at him like hey Dharma good boy. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8718.32s)]
*  Good boy. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8726.32s)]
*  He pushed me to the side he was like you don't call me good boy that's elephant jail. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8727.72s)]
*  But yeah he took the jeep and he shouldered it put it up on two wheels made dead ass eye contact with me and he was like you gonna give me the bananas or not. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8733.72s)]
*  I was like just put the jeep just put you know I was in this suddenly I was in an argument that I couldn't win with an elephant. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8741.72s)]
*  I was like please put the put the car down. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8747.72s)]
*  He put the car down and then I was like come on come over this way. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8750.72s)]
*  Eventually I had to give him the bananas or he was he and he was threatening me. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8753.119999999999s)]
*  He pushed it up just enough and stopped and looked at me. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8758.119999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8761.119999999999s)]
*  He was like you want me to do this. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8763.119999999999s)]
*  Because it seems like you like it when it's this side up. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8766.119999999999s)]
*  I don't know though. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8768.119999999999s)]
*  And I was like it was it was actually terrifying in that moment because I was like I can't overpower you. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8770.119999999999s)]
*  I can't like threaten you with there's there's no way for me as a smart human to win this argument. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8775.119999999999s)]
*  He just looked at me. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8781.52s)]
*  And then he got his bananas and the next day when he did it my friend Neeti had a hack for it. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8783.52s)]
*  She was the one who was really in charge of this but she would go and take a cup of water and throw it at his face. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8788.52s)]
*  He would slap him in the you know. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8792.52s)]
*  He'd be like I hate that and then he'd like get upset and walk away. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8794.52s)]
*  But they really it's surprising like Jane Goodall changed humanity being like you know she discovered that animals use tools. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8797.52s)]
*  It's like you watch elephants they use tools all day long. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8805.52s)]
*  You know like I've seen an elephant like rip off a stick and like use that to scratch. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8807.52s)]
*  That's a good spot. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8811.52s)]
*  They're so they're just they're just brilliant. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8813.52s)]
*  They're just brilliant. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8815.52s)]
*  Have you seen those videos of elephants painting. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8817.52s)]
*  I'm skeptical already but no what are they painting. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8820.52s)]
*  You've never seen it? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8823.52s)]
*  No. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8825.52s)]
*  They taught an elephant to paint an elephant and the elephant's literally painting a trunk. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8827.52s)]
*  Really? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8829.52s)]
*  Yeah it's impressive. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8831.52s)]
*  I don't doubt it. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8833.52s)]
*  I just wonder what the incentive I guess like everything else. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8835.52s)]
*  Didn't they send us one? [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8837.52s)]
*  They sent us a painting that one of the elephants had made. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8839.52s)]
*  They make things. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8841.52s)]
*  I don't know how they're teaching them how to make these shapes. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8843.52s)]
*  I don't know if the elephant recognizes that it's making the image of an elephant or if they've taught them to make specific shapes. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8847.52s)]
*  I don't know what they do but this here we'll show you a video. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8854.52s)]
*  But these elephants take a paintbrush they put it in their trunk and they dip the paint and start working on canvas. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8858.52s)]
*  I mean I don't doubt it. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8864.52s)]
*  Honestly I wouldn't put much past an elephant. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8866.52s)]
*  And I mean they. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8868.52s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8869.92s)]
*  So here's this elephant. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8871.92s)]
*  I'm going to give this elephant and this is all real video. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8873.92s)]
*  This is pre-AI shit too. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8875.92s)]
*  So this elephant he puts the paintbrush in the elephant's trunk and the elephant walks up to the palette. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8877.92s)]
*  Come on. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8885.92s)]
*  To the canvas and starts painting. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8887.92s)]
*  Starts painting this girl. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8889.92s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8891.92s)]
*  Also look at how dexterous that trunk is. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8893.32s)]
*  Look at the control that he has. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8896.32s)]
*  See it's looking like it's creating something that mimics what it is. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8898.32s)]
*  And so this guy has to dip the paint for it. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8905.32s)]
*  It gives it back to the elephant. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8908.32s)]
*  I wonder why he dips the paint for him. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8910.32s)]
*  Wow look at that you can already see it's going to be an elephant. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8912.32s)]
*  I don't think the elephant totally understands it needs more paint. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8914.32s)]
*  It knows what it needs. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8917.32s)]
*  It knows what it needs. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8919.32s)]
*  It understands it needs more paint. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8920.72s)]
*  It knows when it gives it the brush the paints on it. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8922.72s)]
*  Look at this man. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8926.72s)]
*  Oh look at that he even has the mouth. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8928.72s)]
*  That's a better elephant than most people could draw. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8930.72s)]
*  Yeah better than like most kids for sure. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8933.72s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8935.72s)]
*  It's really incredible. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8937.72s)]
*  But it's somehow or another it's not being guided so it knows how to do this. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8939.72s)]
*  My gut says that there's something gimmicky about this. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8944.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8949.119999999999s)]
*  You can train a lot of behaviors. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8951.119999999999s)]
*  But how is it training it to make these shapes? [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8954.119999999999s)]
*  Which is so specific. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8957.119999999999s)]
*  It's literally drawing itself. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8959.119999999999s)]
*  I would like an explanation. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8962.119999999999s)]
*  Because it's really good. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8965.119999999999s)]
*  Look how it makes it. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8967.119999999999s)]
*  The legs are proportionate. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8969.119999999999s)]
*  The mouth is good. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8971.119999999999s)]
*  The trunk is up. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8973.119999999999s)]
*  Did you cut that Jamie? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8975.119999999999s)]
*  I'm skipping ahead because it's a 15 minute video. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8977.119999999999s)]
*  I call it bullshit. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8979.119999999999s)]
*  Don't skip ahead. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8981.119999999999s)]
*  Let's just take a look at how it's doing this. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8983.119999999999s)]
*  So now it's doing flowers. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8985.119999999999s)]
*  I read that they're trained to do this. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8987.119999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8989.119999999999s)]
*  Of course they're trained. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8991.119999999999s)]
*  But what is this thing seeing? [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8993.119999999999s)]
*  You have to train a child to paint too. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8995.119999999999s)]
*  But you know they use medicine. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8997.119999999999s)]
*  They've documented elephants eating plants that induce labor that African tribes use. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=8999.119999999999s)]
*  And then they found the elephant doing it. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9005.119999999999s)]
*  There's published papers on this. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9006.52s)]
*  Elephants use medicine. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9008.52s)]
*  What? [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9010.52s)]
*  What kind of plants that they find induce labor? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9012.52s)]
*  I wish I remembered the name of it. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9014.52s)]
*  I was just looking this up because somebody told me and I didn't believe them. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9016.52s)]
*  But there's a plant that helps induce labor in some African tribes that they chew when mothers are like right on the cusp of giving birth. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9018.52s)]
*  And this one researcher found elephants eating a ton of this stuff and then having babies and then went back and studied it again and again. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9022.52s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9026.52s)]
*  So this is a plant that's been doing this for a long time. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9028.52s)]
*  It's been doing this for a long time. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9030.52s)]
*  It's been doing this for a long time. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9032.52s)]
*  And then they found the elephant eating a ton of this stuff and then had babies and then went back and studied it again and again. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9033.92s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9035.92s)]
*  Elephants might be able to self-medicate to induce labor. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9037.92s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9039.92s)]
*  Like this world is wild. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9041.92s)]
*  Oh. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9043.92s)]
*  God that's so interesting. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9045.92s)]
*  So they know that the elephants have been trained right? [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9047.92s)]
*  Yeah that's what I was going to get into. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9051.92s)]
*  So trained to make that specific image. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9053.92s)]
*  But still tried to get a dog to do that. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9057.92s)]
*  It's not going to be able to do that. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9061.92s)]
*  It's not going to be able to do something. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9063.92s)]
*  I mean that's the thing. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9065.92s)]
*  I think that's what I'm struggling to get out here is that you can train a dog to do very complex tasks. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9067.92s)]
*  Like a sheep dog. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9071.92s)]
*  Or like that guy who has like 400 different things and he goes you know get the ball, get the sponge, get the thing. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9073.92s)]
*  But like that to me is still a gimmick. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9077.92s)]
*  Whereas like the fact that they have culture. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9079.92s)]
*  The fact that elephants have taught other elephants that you can chew on this when you need to have a baby. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9083.92s)]
*  They have shit that we're not realizing. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9087.92s)]
*  We just look at them and we're like oh they're giant grass eating animals. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9089.92s)]
*  Like with butterfly ears. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9091.32s)]
*  Like cool why not. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9093.32s)]
*  But it's like if we spend that time or the fact that they do the low vibration communication where they can communicate through the earth. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9095.32s)]
*  Where they rumble. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9099.32s)]
*  And they can send like you know there's water over here come. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9101.32s)]
*  And like we can't hear that. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9103.32s)]
*  What are they doing when they're doing that? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9105.32s)]
*  They're pounding on the ground? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9107.32s)]
*  No they're rumbling. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9109.32s)]
*  And they're sending through those. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9111.32s)]
*  So they're an elephant skeletal structure. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9113.32s)]
*  Like it's like the foot is up. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9115.32s)]
*  And so the whole bottom of their foot. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9117.32s)]
*  I want to see that. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9119.32s)]
*  Like I just had an elephant step on my foot. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9121.32s)]
*  And it doesn't hurt as much as you think. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9123.32s)]
*  Because it's very soft under there. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9125.32s)]
*  And so they can actually like rumble and transmit information. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9127.32s)]
*  So they shake their body? [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9129.32s)]
*  No it's a inside of them. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9131.32s)]
*  And it transmits it through the ground? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9135.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9137.32s)]
*  And like vast distances too. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9139.32s)]
*  Miles and miles. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9141.32s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9143.32s)]
*  Yes. Oh my God yes. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9145.32s)]
*  No. This is elephants can communicate in a way that we can't hear using the earth. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9147.32s)]
*  using the earth. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9148.32s)]
*  Is that the sound of it? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9149.66s)]
*  So it says this is. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9154.4s)]
*  I mean, there's obviously some other, [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9155.92s)]
*  you can hear that low frequency around, [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9157.92s)]
*  but it's very low. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9159.199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9162.92s)]
*  It's like a whale. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9163.76s)]
*  They're like avatar creatures, right? [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9166.0s)]
*  Here comes another one. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9167.68s)]
*  Look at that, how crazy they are. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9168.52s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9173.84s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9176.36s)]
*  And they're talking. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9178.3s)]
*  This is great. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9181.06s)]
*  We should always have this soundtrack on. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9181.9s)]
*  I love this. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9184.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I should go to bed to this. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9186.06s)]
*  This is like a warm blanket. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9186.9s)]
*  This is wonderful. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9188.179999999998s)]
*  You know how people like sleep with the static sound? [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9189.46s)]
*  Sleep to this. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9192.539999999999s)]
*  What dreams you would have. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9195.46s)]
*  Don't lose this link. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9199.14s)]
*  I'm gonna listen to that tonight. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9200.019999999999s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9201.5s)]
*  That's great. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9202.82s)]
*  I did not know they did that. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9203.66s)]
*  Yeah, but like the fact that they're transmitting, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9204.679999999998s)]
*  I actually don't know how complex it gets, [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9207.5s)]
*  but that they can be like, hey, [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9209.02s)]
*  there's water over here, guys, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9211.54s)]
*  or that there's simple communications. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9213.060000000001s)]
*  I know vervet monkeys have different calls [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9214.7s)]
*  for aerial predator versus lion versus whatever. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9216.7s)]
*  So they actually have a good type of dialogue. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9220.300000000001s)]
*  They can talk to a degree. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9224.140000000001s)]
*  I've heard that monkeys even trick each other. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9225.980000000001s)]
*  When some monkeys are going after fruit, [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9228.220000000001s)]
*  a monkey will make the sound of an eagle, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9230.460000000001s)]
*  and then the other monkeys will take off, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9233.34s)]
*  and then they'll run and steal the fruit. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9234.86s)]
*  Why not? [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9237.7s)]
*  Why not? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9238.54s)]
*  Deception. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9239.36s)]
*  Deception in the monkey community. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9240.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild, man. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9241.86s)]
*  That sound thing is incredible. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9243.18s)]
*  That was really awesome. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9245.34s)]
*  I have this monkey video queued up [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9246.94s)]
*  you wanted to show a long time ago. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9248.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, hell yeah. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9249.54s)]
*  We were talking about the things we eat in the jungle, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9251.300000000001s)]
*  and I was talking about the bamboo, [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9253.18s)]
*  and the things, and the other things, [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9254.42s)]
*  and I wanted to show you this is one of, [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9255.5s)]
*  let me just set this up for you. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9257.5s)]
*  This is one of my friends who used to be a logger. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9258.62s)]
*  This is one of the guys that's been at war [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9261.300000000001s)]
*  with the uncontacted tribes. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9262.820000000002s)]
*  This is his daughter, and she's six. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9263.84s)]
*  This was the other day, and I found her sitting there, [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9266.220000000001s)]
*  and I said, what is your favorite food? [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9268.98s)]
*  And she went, this. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9270.5s)]
*  And then I just watched her rip into this thing and just. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9272.300000000001s)]
*  Her favorite food is monkey? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9277.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9278.9s)]
*  Oreja, su oreja. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9279.74s)]
*  Yeah, in the beginning of the video, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9282.26s)]
*  I'm like, what's your favorite food? [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9283.5s)]
*  And she's like, monkey. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9284.5s)]

*  of a yellow-footed tortoise, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9364.14s)]
*  which looks like Bowser's foot from Super Mario. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9365.46s)]

*  The foot was the best thing in the bowl. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9391.98s)]
*  Really? [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9393.34s)]

*  like those big scales, like this claws at the end. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9403.1s)]

*  as like this giant spoon for the rice. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9406.859999999999s)]

*  And then I like, I like walked out back and I was like, [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9460.42s)]
*  is that the other half of the monkey you just cooked me? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9463.26s)]
*  And they're like, yeah. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9464.98s)]

*  I was like, cause I don't want grub right now. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9517.22s)]
*  And she just took it and bit the pincers on the face of it. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9518.7s)]
*  And she like bit the pincers off. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9522.26s)]
*  She was like, what about now? [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9523.5s)]

*  Challenging you. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9536.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9537.300000000001s)]

*  It's mushy. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9555.1s)]
*  The worst thing about a grub is that if you don't cook them [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9555.94s)]
*  and you just like, or when you start to cook them, [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9559.26s)]
*  when the nematodes come out of them, [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9561.46s)]
*  when the parasites that are living in the grubs come out. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9562.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I mean, nothing seems to happen. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9565.82s)]
*  Usually I think. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9567.699999999999s)]
*  Do you have to cook them? [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9568.539999999999s)]
*  You should cook them. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9569.98s)]
*  Was she cooking them? [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9571.22s)]
*  Nope. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9572.179999999998s)]

*  I couldn't keep my, all these videos of her just eating. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9574.619999999999s)]
*  They're hysterical. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9577.859999999999s)]
*  And then they had a baby. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9579.38s)]
*  He's got a baby. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9580.619999999999s)]
*  It's like a, he was like an infant [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9581.46s)]
*  and they're the mom is popping them in the baby, [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9583.22s)]
*  little tiny soft ones without the pincers, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9585.58s)]
*  but she was popping them in. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9587.7s)]
*  And like the whole family, [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9588.66s)]
*  like it was like you got popcorn at the movie theater. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9589.740000000002s)]
*  It's like we couldn't, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9592.060000000001s)]
*  you couldn't fight over it fast enough. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9593.42s)]
*  Everybody wanted a grub. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9594.980000000001s)]
*  And then she just picked the biggest gnarliest motherfucker [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9596.34s)]
*  with the gnarliest fangs. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9599.18s)]
*  And she was like, put this in your mouth. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9600.900000000001s)]
*  Are they nutritious? [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9602.740000000002s)]
*  They're very nutritious. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9603.980000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're amazing. Yeah. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9605.18s)]
*  No, and if you cook them, they are delicious. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9606.300000000001s)]
*  Souris. Really? [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9607.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They're sweet. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9608.820000000002s)]

*  Oh, souris. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9612.62s)]
*  They like, they'll stick a bunch of them on a stick [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9613.460000000001s)]
*  and then fry them and stuff. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9614.820000000002s)]
*  What does it taste like when you fry them? [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9616.54s)]
*  When you fry them, it's crunchy. It's good. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9618.1s)]
*  Like that, I guarantee if you blindfolded somebody [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9620.220000000001s)]
*  and fed them fried grubs, [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9622.9s)]

*  No. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9633.74s)]
*  So that could be like a menu item. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9635.98s)]
*  Yeah. No, it's yeah. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9637.58s)]
*  Like you go to Peru and like, oh, they're still alive. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9638.42s)]
*  Oh, cooking them alive on the skewers. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9641.7s)]
*  Yeah. But like I've seen, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9644.1s)]
*  like the way people give like a baby a lollipop or something. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9646.06s)]
*  So this is like a market [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9648.62s)]

*  These guys seem to be enjoying them. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9651.9s)]
*  They do look kind of tasty. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9653.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9654.86s)]

*  Do you have a fascinating life? [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9658.5s)]
*  I have a weird life. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9660.74s)]
*  It's pretty weird, but it's pretty fucking cool. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9661.82s)]
*  Yeah. Well, dude, I've been, [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9664.140000000001s)]

*  And I thank you for coming here. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9685.539999999999s)]
*  And I hope more people understand [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9686.699999999999s)]
*  and more people get involved now because of this. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9689.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9691.539999999999s)]
*  Because of this conversation. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9692.38s)]
*  I think they will. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9693.22s)]
*  Yeah. Let's save an entire river. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9694.06s)]
*  That insane carnival of life. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9695.42s)]

*  a bunch of times too. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9702.14s)]
*  So like anytime new things are coming on [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9704.06s)]
*  and new things are happening [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9705.38s)]
*  or anything you want to talk about, let's do it. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9706.699999999999s)]
*  All right, man. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9709.019999999999s)]
*  As soon as I get some weird new parasites. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9709.859999999999s)]
*  I was thinking, I was actually thinking [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9711.099999999999s)]
*  of trying to keep the bot fly. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9712.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9714.38s)]
*  I was like, we're gonna take it out on here. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9715.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9716.06s)]
*  It's no need. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9717.3s)]
*  A video is good enough. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9718.14s)]
*  Are you sure? [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9718.98s)]
*  I'm positive. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9719.8s)]
*  I guess you want to eat it afterwards. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9720.64s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9721.859999999999s)]
*  Show me how tough you are. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9722.699999999999s)]
*  Yikes. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9723.539999999999s)]
*  Do they eat bot flies? [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9724.38s)]
*  No. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9725.199999999999s)]

*  No. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9727.699999999999s)]
*  No, that's taken it too far. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9728.539999999999s)]
*  They cook tarantulas. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9729.5s)]
*  I know that, right? [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9730.58s)]
*  Tarantulas apparently taste like crab. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9731.42s)]
*  I've never actually had one. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9733.38s)]
*  I mean, I've eaten pretty much everything, [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9734.9s)]
*  but I've never had a tarantula. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9736.5s)]
*  Apparently David Good's people, the Yanomami, they do that. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9737.62s)]
*  They cook up some nice tarantulas. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0UShlEjxys&t=9740.06s)]
