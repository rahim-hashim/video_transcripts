# Joe Rogan Experience #1565 - Gary Laderman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmHwG2p_esE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hello, Gary.
*  Hey, how you doing?
*  What's up, man?
*  Thanks for coming.
*  Appreciate it.
*  I'm happy to be here.
*  Why don't you tell everybody what you do?
*  Well, for work.
*  Yeah, I teach at Emory University.
*  So I'm a professor.
*  I've been there for about 25 years.
*  And I also write some books and teach a variety of classes.
*  But you study, like what I've read of your study is some of it is on death and some of
*  it is on drugs.
*  That is correct.
*  Those are two very heavy subjects.
*  That may be the heaviest.
*  Well, the other course I teach is religion and sexuality.
*  So I mean, that's a very heavy subject.
*  So I'm a professor.
*  I'm a professor.
*  The other course I teach is religion and sexuality.
*  So I mean, that's another really heavy one.
*  You look like a guy who would study both death and drugs.
*  So well, this is the pandemic here.
*  I mean, really, I'm usually I'm much more, you know, well, I'm not really doing this.
*  Just doing the full plus.
*  One of my students told me I should do before I came in here.
*  I'm telling you, man, once you once you do it, it's so freeing not having to go to a
*  shop or a hairdresser.
*  Well, what's weird is I feel really free with all this hair.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, again, the hair fits the subjects that you study.
*  How did you get involved in what when you talk about drugs like you, you studied all
*  sorts of psychedelic drugs, but also common drugs like like caffeine, like we were talking
*  about before.
*  I was telling you before that I make some ridiculous French press coffee with far too
*  much coffee in it.
*  And it's become a bit of a problem lately.
*  Well, but it's probably keeping you healthy and keeping you going.
*  I don't know if it is.
*  I don't know.
*  At the end of the day, I'm really tired and I'm not usually really tired.
*  And I think it's because I've been on speed all day.
*  It can tire you out.
*  That's for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, I mean, my interest in studying the connection between religion and drugs,
*  I'm in a department of religion at Emory, really spans the spectrum.
*  So I'm interested.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And psychedelics, but also, as you're saying, in the more ordinary psychoactive drugs that
*  bring order to our lives and, you know, allow us to tap into our true identity, maintain
*  some semblance of stability in our lives, you know, things that religion often can do.
*  It's the subject of religion and drugs is it's really fascinating to me, but it's something
*  that I never even really considered until, you know, 10, 15 years ago.
*  And I was introduced to Jack Herr and he was, do you know who he is?
*  The cannabis advocate, recently deceased, not so recently anymore.
*  Great guy, but wrote, was writing a book about the connection between psychedelics,
*  psychedelics, particularly psilocybin and religion and Christianity.
*  And he had this amazing collection of artwork that connected like ancient Christian artwork
*  with a lot of these dancing naked figures that look like they were in ecstasy, shrouded
*  by this translucent mushroom.
*  Yeah, though that's not uncommon.
*  There are a lot of theories out there that connect early Christianity, especially to
*  different kinds of hallucinogenic psychedelic drugs of some form.
*  But I think the connections are much more widespread.
*  People have been using psychoactive substances for religious ritual, for religious experience,
*  for forms of transcendence and journey in all kinds of different cultural settings and
*  through history.
*  What got you into the subject?
*  Well, I've been interested in the topic of drugs for a while, but I think what really,
*  you know, led me to see this would be quite a fruitful topic to pursue in terms of research
*  was I wrote a short little essay on LSD and religion, talked about my own experience as
*  a young man tripping and talking about the ways in which when I had that experience in
*  the late 70s and people more and more were, you know, enjoying psychedelics coming out
*  of the decade of the 60s, I started to see that they would often use words like spiritual
*  or mystical to describe their experiences and to talk about how their religious views
*  are being reoriented.
*  And I saw that in my own experience and wrote about that as a way to talk about what is
*  probably the most significant shift in religion in America and that's the rise of the nuns,
*  those who don't affiliate with any religion and who many who claim to be spiritual but
*  not religious.
*  And I want to tie that back to people's experiences with psychedelics.
*  There's a lot of people that are in the nuns that don't have any experience with psychedelics.
*  They just seem to want to have a deeper meaning to life.
*  And they'll say I'm not religious but I'm spiritual.
*  And a lot of people get really annoyed when people talk like that.
*  Yeah, well, it can be annoying.
*  And also, you know, I think as you say, it's very much becoming quite common for people to identify
*  in that way.
*  And that's also about a very strong kind of negative understanding of traditional religion,
*  institutional religion, and so on.
*  Yeah, I feel like for a lot of these people that don't have psychedelic experiences that are
*  spiritual, that sort of dismiss religion, I never want to tell people to do psychedelics,
*  but I feel like if they did it, they would relax a little with this idea that they really have an
*  understanding of what happens when you die.
*  I think they would really let that go.
*  Most people would.
*  Right.
*  You'd go, well, I didn't know this was real.
*  And this has been around for thousands of years, psychedelics.
*  And then you have these experiences that are so profound.
*  And you're like, OK, maybe I'm just full of shit and I've been posing this whole time.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, again, it's not just you who have these views.
*  What we're seeing is a lot of medical research around psychedelics also.
*  We're pointing to the same thing, a decrease in fear of death.
*  People's sense of compassion and love really can blossom.
*  People's lives are transformed in a lot of these more controlled medical studies with people who are
*  taking psilocybin or MDMA.
*  But the main focus of all that, of course, is the therapeutic benefits.
*  But as we're saying, it's all about spirituality.
*  And those therapeutic benefits can't be separated out from a kind of spiritual sense of that experience.
*  It gives me a little bit of hope that in this time of great strife and struggle,
*  and especially in terms of the way human beings are dealing with each other,
*  that this is a time where people are also rediscovering psychedelics in record numbers.
*  And they're looking for some sort of a way to make sense of this life.
*  Because we're obviously in some strange transitional moment in history
*  where our confidence in systems and government and even education,
*  certainly news and media, is eroding at an unprecedented rate.
*  But it's also at the same time, all drugs are now legal in Oregon.
*  These things are happening where people go, you know what? Come on, Colorado's like mushrooms.
*  Go ahead, do mushrooms.
*  And God bless Texas, they fucking need all that shit right here.
*  Georgia too.
*  Yeah, all these places.
*  The whole world needs it. They need the option.
*  Right.
*  Because the idea that human beings are somehow or another preventing other human beings
*  from having non-lethal experiences that have proven to be incredibly transcendent
*  and change people's lives for the better, just en masse.
*  Like if you see the John Hopkins study, the people that won psilocybin experience,
*  the majority of them listed as the most profound experience of their life.
*  Right. And non-addictive.
*  Yes. And non-lethal.
*  I mean, the LD50 is like what? You have to eat like two pounds of it or something crazy.
*  Right. And we know that the stories of addiction and a lot of the dangers are so overblown.
*  But I think, again, this is just a moment, as you're saying.
*  That's why I feel I'm on to something.
*  I think you are too.
*  I think I'm going to read this book that I'm writing,
*  which is going to make the argument that drugs are really the sort of source of spiritual life in America.
*  That's the future. As well as the past.
*  Yeah.
*  Again, the influence of psychoactive substances in the Americas pre-Columbus was pervasive
*  and just a part of everyday life.
*  And as you say, we've, for whatever historical reasons and changes that have happened in our society,
*  have lost touch with those resources of spiritual meaning and religious life.
*  And as you're saying, and I believe it too, we are in a moment when things are really transforming
*  and drugs will be, I think, quite important in terms of how we come out on the other side.
*  I hate the word drugs. It's just such a blanket word.
*  It's so unfortunate that, you know, like heroin and opiates and meth is lumped in with psilocybin all under one blanket.
*  Well, yeah, you're not alone. I mean, I'm intentional with drugs.
*  I like to be provocative and try to confuse a lot of the categories that we use in thinking about some of these things
*  that are so central in our lives and so potent, especially in terms of our religious lives.
*  So, yeah, there's entheogens, psychedelics, and, you know, obviously all different kinds of other kinds of, again, substances that we use.
*  That have an effect and for me that in some cases, in many cases, have religious meanings and connections.
*  Have you ever experimented with holotropic breathing or any of the non psychedelic methods of achieving these certain states of consciousness?
*  No, no, I mean, no, but I think they're important as well.
*  People as achieving a mystical state through non psychedelic means is another avenue in thinking about the importance of those mystical states and how people get there.
*  But also, I would say, as you said, it's what are the results? What kind of transformations are made in people's lives?
*  And I think what we're seeing is whether it's a psychedelic induced experience or non psychedelic.
*  It's there are lots of similarities.
*  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people get it get there through near death experience.
*  There's a lot of people. Well, this is another thing where the mind is capable of producing psychedelic compounds and in near death experiences,
*  although it's very difficult to measure, right, because you'd actually have to open up someone's brain while they're in the middle of a near death experience,
*  which is probably not the healthiest thing for someone who almost died.
*  But that's as far as we know, that's the best way to measure it now.
*  But these people who experience these near death moments have these incredible profound visions.
*  And many people think that what's happening is some sort of endogenous dump of psychedelic chemicals.
*  We know the brain is capable of making the most potent one psychedelics in terms of like, you know, what happens and how they do it.
*  It's still a bit of a mystery they're trying to solve.
*  But that connection is fascinating.
*  Yeah. And as I mentioned, or you may know, I teach a death and dying course as well.
*  And so near death experiences are pretty much an important part of that class.
*  And the kinds of research and findings that are beginning to appear in terms of looking at those connections are fascinating and tie into this question of what is our relationship to death?
*  How do we understand, you know, the reality of death in our lives and, you know, what are our thoughts about the afterlife or if there is one that gets tied into a lot, you know, how people respond to this research, you know,
*  how they are engaged with it and how they're compelled by it.
*  There's a lot of folks that apparently can reach like some pretty intense states of consciousness through yoga, through different styles of yoga and different styles of breathing.
*  But there's a really funny quote by Terence McKenna where the Buddha met this monk who said, I practiced the city of levitation for the last 20 years and I've achieved the ability to walk on water.
*  And the Buddha says, yeah, but the fairy is only a nickel.
*  Yeah, right.
*  You can really meditate alone in darkness forever or you can just take mushrooms. You get there in an hour.
*  Right. Well, I think for many of us, we take the quicker route.
*  Yeah. But again, there are like with the monk or people who meditate, you know, all kinds of important, well, set and setting, thinking about, you know, what is the context in which this is taking place?
*  And that's critical.
*  Do you ever get pushback about the connection between psychedelics and religion?
*  Has anybody ever like challenged you on this or debated you on it?
*  Oh, I mean, I teach. I mean, my students don't.
*  Sometimes they challenge. But no, I mean, I'm not directly and I don't really give a shit.
*  You know, I mean, I'm at that stage of my career.
*  I'm convinced about, again, the sort of great research possibilities and thinking across the board about the connection between drugs and religion.
*  Now, when you're you're teaching these classes and I'm assuming that for a lot of these kids, this is the first time you're exposing them to these ideas.
*  Absolutely. Because, yeah, they many of them don't know what the study of religion is.
*  Right.
*  And well, we have a pretty nice diverse mix of students in terms of their background, but most don't have a religion course other than something they've done.
*  And they were in Catholic school or if they studied the Bible in some form.
*  But no, they've never seen anything like me.
*  It's funny because that's I mean, that's a heavy responsibility.
*  I would imagine, too, because you're introducing to these kids this these ideas that have a really the potential for a very profound impact on the rest of their life.
*  Yeah. And that's been something I've worried about my entire career.
*  You know, I actually care quite a bit about how these ideas are transmitted and received.
*  And as we said, a lot of them are quite sensitive, the topics that I'm trying to teach.
*  But it's an essential part, I think, of of of being a young adult and learning how to not just think for yourself, but to sort of reimagine the world and try to understand some of the forces that are at work in in your life and what's going to be coming in terms of your future career.
*  And I try to make religion relevant, you know, in those terms.
*  But I also, as I like to say to them, you know, I mean, my I wouldn't say this before I had tenure.
*  But, you know, my my goal, I tell them the straight out is to confuse the hell out of them.
*  You know, what they think is religion is not the only game in town.
*  And so I'm very upfront about this sort of being an intellectual exercise.
*  You know, why are students taking my death and dying class?
*  Well, I don't want to know.
*  I want it just to be purely academic for them to encounter different understandings of death, different death rituals, different cultures and and shake them up.
*  But not necessarily, you know, kind of turn them away from what they've been taught.
*  The end result may kind of reinforce their own sort of cultural background and outlook.
*  But but I'm I'm for myself.
*  I'm very gratified in the work that I do, if you could call it work.
*  And, you know, I get a great response from students and I'm just, you know, really pleased that I'm able to be a part of that educational process because not to go on that.
*  That, yeah, I mean, because my classes are often not like their other classes, which are, you know, political science or economics or biology.
*  And, you know, I just want them to be able to reflect and think about some of these deep things that sooner or later, you know, are going to bite them in the butt.
*  Yeah, I like how you describe it, too, that it's not the only game in town.
*  The way I try to describe it to people is like I'm not not a religious person, but I'm not opposed to it.
*  And I probably was when I was younger, but I think I was just arrogant.
*  And I think that the best way to look at religion is it's not the whole thing you should.
*  But you shouldn't throw it out. I think it's a piece. Yeah, I think it's a piece of something that's a giant puzzle.
*  And the idea of throwing it out, I don't think that's the way to do it.
*  I think I think those people in the problem, obviously, is during translations.
*  Translation is a giant issue when you're taking something from ancient Hebrew and you're translating it to Latin and to Greek and Aramaic and all these different languages.
*  It's like a lot is probably lost in terms of the way they express.
*  Like if you ever read Russian to English, there's a lot of like Russian people I follow on Twitter and I get a huge kick out or excuse me on Instagram.
*  And I get a huge kick out of pressing the translate button. Oh, yeah.
*  Like to try to break down the way they communicate.
*  Now, when you're dealing with like super ancient languages that we don't use anymore, like ancient Hebrew, like who knows how accurate and what if the the intent is clear.
*  The intent is clearly expressed through an English translation. Right. Probably not.
*  Well, a lot gets lost. Yeah, a lot gets invented.
*  Also, it's just these ideas have been passed down through thousands and thousands of years.
*  And I feel like if you could just not be too literal with it and just listen to what these people are saying, what they were trying to get across.
*  Obviously, there's some awful shit in the Bible in particular and many religions in terms of condoning slavery, treating women as second class citizens.
*  There's a lot that's probably just some cultural artifact of the time where they've embedded their own beliefs on how human beings should act with each other and then and then attributed that to God.
*  Right. Right.
*  But if you can get past that and just not take it, you know, no pun intended as gospel. Right. And just these people were trying to lay down their experiences and the lessons that they've learned in some sort of a way to live your life book.
*  Right. Right.
*  And, and yeah, I mean, I agree with you from my point of view.
*  Too much literalism, you know, is really counterproductive, if not destructive. Yeah, as societies change over time.
*  So, you know, the act of interpretation is very much obviously a part of of the study of religion and looking at how religions change and transform.
*  For me, I'll just I'll say I'm so not interested in Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Islam.
*  You know, the conventional containers of what we think are the world's religions are, you know, very problematic, to say the least.
*  But my my interested my interest is more in the sort of intersections of religion and culture, where people might not recognize they're being religious, even though I would try to make the argument that they are.
*  Like how so?
*  Well, I mean, I've written a book called Sacred Matters that looks at these different kind of arenas where where religious life can be found in cultural forms of activity.
*  So like celebrity worship, I would call a religious culture that has systems of meaning, different kinds of rituals, possibilities for discovering your true self, a whole kind of value system that can be tied up.
*  That's interesting. Celebrity worship as a form of religion.
*  I've always thought of is just hijacking the human reward system, because if we lived in a tribe of people, a small tribe, and there was one great leader, you know, the battle scarred leader who's seen it all and can give us the information, and he was the one talking, we would listen.
*  That would be a person of great importance.
*  And we all gather around and listen. But when you see Brad Pitt in a movie screen, and his face is 30 feet high and this music playing when he talks and a team of writers have carefully constructed all of his words and this perfect sentence and you know, it's just like, it's so moving and inspiring.
*  And then we see him in real life. Oh my God, it's really you. But meanwhile, he hasn't really done anything other than pretend.
*  Right.
*  He's not a great entertainer, but he's given us some wonderful distractions, but it's not that he's led us through battle. Right. It's not that he's figured out how to find the food in the water.
*  You know, this is not what it is, but in our hijacked human reward system, we treat him as though he is the great leader.
*  Yeah, or even someone like Oprah, I mean, who's more clearly, you know, in that sort of strange middle ground between celebrity and spiritual leader of some kind.
*  So, you know, obviously it's going to vary depending on what celebrity you're talking about. But, you know, just in terms of projections, our imagination, where we invest, you know, our energies, you know, celebrities big.
*  But again, I'd like to talk about other things, you know, as well. That, you know, whether we're talking about politics or consumer culture or things around medicine, that there are religious qualities that don't have to do with the Bible or with Muhammad or something.
*  Right. There's religious qualities in that there's these very rigid ideologies that are treated like religions that you have to follow. And there's also signs that people will hold up that they're complying and they're along with this ideology.
*  One of them that I talk about a lot is people taking photos with masks on, on Twitter for their profile picture. Like, I know what you're doing. We all know what we're doing.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, that's again messaging and thinking about, you know, values.
*  Yeah. It's bizarre when you see these patterns sort of repeated over and over again.
*  Right. Well, and social media too will be the future of religion in terms of how it transforms and moves forward is an important kind of site for religious activity and investments and, you know, where we're really going to see the action.
*  What's happening on Instagram, Twitter, and so on.
*  Yeah. So when you say like religion that these things fall into sort of religious behaviors or religious ideas, you're not meaning like as handed down from a higher power.
*  You're meaning as in people fall in with the same sort of compliant behavior and patterns and not necessarily.
*  I mean, it's not, it's not all just sort of compliance and compliance. One aspect. Right. Or conformity or something. It's just meaning making. It's how we try to live our lives in ways that can carry us on when we have to confront suffering and death and as well as, you know, issues around health.
*  And what are the sources that are available to people? And, you know, as I've said in my class many times, I think popular culture is much more of an important kind of teacher about religious ideas and values than, you know, the local preacher.
*  How so? Because people paid more attention to it? Absolutely. Yeah. And because they're more swayed by it, you know, because it has more of an impact and resonance.
*  But it's so it's so it's a dangerous way to sway things coming from someone who's involved in distributing popular culture because there's so little thought put into the actual impact of what it is and so much thought putting into it just what pops.
*  Yeah. What gets people to pay attention? Right. Well, and money talks and money is sacred. You know, what's more sacred in our society than making some money? Yeah.
*  And that's dry. You know, again, so there, too, we can talk about other religious qualities to capitalism. Well, you know, there have been a number of scholars who've written on that topic and made those connections.
*  So, again, you know, the action isn't taking place in the church. It's taking place in, you know, music festivals. Burning Man. Yeah. You know, it's this is where, again, not making it.
*  I'm not trying to kind of overgeneralize, but I think very much for especially younger people, but baby boomers as well. You know, where where the you know where does where do I get my spiritual juices?
*  You know, there are churches now that are incorporating psilocybin into their rituals. I think one particular in Oregon, see if you can find that there's a church in Oregon that is doing.
*  What am I Oregon spokesperson today? Well, it's a big, you know, that's big news and big changes. Yeah, we're all going to be watching that. Well, the idea is that that's what it used to be all about.
*  You know, if you go back to it's a very controversial book, but John Marco Allegro's The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross is all about consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and that he believes that that was really what the Bible was about was about hiding these stories from the Romans.
*  When they were captured. Yeah, lots of theories that even with Judaism to Moses, you know, there's just all kinds of ways people have tried to make the connection. Oh yeah, there legally offering psilocybin mushroom therapy through ceremony.
*  Oh, but look, there's that's what is the name of this place?
*  Sacred Heart Medicine dot us. Is that the name of the church? No.
*  Yeah, Oregon State nonprofit domestic gotta go nonprofit if you want to sell mushrooms and not get locked up. Well, that's right. Donated all charity kids.
*  Well, stay out of the pokey. Well, and there are weed churches too that are starting to crop up. So cannabis and religion also beyond again just the psychedelics. Yeah.
*  And, and that's just sort of the surface. My sense is, there's a big underground and I know there's one here in Austin, because I did some research here but around I do my research out I've made before the pandemic I was able to get out and do some research around and talk to people who are who are you know running these kinds of, you know, psychedelic religious communities or, you know, sacred plants.
*  And then there's a lot of different communities that are cropping up Washington DC right they just also decriminalize psilocybin. Yeah, and there too is a thriving underground so these are I think we're going to see that underground these subcultures really begin to surface.
*  I think so too. And with the war on drugs. Now, basically, almost over.
*  How are we going to think about drugs, how we respond to them, the war on drugs almost over. What a crazy war and drugs one.
*  Well, yeah, I mean I've been saying this a lot lately but like my whole life has been lived under the war on drugs. Yeah, I mean, yeah, how old is 58. Yeah. So it's some.
*  I missed out.
*  All of a sudden, changing and like, I would have been fascinating going to be like to be around late 50s early 60s before everything was illegal. When people were just freaking out when, you know, after Hoffman did synthesized LSD and when you know, basically all of the schedule and compounds were free and legal, I mean free to consume you.
*  You got to wonder the only thing that was illegal was marijuana. Yeah, which is kind of hilarious. Yeah, it boggles the mind. Yeah, it's full of hypocrisy but yeah that was a crazy time I don't know if you saw that great documentary Wormwood. No, I didn't.
*  By Errol Morris. I've heard of it though. Yeah, it's crazy about again the sort of 50s and psychedelics and LSD and CIA and all that. Yeah. So that's a very rich part of the history that pre Timothy Leary that, you know, Rock Hudson was on the psychiatrist's couch.
*  Taking LSD and experimenting with that and you know, what was that doing? Again, the notion was miracle drug medicine. This is going to help people with their depression and you know, all of that and and again, what we don't know, although we're beginning to see this more and more in some of this research is what are the religious implications in a person's life after they trip.
*  Yeah, there's a great book that I've mentioned many times in this podcast because I have the guest on the author on rather Tom O'Neill wrote a book called chaos and it's about the Manson family and he was writing a book on the Manson family excuse me he was writing an article 20 years ago on the Manson family just supposed to be real quick article writing it and then in the middle of his research writing writing the book he started finding all these problems and weird inconsistencies.
*  Weird connections 20 years later he finishes this book and it's all about the CIA and LSD and that the Manson family Charles Manson in particular was involved with CIA experiments they did with LSD on LSD with prisoners and that they were most likely dosing him up when he was in jail and then giving him access to LSD and these psychological techniques that he was using.
*  That he used on the family when he was released and then also all this evidence that every time they would arrest him even though he's on parole they would let him go because the CIA was encouraging his use of LSD his promoting it to the family and they're committing crimes and the whole idea was to discredit the anti war movement and to disrupt the civil rights movement there was a lot of shit involved with the CIA and LSD and they were running a.
*  They were running a clinic a free clinic in Haight Ashbury until for 50 years until three months after this book is released and then mysteriously our work is done yeah it's over they closed it down right but there's amazing connections that Tom O'Neill makes in this book to Jolly West who was in the CIA was a part of their LSD program to Jack Ruby.
*  I've heard some of this yeah oh my god it's it's amazing he's Tom is great and his book is I can't recommend it enough I'll check it it's a mindblower yeah because as you get into the book you're like what the fuck because meticulously researched over 20 years I mean it was this man's life right and they succeeded yeah oh yeah yeah yeah that was the end of it or you know a lot of people that kind of mark that as being sure yeah yeah yeah and they think of LSD as a way to get to the bottom of this.
*  Yeah and I think that LSD is something that makes you go crazy and want to murder people and kill people and they change the idea of what a hippie was right right right because of the psychological techniques that he learned when he was in jail and all the mind control experiments that he learned and the way they did it like he would pretend to take acid and he would give it acid to the family and then he would mind fuck them right and then have them go out and commit murder and tell them that they were freeing people and yeah well wild shit no no doubt I mean wild times yeah absolutely.
*  And there was a lot of interest for sure and among the CIA for you know what the potential would be for LSD.
*  Yeah he also went over the Operation Midnight Climax which was a part of MK Ultra do you know about that?
*  Operation Midnight Climax they ran whorehouses they ran brothels in San Francisco and I think a couple other cities and they would have two way mirrors and they would have the prostitutes dose up these johns with LSD in their drinks and they had no idea and then they would have sex and they would watch them and observe them and this went on for years.
*  Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Where they're just giving people LSD like American citizens yes they will. Right right right this is a law enforcement agency. Yeah. Bizarre. Well you know I mean what don't we know. Yeah exactly what don't we know. Right well.
*  Well they only found this out sort of accidentally through research into these files that had been left behind and some Freedom of Information Act stuff. Right right right well that's how people are being able to get access to some of that. Yeah. Some of that information.
*  But the problem is for so long people have had this idea as LSD equals lose your mind go crazy jump off buildings. Right. Well and then that also gets transferred over to cannabis and other drugs as the war on drugs really picks up with Nixon and it does help to demonize certain groups of people.
*  Well the real sad thing too is in putting these things in schedule one we've really missed out on research that would be very helpful for people that do have adverse reactions. There's a lot of people diverse reactions to psilocybin to cannabis to LSD and we don't know why. Right. Right.
*  Particularly people that have schizophrenic breaks while on cannabis it's very common. Right. Not very common but it might be like you know one out of a hundred or something crazy like that. Right. Right. Right. It's not huge but it's enough that we really should be concerned and we don't know what the fuck's going on because they've kept people from doing research. Right. Right.
*  Well who knows if that is going to change. Yeah. It's already starting to change quite dramatically and with the results that are coming out of some of these experiments and research studies that are going on I think you know it's convincing. Yeah. And when you're helping you know war veterans. Yes. PTSD you know I mean I mean come on. MDMA seems to be particularly helpful for that. Right. Well that's right. And I know they're doing some some of those studies at Emory but I think that's a good thing.
*  And a lot of places. Again this is what is being referred to as the mainstreaming of psychedelics. It's just you know they're going to be more and more a part of our resources. Yeah. In terms of where to go. Yeah. A mild dose of MDMA for the whole world might fix everything. Yeah. Well just a real mild dose where everybody together. Right. Three two one go. We're all just like I'm sorry. Oh man let's love each other. What are we doing here. It would be amazing. Yeah.
*  I've only done it once but it was incredibly profound. Right. But the next day I couldn't read. You were pretty fogged out or something. I was so dumb. And then I had to go on stage and I was terrible. I did stand up the next night and I just couldn't get it together. My brain was so worn out. Right. I was going to ask you. I think I saw that your tour was called Sacred Clown. Yeah. So you know sacred is my I like to kind of go after that but is it a sacred thing.
*  I like that title. And so I was curious how you came up with that. It's a Lakota term. Hiyoka is a sacred clown. OK. Lakota has had a term for a very important part of their culture which was someone who mocks all the things that are deemed sacred and important. Right.
*  And sort of finds holes in all of these dogmatic ideas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's I mean again that's what religion can do. Yeah I would have called it of sake notions of the sacred can really help you to see what's really going on in the world. I would have called it Hiyoka but it seems like that would have caused more problems than. Well first of all people like what the fuck does that mean. And then second of all people like your culture appropriating which is careful.
*  Do you really. I'm not sure you do. Well I'm not sure. I think you better off. Yeah. I mean certainly. Yeah. In terms of it's more of a waiting. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. But I get you. Yeah. So that's what I'm going to call it once I get tour again. Right. I'm sorry. And it'll be even more important now. After the pandemic you really need to make fun of shit. Absolutely. Because people are more on edge. And then also unfortunately or fortunately people have embedded themselves so deeply into social media.
*  That they believe that this really bizarre way of communicating which forms these echo chambers and these really non empathetic ways of expressing your disdain or anger or hate or disagreement with people.
*  That this is common and standard. It's the most non psychedelic thing. Right. The way people communicate on Twitter is like a bunch of mental patients throwing shit at each other. Yeah. I understand. Yeah.
*  And you've gotten off of Twitter of social media. Well I'm on Twitter but I don't use it. Right. Right. I'll read other people's stuff sometimes just to go what is going on. But if someone's trying to get my attention. Good luck. Good luck. I don't read anything about me. Yeah. But I don't read anything about me in general. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because Instagram is basically just a giant distraction for me. Right. It's fine. It's fun to lot of good images and things. But I agree. You know I think that the.
*  Social media is one of the more powerful forces and the changes that we are seeing. Yeah. And the political divisions clearly are kind of one of the consequences of how embedded you know these platforms have become in our lives. It's almost like.
*  Like it's all been. I mean it hasn't all been planned out but it's almost like it has been in order to really deteriorate our confidence and all these structures and systems. If you thought about what would be the perfect way to deteriorate it. Well you have a guy who's clearly unqualified for the job who is famous for just kind of being an asshole on television firing people and being like a bombastic sort of you know braggadocious rich guy with his name on giant buildings.
*  And you're fired. Fuck you. And grab him by the pussy. And then you have that be that guy be the president. Yeah. And then have everybody like we got to get him out of here. He's the problem. He's the problem. And then I think they're going to realize once he is out. No no no he's not the problem. He's he's just a problem. Right. The problem is human beings. Right. And the problem is the political system is just deeply embedded with corruption. And you're going to realize that with this next guy who's supposed to be your savior. It's not going to work out. Well to bring it back to your earlier point.
*  I think we all could use some MDMA. Yeah. Everybody. Everybody should microdose on mushrooms for sure. OK. Well look where we're going. I think we're heading in that direction. I think you are too. You know I believe in the young people. Yeah I do too. I do too. Well that's why this podcast works. You know because I think you can't have the systems that are in place that are bullshitting people and then they're out on the streets talking to their friends and communicating
*  in a totally different way than they're seeing in the media. And they're like but what this doesn't represent me. Right. This is not how I think and feel. And my experiences with life and with particularly if they've had any psychedelic experiences. These aren't represented. Right. Why aren't they represented. When I know they're so common and I know they're so profound and I know they've meant so much to me and my friends. Why. Why. Why don't I see this. Right. So then they find things like this on the Internet and they go OK. This I'm not crazy. Right. There's other people out there.
*  So right. And then the other side of that would be the notion that we really have lost any sense of powerful authority structures. You know sort of cultural authorities that really can unite people or kind of help people understand the importance of common cause of some kind.
*  And you know that's again partly to bring it back to religion has to do with the conflicts around the church and Christianity especially in American politics that is being diminished.
*  I like to write about sort of the de-Christianization you know as the dominant sort of religious structure begins to erode and you begin to see again spiritual but not religious and other kinds of challenges that are coming from different communities or different kinds of spiritual experiences to you know the authority structures that are in society.
*  You know that is part of the context of all of this. Yeah. Where a lot of these battles are going on and people don't know where to turn or you know wondering where am I represented in all this. It's not coming from religion or the church and political leaders Republicans or Democrats.
*  So it all becomes self focused you know or all just about self promotion and self you know identity becomes the main you know force in our lives I think for too many people.
*  Yeah and hence the celebrity and then the chasing celebrity. Yeah right. This becomes the ultimate you know level of this stupid game we're all playing.
*  Right. Well again for me as someone who studies this I try not to be judgmental but I see again it's a religious system there's a religious culture at work and it's you know it's just as interesting and legitimate in my mind as Christianity.
*  I don't I wish there was a structure that was in place that mimic the positive aspects of church that didn't contain the dogmatic religious ideas that a lot of people find problematic.
*  You know like I think there's something great about the whole community aspect of church you know my friends that do go to church.
*  I have a lot of friends that are Christian that are really good people they're really good people like admirable people and I think one of the things that's very admirable about their pursuit of Christianity is this community reinforcing aspect of it.
*  Right. You know they get there together with the members of the community everybody's real friendly they know that they're going to sit there and they're going to submit to this experience and they're going to you know read the passages and they're going to hear the sermon and they're going to they're all going to be together they're going to dress nice they're going to behave well.
*  Right and they're going to feel good about the people that they live near and they're surrounded by and I think we're missing that there's so many people that I'm friends with that live in cities that don't know the person who lives in the apartment next door to them.
*  They've been there for 10 years and they they they don't know anybody in their building I have a buddy of mine who's telling me he lives in a building with a thousand people he doesn't know any of them that's crazy.
*  Well.
*  That's such a weird modern humans.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird way for humans to live and I think people feel particularly lost when they don't have a real sense of community and I could say as a stand up comedian one of the things that we all have in common particularly folks that we're working out of the comedy store was that there was a family aspect to it.
*  There was a real community there and we were very supportive of each other and embracing physically embracing like people see people that they was everybody hugs and so for a lot of these comics who are single.
*  Live alone maybe don't know their neighbors like that was the place where they could go to that was church.
*  Yeah right.
*  That's what I mean I think that's beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Right on because you could see in that community of comedians something sacred.
*  Yeah.
*  Something religious that's meaningful and that that is profound in some ways and as we said the community aspect but also you know helping people in terms of their own understanding self understanding.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's people turn to different kinds of communities you know and that's part of the modern world too that that community feeling sort of collective togetherness can can be found in a number of different settings and certainly the church and the congregation is one but.
*  Rock concerts or you know the comedy clubs.
*  Grateful Dead.
*  Grateful Dead.
*  I mean the Grateful Dead's whole thing was acid right.
*  Well.
*  Was music and acid.
*  We're going to turn to that next next week.
*  Oh are you.
*  Oh yeah.
*  We end the course with psychedelics and creativity.
*  Fish too right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's their deal too right.
*  It's a lot of people drop acid.
*  Yeah.
*  And listen to that sort of jam music and.
*  Well my friends who have done yes and certainly meaningful.
*  Yeah.
*  My friends who have gone to a lot of dead shows say you don't even really know the dead until you listen to them on acid.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Like it's music designed for acid.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's that's something you can find in other musical acts as well.
*  That connection.
*  I mean that's the thing about dimethyltryptamine and the Icaros.
*  Have you ever listened to South American Icaros.
*  Those when you hear those songs on psychedelics the images dance to those songs like they're there.
*  They work together like a hand in a glove perfectly.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I like I like that connection between music and drugs and religion.
*  So you can also look at the peyote church and listen to some of the music that comes from those ceremonies.
*  Yeah.
*  Very much a central part of the experience and how people absorb receive it and make sense of it.
*  I think we're way too comfortable with music.
*  We think of it as like no big deal.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what I do in my all my classes I bring in music.
*  So in the death class at the beginning of the semester I tell students I want you to be listening you know just in terms of the music that you listen to day to day if you can identify the theme of death.
*  And of course they when they hear that at first they think of nuts and way you know out of my mind and they soon realize it's everywhere.
*  Right.
*  And so I mean I know that aspect of my classes can really be powerful because again we don't we take music for granted but it's so central to our lives.
*  And again I think it can have more of an impact than just always in this fun to listen to.
*  Yeah.
*  Shape our consciousness and our communities.
*  And so so I do that in the sex sexuality class and we're doing it in the drugs class and it's great for students to be able to see that as data.
*  What do you open up with.
*  What song do you open up with when you.
*  For which one.
*  For death.
*  Oyster called.
*  Fear the Reaper.
*  They love it even though they've never heard of it.
*  They never heard of Blue Oyster called these fucking kids.
*  Yeah the kids today.
*  You're not here of that song.
*  I mean again their parents may have listened to it.
*  Sometimes I get that but oh man there's just a lot of things that can can play be played across different genres.
*  There's a few recordings that are still available of the Lakota is doing the ghost dance.
*  Yeah yeah and I've played that yeah and my I teach American religious history and then there too music is the main thread where we learn about religious communities.
*  That is one of the saddest songs in the history of the world because that that's these people that really are at the end.
*  I mean there's very few genocides.
*  There's I mean there's a few right.
*  But there's very few where there's almost nothing left of people that existed in in thriving numbers 300 years ago.
*  But in Native American communities it's common.
*  It's like the most common.
*  They like they're all gone.
*  Right in terms of like what the way they used to live versus now and that ghost dance was them trying to conjure up the spirit of the past and reignite their culture and bring back the old ways and get rid of the white settlers and get rid of the armies and get rid of all the people that have destroyed their way of life and disease and all the things that had happened to them literally over the course of their life from you know there's people
*  that were born in 1850 that were 50 years old at the turn of the 20th century that were like what the fuck happened when they were born.
*  They lived on the plains and life was as it had been for hundreds if not thousands of years.
*  And then all of a sudden it was gone.
*  And so this ghost dance was this attempt at reigniting their old culture.
*  It's it's it's so eerie and sad and it's it's it's so rare to have an actual recording of something.
*  Yeah.
*  That was an attempt to stop genocide.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And from that period too is really valuable valuable to have.
*  Again that's it's beyond data.
*  It's yeah you know this is about our memory and as you said it's very evocative.
*  Yeah.
*  When people listen to it and it does become an important remnant of that of that movement and that experience.
*  But yeah the music and those ceremonies are incredible.
*  Do you play that for your classes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No one the book I use there's a whole chapter on the ghost dance.
*  Oh all right.
*  You know James Mooney and really trying to dig into some of the historical forces that led to this as a potential revitalization form of religious revival that ends tragically.
*  You know as you say is something that disconnects people from their past in ways that are difficult to maintain and to keep hold.
*  And people are still suffering from the momentum of that disconnection today.
*  In 2020 there's massive amounts of strife and huge problems in Native American reservations because of that.
*  Still today.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's crazy.
*  And still you know as has been the case in Native American history incredible signs of resilience of innovation of you know new forms of community that have really.
*  They're getting back at us with the casinos.
*  Well I've heard that before.
*  It's not us.
*  I should say clearly I'm a child of immigrants.
*  Well I mean you know this is another development that's you know kind of ironic in some ways.
*  Now it is it is it's bizarre that they're getting wealthy off of this weird vice.
*  No well another addiction.
*  Yeah another is gambling.
*  Is it do you think.
*  Well you know we had a great class on addiction.
*  Have you ever been around gambling addicts.
*  Like really am I.
*  No I mean I've been around a bunch of.
*  Well it's a drug.
*  It's a drug.
*  That's what I'm wondering.
*  Oh my God.
*  I was going on in the brain too.
*  That's going to be you know where you're going to be seeing some some kinds of activities that you know will lead people to continue on in the behavior.
*  Yeah it's for sure a pattern that people fall into like my grandmother was addicted to playing the numbers.
*  I remember she was always losing and she was always like saying oh I was supposed to bet this one and I bet that one like that was the whole deal with my grandmother.
*  Italian grandmother in New Jersey you know and the numbers were obviously this mob run weird lottery thing for the neighborhood.
*  But it wasn't until I was in my 20s that I started playing pool that I was around real hardcore gambling addicts that would bet on raindrops running down a window.
*  They would bet on anything and everything and their life revolved on getting like getting bets and winning and losing.
*  It was it was their whole there was their juice for their life.
*  Was all gambling.
*  Oh right.
*  The life source or some something but also destructive in its way.
*  It was overbearing but it's hard to say it was distraught.
*  Well it was definitely destructive in terms of their financial stability.
*  They were always broke but boy they were they were engaged and they would call it action.
*  That's what they would call it like trying to get some action.
*  Like it was all about this thrill of possibly winning and possibly losing.
*  And you could say that people are doing that when they're playing the stock market they're just doing a nice slow version of it.
*  Or if you're gambling on sports you're certainly participating in it.
*  Right.
*  You know right.
*  And a lot of different kinds of addiction.
*  And people have I mean sure talking about religion I mean about drugs.
*  Well I think religion may be an addiction to in some in some ways but I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  And so do you.
*  For some people.
*  Yeah.
*  You just again life force life juice is what you got to keep giving yourself if you're going to make it.
*  But yeah I mean I'm curious to think about what what are the addictions in our society.
*  Right.
*  You know too much shopping or too much sex or drugs are the obvious one but we really stretch out that term to mean you know and apply to all kinds of different.
*  Or social media.
*  Well I think that's a brand new addiction.
*  Right.
*  That's that was in that Netflix documentary.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Tristan Harris was actually here a couple of weeks ago.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Talked about it and it's I mean it's I'm hoping that people recognize that that is not much different than all those other ones.
*  Whether it's gambling or masturbation or whatever it is that you're addicted to it's the same kind of pattern.
*  It's just this one is particularly compelling because it's with you all the time.
*  Right.
*  You know it's like gambling you have to have someone to gamble with.
*  So you have to go to the casino or there has to be some way that you could do that goddamn phone is with you 24 7.
*  No doubt.
*  Yeah.
*  Well it becomes all consuming as you say.
*  And yeah then yeah that can lead to all kinds of you know ruin.
*  We're finding a pattern in all this right.
*  It's it's in humans like humans have weird sort of pitfalls that we slip into.
*  We have weird weird behavior patterns that we can fall prey to.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean I think that's probably part of just the makeup of what it means to be human.
*  Yeah.
*  As we can get sidetracked and get so consumed by something that you lose sight of the rest of reality in some way.
*  And yeah I mean I see that in the things that I study for sure.
*  People obsessed about death or sexuality or drugs or anything or anything at all.
*  Yeah.
*  But but how you know we think about gambling and how that connects to sort of larger social issues and psychological kind of mental issues is important.
*  You know to make sure you're not just kind of compartmentalizing the behavior.
*  Yeah.
*  It's part of a you know there's part of a larger context and pattern that that's that are worth studying worth looking at.
*  How much of a benefit is there in explaining to people the way we fall into these patterns as much as there is exploring the patterns themselves.
*  Like we we have these weird sort of vulnerabilities that are built into our system because we're there's benefits to getting obsessed with certain things because those certain things can lead you to success as a hunter gatherer as a fisherman.
*  It's going to help feed your family if your brain can completely lock on to in this like tenacious way of succeeding at something.
*  Right.
*  If you're a hunter gatherer and you know your feet hurt you like well I give up.
*  I can't do this.
*  Obviously hunting is not for me.
*  You can starve to death if your children are going to cry.
*  It's going to be horrible.
*  Right.
*  So there's this built in thing but that could be hijacked by roulette.
*  Well which is so weird.
*  That thing of come on I got to get this I got to win I got to go.
*  That could be hijacked by games.
*  It could be hijacked by by many things that we find ourselves obsessed.
*  Right.
*  Hijacked or also motivated by other kinds of inner dynamics as well.
*  I mean whether you want to talk about Freud or some other primal instincts that are at work that depending on the individual and the particular social setting they're in.
*  You know family background can can lead to these you know all or nothing pursuits.
*  But psychedelics sort of illuminates that for you.
*  Psychedelics are one of the only things that I've ever found that goes hey stupid.
*  Look at what you're doing.
*  Look what that is.
*  Look what the cause of this is.
*  You're like oh yeah.
*  Like why didn't I notice that.
*  Why didn't I see that.
*  Well you don't see it until you the psychedelics sort of turn the light on for you.
*  Yeah right.
*  And when it does it's often the case that you don't need to go back.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like or at least I've read that people you know it's not addictive but also you know once twice you know you get you get it.
*  You certainly don't need to do it every day.
*  Right.
*  I mean if you want to have like I think people feel like a little refresher course every year or so it's not a bad thing to sort of get like oh yeah well yeah.
*  That's right.
*  I almost forgot.
*  Right.
*  You know recalibration kind of.
*  Yeah.
*  Resetting the system.
*  The way I've described really profound psychedelic experiences like pressing control alt delete for your brain and for people don't know what that means if you only use a Mac.
*  That's how you reboot a Windows computer when it crashes control alt delete your computer reboots and you have a fresh desktop with one folder and that folder is just labeled my old bullshit.
*  And then you have a choice.
*  The choice is do I open up my old bullshit start going through try to figure out life again through my old memories or do I try to form a new view and resist my old bullshit resist opening it up.
*  And that's where it gets tricky.
*  Because your ego will try to convince you like listen man have one cigarette it's not bad.
*  You know you know if I can relax buddy.
*  You know let's let's let's go play some bets.
*  Nothing wrong with that.
*  Look hey come on man.
*  Let's go do this.
*  Let's go do that.
*  And that makes you know you fall right back into the traps that you were avoiding.
*  Right.
*  Well the ego can be tricky in that way and leading you astray or making you think it's real.
*  Or making you feel comfortable with these old patterns.
*  Right.
*  Really familiar with even if those old patterns are failure.
*  Right.
*  Like a lot of people like fall off diets fall off the wagon with drinking.
*  They do it because they're comfortable with the feeling of failure and this the uncertainty of the unknown of the future with these new patterns that you're trying to establish.
*  It's very confusing.
*  It's very scary.
*  No doubt.
*  And it's religious.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that how you would describe it.
*  Yeah.
*  In a way.
*  Yeah.
*  For lack of a better term.
*  Yeah.
*  And what it does you know and just that that whole metaphor is like being born again or something like that.
*  And the shamanic journey you know you're not the same.
*  You come back and you've got something to teach you know and that's it's not just I would say not necessarily just for the consumer.
*  Yeah.
*  Psychedelic or whatever the substance is but it's it's also you know about connections I think and and sharing the knowledge.
*  Yeah.
*  Getting it out there.
*  What what are you teaching in your sexuality classes.
*  That's different than what people would normally expect.
*  Well one thing I try to do is be as a cross cultural as I can be.
*  So we look at sexuality and Hinduism in terms of Chinese religions in terms of African religions.
*  So I try to really for these students expand their minds as much as possible to see the varieties of ways in which people understand their sexuality.
*  And and and so now that's that's where I start the class.
*  How long you been teaching this for.
*  This class.
*  Yeah.
*  And so it's another one that's post tenure but it's probably been about seven or eight years.
*  How much.
*  This is a really important question.
*  As a professor what is it like pre tenure and post tenure because it seems to be a night and day difference in terms of freedom.
*  Right.
*  I overplay that a bit but everyone does this is not you.
*  Everyone.
*  I guess.
*  Yeah it's a strange whole organization you know and logic higher education.
*  I'm opposed to tenure.
*  I think it's bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think it protects intellectual freedom.
*  No anyway.
*  I mean I think there was a time in which we might make that argument but you know I don't know who else has tenure.
*  What other professions.
*  It's a good question.
*  It's just not insane.
*  Yeah it's like not the real world and.
*  So you think it's in some ways not good because then the almost like you the intellectual version of being born wealthy like you.
*  You're you're you have no worries and so you almost become spoiled.
*  Well OK.
*  Yeah.
*  No well yes absolutely.
*  I mean you know there there are arguments that after some faculty get tenure they shut down or they really aren't doing as much research anymore and there isn't that drive.
*  Right.
*  I mean it's a whole tiered system so you move you get tenure when you move from assistant to associate professor and then you know what you want to get to is full professor.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And again that's sort of that's just a different place in the hierarchy.
*  Yeah.
*  But again it's all the papers you write books you publish.
*  I mean yeah my humanities it's getting a couple of books out there.
*  But but yeah I mean I can't deny that I felt much freer after I got after I got tenure to explore topics that I would be more hesitant to explore.
*  Which topics in particular drugs.
*  Drugs for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  As again as a as a as a research area full full force you know going to go into it again because there's a legitimate purpose to a scholarly study of the connections between religion and drugs.
*  It's luckily I'm not the only one who was pursuing this but but it's it's I believe there are a lot of interesting connections that haven't been made especially in contemporary American society.
*  The other the other drug that I'm particularly interested in and seems to get a lot of responses.
*  I also include pharmaceuticals and prescription psychoactive drugs as a part of the drugs and religion connection.
*  And so looking at the pharmaceutical industry and pills as sort of religious objects and structures and cultures.
*  Really.
*  How so.
*  Well like anti anxiety medication.
*  Yeah I mean that is just a kind of you know it's ritualized so you put it you know you've got to make sure you know you take it and take it when you're supposed to take it you put faith in this little magic pill that is effective and can bring you to a better place.
*  It has importance in terms of community and who you are connected with and how the drug allows you to have certain kinds of community.
*  So a lot of this is obviously kind of a message you see the messages in pharmaceutical commercials which are for me dripping with kind of religious sentiments and sensibilities.
*  You can be saved.
*  You know where you saved you while you're saved with a pill.
*  So this is a subject in particular that like pre tenure would be you'd have to be walking on eggshells.
*  Again drugs more generally I would be I would I would not be necessarily going there but you know I mean I'm not sure.
*  Do other professors share your perspective on tenure that that's kind of nonsense.
*  Or bullshit I should say.
*  I would say yeah there are some but.
*  Most must enjoy it though.
*  I think most people would like to keep it and think it serves some function in terms of as you're saying sort of legitimacy of academic freedom.
*  Some people are internally motivated.
*  Some people are motivated just by whatever drives them whatever intellectual curiosity their their goals whatever it is it has nothing to do with financial stability or job stability.
*  But not not not most.
*  Yeah most people if you give them 100 percent job security they're going to get fat.
*  Yeah I'm afraid I.
*  I would agree.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's weird.
*  And you're right.
*  Some people are just you know just motivated.
*  They want to succeed and pursue their interests sort of no matter what.
*  And and there are certainly a number of scholars who are like that.
*  Sure they're make their way to the top.
*  The path is what interests them.
*  Right.
*  The the the destination is not real.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's exactly right.
*  And you know but as I sort of joked earlier I joke that I know this is called a work and I don't feel I really work.
*  Right.
*  I have a great great job.
*  I just I love what I do.
*  Well you nailed it right.
*  You figured out what actually interests you.
*  And for some people that what you do would be work but not for you.
*  Well right.
*  Exactly.
*  Again I'm very fortunate especially being at Emory.
*  So it's a it's a different kind of professional life.
*  And I know it's just I've been really fortunate and it wasn't planned.
*  You know I was a fuck up and as I write about in this new book you know I don't think about death which is a memoir on mortality.
*  I was directionless and just fucking around at high school and getting high and taking all kinds of drugs.
*  How dare you.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you believe that.
*  In the San Fernando Valley.
*  That's weird.
*  You were doing that in the San Fernando Valley.
*  No one does that.
*  Nobody.
*  No.
*  You must have been a rebel.
*  Oh yeah right.
*  Conformity.
*  But oh my God.
*  What part of the valley did you live in.
*  Van Nuys.
*  Oh OK.
*  Our old studio was in Woodland Hills.
*  Right.
*  And one of your guys grew up in the valley so I got to talk to him.
*  Yeah.
*  It was fun.
*  I used to work out in Van Nuys.
*  It's where Benny the Jets Jet Center was.
*  Oh yeah right right.
*  You know where that was.
*  Funny.
*  World famous kickboxing gym.
*  Oh yeah.
*  One of the first places I came to when I came to California.
*  Couldn't wait to go to the Jet Center.
*  Because you had heard about it.
*  Oh my God it was legendary.
*  Benny Arquitas is like a legendary kickboxer in the early days of kickboxing and he came out of Los Angeles.
*  Yeah it's so funny how many people come out of San Fernando Valley or connected.
*  I mean but yeah that's I guess not that funny.
*  Well a lot of people out there.
*  Yeah.
*  Well but in any case I was I was on a different path and luckily came around.
*  Yeah for sure.
*  So what what led you out of the fog of adolescent craziness and fuck upery.
*  A woman.
*  Ah a beautiful story.
*  No my my current wife.
*  Liz really helped to bring me into another direction although you know not I wouldn't say.
*  Only her.
*  But you know it was just all of a sudden I started really liking to learn.
*  And I went to dropped out of college a couple of times and meeting her settling down all of a sudden.
*  Thinking more critically and more kind of more deeply and taking classes more seriously.
*  So I moved from usually sitting in the back of the room to you know the front.
*  As I became a junior and senior in college.
*  So it was essentially just a natural course of progression.
*  You just became naturally more interested in things naturally more curious naturally more dedicated to learning.
*  Absolutely.
*  But but for some strange reason I was back then very interested in death.
*  So that was the subject as I was doing my undergraduate work you know.
*  Why death.
*  Well that that's the memoir.
*  I have no idea but.
*  I'll say the memoir starts with me as a young kid maybe eight or nine.
*  And waking up in the middle of the night with all this commotion in our house the small San Fernando Valley house.
*  Three bedrooms in one bath.
*  And then looking down the hallway and seeing you know what seemed to be like 50 firemen.
*  But there couldn't have been 50 firemen.
*  So I'm sure there were only a few.
*  Who were rushing into our bathroom where my grandfather was.
*  And when he was going into the bath he had a heart attack and died.
*  And I kind of witnessed that.
*  And they took him out of the bathroom and that was that.
*  But what really.
*  The what's really vivid.
*  As a memory associated with this.
*  Was after the death of the family rabbi.
*  Came to our house.
*  And I just remember.
*  Very vividly being in the backyard with him.
*  And he asked me.
*  Do you know what the meaning of death is.
*  Like again eight or nine like.
*  I have no idea.
*  And you know he must have said some things but the thing that really stood out and is the title of the book is.
*  Him saying don't think about death.
*  Just think about the living.
*  And trying to help your father cope.
*  With his grief.
*  And you know I mean when people ask you know when did you start how did you get onto the topic of death.
*  This early memory seems to stand out and I utterly failed in the rabbi's advice.
*  And I think at that point really started thinking a lot about death.
*  Well I don't know if the rabbi's advice was so good.
*  Well I don't think anybody should ever tell you don't think about anything.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean don't think about.
*  The elephant in the room.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't think about the elephant.
*  I just don't think it's ever good advice.
*  Well I've.
*  Come around.
*  Yeah.
*  Again I had a lovely rabbi.
*  Lovely.
*  Experience in the temple even though after my bar mitzvah.
*  I never looked back.
*  How old were you when your grandfather died.
*  I was about eight.
*  Yeah well that's something you would say to an eight year old.
*  But again it's just it's not how people.
*  How people's brains work.
*  Well and it's not.
*  You know being fair to the to the reality where we're all going to have to.
*  For sure my death is just integrated in a part of life and I think thinking about it and.
*  Trying to figure it out is is valuable.
*  I think ultimately we've been given a bunch of crude tools to deal with an insanely complex issue.
*  This finite life form that we find ourselves inhabiting our consciousness is trapped in this finite thing.
*  And we've been given these very crude tools for navigating.
*  Right.
*  And for coping and for just just the way we interact with each other about these these very complex subjects we've get be very simplistic very.
*  Just empty phrases that don't provide any real comfort.
*  Right.
*  And that right and that are in some sense traditions they're handed down sort of as part of the lore on how you're supposed to deal with death.
*  Yeah.
*  But for me and what was clear as I was studying more and more in terms of what you were saying is that that is what religion is all about.
*  You know I think religion is very much a response to death.
*  Yeah.
*  You know and religious life is sort of required if you're going to be human to deal with death.
*  Now what are the sources that give you the right tools.
*  Again traditional religion has been the primary resource you know for people.
*  And that's fading.
*  And now people are have all kinds of ideas about death and what happens after death.
*  And again don't necessarily follow the so-called or traditional authorities.
*  Yeah.
*  Who want to teach us about death.
*  I had Richard Dawkins on the podcast once.
*  There was a real weird moment where we were talking about death and he was saying that he thinks that when it's over there's nothing.
*  And then he sort of like semi aggressively said you don't think that.
*  Like what do you think.
*  I'm like I don't know.
*  I'm like I don't know but I know that I've tripped balls and you have it.
*  You're the one who's scared to do an acid.
*  You've already had strokes and stuff buddy.
*  Like when are you going to when are you going to dive into the pool.
*  Right.
*  And I think he's brilliant.
*  And I've loved a lot of his takes on religion.
*  And I think in many ways he's been aggressive because of the pushback of you know his perspective as an atheist.
*  But I think that I think people that have had profound psychedelic experiences are not that they're not that confident because you didn't know that that could exist until you had it.
*  And then once you've had it you're like wow what this is all about.
*  I think anybody who says I know what this is all about when you die it's blank it's dark and that's it.
*  You shut off and it's over.
*  I'm like maybe.
*  Or maybe you come with me and I'll take you to a place and we're going to do some stuff and you're going to meet all kinds of gods.
*  Right.
*  And it doesn't last that long.
*  Like you got a couple hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Like we could we could change everything for you in a couple hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  It'll completely disrupt and challenge all of your assumptions that you also evaporate them.
*  Well I think that you know that's what gets me in trouble more than anything.
*  Why is it gets you in trouble.
*  Well I mean when when when we talk about atheism because I take this approach again much more to be provocative that there are no atheists.
*  We're all religious.
*  Again if you're if if you're willing to entertain my very broad understanding of religion and religious life then I would say yeah.
*  OK so that's a very broad because we're not talking about what you're talking about religion in terms of like taking Xanax.
*  You're not talking about a higher power really.
*  You're not talking about faith in a grand creator that has had some master plan for every single living thing and they're all interconnected and the entire universe is all part of his master project.
*  That's well I don't think you need the creator to be religious.
*  Right.
*  Or some divine power.
*  I mean what do you need.
*  Well you need some access to transcendence.
*  You need some way of understanding your own self and identity.
*  You need to have a system of values that will guide you through your life.
*  Yeah.
*  A way of being you need to have community in some form.
*  So you know I'm I'm more anthropological than theological is one way you might put it.
*  So if you're talking about religion in Native American cultures where you know and no doubt no and there's no word for religion in any of those languages.
*  So when you think about well what's religion pre-Columbian you know native cultures.
*  Well it's what they do with the crops.
*  You know it's you know how they set up their sort of ritual ceremonies.
*  It is their relationship to the weather.
*  You know it's all kinds of things and where it's not necessarily a higher power.
*  But you know it is about seeing that there's more than just materialism.
*  Yeah.
*  Is the problem the word because the word religion like we have like a very narrow definition for it fits into our society and our culture like religion.
*  Oh yeah I know what that is.
*  That's you're a Buddhist you're a Muslim you're a Christian you're.
*  That's religion.
*  Dude you got to take my class.
*  Oh maybe you should come.
*  I'm not the type I want to zoom in.
*  Can I zoom in for a guest lecture.
*  That would be so.
*  What am I going to say.
*  Well come in on the psychedelics we do it this week.
*  But but yeah no I mean I mean again I just I think that the word sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  The religion as I like to say is an invention.
*  It's a word that we have invented to label a lot of different kinds of behaviors.
*  It's a very clunky word in a lot of ways.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's just like you say oh he's religious like oh got it you know.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  All of a sudden you think you know.
*  You know there was a guy that we've made fun of a bunch on the show who was a pastor to a lot of famous people he was like the hip young pastor.
*  We just got busted.
*  Yeah he just got busted.
*  Banging some chick.
*  Yeah.
*  And we made fun of him because I'm like look these guys there's no way this guy's religious.
*  This is what I was saying because he was wearing these shorts that showed what I called his dick root.
*  Like he wears these shorts that go way low which you just don't wear your shorts like that unless you want someone to think about your penis.
*  Right.
*  That's that's why you wear your shorts like that.
*  Or maybe in the 70s it would be.
*  But I mean there's no reason to.
*  Guys who wear their shorts that low.
*  They're they're they're being overtly sexual to people.
*  They don't even necessarily know.
*  Right.
*  You're trying to and you want everyone to look at your chiseled body.
*  You know like this is none of the there's a reason why monks dress in these like very modest clothes that cover everything.
*  They don't even want to think about their body.
*  And that is a part of the religion of both celebrity and social media.
*  Right.
*  That this guy has got these traditional Christian ideas fused in with the religion of celebrity in with the religion of social media.
*  And then you're seeing that it doesn't really work because you know like what's the reward for those that those behaviors.
*  The reward is he wants to fuck like that.
*  Once people know that's that guy wants people to lust after him.
*  And it wound up sabotaging him.
*  Ultimately.
*  Absolutely.
*  I think.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a now a morality story of some kind.
*  Yes.
*  Sale.
*  Yes.
*  You know this is a kind of.
*  Celebrity fame.
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of pursuing.
*  A trap goes wrong.
*  It's a trap because if you achieve what what do you what if you're you're lusting after this this attention and the sexual praise and you want people to lust after you.
*  You also want them to think of you as being someone who is more enlightened than everyone else which is why you're willing to stand in front of them and give these emotional profound sermons in the first place that resonates with all these lost young people.
*  Right.
*  Well right.
*  And historically there's a lot of overlap between sort of celebrity and religious preaching.
*  Billy Sunday or.
*  Sure.
*  You know others that you know that the religious leader becomes a celebrity and those lines get blurred and it all becomes entertainment which.
*  Yeah.
*  For celebrities there's a need for that because they feel very lost and disconnected because they've achieved the thing that they've always desired and they still feel lost.
*  Like everyone's looks at certain celebrities and go oh my God you've made it.
*  Your life must be heaven and they're depressed and all fucked up and we don't have any sympathy for them.
*  There's no one's going to be sympathy sympathetic to Justin Bieber with fucking 300 million dollars in the bank and having sex with anybody who wants to like.
*  Fuck you for being depressed you little piece of shit.
*  Been famous your whole life but for him it's probably very confusing because first of all particularly like the really young people who became famous while they were young.
*  Like I had Miley Cyrus on who I think is incredibly talented brilliant brilliantly talented her voice is fantastic.
*  I mean so soulful but she got famous when she was 12.
*  I have a 12 year old man I can't even imagine I can't imagine being the boss and filling arenas when you're 12.
*  It's madness and no one survives it.
*  They don't I mean maybe a few have gotten through it and they're sane but most of them don't.
*  And that's where celebrity preachers come in or someone can harness your your celebrity and it boosts them up and they can also provide you maybe even maybe if it's disingenuous but some sort of a structure.
*  That makes you feel like there's more that you that you can you can cling to something that's going to make sense of this all and that something is Jesus or Mohammed or whatever it is whatever it is that you you cling to whatever structure that you cling to.
*  Buddha whatever it is right and they can and that can be exploited especially in those situations I think because of what you're saying.
*  Gap or absence you know oh God I got here.
*  And you know is this all there is I think with the children in particular because it's not oh God I got there it's I've never been normal.
*  Well that especially it's like having cement but you've never added water like it's never there's something missing.
*  You didn't grow up right.
*  And many of them don't they don't survive you don't survive and then you know obviously drugs can be one way to it's the most common way to to deal yeah you know try to try to deal yeah.
*  I'm I'm well aware of a lot of people in the whole Hollywood show business world that grew up famous and almost none of them survive.
*  Yeah Rob Lowe did though Rob Lowe got famous really on he's super normal he might be like one of the only ones I've ever met and I've hung out with him right and I've hung out also more importantly with him and his son who's also really normal really well adjusted to but he also got clean and sober.
*  Right early on right right right yeah so yeah I mean he made it he made it but it's also very few it's also very beautiful yeah it's probably easy to be Rob Lowe right.
*  And he's got to be what he's 40 30 no he's older than that he believes me I'm 53 I believe Rob's 55 yeah okay well anyway there you go he's one of the few that got famous very young and has navigated through with grace.
*  But I think the ones that are children that grow up child stars the you know the ones on the Mickey Mouse show and that kind of shit yeah good luck no I mean that's so they find the celebrity preachers this is often what happens they find gurus.
*  They find celebrity preachers right right yeah someone tries to make sense of things so do we look for to put our faith in you know and that's there there too is a pretty common universal.
*  aspect of human life is in the product I have something to believe in those poor gurus they fall into the trap too because now they can leech off the success of these famous people become famous themselves right and maybe they haven't really.
*  immunized themselves and not related themselves to the power of celebrity sure it's a very intoxicating drug like you got to understand how to how to avoid it right and avoid the pitfalls of it it's not easy yeah well again that's.
*  That's the life that everyone wants I mean that's that that's part of the pressure I assume for a lot of people yeah you know the American public the global audiences.
*  can be transfixed on on on you and also you know want what you have, but I think we can really learn from those those preachers those preachers that only go after the like really like not not only go after but attract celebrities.
*  Like there's something to that weird sort of parasitic genre of you know of preacher right no I agree, I think it's right for study yeah there's been any kind of it should well i'm certainly I mean maybe sure.
*  Well i'm sticking with drugs man for now i don't want to go well celebrities a drug intoxication yeah this is yeah sort of.
*  What we're after in some form celebrity I think there's a drug in so there's several drugs that are mixed together and sort of a concoction there's a drug of celebrity which you know for sure is a drug and then there's also a drug and being the person who has the answers.
*  Definitely and there's something that people do when they convince other people that they have the answers that it elevates their mood and their perspective there's like some weird guru drug yeah so there's the guru drug and then there's a celebrity drug.
*  Where we're identifying a whole nexus of with that guy was the sex drugs he's a beautiful man he's a handsome tall ripped now shredded preacher guy right right right a lot of drugs going on there well and I wonder how extensive it all was.
*  Extensive well in terms of his you know whatever kinds of activities he was engaged in the got him in all this trouble.
*  And I think with people like this is where it's i'm going to give a simplistic perspective I think he could have benefited from real drugs.
*  So I think a person who's involved in those three weird drugs could have been they've really really could have benefited from psychedelics because psychedelics would have let you say hey hey hey.
*  Do you see what you're doing because I see what you're doing right the psychedelics would have said I know what you're doing you're pretending you're pretending to be profound you're pretending to be pious you're pretending to be enlightened you're pretending to be above it all but you're not.
*  yeah yeah yeah you're just one of us right and that can be pretty pretty destabilizing you know for someone like that but also transformative that's where there's real benefit in those destabilizing I think so too well I tell people I like getting paranoid from pot it's one of my favorite parts.
*  Because when it's over I feel good it's like a near death experience that you always survive didn't happen you're okay but also there's a lesson in it that fear comes with a lesson and that that insecurity comes with a lesson and I think part of the lesson is.
*  Appreciate the moment of life appreciate life appreciate this right you know and when you're all fucked up on on pot and you're like oh everything's crazy like when it's over you can like right you relax and you can appreciate things in a different way right well and that's.
*  Having that new awareness is yeah you know is can be rejuvenating it's also a hypersensitivity right yeah you mean of the appreciation yeah or you know how things are or you know what is the sense of security of some kind the paranoia itself is a hypersensitivity of the reality of your finite existence.
*  Back to death yeah because that's that's really we we were living life like it I mean this is right the here's another religion right the religion of materialism yes it's the most ridiculous one and this is like the Bible telling you not to worship false idols like part of that is this worship of a thing.
*  Of a of a of an object of of things that you're trying to acquire they're difficult to acquire but then once you get them you just want to acquire the next one right well that's there's no object consumerism right there's no object or we like if I just get this one purse I'm going to be all settled in it's going to be I'm going to feel so good I'm going to be calm and normal right nope.
*  Need more yeah well yeah I'm you know there too as a scholar not judgmental you know materialism is a religion and it's you know it's got some heft and validity in terms of how people orient themselves in the world.
*  But again isn't it sort of hijacking the same sort of human reward systems in that it's difficult to acquire like say if you want a Mercedes like a new Mercedes coupe but they're hard to get you got to have a lot of money to get one of them AMG Mercedes coupes those are beautiful and engineered they come from Germany and they sound great and.
*  God you have to have a lot of money to get that so you got to you have it's hard you see when drive down the street that guy got one where to get it right right how did he get that I want to be like I want to be that guy.
*  That's where you can get philosophical and and that's highlighted by social media as well right because people will pose in front of their beautiful Mercedes with their gold watch like look at me right look at me balling out of control over here that's yeah don't you wish you were like me.
*  Yeah you know they have yeah projection yeah it's all image and it's really responsible for a lot of depression too exactly yeah no absolutely that's what that's what they're finding you know in terms of how people more engaged and immersed in their social media lose themselves.
*  Especially young.
*  I think they find them you know they think they're going to be able to find themselves or at least you know kind of attempt to project a certain image of the self that they would like yeah right and that's you know that's just living by that I think is.
*  Is.
*  Debilitating in terms of person sense of ego confidence who they are you know in real life do you think that there's.
*  A religion or not not a religion but a framework or a structure that maybe someone could develop in order to successfully like.
*  Classes in the pitfalls of all these things that we're talking about materialism social media that there's maybe a religion that can be developed to deal with the modern time.
*  The modern times pitfalls of the problems and trials and tribulations that we're dealing with today they're not worse than famine I mean I'm in the middle of.
*  How do you say his name Noah you've all her daddy how do you say his name you know the guy who wrote sapiens.
*  You've all know a harari harari homo Deus is this book that I'm in the middle of now and.
*  It's.
*  Stunning he starts the book off with all of these examples of famine plague and famine where the person the vast majority of cultures have experienced one of those two things plague or famine or both plague and famine throughout history and it's talking about.
*  How many decades they went on where people starved to death and how many how many times in history people lost 30% of the population 20% of the population to starvation.
*  I mean it's madness the things that people had to deal with today so in terms of like what we have to our trials and tribulations our biology survives far easier today.
*  But maybe our consciousness is just as vulnerable now as it's ever been before if not more right, but the problems aren't as big, but we think they are because of the only problems we know right right.
*  Well, and consciousness is just trying to you know understand its surrounding and.
*  And the surroundings are pretty complex you know it's not just a matter of food for survival or something or shelter.
*  The weird problems yeah it's the yeah it's you know what we think are real problems, but are.
*  Inconveniences or some difficulties and some obviously lots of serious problems, but I mean I think you know.
*  We don't have the tools, the intellectual religious spiritual mental tools and in terms of dealing with all of all of these.
*  So called problems that surround us.
*  You know what yeah please well I was just thinking about you know when the middle of this pandemic and whatever getting close to 300,000 dead.
*  And that has the feel I mean you know of some kind of mass death event as well and.
*  How how that will affect our consciousness as the deaths continue will be interesting.
*  Have more people died from cigarettes during this pandemic than have died from coven.
*  That I don't know well don't like a half million people die every year from cigarettes and aren't we at about eight months in.
*  We're about eight months in yeah so wouldn't that mean we're probably neck and neck with cigarettes.
*  Well, well, I mean there are a lot of different causes of death, you know you can point to this seems to be again above a of a different kind of order.
*  For certainly because it's non voluntary right right it's not of your own decision to smoke something that's right clearly labeled a carcinogen right and it's mysterious yeah we're not sure what the right is.
*  But again i'm you know in terms of going off what you were saying I i'm just sort of wondering how consciousness our collective consciousness is going to be.
*  You know dealing with our ideas about death.
*  And sort of questions around social you know social responses in the face of this kind of event.
*  yeah well we this is a an issue that we haven't overcome before it's a new thing it's novel one of the weird things about people is that it doesn't help to tell people.
*  That well compared to other times and other generations, we have it easy because as hard as you have.
*  It today, the worst that happens to you today is still the worst that happens to you and it's all that we understand right.
*  We don't really understand like i'm telling people about famine like when I was explaining the horary book.
*  No one does that's not going no one is going oh my God now I get it now i'm going to not think about social media and i'm going to be happy that I can just go to in and out and get a burger.
*  They're not going to think that way no one does not that has worked on zero people from me saying that to these people hearing it, no one has had a light bulb go off like.
*  Of course there's no famine now I feel much better right thank you no it doesn't work that way it doesn't work people only understand what's the worst thing to happen to them right.
*  That's why spoiled people scream and yell over nothing like oh my God you're so spoiled but.
*  we're looking at the wrong way that's just the worst thing that's ever happened to them right.
*  You know and that's what the only thing they know and yes, how do you break people out of that very insular understanding of.
*  The difficulties of life and that you have children yeah.
*  You know what it's like when kids are young and they think it's the end of the world like one of my daughters is 10 the other one's 12 the 12 year old eight a couple of pieces of the 10 year old's Halloween candy.
*  And oh my God was there chaos in my house yesterday chaos and screaming my 10 year old she doesn't take any bullshit she gets mad and she starts screaming i'm like Jesus Christ it's candy it's just this is not you and it takes a while and I don't think they really.
*  Ever understand how good they have it it's it's hard for people if that's the worst thing that's happening.
*  They think it's the worst thing they think it's like a real bad thing right the perspective is so difficult to achieve like to achieve like and like to lift above and look at it from.
*  yeah yeah exactly and a parent isn't necessarily going to help barely I mean barely maybe in the long run that can that can turn out but.
*  Talk to them and then let them blow off steam but that's.
*  Look that's kids yeah and as I was saying you know when they start transitioning into adulthood.
*  that's when things really come to the fore and start thinking about who they are and how how they are.
*  yeah and you know the difficulties get greater and weirder and and then with time those seem minuscule like I remember when I was 18 my girlfriend broke up with me I thought it was the end of the world I couldn't believe it oh my God I've never been so sad so depressed.
*  You know and then, like a couple years later, my thank God she's so crazy like what was I thinking like.
*  Right was I was in the middle of this terrible relationship and I don't even understand it right well and it sort of goes back to something you said earlier about you know how we don't know how to deal with.
*  Our own struggles are difficult yes you know we just can't we hit the other side right and even then you know it's.
*  Where do you turn for community or for sort of buffering yeah support and.
*  And that's I think hard for I think, especially a lot of younger people yeah and people coming of age into adulthood well that's why I try to preach the religion of physical struggle, because I think the one thing that's helped me through.
*  All sorts of things is to make my physical workouts so much more difficult than anything else I'll have to deal with in my life okay so.
*  it's so hard to do and so fucking exhausting and and I don't want to do it and then when it's over other things are just like whatever yeah because.
*  I make my own bullshit is basically what I do right to in order to not get spoiled by life and I think there's some there's a real.
*  there's a real lesson to learn and then i've learned it from other people it's not like something I figured out on my own, but I pieced it together in a way that works for me.
*  And they think that, whether it's yoga or even mental things, whether it's playing chess or meditation or something more difficult than regular difficulties right.
*  Right, I was going to follow up, you said, you know talked about the you know the religion of the exercise working out and for me, I would say my religion is learning you know and knowledge and just trying you know to.
*  intellectually kind of absorb as much as I can and that's.
*  that's not like working out, but it is more on the mental stuff that you're talking about where it's.
*  But it's even the darkest.
*  of times, you know it's just i've got to sort of go back to the books and try to try to learn as much as I can on whatever topic we're talking about.
*  But again it's a it's you're doing something difficult and I think like there's a there was a study they did on chess players.
*  And they were trying to figure out why chess players lose so much weight during these big tournaments and they realize that they're burning thousands and thousands of calories a day playing chess at a very high level right.
*  And like these guys would lose tremendous amount of weight yeah I think.
*  I wonder how that works.
*  yeah a crazy number of calories I forget what the exact number was maybe Jamie can find the study, but they were trying to figure out.
*  What was happening to these chess players and then they realized like oh when they're playing at this incredible high level world championship caliber.
*  there their brains are flying here 6000 calories how Robert so Polsky who's brilliant so you just sit in there, but you're not your brain is firing up at a million fucking rpms.
*  Robert so Polsky who I love who studies stress and primates at Stanford says a chess player can burn up to 6000 calories a day while playing in a tournament three times what an average person consumes in a day that's amazing that's amazing that's amazing yeah but it makes sense.
*  Right when the brain is going on when you're thinking when yeah when you're so focused well they're playing.
*  And multiple levels they're playing several different games right because they're not just playing what's in front of them they're playing right if I do this he does that so, but if I do this he does this if I do that this happens then that happens then this happens or that happens if that happens this happens and so they're their brains gone.
*  And then yeah yeah and there are.
*  Consequences in yeah and how the body is functioning well that's a weird thing about doing podcasts is like sometimes at the end of the day i'm fucking exhausted i'm like i haven't done anything just been sitting talking so goddamn easy look what's wrong with me it's coal miners out there busting their ass working really hard.
*  That's that's what I always remind myself to sit and teaching or reading a book and working.
*  But I think these intellectual pursuit pursuits yeah I think there's more struggle than we think.
*  Yeah I mean i'm not gonna argue has to be otherwise everybody would do it.
*  I think there are lots of factors in terms of why people go on into graduate school and continue in the life of learning.
*  Yeah, but it's it's a it's a weird feeling like that joke joked but also been serious that that's my religion.
*  What religion are you well.
*  Learning you know that's where I get my religious meaning.
*  Is it feels like teaching sexuality over the last 10 years would have gotten increasingly more minefield like.
*  Definitely.
*  Definitely yeah and a lot of topics have I would say over the last 10 years sexuality for sure.
*  But I do I mean I get off getting into the topic and especially in this kind of with this kind of purpose you know how can I how can I blow students minds.
*  Around the topic and.
*  And I'm you know you have to be fully aware of the various sensitivities that might be out there with students and i'm.
*  I always I mean it's it's just you know i'm going to be covering some very touchy topics and if you aren't able to deal with that you shouldn't be in the class.
*  Like what seems to be the most touchy.
*  Or what's an example of a particularly touchy subject.
*  Well in the death for the for sure the death class would be suicide.
*  That's just one that I have really tiptoed around until recently.
*  Tiptoed also tiptoe because I don't want to talk about suicide that's really yeah it's kind of weird but i've had this version to having that really be a topic in my class until until recently and that's.
*  I think that had a lot to do with a feeling of i'm not fully.
*  prepared or trained.
*  To deal with students who were really struggling with suicide and I would feel that would open that up.
*  So but i've changed in the last couple years it's like you know there are too many suicides and numbers have gone up and you know I mean i'm I think it's an important topic.
*  That's one thing that's ramped up in a huge way during this pandemic.
*  I just read that.
*  yeah and it's an under reported.
*  So yeah.
*  I have a buddy that was talking to a sheriff in la and he was saying that they used to get you know one suicide a week and now they're often dealing with five a day.
*  That's crazy.
*  it's crazy.
*  I mean yeah something.
*  And it's not something that people point to as being a side effect of of the pandemic the media is not going to be a side effect of the pandemic.
*  I mean they maybe give it a cursory right sort of they talk about it very, very rarely but it's I think it's a huge issue right right.
*  despair and also this feeling that a lot of people have there's no way out of this.
*  I think that's getting you know.
*  financially losing their businesses losing their homes losing their their ability to feed themselves.
*  Yeah no I mean this is unprecedented for so many people.
*  Yeah.
*  Where they find the strength you know to carry on and deal with it is not so easy.
*  So how did you prepare differently for a subject that you've had such a difficulty in describing and teaching before with suicide.
*  What do you mean.
*  When you decided to start talking about it.
*  How much time did you spend sitting down by yourself thinking OK how do I do this.
*  Quite a bit of time I think with that topic and really trying to again I want to position myself so I'm not the school counselor and I'm not the rabbi or the preacher and I'm not the parent.
*  So you know it's carving out this intellectual space of you know what is the history of suicide.
*  What are the you know kind of.
*  motivating factors and forces and patterns of suicide and so on and then I really try to bring in popular culture you know songs that are express ideas about suicide or thinking about.
*  Express ideas about suicide or thinking about suicides of celebrities.
*  So you know I try to.
*  Find a way to put those pieces together and a good way that's intellectually stimulating that doesn't just kind of work on.
*  The psychological level.
*  You can think about that as a distinction.
*  The psychological level.
*  Yes, it means so many different reasons.
*  Right.
*  Yeah I mean I mean it's silly as it sounds I mean my my goal is to sort of depersonalize I try to keep personal.
*  Experiences and feelings out of the class that doesn't sound silly at all.
*  Now it's hard to do, obviously, and it's they do creep in and find expression, but still it's with these topics that's that's the game plan.
*  yeah um.
*  How long have you been doing the suicide discussions.
*  Well, it's really past few years as i've seen these and as i've heard from students who.
*  I mean this is really a key reason.
*  It's just the number of students who came into my office telling me about.
*  Someone they knew committed suicide.
*  I mean it was just again like three or four years ago when I would have more and more students.
*  Just talking about it and again the death class opens up that space where I can they can feel they can come in and and and want to talk about it.
*  And and want to talk about it.
*  Were you worried about not doing it justice were you worried about pushback like what what what was the fear of not discussing this previously.
*  That there were students who might be suicidal.
*  And then you might somehow or another trigger it wow.
*  Well, I mean again it may be an overblown fear but.
*  So responsible fear it's thank you being very responsible thinking that way.
*  It's just you know for so long I just I knew it was a topic I intentionally kind of go there and.
*  But but as I said it's changed just because the dynamics have changed with I think young people in suicide.
*  Yeah.
*  How has that evolved over the few years that you've been teaching it.
*  I think I've grown more comfortable with it most mostly as a important element of the class and I can see students being willing to engage in the topic I think in ways.
*  That I imagine would not have been.
*  Similar earlier.
*  I just.
*  I like to.
*  Go after the taboo topics where I know kind of students.
*  Are already considering and reflecting on them even though they don't have an outlet for really.
*  Intellectual kind of consideration really.
*  Intellectual kind of consideration really.
*  Removing themselves from whatever they you know personally think about suicide or homosexuality or whatever.
*  And allow them to kind of get learn history learn about different cultures and then you know and I try to provoke them as much as I can to get them to get them to really.
*  Think outside the box but also to sort of dig in to to their own abilities to figure some things out.
*  When you're teaching a subject like the first day when you've been thinking about doing it for so long but not want to trigger people the first day you did it that had to be a very unique kind of class for you.
*  Well, it was I mean I think just the hesitancy from before and then bringing it up like this class has two to 300 students so it's it's not like me and 12 people right you know it's a very part of that setting.
*  forces me to kind of think about what.
*  forces me to think about delivery you know because it's not going to be so interactive and so that you know when I really went in to the class with that topic I felt.
*  Like I was able to really convey the points I wanted to get across and get them to which is the most important thing, even in a class that size is to feel like they could chill and kind of relax and talk about the topic without feeling you know pressures from anyone or feeling anything's taboo and can't be said.
*  Do you get questions from students during during your lectures on this.
*  Well, generally yeah I mean you open it up to absolutely what's a common question that they have when it comes to suicide.
*  Absolutely what what's a common question that they have when it comes to suicide.
*  I don't know there aren't a lot of common questions, I think you know.
*  Students have asked a variety of different things that.
*  Often have to do with.
*  What does Christianity say about suicide.
*  What does you know what do the religion say about suicide.
*  Guess what i'm getting at is do they turn to you for help.
*  No, what can I do what should someone do if someone knows a friend who's suicidal.
*  I give them the resources where people who were trained can really help them with those kinds of more practical intimate concerns.
*  I you know I play the role of.
*  You know professor who who doesn't want to get personal doesn't want to hear about personal experience, whether it's about drugs or grieving or you know sexual experiences.
*  Yeah, the sexual experience when you were saying also that you have to be very sensitive to the feelings of the people in your class or students like how do you like what what are the particularly difficult.
*  Difficult subjects to explore.
*  When it comes to.
*  Well, like sexuality in popular culture and music where you know all kinds of graphic.
*  Language is used like that wap so yeah you teach that.
*  You should teach that well maybe i'm teaching this class on the fall.
*  That song and teach it.
*  Hey I go I try to go there, but again it's some students are like you know going to be.
*  That's insulting or this is terrible or you know I mean again it's data it's it's right but it's data data yeah you know if you want to take the study of religion seriously.
*  You're going to be encountering things that make you uncomfortable.
*  Yes, and if you're going to discuss sexuality if you're particularly prudish or you have a very difficult time discussing this the way various people go about it right yeah I mean or the varieties of whether we're talking about polygamy.
*  Whatever you know it's it's out there and you know all kinds of things.
*  Well there's other than religion that's probably the most charged subject that you could discuss with people today.
*  People have some really steadfast ideas about what's right and what's wrong and when it comes to sexuality it seems like at least one place where we're gaining.
*  Or we're showing some evolution or showing progress is with the acceptance of homosexuality homosexuality seems to be way less taboo now than any other time in my life like.
*  Now people are becoming much more comfortable with it there's any.
*  Like universally in this country at least there's.
*  Very little resistance to gay marriage very little resistance to gay unions or gay rights that's all changed that's all changed.
*  When I was a kid it was a I mean you were a kid the same time I was a kid when we were young I remember I lived in San Francisco from the time I was seven till I was eleven.
*  So I was around a lot of gay people in my next door neighbors my aunt used to get naked they would smoke pot they would play the bongos with this gay couple that lived next door was hilarious I was just around it was normal.
*  Now and then we moved from there to Gainesville Florida which is really like the universe throwing me a curveball and I had this friend and his dad was really mad to gay people get married.
*  And he threw the newspaper down the tables I can't fucking believe this and I was like what is like what is he so upset about I don't understand it he was mad.
*  That gay people are going to be allowed to get married yeah and I remember thinking wow what a dummy and I was eleven I was like this is grown man thirty years old freaking out about some stupid shit right like what I didn't understand it didn't make sense to me like it was normal to me.
*  But I think those people are really rare now people like him they're they're much more rare than they were when I was absolutely yeah no there's been a big huge sea change in attitudes yeah.
*  And that's you know led to a lot of conflict and sure aspects of the culture wars but still I would agree you know absolutely most people have come around on that do you discuss that kind of stuff like this the the evolution of our ideas about sexual.
*  Sure yeah definitely I mean I I try to as a part of it but for me sexuality is you know it's not just sex it's right gender and religion and reproduction yeah and religion so it's a it's a broad gender it's a broad category absolutely but in America especially when you start.
*  When you move outside of.
*  You know the traditional man and woman having sex in the missionary position you go to death or reproduction so you're going to hell.
*  So you know that is the dominant.
*  Ideal as you know as as.
*  Gone by the wayside wayside I mean it is certainly the ideal for many but sexuality in America today is fast and furious right but if you think that that's the ideal.
*  Then you're a freak all of a sudden right well well I mean surely that's part of the shifts in attitudes that's what's interesting to me who's the authority to tell us.
*  Yeah what is right wrong for sure and then also the hypocrites like you there's so many people that we have looked at as these religious leaders and it turns out all these guys are freaks perverted yeah.
*  And where I've read I don't know where the study is but you know viewing pornography is kind of the highest in the Bible but oh yeah so again it's make sense well.
*  Well if you know what's what's you know yeah again that that discrepancy is like well what's really sacred to you.
*  You know yeah uses and on Sunday or you know what you're doing or gangbang yeah right I mean whatever.
*  Yeah job you're going to yeah so you know people like to project and say who they are and they have other yes they like to project yeah that's a good way of putting it that you like to project they like to pretend.
*  Make believe do you discuss the type of pornography that people view and how that has sort of changed.
*  Well I mean I write about pornography in that book sacred matters I have a chapter on sexuality and I write about.
*  Deep throat and you just swallow yeah.
*  Sound effects really going to say that deep throughout.
*  Oh yeah Linda Lovelace yeah Harry reams and their story is a kind of morality tale we want to talk about sexuality we're going to talk about religion didn't Harry reams become a politician afterwards.
*  Well as I remember it was he became a realtor he might have that's right that's right.
*  That's right.
*  But but became very successful as a realtor right yeah in Los Angeles right yeah well.
*  You know so I mean I do you know obviously want to include you have to include that you know well non reproductive forms of pleasure and sexual activity.
*  Is not disconnected from religious pursuits deep throat was a movie that played in movie theaters for people that don't know and people went to see that movie.
*  And they waited in line like couples would go dress normal not wearing raincoats like regular people in fact Johnny Carson was in line.
*  Was in line waiting to see deep throat and they interviewed him and talked to him about it because it was it was a movie that was a movie it was it wasn't just a stag film and the whole idea was that back then.
*  Pornography in terms of like that's what they would call them stag films that'd be these films they would play because people didn't have access to a movie projector for the most part is a very rare thing to have in your home.
*  So for people like to play those things they'd have to get together with a bunch of guys at a party like when a guy was about to get married look at this this what you're going to do we're going to watch people fuck.
*  And those films if you ever seen them they're really weird like from the beginning of the 20th century yeah very strange no the history of pornography is fascinating.
*  And there's I remember watching this thing on deep throat and then I just remember very clearly Johnny Carson getting interviewed talking about I remember that yeah do you know what i'm talking about I typed in Johnny Carson and I found an article that says Ed McMahon his sidekick was such a fan of the movie he showed up with six friends in a case of years.
*  That's not fake news that's a real news I'm sure I'm sure that's true I'm sure that's your thanks not sure was on the early audience members.
*  No long with vice president Spiro Agnew Warren Beatty Truman Capote Shirley McLean Nora Efron I don't know who that is Bob Woodward wow Woodward and Bernstein and Sammy Davis junior.
*  Who grew so enamored of Linda Lovelace that within the year he and his wife would be having group sex with her and her husband holy shit Sammy I did miss Sammy got crazy.
*  Wow it was the was the longest 62 minutes that millions of people would ever sit through in retrospect the most inspired decision Damiano I guess the person who made it made was to rename the movie deep throat nothing else could possibly explain its success.
*  Wow was the original name for it.
*  Lovelace is interviewed by Johnny Carson on the tonight show wow further stoke in the interest of socialite students swingers in the curious.
*  See that's what's interesting it's like crazy people didn't think of pornography as being something that was awful that you should hide right.
*  It seems to me that it's discussed far less now that it's much more accessible it's like people almost don't want to talk about it in terms of like average data.
*  Yeah right because it's so pervasive everywhere yeah it's well it's not just pervasive it's also it's too accessible yes you don't it's still you could just yeah it's not taboo like it was right it's weird it's it's and.
*  I've done research and one of the things I've noticed is there's a lot of stepmother porn lately that's basically all you get what what is that I don't know man but if you go to porn like a lot of it stepmom stuff okay it's like my hot stepmom you know dad's out of town that kind of stuff weird.
*  Well I will say.
*  I hope my colleague doesn't mind me calling her out but at university don't say her name okay University of California Santa Barbara.
*  In the film studies department they have a class on pornography or they did about stepmoms well not that I don't know if that topic made it in but as a genre of film you know you can teach about it yeah well.
*  It's listen it should be a genre of study because it is a part of human life it's a weird part of human life yeah that is not very discussed right.
*  Why are you super nervous well and people love it I mean well billions of dollars and you know not really anymore I don't think they make much money I well that's weird I don't know the economics but in terms of the impact though.
*  Or in terms of the prevalence of it it's incredibly prevalent I think there's something bananas like right 20 plus percent of all internet traffic is pornography which is insanity it's an insane insanely high number yet.
*  The amount it's discussed in polite company is like less than 1% right it's very very rarely discussed if not dismissed as a joke right.
*  Right and there's something that in itself speaks volumes yeah that's the weird part about it here it goes 35% of all internet downloads are related to pornography how can I mean that is amazing is that the highest percentage of any topic I wonder I don't know must be.
*  I would am I must be listen this is what's hilarious about 200,000 Americans are classified as porn addicts here we go there's probably another 100 million that are full of shit.
*  That's right.
*  Get the fuck out of here that's such a low number this is a very low number also 37 pornographic videos are created in the.
*  Every day.
*  Every minute or hour that's.
*  They've never been to the San Fernando Valley.
*  Where you grew up.
*  Yeah that was the center of it all well they passed some sort of wacky rule a few years ago.
*  Well they passed some sort of wacky rule a few years back where they had to wear condoms in the porn and California yeah and then people are well we're moving out of California and they started doing it other places right nobody wants to be safe.
*  I want you to have sex with your stepmoms I want to do anything safe I want the dad to be pulling into the driveway when you climax that's that's what everybody wants they want naughtiness yes that's.
*  It's weird that when it's so prevalent it's also so rarely discussed and just as a topic of a class like that would be a very interesting thing to discuss just in terms of human nature and psychology sure and history yeah thinking about that yeah.
*  Yeah the other thing before we're really going to be talking about this the other understudy topic that's starting to get more study is the orgasm right and thinking about mystical experiences or certain kinds of ego dissolving.
*  Aspects of human life it's it's in there and I teach about that as well you know and in both the death class and the sexuality class right do you discuss tantric.
*  Well some of my training is an American religious history but in these courses I do try to very superficially you know talk about a different religious cultures and certainly tantric.
*  Yeah that's a weird one when it comes to the orgasm right because they're like trying to internally orgasm yes is that real well I don't know I have no idea seems like but some guru shit to me yeah well.
*  And even in American history there have been interesting attempts at different kinds of sexual cultures, you know the United community oh yeah I'm free noise you know wanted.
*  Didn't want anyone to orgasm you know that was you want to hold it in but you have sex with.
*  That's where you want it no marriage that never lasts.
*  Like how about this community did fall apart this sex cult the next how do you say it next year yes I have not been following I haven't either and there and.
*  I haven't either but I keep making a mental note to eventually there's a documentary apparently is a documentary series or something on it a hulu thing or something.
*  But it's apparently pretty fascinating because it was involved like legitimate celebrities like people on television shows and stuff getting branded.
*  it's like a documentary show on stars stars or five episodes.
*  yeah that's a weird one right right well I mean most sex cults are or that that kind of.
*  focus on sex as a part of religious trust and religious.
*  What is the law against that like how are they arresting people like what are the people do that there do you know Jamie like people going to jail for this the sex cult right.
*  I don't I will think the six out of my head is I know people are getting branded right now that was like the next the next thing there's also another show called the vow that has some it's I think it's the same topic that's on HBO.
*  I don't know if that's direct documentary or like I'd like to find out what their journal jail for I'll look I'll look at because people are going to jail yeah well.
*  that's right right right right.
*  One of what they did where they said all right, this is this is where you cross the line right you can't just what did you see wild wild country.
*  That is that the documentary that's the document from the people that lived in Oregon going back to Oregon right fucking crazy Oregon sex trafficking we're all going to Oregon.
*  Conspiracy conspiracy to commit forced labor forced labor.
*  Who knows what you know.
*  This sounds like they have good enough release forms.
*  yeah well.
*  i'll see about putting it on the syllabus yeah i'm interested in some things yeah you don't need to go but wild wild country whoops whoops almost felt.
*  This bottle does not want to stay up.
*  Wild wild country is the documentary on oh show that the guru that the Indian guy that had the cult up in right with that girl shelo poisoned a bunch of people right that is an amazing netflix documentary.
*  Yeah i've seen some of it oh my God yeah but it's one that I always hear about and you know again it's a really well done, but also revealing what is now we're seeing a fairly common story it's so funny because my friend Todd saw the first episode and he's like.
*  It looks like so much fun like it'd be it looks so great and he's right in the beginning it did look so great, but it combined both these things we're talking about combined sexuality and religion.
*  It's like this their religion was of love and of peacefulness and sex and and harmony and it all went terribly wrong what they always do like they like they often do right always what what cult.
*  has nailed it what cult has never gone wrong figured out all the traps and pitfalls and made it to the finish line none none zero well that's I think that I would agree with that statement as a general statement of yeah it seems weird though that they can't someone can't do it right.
*  Yeah well I think that's maybe built into religion you know it's just no way to perfect it.
*  Well at least religion has figured out a way to achieve tax exempt status and a long.
*  illustrious history of success right yeah well that's the beauty of the country yeah.
*  Yeah freedom of religion yeah supposedly yeah yeah yeah but once you get to a point where you're doing the wild wild country type stuff right it's not.
*  Yeah it's no longer yeah so do you discuss those kind of things in your classes some you know that are a part of.
*  The longer history so was Mormonism you know as an early cult you know kind of marginalized community had a very different understanding of sexuality and marriage and well started by a wacky 14 year old.
*  Was completely full of shit I won't exactly characterize in that way he was a little con man.
*  Anyway so yeah you know I try to cover a lot of bases on the varieties of ways that sexuality gets you know bound up in religious life yeah.
*  Mormonism is particularly unusual right and that their their interest in polygamy led them to leave the country.
*  Yeah at the time yeah they were heading west well they're still there no no in Mexico oh that yeah yeah they're continuing that yes.
*  Well that's you know the whole Mitt Romney's family story yeah they're all down there still that yeah Mitt Romney's dad was actually born in Mexico that's why he couldn't be president United States.
*  Mitt Romney's dad could not be president United States he was born in Mexico yeah they lived in this compound this is the compound the same kind of compound that was originally in the news because they had been attacked by the cartel and women and children had been murdered.
*  Okay yes I remember that yeah.
*  Those were I mean they're not really expats because they've been there so many generations that they're now Mexican citizens but they're living in these compounds these fortified compounds in Mexico and they originally went there so they could practice polygamy.
*  Yeah right when it was out I mean outlawed here of course.
*  Well not only that when there was no difference really between living in the United States and Mexico you know 1812 the difference between the United States and Mexico was not that big a deal.
*  Well right.
*  Just take your horse you go over there.
*  Right yeah yeah yeah.
*  And you bring your eight wives.
*  Right yeah exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  There's a way out and a way in.
*  Well you know the thing about the United States and Mexico is that they were not allowed to live in the United States and Mexico.
*  Right.
*  There's a way out and a way in.
*  We'll talk about a subject that's filled with pitfalls like that subject is probably particularly difficult subject of polygamy.
*  Yes.
*  Is a particularly touchy one.
*  And almost always is a lot of wives.
*  Very rarely is one woman who gets the pleasure of 10 husbands.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  There are some you know I think examples of that but yeah.
*  Well I mean polygamy is for you know husbands with multiple wives.
*  Right.
*  Have you ever heard of the other way.
*  Well no I mean not in polygamy but there I believe there's another term.
*  I bet there's a few gals that can pull that off.
*  Well.
*  Jennifer Lopez.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah I mean so it's it's it's part of the story and it is a little bit.
*  Here it is.
*  Polyandry is a form of polygamy in which a woman takes two or more husbands at the same time.
*  For example fraternal polyandry is practiced among the Tibetans in Nepal parts of China and parts of northern India which two or more brothers are married to the same wife with the wife having equal sexual access to them.
*  Interesting.
*  So.
*  Five places where women have more than one husband.
*  All right.
*  There you go.
*  So I mean yeah.
*  Look at that look at that photo though.
*  Go to that photo.
*  Look the woman's looking straight ahead like both guys look off the side like shit.
*  Right.
*  I can't believe they're taking my picture here.
*  But she's got her hand on both of their knees.
*  Like I own these two motherfuckers.
*  But they're all looking off in the distance like.
*  OK.
*  So there's one lady with four husbands.
*  Hey.
*  Hey.
*  Look at that.
*  That lady's bawling out of control.
*  Where is she.
*  She's dead.
*  That's an old ass picture.
*  That's a picture from the 1800s.
*  Look at that picture.
*  That was like one of them.
*  Where was that.
*  Stand still.
*  You know those pictures.
*  Look at that.
*  Whoa.
*  What is that.
*  That's like from some Norman Rockwell shit.
*  Yes.
*  They're ladies.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well no pun intended.
*  Google goes deep.
*  Oh.
*  Anyway.
*  Listen man I really enjoy talking to you.
*  So a fascinating series of subjects we brought up here.
*  Love it.
*  And so you're in the middle of writing a book right now.
*  Yes.
*  What is the book?
*  It's on religion and drugs.
*  Do you have a title for it.
*  No.
*  I'm playing around with some things.
*  But if people want to read your past work what can they read.
