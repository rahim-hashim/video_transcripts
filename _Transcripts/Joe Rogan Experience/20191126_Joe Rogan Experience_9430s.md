# Joe Rogan Experience #1391- Tulsi Gabbard & Jocko Willink
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 26, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdYud9re7-Q)
*  All right, here we go.
*  How did this get started?
*  How did we decide to do this?
*  I was trying to think about that because it's something something you and I started interacting
*  on.
*  It was somebody on Twitter.
*  Twitter.
*  Somebody I don't know exactly how it started, but I saw you replied to a tweet from somebody
*  saying, Hey, great idea.
*  Why don't why doesn't Jaco and Tulsi go on the Rogan show?
*  And he's like, yeah, cool.
*  Yeah, you're like, I'm in.
*  Yeah, I'm in.
*  I'm in.
*  But Jaco, he'll say that to anything.
*  Yeah.
*  Want to go to the moon?
*  I'm in.
*  I believe that.
*  Roger.
*  But it escalated quickly from there because I didn't know how to get a hold of you.
*  And then next thing I know, you're texting me with Jaco like, so are you serious?
*  Are we doing this or what?
*  Well, it just seemed like such a good idea.
*  I agree.
*  Whoever it was, salute.
*  Yes.
*  Whoever you are.
*  Thank you.
*  Good job.
*  Just seemed like a wise thing to get together because I'm both your veterans and both of
*  you, I'm sure, have things you agree on and disagree on.
*  But you're in a really unique position here.
*  And since you've been on the podcast, a lot of things have happened.
*  The big one is when you rightly called out Kamala Harris on her past and what she's done.
*  And then it seemed like everybody's attacking you.
*  It's like that opened up the floodgates and then there's all these hit pieces on.
*  And then you're like, wow, look at the machine work.
*  Look at the attack dogs go.
*  Look at this.
*  It's very transparent.
*  Ah.
*  So if you're paying attention, the thing is if you're on the outside and you watch it
*  all happen, then you go, oh, I see what's going on.
*  But if you just happened upon one of those articles, you go, oh, she's an Assad supporter.
*  Oh, she's a terrible person.
*  Oh, she's a this and a that.
*  It was amazing.
*  It was amazing to watch.
*  I've never met anybody like like you that's run for president.
*  Like I knew you when people didn't know you that well.
*  And then all of a sudden people know you way more.
*  And now you're kind of a household name.
*  So to watch this process and to watch all the machinery sort of move in your direction
*  and pampampam, it's very interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  What's it been like to you?
*  I mean, that literally is our challenge here is we are up against the most powerful overall
*  political machine.
*  When you when you look at this this machine that's revved up their engines to try to,
*  you know, define me as something that casts suspicion or doubts or whatever in people's
*  minds, you know, pushing information that isn't true or all of these different things.
*  And I think there's a few reasons for it.
*  Our challenge is like we are battling the political establishment in Washington.
*  And it's because I'm telling the truth.
*  It's because I'm challenging the status quo that they represent and that they've profited
*  off for for a very long time.
*  So, you know, my campaign, we don't take any contributions from PACs or lobbyists fueled
*  completely by contributions from individual people.
*  And they are outspending us by many, many multiples where we need help to challenge
*  their narrative with the truth.
*  Telling me, hey, this is who I am.
*  This is why I'm running for president.
*  This is the experience in the background that I bring to this job.
*  We've got to be able to bypass that mainstream corporate media and just go directly to
*  voters. And what is the experience of being attacked feel like?
*  God, I feel like I'm used to it.
*  So, I mean, it's just like it's it's nothing that I've ever really taken personally
*  because I understand the situation.
*  You know, I understand that, you know, whatever the smears are, however radical they
*  are, you know, it shows me that they feel threatened and they are concerned about both
*  the unifying message that I'm bringing because we have Democrats, Republicans,
*  libertarians, independents who are joining this coalition that that is fueling our
*  campaign. And it's a campaign of buy in for the people and one that's that's actually
*  speaking the truth. That's calling for an end to these regime change wars, calling for,
*  you know, a de-escalation of tensions between the United States and other nuclear armed
*  countries and end to this new Cold War nuclear arms race.
*  Actually, hey, let's focus our limited taxpayer dollars on actually serving the needs
*  of our people. That's really the message that we're bringing in.
*  It scares the hell out of them.
*  What's interesting is for me, again, as an outsider, it's a clear, clear recognition
*  that what they want versus what they say they want are two very different things.
*  The Democratic Party's party's always been like, we want a woman.
*  OK, I got you a woman. How about a woman that's a veteran?
*  Check. How about a woman that's a congressman?
*  How about that? Congresswoman, veteran, minority, minority from Hawaii.
*  All these positives trying to dig up dirt on you.
*  They don't have anything. They should be behind you.
*  They should have wind in your sails.
*  But the other thing they're saying is that, you know, in order for Democrat to beat
*  Donald Trump in 2020, you're going to have to be able to take Trump voters away from
*  him. You're going to have to win over those independents who stayed home in 2016 or even
*  some of those Democrats who voted for Trump because they feel like our party has left
*  them behind. Guess what?
*  Check, check, check, check.
*  We're doing all those things. And instead of saying, hey, this is really something that
*  maybe we should get behind instead, they're saying, oh, my gosh, there's something very
*  suspicious and weird about her because she's actually stealing voters from Trump.
*  That's yeah, that's the big one.
*  Right. Has there ever been someone in your position that's gotten caught in such a
*  crossfire like to be taking this much heat from the party that you're, you know, trying
*  to represent is it seems I don't remember this happening.
*  Well, they thought Harris had a real shot and she sunk Harris's ship.
*  That's exactly what happened. I mean, if you look at that, there's a direct correlation
*  between where Harris was standing and where she's at now and that debate.
*  It just you put holes in her boat.
*  Which which was, you know, I was raising some very important issues related to criminal
*  justice reform, you know, ending the federal marijuana prohibition and essentially
*  pointing to to leadership because we're all asking to to lead this country and bring
*  the experience that each of us has that's very distinct and different.
*  And and her whole campaign was based on the premise of being a prosecutor for the people,
*  being the attorney general here in California.
*  And I, you know, I OK, you've said you're proud of your record.
*  This is what you have done when you were in a position to make a positive change for the
*  people. Instead, you chose to do otherwise.
*  And I think that speaks louder, louder than words.
*  When you had more bullets in the chamber, too, because there was other things you didn't
*  even touch it like you didn't really touch upon her saying to single mothers that she
*  was going to prosecute them and lock them up if they didn't get their kids in school
*  laughing as she did.
*  So, yeah, I mean, that's I've seen her talk about that as if it's a good idea that this
*  was a good solution.
*  Yeah. And then I mean, you're single moms into with a fear of jail if their kid didn't
*  go to school. Yeah.
*  That's that's the challenge of this this debate format that's that's so frustrating is,
*  you know, you've got 60 to 75 seconds to get your point across to be able to talk about,
*  hey, here's my position.
*  Here's what I would do with, you know, North Korea.
*  Here's how I would deal with, you know, immigration reform in 60 seconds or less.
*  Jaco, I don't even know how you stand politically, which is hilarious because you're one of the
*  few guys that's just not defined politically online because people think of you as such
*  a savage. They leave all the politics out of it.
*  There's got to know what he's just get up, gets up at four o'clock in the morning, leaves
*  a puddle of sweat. He's America.
*  He's Team America.
*  That's what I'm saying. Like, it seems like you don't have this thing with like left or
*  right. You don't have this right or left distinction.
*  Yeah. And what's really interesting, if you look at the demographics of like the people I
*  meet when I go and speak, it's everyone.
*  It's everyone from every different spectrum.
*  And I can I'm just talking my political beliefs are like, hey, I believe in individual
*  freedom. Well, that seems to me it's kind of hard to argue against that.
*  Right. Yeah. I believe in individual freedom.
*  And with that goes some level of individual responsibility.
*  Yep. OK. I don't think the government is a great solution to a lot of our problems.
*  You know, so for me, it's like a smaller government, probably a better thing.
*  And I think probably why you get this impression from me is I actually have a balanced I
*  believe that the solutions are somewhere balanced.
*  And in America right now, that that doesn't really get a lot of traction because everything
*  is broken down into such little tiny sound bites of you're either pro this or you're
*  against it. And there's no gray area.
*  And by the way, if you believe this, you know, if you believe yes and I believe no, I
*  actually hate you and I'm going to attack you.
*  And that's why when when I started going back and forth with Tulsi, like I know, I kind
*  of get a gist of what she thinks.
*  I'm like, oh, cool. Guess what?
*  I think she serves.
*  She trains martial arts.
*  She plays. She plays ukulele.
*  Oh, I can hang out with her.
*  And even if our our political beliefs aren't 100 percent aligned, which my political
*  beliefs aren't 100 percent aligned with anybody.
*  Does that mean that I hate her and I'm never going to talk to her and call her out?
*  No, actually, it's like, oh, cool.
*  Oh, that's an interesting perspective, because one thing that gets tied into all these
*  things nowadays is our ego, right?
*  Our ego. We paint ourselves into a corner where it's like, I believe this.
*  And now the last thing we can do is say, oh, actually, no, I that's a good point, Joe.
*  You know, you want to never thought of it from that perspective before.
*  And also just thinking of what other people's perspectives are, because, you know, you
*  just talked about single moms.
*  Well, you've got to take that into perspective because it might be easy for me to say
*  because I've got kids, but I got a wife and we can make things happen.
*  But all those single moms over here working two, three jobs, you know, you always talk
*  about me getting up at four thirty in the morning.
*  And I always say, look, there's single moms out there that are getting up at three
*  thirty in the morning to go work their first shift at the diner so they can get to
*  their second shift at the grade school or wherever they're working.
*  So they can do their third shift at some other restaurant at night.
*  Like, OK, that's going on.
*  I got to understand that perspective.
*  And we all have to understand that perspective.
*  And the last thing, when you talk about this 60 second answers, which which is insane
*  and I've been interviewed on TV before a bunch as well.
*  And it's actually crazy.
*  It's when you compare it to a podcast, it's completely crazy that you have to fit your
*  thoughts into one sentence, maybe two sentences and the 24 hour news cycle that we're
*  on. Every news story that comes out is the end of the world.
*  Right. It's like the end of the world.
*  Everything that happens is, hey, Trump did this or Pelosi did that.
*  This is the end of the world.
*  Just like when if Hillary got elected, it's the end of the world.
*  If Trump gets elected, it's the end of the world.
*  You know, I had early on right after Trump got elected, somebody I was doing a Reddit
*  AMA. And as soon as I signed on for my Reddit AMA, up pops this question.
*  And it's clearly the guy had spent a lot of time writing it.
*  And it was this this sort of breakdown of the Russians and Trump and all this
*  negativity. And and, you know, I basically took his whole paragraph and I answered it
*  in one sentence. I said America is stronger than one man.
*  And that's the truth. Like, hey, America is stronger than one man.
*  One man is not going to take down this country.
*  That's that's the way it is. Right.
*  It's hardship to turn.
*  Look at what Trump's got accomplished.
*  You know, he he's working as hard as he can to get stuff done and he could barely move
*  the needle. Right. That's the way it is.
*  And on top of that, look at what happens with our political system.
*  You know, we had Carter.
*  Oh, there's a backlash against Carter.
*  We have Reagan. Right.
*  Oh, you know, you know, these things go back and forth.
*  We end up with Clinton. Then we end up with Bush.
*  You know, the and then we end up with Obama and then we end up with Trump.
*  So there's a balance that happens out.
*  So when I think of my political beliefs or where I stand politically, it's like, oh, I
*  stand. You're not going to be able to place me very well because I'm going to listen to
*  what different people have to say.
*  I'm going to try and understand what their perspectives are.
*  And then I'm going to say, oh, not what's best for me or what satisfies my ego, but
*  what's good for America?
*  Well, it actually makes sense for America.
*  And that's what I would move forward on.
*  Tells me, have you thought at all about doing a podcast of your own?
*  I have. It's been it's been just a function of time and capacity.
*  Almost like you could just have someone record some of your thoughts while you're on tour
*  and just do it. You know, like it doesn't have to be overproduced.
*  Yeah, just real simple.
*  Release it. But that ability to get those thoughts out there in a way where you you
*  can form full sentences, explore ideas, express your concerns, talk about it without the
*  pressure of this buzzer.
*  When when when you're in the middle of something, Congresswoman, Congresswoman,
*  Congresswoman, we got to cut the commercial.
*  Yeah. The tide is waiting.
*  Yeah.
*  We have a Toyota truck.
*  It's so goddamn crazy.
*  This is how we decide our leaders.
*  And the idea that is, isn't it possible?
*  Can't someone step up?
*  Can't Apple or fucking Samsung or something step up and say, all right, we're going to
*  we are going to advertise at the beginning of this show and then we're going to promote
*  the whole show. So the whole show, we're going to just let it run with no commercial
*  interruptions. No.
*  And let it let's do a few hours.
*  Why should happen? Why are we doing an hour?
*  Why is it two hours? Why?
*  It should be as long as it takes to get.
*  I mean, did Lincoln do speeches that were hours long?
*  You know, yelling, right?
*  No microphone.
*  Yeah, it's so strange that we have decided that this commercial
*  oriented meaning it has to be sandwiched in between commercials, that this is the way
*  we are going to let our potential future leaders discuss the most important thing on
*  earth. And it's going to be interrupted by what gum?
*  No, it's like what he's selling in between.
*  It's so dumb.
*  And people are getting really turned off by it because they have alternatives.
*  They have alternatives and they're not getting anything of value from the conversation
*  that's happening on these these debates that are really like political reality TV.
*  They are completely set up for conflict and confrontation to drive up ratings so that
*  they can make more money.
*  The corporate media can make more money.
*  The first debate had something like 22 million viewers.
*  The one that we just did, I think, had six point six million viewers.
*  And I meet people almost every single day.
*  They're like, man, I don't got time for that.
*  I don't get anything from it from it anyway.
*  And, you know, rather than rather than it being this this money driven ratings driven
*  venture, which which, you know, the media is doing across the board, both the debates
*  and kind of what issues they're choosing to cover and go back to like the League of
*  Women Voters, you know, who used to actually host presidential forums that would have real
*  questions about real issues that people care about in a way that's not broken up by
*  commercial breaks and advertisements that people can make money.
*  Yeah. And this is not hard to do.
*  No. YouTube is available for virtually anyone who wants to set up an account.
*  This all could be done and it could be done very easily.
*  I mean, it's the where we're showing is the fragility that this this antiquity, this
*  ancient system that doesn't make any sense.
*  And we're seeing it evaporate before our eyes and with a guy like Trump.
*  And then people are using these debates knowing that they're going to get these sound
*  bites and knowing that.
*  And and you could see some of them work like yours with Kamala Harris and some of them
*  don't. Like when she was attacking Elizabeth Warren for not wanting Trump to get kicked
*  off a Twitter. Like, do you read his Twitter?
*  It's fantastic.
*  Keep them on.
*  That's the best way we understand who he really is.
*  I mean, you can get some of that out of speeches, but when he posts a picture of Greenland
*  with a giant tower in it and says, I promise not to do this.
*  Listen, if you're on Team America, you want that guy to keep tweeting because you know
*  what's going on. It's hilarious, too.
*  Well, you called it a while ago when you when you say, hey, no one there's no comedians
*  that have run that have that skill, which Trump has of cracking jokes, making fun of
*  people, letting the other jokes roll off his back because he doesn't care what people
*  say about him, basically.
*  And no one's really had to contend with that until now.
*  Yeah, it's really interesting.
*  Like, no one knows how to handle it.
*  It's really fun. I mean, when you watch the original Republican debates, when he was
*  running for president and he starts attacking these guys, you see them.
*  Mark, Mark, or Ruby, all the nicknames, you see them lock up, crazy Ted, like, oh, he's
*  going after me. He's ruining my thing.
*  It's just, yeah, it's it's a it's a nutty place to watch.
*  What was it? Do you get to hang out with Kamala Harris backstage?
*  No, no. I mean, there's everybody.
*  No, there's there's like a just like a little holding area kind of space, like a lot
*  smaller than this room. So you're all hanging out in there together during the commercial
*  breaks. Yeah. But you say anything to you.
*  Have I contact with her? No, no.
*  Maybe every now and then. But I I honestly like.
*  Yeah, I'm probably not on the top of her friend list.
*  Yeah, you say I go battleship and then I mean, Hillary Clinton.
*  Yeah, I was. How what's up with that war?
*  Because again, you know, she's the matriarch of the of the Clinton family.
*  And there she is, the hero to many people of the Democratic Party.
*  And you two are scrapping.
*  Did that start when you did that start?
*  You did you? You supported Bernie in 2016.
*  Is that where it started? Yeah. OK.
*  That and that was something.
*  Yeah, back in 2016, I was the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.
*  Therefore, as an officer, the DNC had to remain neutral in the presidential election,
*  which was my plan to do so.
*  I really made the decision to resign from that seat so that I could endorse Bernie
*  Sanders largely because or actually largely because of his difference with Hillary
*  Clinton and foreign policy. You know, Hillary Clinton had, you know, very much of an
*  interventionist, in my opinion, kind of the war hawk
*  regime change war policy that she had shown throughout her time, both in the
*  administration as well as as a U.S.
*  Senator and Bernie Sanders, you know, lean the other way.
*  He's he's more of a non interventionist.
*  And I saw that in those debates at that time, the conversations that were in the
*  media was not bringing up this difference between the two of them so that voters
*  could make an informed choice of who they want their commander in chief to be,
*  which to me just as you know, as a soldier, as a veteran, as an American, like,
*  how can you not be putting this issue at the forefront?
*  So I resigned from that position, endorsed Bernie Sanders, started going out and just
*  talking about and raising these issues on the campaign trail.
*  But I remember one of the first interviews that I did on MSNBC, the host of the show
*  saying, aren't you afraid of what the Clintons will do to you?
*  Said this on live television.
*  And, you know, my my answer was no, obviously, but it was amazing.
*  It was it was interesting to see the reaction like the days after when I first went back
*  to D.C. after I made that announcement of endorsement and friends of mine, you know,
*  politicians in Washington, they were like, man, Tulsi, like, go with God, sister.
*  It's a different it's a different animal.
*  See, like if you get into some sort of verbal altercation with Joe Biden, there's no
*  concern for your life.
*  Like, I'm not saying it's real or not, but the rumor is always there's a thing called
*  the Joe Biden is like, yeah, Joe Biden is like, I don't think it is.
*  It's probably some of it.
*  Most of it. Let's say it's all made up.
*  The fact that that's out there, that the thought is out there, that they will whack you.
*  Well, there's there's I mean, the people who are saying, hey, look, you know, there are
*  lists that are kept in your political career will be over.
*  That was really the message that I got from from people who've been around the block a
*  few times. And I think the most recent thing that that came up with what Hillary Clinton
*  said about me is is not it's not a spat between two people.
*  It really just shows the the complete difference and the conflict in our foreign policy
*  views of the what I call the Bush Clinton doctrine of interventionism and regime change
*  wars and warmongering versus what I'm putting forward, which is let's stop the regime
*  change war, world's police policies, work to end this new Cold War in arms race, put
*  the interests of the American people first, always ensuring that we have a strong and
*  capable, ready military to defend our nation and our people and honoring that service and
*  sacrifice that that our troops give by only sending them on missions worthy of their
*  sacrifice, maximizing diplomacy, engagement with other countries in the world through
*  cooperation rather than conflict and always seeing war as a last resort.
*  So that conflict that you're seeing in the media that's been playing out and again, why
*  you're seeing so much of the corporate media and the political machine attacking me is
*  because of this difference is because of this change in foreign policy that I'm bringing
*  about, because when it comes right down to it, you know, whether you're going back to back
*  to the Cold War, back to Vietnam War, back to, you know, the Iraq war overthrowing Saddam Hussein,
*  Libya, Gaddafi, the media has always kind of been this cheerleading voice for these wars to
*  happen, sending a very clear narrative out to the American people.
*  And I think it comes down to it's good business for them.
*  It's good ratings. I want some money.
*  I want to talk to you about that, but I want to talk to you about what she said to you or about
*  you rather that she said that you are a Russian asset.
*  That was that was the insinuation, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, what was the base of that?
*  And how does someone who is completely baseless?
*  That's what's weird, right?
*  How does someone who is running for president and is one of the most prominent politicians in our
*  country, how do they get away with something?
*  So I'm saying something that's that's such a huge accusation with no information to back it up.
*  It would be a good question for a normal person.
*  But when you look at the power of the Clinton machine, when you look at the power of the
*  political establishment, which is made up of people who are either, you know, part of the the
*  Clinton so-called family or who are part of this political establishment that is built on the same
*  foundation that that she Hillary Clinton laid.
*  When you look at the media establishment, who've been pushing a lot of the same narrative, a lot of
*  the same message, then you can see how somebody gets away with calling a sitting member of
*  Congress, a candidate for president, a soldier actively serving the Army National Guard,
*  veteran of two Middle East deployments, basically a traitor to the country that I love and that I'm
*  willing to lay my life down for and to get away with it without any evidence or base whatsoever.
*  Not just that, but no pushback.
*  No, that was the most bizarre thing.
*  No one said, hold on.
*  What are you saying she is?
*  You're saying she's a Russian asset.
*  Define that. What do you mean by that?
*  Do you mean an unwitting Russian asset?
*  Are you saying that Russia is behind her to try to to do something against Bernie or Elizabeth Warren
*  or whatever the consensus pick is?
*  Like, what are you saying?
*  There was no no questions like that.
*  There were no questions like that.
*  And and look, even if there were witting or unwitting.
*  So she's basically either saying that I'm a traitor to my nation or that I am an unwitting
*  asset, which means basically you are too stupid and too naive to know that you're being used to
*  further the interests of a nation other than our own, both of which are are deeply, deeply
*  offensive and again, without any base.
*  And I think that that's the like this is bigger.
*  This isn't this is really not about me.
*  The danger here of what she did and how the media responded and how almost every single other
*  candidate for president refused to comment, refused to denounce what she said.
*  Bert, I think Bernie is an exception.
*  Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang, a couple of them had the courage to say, hey, look, this is
*  ridiculous.
*  The fact that that was that was the response is really it has a chilling effect on our
*  freedom of speech in this country.
*  And it sends a message that whether it's Tulsi Gabbard or any other American or any other
*  veteran who dares to stand up and challenge the establishment, challenge this foreign policy
*  narrative, call for peace, call for an end to these senseless, unnecessary regime change
*  wars, then you too can be smeared.
*  Your character can be smeared.
*  Do you ever think you could reach a tipping point where this happens enough?
*  This kind of thing happens where you just say, all right, I'm done with, in this case, the
*  Democratic Party.
*  I mean, even after what they did to Bernie in 2016, right, that I'm sure that had to be a
*  tipping point for a lot of people that said, wait a second, this is the guy we wanted.
*  And you totally hosed him.
*  And now we got this this woman over here, but we didn't want him.
*  How much how many times can this happen before people go, oh, you know, I'm done with this?
*  I see this as something that's bigger than just the Democratic Party, because we see this.
*  We see how this kind of foreign policy elite and establishment in Washington has crossed
*  both parties over different times.
*  And it's something that I think goes much deeper than that.
*  I'm working to bring about reforms in the Democratic Party to make it so that it is more
*  democratic, more open, more transparent, more inclusive and welcoming of people who may
*  agree on some issues, disagree on others.
*  But one that is actually serving as as a platform for the people fighting for the people
*  thinking about what's in the best interests of the people.
*  That's the kind of change in reform that that I'm working to bring about in the party.
*  But I think the forces that we're challenging here are actually much bigger than that.
*  I mean, you got to give a lot of credit to the Republican Party because the establishment
*  Republicans, the last human being in the world that they wanted to run for president on a
*  Republican ticket was Donald J.
*  Trump. And they tried hard.
*  They tried. They tried.
*  But once he was in, they said, that's our president.
*  And that's a very wise thing to do.
*  And that's where the fear is with a lot of Democrats, that someone is going to go
*  independent and that someone who is popular, perhaps you, would go independent and suck
*  a lot of the votes away from the Democratic Party.
*  People disagree with the direction it's going.
*  And then that's how the Republicans would win.
*  Yeah, I'm not I'm not going to do that.
*  I've been asked that a ton of times since, I don't know, months ago.
*  And every single time I've been asked, I've said the answer is no, I'm running to be the
*  Democratic nominee. I will not run as a third party candidate.
*  And I think that's something else that's that's been interesting and again, very
*  transparent. If you're paying attention is no matter how many times I answer that
*  question from reporters and no matter how many times my answer is consistently the
*  same. No.
*  That was another thing that Hillary Clinton and others continue to point out like, oh,
*  well, we think we think she's going to run as a third party candidate and she's going
*  to be the reason that Donald Trump wins.
*  She's not playing ball.
*  No. And they're clearly trafficking and things that aren't true.
*  Again, why?
*  To raise that question, people's minds and to raise that suspicion and to to do
*  their best to try to to undermine the support that we're getting from people.
*  They did. They did that interview with you on The View.
*  Oh, you saw that. And yeah.
*  And they they said they said something about Richard Spencer, Spencer, the white
*  supremacist. And because he said so, this is of all the things they bring up.
*  They say Richard Spencer, a white supremacist, Nazi said he could vote for you.
*  That's what they decided to bring up.
*  Well, the view is I mean, we have to really be thankful that it exists because
*  without that level of discourse on television, without being able to watch those
*  geniuses banter around some of the most important ideas of today, I don't know
*  where we'd be. I think it elevates us as a society, as a civilization.
*  And it also shows the rest of the world how it's done.
*  If you really want to see how the baddest country on earth deals with political
*  discourse and social issues, watch those gals because they got it down.
*  Bunch of damn geniuses.
*  You're good, Joe.
*  Doesn't get any better.
*  I think I think that out there, they throw that out there.
*  Yeah, they throw that out there.
*  And you know, once it's out there, hey, it's out there.
*  And all of a sudden, there's someone else somewhere that heard that clip.
*  Richard Spencer told me about that's what they're running with.
*  Yeah, that's today, though.
*  Today is there's so much data, right?
*  And there's so much information that all they need is one little Sumerian thing to
*  toss your way. And then people would say, oh, she's an Assad supporter.
*  Oh, she's this.
*  Oh, Richard Spencer's favorite candidate.
*  That one. And then like, oh, I can't vote for her.
*  I don't want to be kicked out of the team.
*  This is what we see on Twitter all the time.
*  That's a giant issue with the left, too.
*  The left eats itself way more than any other party.
*  And I don't know what that is about liberals in general that seem to really truly enjoy
*  calling each other out for not being liberal enough.
*  But it's very strange.
*  It's so obviously destructive.
*  And it shows that there's no good leadership at the top of the heap, because at the top
*  of the heap, everybody would be like, hey, we're all in this together.
*  OK, we can disagree on some stuff.
*  But if we start attacking each other, it makes the other side stronger.
*  So let's cut the shit publicly and let's talk this through.
*  And that's pretty much exactly what the Republicans have done for the most part.
*  Yeah. And as Lee, you know, from a leadership perspective,
*  it is almost always best to look at things in a balanced way and say, oh, I got this
*  this part of my team over here that wants to do this extreme thing.
*  And the other part of the team wants to do the opposite extreme thing.
*  The answer is going to be somewhere in the middle.
*  Why don't I just find a good kind of solution that's somewhere in the middle?
*  And of course, the fringes are going to be a little bit mad.
*  OK, I get that.
*  They're the fringes, but the bulk of people and what's good for the bulk of people
*  is to make this kind of balanced decision and move forward with it.
*  But we don't get that kind of logic inside of these leaders,
*  especially when they're running for president.
*  Yeah. Which is, you know, they run and then as soon as they get in,
*  they're running for reelection.
*  Yeah. You know, it's it's just it's so frustrating as a citizen to sit back
*  and watch us going from the debate format to the way things are handled.
*  It's just I don't understand why there haven't been radical improvements.
*  There's improvements in imagine getting a computer from 1990
*  and trying to do your work on it.
*  Be like this hunk of shit.
*  Like, why doesn't somebody do something better?
*  Well, we have the same exact political system
*  that we had before the Internet with the Internet.
*  It hasn't been updated at all.
*  And it doesn't make any sense.
*  Yeah, it's just it's it's so bonkers.
*  And we sit around and we wait for this magical day in November.
*  Where we're going to all fix it.
*  And we all know that it's not going to get fixed.
*  And it's just it's just a weird place to be in where everyone's aware
*  that there's an issue and no one's fixing it.
*  I when I look at this upcoming election, I have no idea.
*  Right. Right.
*  And you know, I had a pretty good idea who was going to win in 2016.
*  Just like everyone else, I figured, of course, you know,
*  Hillary Clinton is going to win this thing.
*  And we're going to use you knew I talked about it in my comedy special.
*  Yeah, I talked.
*  I talked about it and triggered.
*  My Netflix special from 2016.
*  I'm like, he's that close.
*  You guys. I go President Trump could be a real thing because it's I was seeing
*  I was going across the country and doing these gigs all over the place.
*  And like these people are angry.
*  They're angry at liberals.
*  They're angry at people that are, you know, forcing policies
*  that they don't agree with, whether it's social policies or economic policies.
*  There's so many people that thought that Bernie Sanders
*  was going to steal all their money.
*  Well, it was it was just I was saying it.
*  I was like, he might win.
*  Every time someone said, oh, if you believe in
*  if you believe in border security, you're a racist.
*  Yeah. Right. Hey, if you believe in border security, you're racist.
*  Well, that makes Obama racist. Yeah.
*  And but but all those people that heard that like,
*  I'm not a radio. He's talking about I'm voting for Trump. Right.
*  And that is what happened.
*  A hundred. It's still what's happening. A hundred percent.
*  Yeah. It's still playing out right now.
*  You know, where people are saying exactly that, that if you believe
*  in secure borders, then you must be anti-immigrant and you must be
*  you must be a racist and vice versa.
*  You know, they look at the opposite side and make the opposing argument
*  rather than taking that sensible approach and saying, hey, how about
*  we secure our borders using the most effective
*  and cost efficient means possible and update our immigration laws
*  so that they are humane and that they actually serve the interests
*  of our country, our economy, our families, education and so on and so forth.
*  I mean, this is something that, yeah, Republicans and Democrats,
*  if you just sit down and have the conversation say, oh, yeah, well,
*  I actually agree with that. Like you're saying, like, OK, that's a really good point.
*  We maybe we should do it this way. Maybe we should do it that way.
*  But if we can agree on the objective, then we can have the meaningful
*  conversation about how to get there rather than continuing what we are doing.
*  Where we're seeing we have not seen an update to our immigration laws for decades.
*  I think since Reagan, actually, we have not seen a comprehensive
*  immigration reform, which we so desperately need.
*  And it's because honestly, both sides are so busy throwing
*  crap at each other and arrows at each other because it's about partisanship
*  and getting the political win rather than actually solving the problem.
*  The difference. It's easy to cry racism when you look at the difference
*  in the border of Mexico and the border of Canada, because the border of Canada
*  is like a giant landing strip.
*  Like, come on through.
*  It's just woods.
*  And then there's a huge gap in the woods.
*  It's the opposite of a fence.
*  It's like we're going to make it easier for you to cross.
*  We're going to show you where the line is.
*  Have you seen the border? You see the border of Canada?
*  But it's hilarious. You put the economy in Canada
*  is not going to force people to try and get to America.
*  It's pretty nice. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's the issue. Right.
*  And the real issue is there's parts of the world, you know,
*  whatever you want to use, third world, whatever phrase you want to use.
*  There's parts of the world economically where if you're born there,
*  you're kind of screwed.
*  You know, it's really hard to get by. It's really hard.
*  If you're living in a poor community in Mexico that's run by the cartel.
*  What a shit roll of the dice.
*  You know, you just you got a bad hand of cards.
*  That's what it is.
*  And until that gets balanced out, which traditionally takes centuries, right?
*  For close nearby countries to sort of for everything to even out,
*  especially when the politics are so different between Mexico
*  and the United States and Mexico is just insanely corrupt.
*  Sorry, Mexico.
*  But I mean, I mean, you saw what happened with Chapo's son.
*  He gets arrested by the Mexican military.
*  And then the cartels forced them to release him and they're like,
*  all right, take him back. Sorry. Yeah.
*  We'll figure this out later. Yeah.
*  And that's something that, you know, that's the kind of of change
*  and the rooting out of corruption reforms that can only happen organically.
*  Yes. Within Mexico.
*  Could you imagine Jaco as a military man, a situation like that
*  happened in the United States where the some cartel forces
*  the United States military to release a prisoner?
*  No, no.
*  Do you imagine? No.
*  Can you imagine the backlash?
*  There are so many rednecks that would just be just spending all day
*  filling cartridges.
*  I mean, it would be the militia will rise up.
*  My God. Yeah.
*  You want to find out what the second amendment's really for?
*  If that ever took place in this country, if there was ever a situation
*  in this country, we felt like we were really overrun by a cartel
*  where they're taking over cities like what's going on in Mexico.
*  It would be you would understand how rapidly independent
*  this country really is. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
*  And even, you know, when you talk about people that are living down in Mexico
*  that want to come here, it's like, oh, you know, you feel for them
*  because they got a bad deal.
*  But a lot of the people that are trying to come here are MS
*  13 gangsters looking to come up here and whatever.
*  Do what they're going to do in America, where there's even more money
*  to be made off of illegal activities.
*  Yeah. If you could throw the Wonder Woman lasso of truth around them
*  and find out what they're really all about, that would be great.
*  That would be awesome.
*  We can't really do that.
*  If you're just poor and you want to make it, hey, come on in.
*  You're a hard worker. Excellent.
*  So are my grandparents. Come on in.
*  You know, but it's just the idea that we should all have open borders
*  and everybody should be able to go anywhere like, yeah.
*  Boy, there's a lot a lot of people that you don't want coming here.
*  And it probably should be a good idea to check people for criminal history
*  and violent pass and, you know, see if you remember the cartel
*  sneaking to Mexico. And there are just
*  you know, I think there there are practical limitations, even if you said,
*  OK, well, you know, we're going to we want to welcome anybody
*  and everybody in the world who is suffering and who is in
*  in need of help or a better life to come to United States.
*  It's just not realistic.
*  We don't have the resources as a country to be able to do that.
*  When, you know, look here in L.A., I was on Skid Row a couple
*  of couple of about a month or two ago coming, visiting there.
*  The homeless crisis in Hawaii is is the worst per capita of any state
*  in the country. It's something that's affecting both urban cities
*  and rural communities across the country.
*  We have, you know, what almost 80 million people who are uninsured
*  and underinsured in this country, who can't get the money.
*  Who can't get the medicine they need and who are literally
*  driving their kid to Mexico to buy insulin because they have diabetes
*  and they can't afford to get the medicine here at home.
*  We got a lot of issues and a lot of challenges that we've got to deal with.
*  And my view is we've got to be pragmatic and practical
*  in how we are seeing the situation, looking at what our objective is
*  and how does that best serve the people of this country and then figure out, OK,
*  what's what's the best way for us to get there?
*  I think that's what's unfortunately lost in this hyperpartisan
*  political atmosphere, whether you're talking about what's going on
*  in Washington and the media or what's going on in Twitter,
*  where you have these extremes, you have this rush to judgment
*  when people aren't taking the time both to sit down and first try
*  to understand the problem.
*  Like, you know, this this goes back to like military decision making process 101.
*  First, you got to understand the problem, right?
*  You're trying to solve. Come up with what's the objective,
*  make sure it's achievable and then build your plan and then execute.
*  That just doesn't happen these days because it's more about
*  calling the other guy's names or, you know, having this race on.
*  This happens all the time.
*  There's like something happens in the news
*  for the political candidates running for president.
*  It's who can get their tweet out the fastest on the issue.
*  We saw this recently with the situation in Syria with the Kurds.
*  And who can get the tweet out the fastest?
*  People are asking me like, hey, what do you have to say?
*  What do you have to say?
*  And like, I'm trying to understand the situation first.
*  I'm actually trying to understand what happened
*  and why we are in the situation that we're in.
*  Once I do that, I'll let you know what I think.
*  And that was another one of those end of the world scenarios that unfolded.
*  You know, we Trump pulled the troops out of out of that area.
*  And it was like, oh, the world's going to end.
*  And look, there was some bad stuff that happened.
*  I get it. Some ISIS folks, folks, some ISIS terrorists.
*  Murderers escaped.
*  I got that. Some some Kurds were killed, like some bad stuff happened.
*  But it wasn't the end of the world.
*  And and one thing, you know, I was my second deployment to Iraq.
*  We were we started doing counterinsurgency operations
*  instead of counter terrorist operations.
*  So we we changed our strategy.
*  And as we did this, we were we were starting to kill
*  a decent amount of bad guys, a bad of these insurgents.
*  So a few weeks go by and.
*  I got a message from up in my chain of command and they're like,
*  hey, Jocko, we get that you're doing these missions, but right now
*  we're not seeing any changes in the metrics as far as enemy attacks
*  that are happening, happening, right?
*  And luckily, I had read the the counterinsurgency manual
*  that was written by General Petraeus and and I part of that explains
*  that the average counterinsurgency takes seven years to work itself out.
*  Right. And so I said, hey, you know, boss,
*  the average counterinsurgency takes seven years to to flush itself out.
*  It's only been three weeks.
*  Can I get some more some more time here to work through this?
*  And he's like, OK, yeah, you know, makes sense.
*  But my point is it's the same thing here.
*  We think that some news event
*  that we can fully understand a news event within one hour of it happening.
*  We don't have any understanding.
*  You need to let these things develop
*  and and see where the actual long term effects are.
*  We can't be snapping judgments and making radical decisions
*  or split decisions when we have to actually assess what is really going on.
*  And so the press, for sure, is like snap decision, snap decision, snap decision.
*  And you can see it's comical to flip back and forth between the two
*  did to the left wing media and the right wing media.
*  And one of them is the greatest decision ever.
*  And the other one's the most horrible thing that's ever happened.
*  And there you go.
*  And, you know, no one can even make an assessment of what just happened
*  because it only happened 14 minutes ago.
*  How about we see where it plays out?
*  It's about being first rather than actually being accurate
*  and presenting the American people with here's what has gone on.
*  You can form your own opinion.
*  You can form your own conclusion.
*  But here's the course of events that took place, A, B, C, D and E.
*  And that's that's exactly what we're missing in most of the time.
*  Well, I think it's what we were talking about earlier.
*  I think we're poisoned by this desire to have our information fed to us very quickly.
*  And the fact that there's so much information coming at us,
*  we don't have enough time to sit back and read a manual on how long it takes
*  counterinsurgency efforts to be fruition, to reach fruition.
*  The fact that that's hitting you in the military,
*  that you would think that the most pragmatic, the most disciplined people
*  that understand the long game that are playing 3D chess,
*  those are the people that you would want
*  telling people like you what you can and can't do.
*  The fact that that kind of thinking is even filtering down
*  to special ops groups is crazy.
*  Well, what's nice is we do have decentralized command inside the military.
*  So when I'm telling my boss this is what's going on, my boss isn't like,
*  shut up and do what I told you to do.
*  My boss is like, OK, makes sense. Explain it to me.
*  OK, got it. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool.
*  Move forward. That's that's a very positive thing in the military.
*  Everyone thinks that the military is this rigid, structured way
*  where you just obey the chain of command.
*  You don't you don't veer from that at all.
*  But if my boss tells me to do something that doesn't make any sense,
*  I'm going to say, hey, boss, this actually is a bad plan.
*  We should do it a different way.
*  And if I have a good boss, my boss says, OK,
*  I didn't see that angle.
*  And that's another thing that, you know, when Tulsi is talking about how
*  politicians, we come up with a plan and then we start executing the plan.
*  Guess what? Once you start executing a plan,
*  some other things are going to come to come to light. Right.
*  And you as a leader have to say, hey, you know what?
*  We started executing this.
*  It's going pretty good. But I didn't foresee this happening.
*  I'm making an adjustment. Here it is.
*  Here's what we're going to do.
*  And I'm going to wait for that feedback to come to me.
*  The problem is people are so insecure or slash their ego so big
*  that they won't.
*  I'm just going to stick with the same plan, no matter.
*  Everyone else is dumb. No, you just need to see it through.
*  It's like, no, actually, we need to make some changes.
*  Because they, you know, they they are afraid of saying, hey,
*  my initial assessment might have been inaccurate or wrong.
*  And I think that that also just points to the bigger point
*  for the political leadership, the civilian leadership
*  that sets the policy that the military executes is so often lacks that foresight
*  and that that planning of actually looking, OK, if we pursue course of action, a,
*  you know, we call it here.
*  Here will be the second, third, fourth order of effects. Right.
*  Here's how, you know, the enemy or the opponent is likely to react.
*  Or here's how other actors are likely to react to our action.
*  So we can try to anticipate that. And then we can.
*  OK, this is how we would respond.
*  This is how they're likely to respond, actually go through this
*  so that we don't end up in the situation that we too often find ourselves in,
*  where you're like, all right, here's the here's the mission, guys.
*  Go for it. And then you, whether it's a week or a month or a year later, like,
*  how the hell do we find ourselves here?
*  It's like you failed as leaders, the leaders of our country
*  failed to ask those questions about, you know, what happens, what happens next?
*  You know, after we go in and topple Saddam Hussein
*  and we completely obliterate the entire Iraqi military,
*  what actually happens next?
*  What will be the consequences to this?
*  What will be the cost to our troops, our military?
*  What will be the cost to the Iraqi people?
*  What will be the cost to American taxpayers?
*  Is the is the objective?
*  Do we know what the objective is? Is it achievable?
*  What's our end state and exit strategy?
*  When you look back and I've just I've seen this throughout my seven years
*  in Congress, sitting on the Foreign Affairs Committee,
*  sitting on the Armed Services Committee, where we're we're questioning
*  and providing oversight over the Department of Defense and Department of State,
*  asking leaders these questions.
*  And when we're not given answers or given ambiguous answers or things like,
*  you know, I asked Secretary Mattis once in a hearing
*  about how Al Qaeda has gotten so strong in Syria
*  to where I mean, right now, they they control an entire city,
*  the entire city of Idlib is controlled by Al Qaeda.
*  And I asked him at that time, I said, well, why aren't we going after Al Qaeda
*  in Syria in a very serious and concerted way?
*  And his answer was, well, it's complicated.
*  It's complicated.
*  And it's it's it's frustrating, to say the least.
*  But I think it's been a very
*  transparent it's been it's been a very clear window
*  into the lack of foresight and good judgment
*  and just the ability to look at these challenges and situations with that
*  that basic understanding in a non-emotional way and understand
*  what what's the objective, cost and consequences before we launch this action?
*  I want to talk about something you brought up briefly earlier about the media
*  being sort of cheerleaders for a lot of these wars or a lot of these military actions.
*  What do you think that that happens because this ensures that they get access?
*  Do you think it happens because conflict is good for their business?
*  Do you think it happens because if they don't act as cheerleaders,
*  they don't get access to the leaders and to the important politicians
*  and military leaders?
*  I mean, I I think that the underlying driver is that conflict is good for ratings.
*  That's crazy that that is their decision how to cover things.
*  And it's it's the it's the war machine,
*  you know, that that they're a part of and that they're driving
*  that they are a driving force for.
*  You know, I think that, yeah, there there, you know, there there have been reports.
*  I think over time, I think you and Matt Taibbi here recently where you've got,
*  you know, journalists who are more or even, you know,
*  papers who are more interested in covering for their, you know, CIA relationships
*  rather than actually bringing forward a story that the American the truth,
*  you know, that the American people deserve to hear.
*  So, you know, I think there there are other factors there that drive
*  the media really playing a heavily influential and dangerous force
*  in continuing to push this this
*  warmongering narrative that that is, you know, I mean, it's it's
*  costly in an immeasurable, immeasurable way.
*  Well, the coverage is so influential in that influence.
*  It changes the way people accept or don't accept things that are happening
*  internationally, you know, when there's something.
*  I mean, what was the do you remember when there was a time when Obama had talked about
*  attacking Syria? Yes.
*  Doing something that was in 2013.
*  The entire country was like, fuck you.
*  Like it was it was my first year in Congress.
*  I mean, it was one of the biggest like rejections of an idea
*  global or nationally that I've ever seen.
*  And then he kind of backed off it.
*  You know, it was like, oh, OK.
*  I think I think that was one of the most brave
*  decisions that he made to back off from it, where he actually, you know,
*  he didn't take that position in that example of just kind of being the obstinate,
*  stubborn, like, no, here's what I said.
*  And he drew this red line.
*  And I'm not going to go back on it no matter what.
*  No, he did.
*  I think he listened to the American people and ultimately he chose diplomacy.
*  Well, this is an area where people have been critical of you.
*  Is your position on Syria and the fact that you had met with Assad
*  and this is something that gets brought up and again, it gets brought up
*  in these little soundbite things that are seeking to define you
*  without any nuance or any any complexity.
*  They try to let light just let this little tiny sentence
*  or two define your position and then they can repeat that to other people
*  without really knowing what they're talking about.
*  Yeah. What is your position on Syria and Assad?
*  And how did all this conflict and all this weirdness with you
*  in the subject begin?
*  I think I think it it goes back to again
*  the the opposition
*  that comes towards me from the political establishment,
*  you know, the corporate media and the military industrial complex
*  because of the the leadership and the voice that I've been bringing,
*  calling for an end to regime change wars, whether we were talking about the one
*  in Iraq, Libya and in in Syria.
*  Um, look, my choice, my my choice will always be towards diplomacy
*  because if we lack the courage to meet with both adversaries
*  and friends in the pursuit of our own national security and peace,
*  the only alternative is war period.
*  That's the way it is.
*  So I will always choose to maximize all diplomatic means and measures
*  and talks and negotiations to further our interests of peace
*  and national security, recognizing that war should always be
*  the last resort if necessary.
*  Now, is this it's very difficult for people to understand
*  that these things are insanely messy.
*  And you saying that you would always
*  lean towards diplomacy does not mean you support dictators.
*  But that's exactly the way they frame it.
*  Yeah. But if you look at the famous Hillary Clinton speech
*  after Gaddafi was killed, we came, we saw he died and she was laughing.
*  Libya is a failed state now.
*  They have they have slaves that they're auctioning off on YouTube.
*  You could watch slave auctions that someone filmed with their camera
*  on their phone and they upload it to YouTube.
*  Libya is gone.
*  I mean, it's a chaotic place right now.
*  Yeah, it wasn't good when Gaddafi was running Libya,
*  but it wasn't as bad as it is now.
*  So the idea that supporting Gaddafi is supporting a dictatorship
*  and you're a monster for supporting him, like maybe not,
*  because it's kind of worse now because the world is a very messy place.
*  And it's not even a matter of of quote unquote supporting.
*  It's just saying, hey, we're not going to come in and overthrow you
*  and your government.
*  I think that's that's the thing.
*  That's the issue here and the contradiction when people are criticizing me
*  for exercising diplomacy and calling for an end to the regime change
*  war that we've been waging in Syria since 2011.
*  But then they'll say, oh, well, of course, I was against overthrowing
*  Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
*  Right. There's no intellectual there's no consistency there.
*  And I think the issue with Libya that that so often gets overlooked is,
*  again, we look at what what will the consequences be of these regime
*  change wars? You said, I mean, Libya is a completely failed state.
*  There are more terrorist organizations and strongholds in Libya now
*  than there ever were before when Gaddafi was there.
*  The people of Libya are suffering far more now than they were before.
*  We also see this other effect on our own national security, where our
*  our regime change war policy has undermined our ability
*  to negotiate with Kim Jong-un in North Korea towards denuclearization.
*  You have the leaders of North Korea time and time again have said, hey, look,
*  we're developing nuclear weapons as the only deterrent that will work
*  against the United States coming in and overthrowing our government.
*  Said it over and over and over again.
*  And they've pointed to examples like Libya saying that, well, you guys are saying
*  you want to come in and negotiate with us to get rid of our nuclear weapons.
*  You told Gaddafi the same thing.
*  He said, hey, Gaddafi, get rid of your nuclear weapons program.
*  We'll leave you alone.
*  And then you went in and overthrew Gaddafi.
*  Why will this be any different with us?
*  And then you've got John Bolton as as then the national security director for
*  for Trump going on television or giving speeches saying, yeah, you know,
*  we're going to approach North Korea with the Libya model.
*  He said that.
*  And so when we wonder, like, hey, why aren't these?
*  And I think I think Trump was right.
*  And I've said it publicly, Trump is right to have direct negotiations with Kim Jong
*  Un, but he hasn't gotten anywhere.
*  And you've got to look at why.
*  And this is one of the reasons why continuing to say, hey, no, we're not going
*  to overthrow you in your government, Kim Jong Un.
*  But on the other hand, you're you're continuing the policies that directly
*  undermine your ability to to make that agreement that that'll be that'll that'll
*  hold and that'll stay.
*  And as a result now, you know, we have
*  North Korea that that's nuclear weapons program is continuing to to escalate.
*  Their capabilities are continuing to grow.
*  And it poses a threat not only to, you know, my folks in Hawaii, the people of
*  Hawaii, given our proximity to North Korea, but their capabilities now they're
*  extending across the West Coast, they're extending extending across the country,
*  posing a very direct existential threat to our country and to our people.
*  So you see how that decision that was made about Libya, these decisions that
*  are ongoing, you see that pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement, North Korea
*  says, hey, you guys made an agreement with them.
*  You got a different president elected tore up that agreement.
*  Why should we think that's going to be any different with us?
*  So these policy decisions that are being made are very directly connected in in
*  having the effect ultimately of undermining our national security and making
*  the American people less safe.
*  I'll tell you, I think a couple of things come up from just kind of on what you're
*  what you're saying, and this is kind of my perspective on it.
*  When you know, when we talk about, hey, when you go in somewhere, you've got to
*  know what the end state is.
*  You got to know what you're, you know, you got to know where you're going and when
*  you're going to leave, got to have an exit strategy.
*  What's really hard about that is we don't necessarily know.
*  And war is so unpredictable, unpredictable that you may, you know, there's, there's a
*  chance that you went in and killed Qaddafi and then all of a sudden some benevolent
*  person steps up and all of a sudden you've got this flourishing democracy.
*  Okay.
*  What are the chances of that?
*  No, very small, but you don't know that it's going to go into this, this
*  completely failed state.
*  You have high hopes.
*  Maybe your Intel people are saying you this.
*  It's like when we, you know, when we did the Bay of pigs, all the Cubans in
*  America were like, yep, as soon as you guys hit the beaches, all the Cubans are
*  going to be on our side.
*  It's going to be good to go.
*  All the Cubans that supported America were in America.
*  We showed up there and they were like, what are you doing?
*  No, this is our country.
*  So we don't necessarily know where we're going to go, which means you've got to
*  have once again, like the open mind to say, Oh, this isn't going the way we
*  thought it was going to go.
*  How are we going to adjust right now to prevent this from getting worse?
*  Which means what you really have to do is prior to intervening in other
*  countries, you have to assess what sacrifices you are willing to make to, to
*  get the result that is positive.
*  And it's, and those, those could be massive.
*  You know, I always talk about if you're going to go to war, you've got to have
*  the will and that will comes in two forms.
*  Number one is the will to kill.
*  Because when you go to war, you are going to be killing people.
*  You're going to be killing the enemy and you're going to be killing civilians.
*  And that's, that's not what we're trying to do.
*  And believe me, the U S military goes through great lengths to prevent that
*  from happening, but it is going to happen.
*  It's war.
*  So you have to be willing to kill.
*  You have to be willing to have that happen and you have to be willing to die
*  because when you go to war, there's going to be American kids that are
*  not going to come home.
*  And so you have to have those two wills.
*  That's before you go in.
*  So you can't look at it and say, well, you know, we can go into Libya.
*  We can move this guy and probably it'll turn out okay.
*  So we don't have to worry about what the sacrifices are going to be.
*  Another thing to think about when we went to war, when we went to
*  World War II, World War I, those kids, 18 years old, 17 years old, those kids
*  went to war until the war was over.
*  They, they, they went on deployment.
*  Like now, you know, in the, in the Navy, in the Marine Corps to six, seven
*  month deployment and the army, sometimes it's a 14 month deployment.
*  And then they're going to rotate back to the States in World War II.
*  It was like, Oh cool.
*  Yeah.
*  We're at war.
*  You'll be home when it's over.
*  So five years, four years.
*  If that was our attitude going into the war, this is so important to us that
*  Johnny is going to get on a ship and he's going to sail to the Pacific.
*  And if he comes home, it's going to be in three years, four years, five years.
*  That's what we're talking about.
*  That's the level of commitment we have.
*  So when we start looking at going into other countries, we need to start
*  thinking, okay, what level of commitment do we really have to make this
*  successful and, and like, even when I look at Iraq, you know, I was in Iraq,
*  fought in Iraq from a granular perspective, being on the ground battle
*  of Ramadi, 2006, the citizens of Ramadi, the normal citizens of Ramadi were
*  overjoyed that we were there and it was like we were, we were angels to go there
*  and help them get rid of these heinous Al Qaeda insurgents, which eventually
*  came, became ISIS.
*  Unfortunately, you know, we kind of, we, we did a great job.
*  Ramadi was the model of counterinsurgency for about seven years and it was less
*  violent than many cities in America.
*  And I had great pride and at least understood the sacrifices.
*  My friends that were killed, my friends that never came home, my friends that
*  won't get to have kids, right?
*  They did all that.
*  They gave all that.
*  And I was able to look around and say, you know what?
*  These folks in this foreign country, they're going to have an opportunity for
*  freedom.
*  And unfortunately, because of politics and whatever we said, okay, you know
*  what, we're, we're not staying there.
*  We're going to leave as soon as we left, everybody that had been on the ground
*  in Iraq was like, this is probably not a good idea.
*  This is probably not a good idea to bail out right now.
*  We don't need to leave a massive force there, but you know, if we leave a few,
*  you know, we leave a couple of brigades worth of men, then, oh, we're going to
*  handle any problems that happen.
*  Well, we didn't, we left completely.
*  And, and those, those insurgents that were there, they were like little embers
*  and they started to, they started to get fired up again.
*  And then the next thing you know, you had ISIS and by the way, ISIS marched
*  back into Ramadi and they, though the reports we got from people on the ground
*  that we knew was that ISIS came in and anyone that had worked with coalition
*  forces in many level, they would murder the whole family.
*  There's about 500 families that were completely murdered.
*  So when we talk about these things, we have to be very sure about what we're
*  going to do.
*  We have to recognize that we can't predict everything because we can't, I
*  don't care how good you are and care how many analysis you put on something.
*  When you start throwing human nature into a leadership vacuum, all these things
*  are going to break out and it's going to, it can go very, very bad.
*  It can go well too, but it can go very, very bad.
*  And so what are we willing to sacrifice?
*  What are we willing to spend?
*  What are we willing to spend?
*  How many of our brothers and sisters in uniform are we willing to sacrifice to
*  make this happen and how does it help our national security?
*  I believe right now, had we stayed there, Iraq would be a pretty strong positive
*  place right now if we had kind of completed the mission the way that we
*  should have again, when we go back and we say, okay, well, what, what, what
*  countries is it worth going into?
*  You know, where are we going to go?
*  What, what are we going to do?
*  You know, where are we going to go?
*  What, how do we draw that line?
*  How do we make that decision?
*  For me, this is, this is what we do as leaders.
*  What we do as leaders, we look at a situation and, and sometimes, you know,
*  you got to ask yourself, do we have a moral obligation to go somewhere?
*  If there's a genocide happening, if there's another Rwanda happening where
*  800,000 tootsies are killed in a hundred days with machetes, if that's going on,
*  do we have a moral obligation to, to, to try and do something to help that?
*  Hey, that's a decision you have to meet.
*  That's a hard decision to make as leader.
*  Cause guess what?
*  You're going to lose 30, 40, a hundred Americans that are going in there and
*  try and shut this thing down.
*  But that's the, that's the type of thing we need to think about.
*  And that's why as a leader, you want to have an open mind.
*  You want to have your ego completely out of it because it's really easy to say,
*  Oh, this is where America, this is what we do with this is we're going to win.
*  It's like, no, actually we made a bad decision and we're actually leaving
*  right now because we think the expenditure from here on out is going to be too high.
*  Unfortunately, I think in Iraq, we paid the upfront expenditure.
*  We had invested lives and treasure to try and get that place stabilized.
*  We had done a decent job.
*  We were almost there and we left early and all of a sudden we look around and go,
*  but that's why these things are important to, to think about thoroughly.
*  As Tulsi said, before you go, we don't know what's going to happen.
*  And you know, if you're going to get in a street fight, Joe, like you, you look
*  as, as capable as you are, as capable as I am at street fighting, that's great.
*  There's that 10% chance that that guy pulls out a knife and sticks it in your
*  neck. Are you willing to sacrifice that?
*  Now, if the guy's doing something to a innocent person and you go, you know what?
*  I got to take that risk right now. I'm going to go in and I'm going to get this
*  thing handled. Those are hard decisions to make. And we have to think through them.
*  If there was very well said,
*  if there was one thing when I brought you two together that I thought that you
*  might disagree on,
*  it would be this stance on non-interventionalist foreign policy.
*  I don't know if that's even the right word, disagree.
*  But I think there's nuances to these decisions and these things you talk about.
*  I think you would agree with that. And Rwanda,
*  what you talked about is a great example.
*  Do you have a moral responsibility to go in when you see some atrocities being
*  committed? I mean, that's one thing that people either pro or con on is,
*  is the United States, are we the police force of the world?
*  Are we the moral high ground?
*  Yeah, I don't just listening to you, Jock. I think that,
*  I don't think that we actually disagree very much.
*  You can tell me if I'm wrong, but I think there are important distinctions to be
*  made. You know,
*  my opposition to regime change wars should not be mistaken for isolationism,
*  nor should it be mistaken for anything other than what it is.
*  Let's stop fighting regime change wars that are so often waged and the guys of
*  humanitarianism,
*  but they are pushed forward for other reasons or their political reasons or
*  corporate reasons or whatever. And they,
*  they try to get the sympathy of the American people and they use the same words.
*  You know, they, this guy's a monster. This is this.
*  When you actually peel back the layers,
*  there are ulterior motives in place that set the pretext to use our military to
*  go and overthrow a regime in another country or topple a dictator.
*  That ultimately ends up more often than not resulting in,
*  in the lives of the suffering, more suffering for the people in the countries.
*  We're supposedly trying to go and help. However,
*  I've been very strong on this. We're talking about Al Qaeda, ISIS,
*  these other jihadist terrorists who are a threat to our national security.
*  We need to stay strong in defeating that threat.
*  That is our function as warriors,
*  as service members in the military is to go and protect and defend the American
*  people and to take out those who seek to do us harm.
*  In the case of a genocide like Rwanda,
*  where there is killing of people at a massive scale,
*  we look to see, Hey,
*  is there something that we can do to help end this genocide?
*  Can we work with other countries?
*  Can we bring together a coalition that can effectively stop this genocide?
*  And if the answer to that is yes, then we should do so.
*  But the problem that we've seen a lot more recently is
*  you'll see the word genocide being used very loosely
*  to as an excuse to go and say, Hey, well, you know, go,
*  go and topple this dictator who is inflicting a genocide on their own people
*  without it actually meeting the criteria of a genocide.
*  When really there's a conflict within the, within the country,
*  whether it be based on politics or power or whatever,
*  that's a very different thing than this.
*  Then then like what we saw in Rwanda, for example. So as, as you say,
*  I agree, I think,
*  I think before we go in and make this decision to take military action,
*  we've really got to look very carefully at what is the situation?
*  Where is the information that we're coming from?
*  Is it coming from people who are pushing their own narrative for their own
*  interests? Um,
*  where they're not really caring about the interests of the people in these
*  countries or the interests of the American people and our troops,
*  they got their own thing going on.
*  We've got to be able to know that and understand that and approach this decision.
*  Um, not based on a, on a knee jerk emotional reaction.
*  And Jaco, what you were talking about earlier is so important here that when
*  you are on one side and the other side's doing something, no matter what,
*  you can never say, well, that makes sense. You hate that other side.
*  This is a perfect example. When Trump wanted to pull people out of Syria,
*  people on the left were saying no,
*  people on the left were supporting military action in Syria. And I was like,
*  this is, this is bonkers. It's weird.
*  Yes. And it's because they despise. That's it.
*  They completely hate Trump. Yeah. And I mean,
*  I know you got friends that hate Trump more than anything in the world.
*  I got friends that hate Trump more than anything in the world.
*  And it doesn't matter what he does.
*  They have such a passionate hatred for him that he could,
*  he could just, you know, cure cancer and people would say, well,
*  he did it for his own good.
*  I have friends that hate him and I have friends that like him and I have friends
*  that love him. And that's what's hilarious to me. When,
*  whenever he does something,
*  I love to call the friends who hate him and just have them scream and yell and
*  rant about it and go, why are you so worked up, man?
*  This is like this quid pro quo thing.
*  I've never heard that goddamn expression more in my entire life.
*  Like who the hell ever thought that quid pro quo would be like a gigantic
*  talking point on every single major news, news station, every newspaper.
*  It's a, it's a weird time conflict wise,
*  and in terms of just people's inability to just look at things with nuance and
*  look at the complexity of these conversations and just say you're on team
*  Trump or you're not, you're with us or you're against us. You're,
*  you're pro this or you're, you're anti-democracy.
*  You know, you talk about how Trump's kind of the guy for the assholes,
*  like the assholes.
*  And at the other end of the spectrum is people that do that,
*  they're, they, they just can't believe it.
*  It insults their very being that this guy is, is,
*  is the president of the United States. Yeah.
*  It insults their very being and they're so offended by it that it doesn't matter
*  what he does.
*  It's true. But then there's so many people that are like, you know what,
*  at least I, at least I'm not getting robbed of my taxes.
*  At least I'm not getting called a bigot because I don't want six foot six men
*  who transitioned to be in a woman last week to play against my daughter in a
*  basketball game. You know what I'm saying? I mean, this is,
*  this is the world we're living in where people like I'm going with Trump.
*  He's he's talking. Look, Kanye West is in the white house. He's not a racist.
*  And this is where we're living now. It's this,
*  this weird society that we have today where we're,
*  there's so much coming at us and you can't pay attention to all of us in
*  between all the pop culture nonsense and the, the fucking ice caps are melting,
*  the environment, the oceans on fire. Everyone's scared of everything.
*  And then on top of that, there's all this political stuff that's going on.
*  You don't have time to pay attention to all of it.
*  If you tell me you're abreast of all of it, I'll tell you you're a liar.
*  There's no way. Let me say something else as well.
*  So I have a consulting company and I go around the country and I talk to every
*  level in the chain of command, including the frontline troops,
*  guys that work construction, guys that work gas oil, guys that are out,
*  do linemen that are output, you know, at manufacturing, everything,
*  those people there, they're met. Most of them,
*  they're not out on the fringe somewhere. You know what they're thinking about?
*  They're not thinking about what Trump's in. They're actually thinking about,
*  you know, how they're going to,
*  if they're going to get to take a couple of days off over their Labor Day
*  weekend, they're getting thinking about how they have,
*  do they have to save enough money that they can get a new truck?
*  That's what they're concerned about. They're not thinking about this.
*  They're trying to live their normal lives. And you know,
*  when I was on Ben Shapiro's program and you'll, he,
*  he just came at me like, it's so all this divisiveness. And I said, well,
*  you live, I mean, that guy lives at ground zero for political,
*  just detonation. Right. And I said, that's not normal life. You're not,
*  it's not normal for everyone else, Ben. Like I get it. That's what it's like for you,
*  but that's not what it's like for everyone else.
*  So even as the country seems so divided,
*  you got to remember the people that we hear that are so divisive are the loud
*  mouths on either end.
*  And most people aren't getting in Twitter fights about who,
*  whatever they're not, they're out trying to make a living.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know what's something that you and I think can relate to is that a lot
*  of these people don't have anything that brings them together.
*  And I think they should all join a jujitsu.
*  They politics and all that stuff aside, the people that,
*  as weird as it seems,
*  the people that choke you and you choke and you get arm barred by those are your
*  brothers and sisters. And you realize like that the way we look at politics,
*  the way we look at decisions and you know what you can agree or disagree on the
*  direction of the country, there's a lack of community.
*  There's a real lack of understanding that we're supposed to be as the United
*  States of America, we're supposed to be a giant community.
*  We're supposed to be a family and this is not how people are viewing it.
*  Now we're, we're viewing it like there's this gigantic battleground that the,
*  the world is in an uprising right now. And I don't necessarily think that's true.
*  You know what else too is. And I hear you say this time sometimes,
*  and I get what you're saying, but you know, you'll say, Hey,
*  this person's in a cubicle and they hate their job and they hate their life.
*  And that's like, of course most people aren't like that.
*  I get it that there's some people that ended up in jobs that they don't want to
*  do. And I certainly couldn't see Joe Rogan sitting in a cubicle or on a
*  manufacturing line, but like I got a factory up in Maine.
*  These people that are up there working, they've, they love it.
*  They're Americans that love hard work and they're building an American product.
*  And it's like, Oh, okay. This is what I do. They're in, they'll stay extra time.
*  They'll do whatever they can. They love it.
*  They're working for you though. They're excited. Yeah, but they're still working.
*  They're still working nine hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, you know, working on it,
*  on it in a factory. That's what they're doing. And they love it.
*  And you know what they want? They want to have a good economy.
*  They don't want the government to mess with them. It's like, okay, that's,
*  that's what they want. So it's weird how the social media that we're doing,
*  that we complain about is, is just a, it's,
*  it's an amplification of the extremes. That's what it is. Right.
*  And most people aren't sitting there arguing about what Trump did or what
*  Hillary Clinton did.
*  It's a gigantic, I mean a small,
*  hugely small percentage of the population that is doing all the discourse on
*  Twitter. It's really tiny.
*  And if you look at it, there's,
*  there's a few people that I follow that I don't follow.
*  I just haven't bookmarked just because they're just bananas and I'll go to their
*  page and just look,
*  and they're literally arguing with people about politics or whatever gender
*  studies and they're doing it 12 hours a day. They're just at it. They're,
*  they're just frothing at the mouth, sweating palms,
*  just phone slipping out of their hand,
*  banging away with their thumb and they're doing it all day.
*  Do you think that,
*  or I think that that has something to do with the fact that they're living some
*  kind of a decent life. I mean, as far as they have food, they have,
*  they have an iPhone, there's no wolves in the streets and they're not worried
*  about it. And that's why when we talk about worldwide problems,
*  what I think is what you do,
*  the best possible thing that we can do in this country to help all these
*  problems, every single problem that we've talked about, build a strong economy,
*  build a strong global economy. That's the best thing you can do.
*  Build a business, make people have a little bit more money. Yes.
*  That's how you get it done. And that's why, you know, like from my perspective,
*  you know, you get involved in a business,
*  you start a business, you move, you help people,
*  you build a product that people want, you build a business,
*  you help the economy and that is what equalizes the world more than anything
*  else.
*  Well, that's also argument for team Trump. I mean, that's Trump's argument is,
*  what he's doing is he's boosting up business in the United States and whether
*  or not you love him or hate him,
*  what he's doing is having a positive net effect on the global economy or
*  particularly the United States economy. And that's going to make us stronger.
*  I mean, this is whether you love him or hate him,
*  you've got to look at that objectively and go, okay, well,
*  is there any merit to what he's saying? Well, I don't understand economics.
*  I don't, I just trust people that study it. I don't have the time,
*  but they're saying yes, in some ways he's doing things that benefit business.
*  I think that, I think that the,
*  the trouble with the approach that Trump has taken, you know, he obviously,
*  he's, he's got his shtick and he's got the things that he's got at the talking
*  points, the things that he says, but he is continuing this
*  mentality.
*  When we look at like the trade war with China and, you know,
*  the trade conflict that he started with Canada and now with different European
*  countries, it is,
*  it's the zero sum mentality that in order for us and our economy and our people
*  to win, then the people or the economies of these other countries have to suffer.
*  And that's where I agree with what you just said, Jaco, about, you know,
*  building a strong, helping grow a strong global economy,
*  gosh, shared prosperity. I mean,
*  you look at the opportunity that would provide for peace and less conflict
*  rather than what we're seeing.
*  And it says is playing out in real time with China right now,
*  where you see this trade war that is escalating a tariff war that's escalating.
*  I have met with farmers in Iowa who are hurting tremendously because of this
*  trade and tariff war, far manufacturers, small business owners,
*  and the danger of this kind of,
*  an economic war can very easily turn into a hot war.
*  And again,
*  we're talking about a nuclear armed country where these ever escalating
*  tensions push us closer and closer to the brink of, of nuclear catastrophe,
*  something nuclear strategists are saying that we are, we are closer to now than,
*  than at least in a generation. I think this is where,
*  you know,
*  the economic war is going to be a hot war.
*  Then, then at least in a generation. I think this is where, uh,
*  the foreign policy that I'm, that I'm, uh,
*  putting forward to the American people that I will lead with is one that is
*  focused on, on engaging with other countries, being that force for good,
*  focusing on cooperation, uh, rather than conflict in every respect,
*  being able to work out, yeah, we, we do have trade differences with China.
*  There's no question about that,
*  but being able to do so in a way that is not further pushing us closer and
*  closer to the brink of a hot war and potentially, uh, with disastrous.
*  Can you get into that? Like, what is the trade? What is the issue with China?
*  Like what, what is Trump feels like we don't have a fair deal, right?
*  That's what he's stated.
*  I think that there, I think his, his, um, diagnosis, I think is, is correct.
*  I think that's widely accepted. There's, you know,
*  ongoing trade imbalance with China and some of the issues with, with IP theft.
*  I think those are the top two that, um,
*  that come to the forefront.
*  The problem is not with the diagnosis of the issue.
*  It is how he's going about it in a very, um, uh, you know,
*  shoot from the hip kind of way. I mean, he's,
*  he's like almost conducting his negotiations via Twitter.
*  He's got negotiators who are sitting across in the Chinese and Hey, okay,
*  we're getting closer to a deal. We're going to work this out.
*  Then all of a sudden something goes out on Twitter and they're like, Whoa, man,
*  like the whole thing just changed, which, you know, it's,
*  it's maybe funny when, when,
*  when Trump is putting out something with Trump tower in Greenland,
*  but when there are such real consequences of the day to day lives of the
*  American people, uh, and when we're,
*  we're pushing us closer and closer to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe,
*  escalating these tensions with countries like China and with Russia, this is,
*  I mean, it's, it's serious. The stakes are very high. And, and so this is,
*  this is more about how Trump is doing this in such an irresponsible way that's
*  creating destabilization and uncertainty, uh,
*  both with our economy and also in our relationships with other countries.
*  It's everything that made him famous as a businessman, all the brashness,
*  all the shooting from the hip.
*  The idea that everybody thought that he was going to change when he got into
*  the white house is hilarious. The guy's 73. Oh, I actually,
*  you can laugh at me then because I thought, well, he got elected. I was like,
*  okay, well, this is going to be interesting to see him, you know,
*  kind of become presidential and then like whatever one day into it,
*  you're sending out a tweet about somebody else. Like Rosie O'Donnell's a pig.
*  And he's, yeah, exactly. So crazy. But, but he's,
*  but what that means is he's unpredictable, right?
*  And so he's the guy in the bar that you look at and you're like, well,
*  I'm just going to give that guy a little extra clearance cause he looks like
*  he's crazy. Right. So I think that might be what he either thinks he's doing
*  or, or not. But here's the interesting thing about this. Okay. And I,
*  I don't want to quote numbers on these things cause I'm not sure what they are
*  right now, but I got a factory in Maine. We make clothes, we make jeans,
*  we make jujitsu geese. All right.
*  All made in America from the cotton that's grown in America. It's woven.
*  We weave it in our factory. We're doing everything here. Now there's things like
*  labor labor is more expensive in America cause we pay our workers because they're
*  they're awesome. And, and so it costs a little bit more to build the product.
*  If you have a Chinese company that can make a jujitsu gi and they have,
*  they're paying their workers a dollar a day, literally.
*  And then they can ship that ghee over here. Well,
*  then they can beat us on the price. Now their quality is not as good,
*  but they can beat us on the price. And someone goes, okay, well I can pay,
*  you know, 70 bucks for this Chinese key or a hundred bucks for this American
*  key. Okay. I'm going to buy the Chinese one at 70 bucks. So,
*  and this actually, this part happened again, the details, I can't quite remember,
*  but they said, Hey, we're, we're not going to put a tariff on geese coming into
*  America because they can't be made here because they can't be made here.
*  And guess what? Specific to specific. Wow. It was like, okay.
*  Can't be made. It can't be made here. And it was actually pretty true.
*  When was this? I don't know. I don't know. Again, I'm,
*  I'm stepping out on a ledge here. I'm going to have my buddy Pete come on this
*  podcast where he can, he can forever though. No, they haven't,
*  but then they've been made in Pakistan and China and there was one company that
*  was making them down in Brazil. But we said, no, actually they,
*  they can't be made here and we're making them here.
*  And they put a 7% tariff on geese from overseas.
*  And so now that kind of equalizes the price.
*  Ours is a little bit more expensive, but it's made in America and it's higher
*  quality. So people say, okay, well buy them here.
*  Are you the only company in America that has made these?
*  American companies, they're buying them overseas. 100%. Yep. Wow.
*  I didn't know that. Yep. Yep. And what's your company? Just so everybody knows,
*  it's called it's origin origin, main.com and origin, main.com and
*  M A I N E. Yep. Main estate. I was talking to my business partner and I was like,
*  I was in the airport and I go, Hey man,
*  how many people do you know that train Jiu-Jitsu? And he's like, Oh no,
*  you know, like 30. And I go, how many people do you know that,
*  that have a pair of jeans? And he said, everybody. And I said,
*  why don't we make jeans? So we started making jeans. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's a good call because everybody has jeans because I was in the airport and I'm
*  looking around and you know, it was whatever.
*  98 people out of a hundred are wearing jeans because we're Americans.
*  And is there anything more American to make it an American company than jeans?
*  Do you make jeans with stretch in them? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That is the important thing. That's every day. Yeah. That's like,
*  you know, otherwise you're, you know, making them out of coal.
*  I didn't know that was your company. I, I,
*  I think one of the first podcasts I listened to from your show at the very end,
*  you and echo Charles, we're talking about origin. You're like,
*  I'm wearing origin jeans and this and that about origin. I was like, dang,
*  they must be pretty good sponsors.
*  What is that boot company that you're, you're involved with origin?
*  We're making boots as well. And this is the,
*  this is the awesome thing about this is you're from new England. Well,
*  in that part of in Maine used to be like the textile and clothing capital of
*  America for sure. They made boots, they made bass, they made,
*  they made all these things, bass boots, bass shoes.
*  They made all these textiles up in Maine.
*  And when the trade war started, it all went away.
*  It all went away in the seventies and the eighties.
*  And they literally took those machines and shipped them overseas to India and
*  Pakistan. And there was my buddy Pete, there was one loom.
*  You know what a loom is? Yeah. It's,
*  it's this big thing that's got like eight billion parts to it.
*  He wanted to get a loom because he realized that the only way you could get
*  material for a G was to weave it yourself.
*  Otherwise you had to buy it from China or Pakistan.
*  So he goes up to Lewiston, Maine.
*  There's a 500,000 square foot abandoned factory.
*  It has one loom in it. Rusty hasn't been used in 30 years.
*  And he find,
*  he found this old timer that used to work on the looms him and his buddies.
*  They went and dragged this thing out of this factory.
*  They brought it into this little factory that he had built himself out in the
*  middle of the woods and started taking apart this loom and reassembling it and
*  started weaving, weaving material and making geese.
*  Now that was five years ago. We, we started working together.
*  We merged together three years ago. He had whatever four employees back there.
*  We have 60 now we're, we're making stuff all the time.
*  But this is when I talk about building the economy. That's what I'm talking about.
*  And so these areas up in new England, up in Maine, that used to be the,
*  the so productive. Well, there's not, there wasn't jobs up there.
*  And now it's like, oh yeah, we, we got,
*  we got jobs and we're going to continue to build that company and just bring
*  manufacturing back to America.
*  So these are things that I think help when I talk about the global economy,
*  you know, who's going to want American genes made at origin in Maine.
*  You know, who's going to want those people in China, people in Japan,
*  they're going to want these genes because they're there's, they've got soul, man.
*  They got soul. They're real.
*  That's one of the best commercials I've ever heard.
*  That's where Muhammad Ali knocked out Sonny Liston. Yeah, there you go.
*  That's a, that's a great place to start a company like that. That's amazing.
*  I think, I think that's where, as we,
*  as we talk about overall trade policy and, and where we've gone wrong,
*  you're saying, you know, what happened back in the seventies and eighties,
*  you saw how, you know, these, these trade,
*  these massive trade deals that were put in place,
*  really the people who benefited most from them were the multinational
*  corporations, you were exporting these jobs. And it was just those mom and pop,
*  those small business owners and manufacturers who suffered the most.
*  And that's where I think, as we look at, you know,
*  trade negotiations with China,
*  as we look at some of these trade deals with countries like India and others,
*  that's where we've got to get back to rather than just making sure the largest
*  corporations have a seat at the trade negotiations tables.
*  We've got to have those small business voices, those small manufacturers,
*  and make sure that our policy is actually helping empower and
*  strengthen the backbone of our economy that has been before,
*  and that we need to bring it back to that helps improve the quality of life for
*  the people who are working, you know,
*  working in Maine manufacturing your jeans and your geese. And this is,
*  and having such great pride in doing so, knowing like, Hey man,
*  yeah, this is made in Maine. I've seen your packaging. It says, we, the people,
*  like what more powerful words are there?
*  They're the first words of our constitution for a reason.
*  That is what should be at the forefront of our,
*  our policies across the board and all these different issues.
*  If the first interest is not we, the people, as it has been for so long,
*  then we see what goes wrong. And then the consequence, we, the people suffer.
*  So what's going on right now, the consequences of this issue,
*  this trade war with China, where it's really hitting, you were saying, is,
*  there's people in America that are, they're selling things to China.
*  Yeah. Well, I give you one, I mean,
*  we've heard a lot from like corn and soybean farmers in Iowa.
*  That's a story that's been in the news a lot.
*  We were at a farmer's market in I think I was in Des Moines recently,
*  and we're kind of walking through and picking up some food and veggies and stuff
*  like that. And we stopped at like an,
*  an apple orchard that had a whole table with all these different,
*  beautiful, amazing apples.
*  We started talking to the guy, him and his wife run this apple orchard.
*  And he said, you know,
*  the trade and tariff war with China has hit us really hard. I said, wow,
*  that's surprising to me. Tell me more. And he talked about how I said,
*  do you sell, do you export your apples to China? And he said, no, not at all.
*  We sell our apples in Iowa and in the Midwest. And that's it.
*  Local and regional customers.
*  What happened was the apple farms in Washington state selling
*  honey crisp apples that they do export to China.
*  When this trade and tariff war started, they couldn't anymore.
*  That market was completely blocked off to them.
*  And so what they started doing was shipping their apples to the Midwest
*  at a fraction of the price that the local Iowa apple farmer was able
*  to charge to his clients,
*  whether they're restaurants or supermarkets or whatever.
*  And he lost tens of thousands of dollars just over the last year as a
*  result. And this year he said, is not looking very good as well.
*  As long as this thing continues, it's going to,
*  it's going to have a disproportionate negative impact on his family farm,
*  essentially. So, you know, there, there are the,
*  the obvious kind of headline grabbing impacts,
*  but then you look at the downstream, you look at, you know,
*  a friend of mine has a small business that he does do business with China.
*  He has things that are made in China and there's a level of uncertainty.
*  He doesn't know like, uh, how far ahead he can plan to purchase,
*  how much should he plan to purchase? Are things going to get better?
*  So you should just do a little bit now and then wait,
*  or just the level of uncertainty and destabilization it's created. Um,
*  I think has been, uh, the,
*  the most negative impact on people here at home.
*  There's some legitimate concerns too though, right? Like Huawei is a weird one.
*  That, that one, I'm a kind of a,
*  there are legitimate concerns. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I'm kind of a tech dork.
*  And, uh, I love looking at one,
*  one of the things that China does particularly well, particularly Huawei is,
*  uh, innovation with cell phone technology. I mean,
*  they make the most spectacular cameras. They, they're like,
*  they were way ahead of the curve on a lot of different features and they
*  continue to do that. And they were selling them in America up to a point.
*  And then that cut off and it cut off with the first time I've ever heard
*  national security concerns because of a cell phone company.
*  And it just makes you go, Whoa, whoa, whoa, is this real?
*  And it's real cloudy. Like you talk to people on the tech side and they said,
*  this doesn't make any sense.
*  But then you talk to people on the intelligence side and they said,
*  this makes all the sense in the world. Like this is a,
*  this is a shifty company that's inexorably tied to the Chinese government.
*  There's no difference between the government and this company. They,
*  they are moving. They have a long game. And this,
*  this long game is provide backdoor access so that
*  data can be stolen, have that built into systems.
*  And they've caught them doing this before. So they're like, we, we, this is a,
*  you got a finger in the damn here and this whole thing can come tumbling down if
*  you don't stop this company. Yeah. I mean, I,
*  I think some of those concerns are very valid. Um, when you're,
*  when you're talking about Huawei, but I think also just, uh,
*  the issue of building these backdoor entries into our technology is
*  something that we are very concerned about both happening here at home.
*  This has been an issue that we've been dealing with in Congress where, um,
*  because of provisions that were passed in the Patriot act,
*  there were loopholes that have been exploited by some of our tech companies,
*  um,
*  working with some of our intelligence agencies to build these back doors into
*  their systems, uh, into their programs or into their hardware,
*  which directly violates the civil liberties and fourth amendment rights for
*  us as Americans.
*  And I think that points to the bigger issue of,
*  of civil liberties and privacy, uh, and the growing,
*  um,
*  power that the tech industry has that we've got to be very,
*  very, I, in my opinion, concerned and careful of, uh,
*  and actually exercising the kind of oversight and accountability, um,
*  that we should have been doing frankly, a long time ago.
*  Tech is a really important conversation to have with you right now.
*  You're in the middle of this lawsuit with Google. Explain that.
*  So, uh, the first debate that we had in this presidential election,
*  you know,
*  we had hoped that I would do well going into it and that people would go and
*  start their internet search and say, Hey, who is Tulsi Gabbard?
*  I've never heard of her before. And so we went and got it, you know,
*  the Google ads set up, got them approved.
*  Everything was ready to rock and roll. Uh,
*  I was the most Googled candidate of the night, uh,
*  as I have been for every debate that I've participated in.
*  The issue was during that first debate, uh, you know, while,
*  while that peak period was happening,
*  our Google ad account was suspended by Google with no explanation
*  whatsoever. No, like, Hey,
*  there was nothing like, Hey, you guys screwed up, fix this.
*  It's Bill. How are you? Good to hear from y'all.
*  That is so sketchy. It's so sketchy. And it, and so, you know,
*  our tech guys are freaking out. They're like, man,
*  this is what we were waiting for. And now you guys took our account down,
*  tell us what we got to do to get it back up. And, uh, a,
*  we didn't hear back for a while. Once we started hearing back,
*  we heard back from different people with different answers,
*  nothing clear cut to say you did this wrong, fix this.
*  We'll put your account back. Nothing. And then all of a sudden, you know,
*  hours and hours had gone by and then our account was reinstated without any
*  explanation about what happened. And you know, this is,
*  this is bigger than just the loss in opportunity that,
*  that my campaign had, uh,
*  because this happened on that night during that peak period,
*  it's a bigger issue about the power that this corporation has in
*  Google in interfering essentially in fair elections and in what kind of
*  information they are willing to put in front of people.
*  Don't they own Boston dynamics too? Does Google on Boston dynamics?
*  They did and they sold it. Good move.
*  Bring it.
*  Jacko's ready for the real black mirror.
*  I'll tell you what you get.
*  You get extra double bonus credit from me right now Tulsi,
*  cause that right there is so crazy and free to be like, yeah, it's bad for me,
*  but it's also bad for the American people.
*  I would have been stuck at bad for me. That is so gnarly.
*  They did that and it's so transparent and very few people talked about it and
*  very few people know about it. Exactly. That's what it was.
*  So stunning about it. It's like there's people pulling strings who,
*  why not undefined and no investigation into it until you
*  put out this lawsuit. There's really no way to find out. Yeah.
*  It started to force that conversation that we're continuing to push to the
*  forefront about how particularly with Google and Facebook,
*  the inordinate amount of power that they have to,
*  as we sit in and type in a Google search for whatever, or you know,
*  what's popping up on our Facebook feed, they control that.
*  I think that we have a real issue in this country with advertising in those
*  things and in Google and Facebook,
*  a real issue that it's never really been fully discussed because those things
*  just sort of came up out of nowhere. You know, we had social networks,
*  we had my space and we had, you know, we didn't think anything of it.
*  And then all of a sudden, not only are they here,
*  but they have this extraordinary amount of influence. They have algorithms.
*  So it's not just, they're putting out what people put out.
*  They have algorithms that figure out what you're into and then show you that.
*  So if you're just really in a conflict, which most people are,
*  they're just showing you conflict all day long and it's getting everybody riled
*  up. So it's having a direct effect, whether it's planned and coordinated or not.
*  It's having a direct effect on discourse in this country.
*  And I think it's one of the reasons why what you were talking about before,
*  where you're either out with us or you're against us.
*  And it's never been more hard line than it has been right now.
*  And all of this is because of advertising money and advertising. What?
*  Like, what are you even selling? All you're doing,
*  you're just a portal to connect people with each other. And through that,
*  you're gaining an insane amount of influence and an extraordinary amount of
*  money is being generated. And we never agreed to it. It's just,
*  we just looked down and we saw the ad. Oh, what are they selling? Oh yeah. Okay.
*  That looks like a nice watch. And then we just,
*  and then everybody's just getting bought and sold and it's happening
*  to a point now where that is one of the main town halls,
*  one of the main places where people discuss ideas in the world,
*  is these social media networks and they're not getting smaller.
*  They're only getting bigger.
*  So they keep growing and they keep stacking up and whether it's Google or
*  Facebook or any of the Twitter, any of these,
*  the amount of influence they have is insane and they're just people, right?
*  They're just people. These are just regular folks. Like I know Jack Dorsey.
*  He's a nice guy. He's a regular fucking person.
*  The fact that this guy has so much power,
*  this company has so much power that any of these companies have so much power.
*  We are not ready for this and this is happening right under our noses and it's
*  happening so quickly.
*  And then when something like your Google situation happens where it's like,
*  Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, not only are you profiting,
*  but now you're fucking pulling strings. You're showing us your pulling strings.
*  And everybody's like, what's going on? Nothing.
*  Oh shit. Spended whatever.
*  They're interfering with democracy and this weird sort of semi legal way,
*  you know, like you could just say they violated policy. Like what policy,
*  what policy did you violate? Did they just cancel your ad?
*  They still have not told us that.
*  That's insane.
*  The policy you violated was being a viable candidate for president of the United
*  States of America.
*  Not only a viable candidate, but one that's saying, Hey,
*  you guys are too fucking big.
*  I'm going to break up these monopolies and provide the kinds of oversight and
*  accountability that will protect the consumer that will protect the American
*  people or protect fair and honest discourse, protect freedom of speech.
*  That's the issue. And that's, frankly, that's a difference, um,
*  between me and somebody like, uh, mayor Pete, for example, uh,
*  other candidates and he's not the only one,
*  but other candidates who refuse to take a strong position in
*  recognizing the threat to, um,
*  our public discourse and our democracy that these tech
*  giants have really within the hands of just a few people. Um, you have, um,
*  I think this is just broke in the news recently, uh, Mark Zuckerberg, who,
*  you know, people were taught he's like, wanted to run for president,
*  not that long ago and was seriously considering it. And, and, you know,
*  he's trying to start his own, um, cryptocurrency wants to have his own currency
*  that he controls. Like the amount of power this guy has,
*  and that he wants to continue to grow, uh, is, is so dangerous.
*  He decided not to run for president,
*  but he and his wife started emailing, uh,
*  mayor Pete's campaign manager saying, Hey, here's some guys we think you should
*  hire for your campaign.
*  And so they hired two of Zuckerberg's Facebook guys who are now working for
*  mayor Pete's campaign. And so they're going to have a seat at the table.
*  Should this guy get elected,
*  which means Facebook's going to have a seat at the table.
*  Nevermind if he gets elected when he's got two people that are inside track at
*  Facebook that show up there. I don't know if you've ever done anything with
*  Facebook as far as advertising,
*  but like people that understand how all that stuff works,
*  I've talked to him before it's a whole science behind it.
*  So now that they're in there, he should get a big bump across the board.
*  I don't know Mark Zuckerberg, but I don't like the way he drinks water.
*  He takes those little sips when he's being grilled. Have you ever seen that?
*  Did the weirdest little sips of water. I don't, I don't trust a person, man,
*  woman or non-binary creature that takes sips of water like that.
*  That is just not the way you drink water. When you drink water is like,
*  I'm thirsty. I'm going to have some water.
*  That's how you show me how he did it.
*  I'll show you. We'll play the video. It's like this. He's like,
*  he puts this glass up to his mouth and like touches the lips of the wife.
*  It's like a robot. Why? Here we go. Watch this. Look at this.
*  He's a robot pretending to drink. Watch this.
*  What the fuck is happening here? What is happening here?
*  The water didn't move. I never noticed this.
*  Barely moved. It barely like slid.
*  I love that Jamie was able to find that so fast.
*  So, so Tulsi, let me ask you this from a strategic perspective.
*  All right. Do you feel like these moves,
*  like you coming out strong against Google, Facebook,
*  saying that you could break up those types of monopolies strategically.
*  Are you thinking right now, well, maybe that wasn't the best call because,
*  you know,
*  you could have not been so strong against them and played along with them a
*  little bit.
*  Maybe they look at you and go through the list that that Joe went through
*  earlier, which is you're a veteran. You're a woman. You're a woman of color.
*  You're from Hawaii. You've got this experience. Congresswoman. Yeah.
*  Congresswoman. You got all this stuff. They could look at you go out. Yeah,
*  she's good. We can get her on our side.
*  And then maybe, you know, increase your chances of getting elected.
*  Then you get elected. Then you go, okay, you know what?
*  I've thought about this and guess what? Uh,
*  we're not doing it that way and I'm going to break you guys up.
*  Do you think strategically or is that just your, the type of person you are is
*  like, you know what? I'm just going to,
*  I'm just going to tell the truth from the get go. Is that basically what we're
*  doing?
*  I'm going to tell the truth and call it straight no matter what. And, and, uh,
*  you know, no matter who, who I'm dealing with because, uh,
*  A that's who I am.
*  And B people are sick and tired of politicians who play this game and do this
*  political dance as they're trying to get people elected and be like, okay,
*  well if I just, if I just say this,
*  or if I just kind of cozy up to these people or these interests,
*  they can help me get elected. And then when I win,
*  then I'm going to do the right thing. Well, guess what? As you, when you win,
*  all of you, okay, you've got to win the next reelection.
*  That means I need more money from wall street. I need more money from Google.
*  I need more money from these guys. So I can't say anything to piss them off.
*  Just yet. I'm going to wait until I get reelected.
*  Then that's when I'm really going to start to do the right thing. And,
*  and I think people across party lines are sick and tired of the same old
*  politicians who say one thing and do another,
*  and instead are looking for real leadership.
*  It just seems like there's a tipping point that we will have to reach before
*  that actually happens. I don't know if we're there yet. It's kind of like,
*  you know, when, when I was on your podcast for the first time, Joe,
*  and you told me to start a podcast at that time.
*  I don't know if you know this or not. It was, it was 2015.
*  The stats were that 17% of America were listening to podcasts.
*  And now it's something like 78% in four years, just totally different.
*  But when you talk about Tulsi having a podcast, which you absolutely should,
*  and by the way, all you need to do is go and do a question and answer town hall
*  with people, have somebody record it,
*  splice it up to the good stuff and put that out 20 minutes long.
*  People start to learn how you are. Yes. But my,
*  my point is that that change happened. And right now, you know,
*  Joe Rogan has like the most powerful voice in media in a very short period of
*  time. But five years ago, he didn't, you know, five years ago, it'd be like,
*  Oh, you want to sell a book? You better go on the big network nowadays. Oh,
*  you want to sell a book?
*  You try and get on Joe Rogan and he can peddle some book for you or get your
*  product out there or, or help your campaign.
*  We're like at that tipping point politically it seems right now. And yeah,
*  just what is it going to take to push people over the edge?
*  That's the question.
*  I think that what we saw happen in, in 2016,
*  I think pointed to that tipping point. And I, I,
*  I believe that that we are here because, um, you know, I,
*  these are conversations that we're having, uh,
*  in town hall meetings in different parts of the country. Again, where we're,
*  we're building this coalition of,
*  of Americans who are most interested in putting our country first,
*  who are willing to disagree without being disagreeable, but understand,
*  we got to treat each other with respect and stand united around the principles
*  and freedoms that bring us together, uh, focusing on we,
*  the people putting the interests of the people first and foremost. And,
*  and I would say that the vast majority of Americans have,
*  have put up with the same old same old for so long and are sick and tired of
*  this pay to play culture in Washington of the political corruption that exists
*  of the, you know, big money,
*  special interests who influence the decisions that leaders are making that
*  benefit them instead of the people that they're looking for a leader that says
*  what they mean and mean what they say and who will back that up with
*  action. I think that's where our opportunity, that that's where we're seeing,
*  um, you know, support growing for my campaign.
*  The more people hear about who I am,
*  the background and experience that I bring to this job and,
*  and that I, that I am willing to take a stand to speak the truth for the people,
*  even against some of the most powerful interests. Honestly,
*  our biggest challenge is getting in front of people because most people in the
*  country still don't know who I am.
*  Or you have people who maybe have heard about me, but they've gotten the, the,
*  the corporate media narrative.
*  But they're Tulsi curious.
*  They're Tulsi curious and really that's a good way to put it. So that's,
*  that's really where our, our effort is, is focused now.
*  New Hampshire is voting and less than a hundred days. And, um, so, you know,
*  we're asking for support from people to make contribution to my campaign.
*  Tulsi 20, Tulsi 2020.com. Um,
*  literally getting this support, uh,
*  we'll make the difference for us to be able to bypass this corporate media
*  narrative and actually communicate directly, um, directly to voters,
*  directly to people.
*  No one better than you knows that these tech companies have this extraordinary
*  amount of power and that it's, it's just, no one anticipated it.
*  It came out of nowhere.
*  What do you think could be done to ensure that people have a voice and that
*  this voice is not being manipulated because of financial interests or
*  political interests. And this is where we're at today, that this,
*  these companies like it or not,
*  they don't have to abide by the first amendment. That's not what they do.
*  They can decide we're going to ban you based on your political leanings based.
*  I mean, there's a famous case out of Canada where a woman was having an,
*  she's a, you know what a turf is?
*  It's a trans exclusionary radical feminist that's never heard that radical
*  feminists who don't believe that transgender women should be involved in
*  women's issues and that they shouldn't be able to vote on women's issues.
*  And she was in an argument on Twitter. Her name is Megan Murphy. And she said,
*  a man is never a woman. Twitter told her, you got to take that down.
*  So she's a bit feisty. She took it down, took a screenshot,
*  put it back up with the screenshot. She's like, okay, I took it down.
*  There it is again though. And then banned her for life. Wow. For life.
*  So it's something like that where you can't even have opinions on things that
*  are controversial without being removed from the discourse.
*  We have a real problem with that. That's a giant problem.
*  This is just one social thing.
*  It's a hot button issue right now. And whether or not it'll stay,
*  whether it's just a fad or it'll go away or it'll be normalized, we don't know.
*  But the fact that you don't have the first amendment protecting people from a
*  legitimate opinion that's actually based on, you know,
*  whether you like it or not, biological science. This is a, this is a very,
*  we're in a very strange time that a company,
*  and I just use this as an example because you're talking about something where
*  it's biologically clear that she's correct.
*  Whether or not you socially think that people should be treated how they want
*  to be treated and use the pronouns. I agree with that.
*  But you're talking about someone who's saying something that's biologically
*  correct. So we have a problem. We're at a fork in the road,
*  and we have to figure out how the hell this gets handled because if just social
*  trends like this can dictate whether or not a person is removed from the
*  conversation forever, we've got a giant-
*  There's no other option. There's no other alternative platform that you can
*  participate in.
*  And that's just one example of the thousands and thousands of examples of
*  people that are removed from conversations based on their political leanings,
*  their ideologies. And,
*  and meanwhile there's just unlimited hardcore pornography on Twitter,
*  which is perfectly okay. But we can't say that about whatever that situation is,
*  which I don't really understand. It's pretty dark. And OJ Simpson as well.
*  OJ Simpson is on Twitter. It's hilarious as well.
*  And also I think that kind of thing is the kind of thing that gets a backlash
*  from moderate people.
*  A moderate person sitting in Nebraska is like, well, who am I voting for? Well,
*  these people are bad. They're against this whole idea. Okay.
*  It looks like Trump is on my side. Here we go.
*  And that scene, this,
*  this idea that you can de platform people and somehow or another that weakens
*  the position that you don't agree with. It's the opposite.
*  The opposite happens.
*  You pump up the only hope that they have of getting their side of the story out
*  there.
*  Their side of the story is going to be represented by Trump and Trump
*  supporters.
*  And I don't know what the president can or can't do to sort of enforce some
*  sort of, I mean,
*  we obviously have a new situation when it comes to communication in this
*  country with social media and tech companies. It's very new and it's really,
*  it's, it's only the last couple of decades. It's even been a thing.
*  And now it's one of the biggest things in terms of discourse and how
*  people communicate and how people form opinions about things.
*  That's a tremendous influence on our culture.
*  And the fact that this isn't protected by the first amendment,
*  we have a very strange new force in our country when it comes to
*  discourse. And I think laws need to be formed.
*  Like we need to have some sort of parameters that you mean there's laws on
*  virtually everything and virtually everything that has massive influence over
*  the way it affects our country.
*  And that's one where there isn't really there's no independent companies and
*  they're not there. They can do whatever they want. Essentially.
*  Yeah. No, it's, it's limited. I think, I agree with you.
*  I think this is, I agree with you both with regards to the tech companies,
*  but also this bigger kind of culture war that's
*  happening in our country, this cancel culture that exists that,
*  I think it, I mean, it does, it threatens the kind of,
*  of freedom of speech and discourse that I think we've celebrated in this country
*  for so long, where this is the country where you can stand up and say what you
*  believe no matter how terrible I may think it is or how strongly I may
*  disagree with it. You know,
*  people like us are willing to lay our life down for your right to do that.
*  I think that's, that's what is at risk here with this, this culture,
*  this, this cancel culture is having such a chilling effect where people are
*  maybe afraid to say something that may be seen as controversial to some,
*  because they will get canceled. And in some, and in some cases,
*  you've seen how people's, especially if you're a public figure,
*  your whole career can be just like gone finished.
*  Cancel culture is real simple.
*  Everyone now has a rock and there's a big window.
*  Someone throws a rock at that window and you're like, well,
*  fucking throw my rock too. And that's what happens. People just,
*  whether or not they have a strong opinion on something or not,
*  they just decide that's the spot we're throwing the rocks and they just chuck
*  the rocks. And then they feel like they have some sort of a, you know,
*  if a politician gets taken down, they're like, look, I helped.
*  Look at my Twitter feed. My Twitter feeds filled with calling that guy a piece.
*  I was the first one. Yeah. First one that did it. I think that, that, um,
*  you know, you mentioned, uh, was it happened in the debate? Uh, Kamala Harris was,
*  she, she like launched a petition or publicly was calling for a Twitter to
*  delete president Trump's account. Yeah. And she really,
*  she really made a big deal out of this, did a whole media tour,
*  like all this called out Elizabeth Warren, all this stuff.
*  I was asked about it, uh, by a reporter shortly after she had made this
*  announcement. I had, I did not even heard of it. Like, Oh,
*  what do you think about Kamala Harris calling on Twitter to cancel Trump's
*  Twitter account? I said, well, you know, I disagree with not everything,
*  but a lot of what Trump says, but freedom of speech,
*  freedom of speech. So no, I completely disagree with her.
*  And the response from her campaign spokesperson, no kidding.
*  Tulsi Gabbard echoes Fox news talking points.
*  Freedom of Fox news is saying, Oh, well, what about freedom of speech?
*  By the way, Richard Spencer loves her.
*  But that's like, this is where we're at. Like just saying, Hey, freedom of speech.
*  You're the president, whether you're the president of the United States,
*  or you're the guy sweeping the floor in the white house.
*  I will stand up and fight for your freedom of speech.
*  I may disagree and I may disagree publicly and strongly, but we've got it.
*  We've got to draw the line here for freedom of speech and being able to have
*  this dialogue and discourse where we can.
*  And I think that we should debate strongly and maybe passionately about some of
*  these issues. Um, not seeing that as a bad thing.
*  That's been the strength of our country.
*  It'll be interesting, you know, from a free market perspective,
*  if at some point somebody comes out with a social media platform that is really,
*  truly free speech.
*  There's think spock and run around right now. Gab's one. Yeah. It'll just be,
*  yeah. And, and,
*  but people have told me tech friends of mine that say,
*  they say that immediately turns into a, what is it? Four Chan and eight Chan.
*  It just immediately goes into the gutter.
*  It's an open sewer. I mean, it's just like,
*  have you ever seen those pipes that pump sewage into the ocean?
*  Like it's just green and disgusting. That's I mean,
*  and it's not the fault of the social media companies. The companies like gab,
*  they're committed to free speech and what they're trying to do is let it just let
*  it all work itself out and abide by the constitution. Don't dox anybody.
*  Don't give up anybody's address. Don't threaten anybody or doing,
*  do any harm and just talk crazy and do it anonymously.
*  And that's what a lot of people are doing. And it's,
*  it's very difficult for even the people that felt like they were deplatformed or
*  their voice wasn't being able to be heard.
*  They don't want to join into this crazy shit because,
*  because of four channel savages,
*  they're just trying to post pictures of their dinner, right?
*  It's so nuts. I mean, look, I mean, even posting pictures of your dinner. I mean,
*  you get, you do that on Instagram. And if it's a dead deer or something like that,
*  you're, you're risking getting your picture taken down.
*  It's the amount of power that's being exhibited by these social media companies.
*  Again, no one anticipated this. What could be done?
*  What do you think could be done? Like say you, you get, you become president.
*  What would you do?
*  So I think there's, there's two things here that we've talked about the freedom of
*  speech, the control over information.
*  I think part and parcel to that that we didn't really talk much about is how much
*  of our private information these tech companies have and what they're doing with
*  it. Maybe without us even knowing about how that's,
*  that's helping to drive up their profits. I think it's,
*  it's both of those components you got to be concerned about.
*  I think number one is we look at our antitrust laws that exist in this country
*  for the protection of the consumer against any giant monopoly from coming in and
*  and being in a position to abuse their power and apply those laws to these tech
*  giants. I think the fact that Facebook owns obviously Facebook,
*  Instagram and WhatsApp.
*  I don't think that,
*  I think that is the definition of a monopoly across platforms that many of us
*  use because there isn't really a legitimate alternative option available to
*  us.
*  So I think that's the first thing and looking at breaking up these,
*  these monopolies. I think Facebook's co-founder,
*  Chris Hayes, I think is his name. I think he,
*  he wrote I think a very compelling argument against Facebook monopoly saying
*  they have gotten way too powerful.
*  They should not have been able to buy these other companies.
*  And the second thing is Congress actually digging down and passing laws that
*  provide actual oversight and a level of accountability to ensure that our freedom
*  of speech and our freedom to access information is not impeded by these tech
*  giants,
*  whether it's for their own profits or to pursue their own political interests.
*  They face, they face,
*  there's people inside of Twitter that are like Jack Dorsey believes,
*  and at least according to what he's told me that Twitter should be like a town
*  hall where everyone should be able to have access,
*  but he faces resistance that inside the actual company that he's the CEO of,
*  that there's so many people that don't think Facebook is a monopoly.
*  They don't think that that's the way it should be.
*  And they think that they have a political or a social obligation to limit certain
*  voices because those voices radicalize young people. Like,
*  what do you say to those people?
*  I mean, with, without knowing examples of what they're citing, here's the thing is,
*  is what they may view is radicalizing young people because of the ideology that
*  they as individuals may hold onto,
*  um, may be seen in the opposite way by people who hold a different political
*  ideology. You know, I think this is something that, um, that,
*  that we're seeing happening offline as well. You know, whether it's in,
*  in college campuses or in other places where, uh,
*  both sides view the other side as indoctrinating young people or indoctrinating
*  people with, um, their ideology. Look at Fox news and MSNBC.
*  They are both pushing, um,
*  opposing narratives on, you know,
*  news happenings of the day or whatever's happening in Washington. There,
*  you watch the exact same thing, uh, happen. You know, the, um,
*  killing of Baghdadi, you saw very different bias in the news.
*  Did you see the Washington post explain, tell people what they said.
*  They, they put a story up that said, I forget what the quote was,
*  but they call them like a cleric, religious cleric, scholar.
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. What's the word? A store. What is that word?
*  Astute. No religious scholar. Um, I forget what word they used to describe
*  him. Put, just try to find out what this, I think it's a stir.
*  Religious scholar. I was like, what?
*  That guy. Yeah. Yeah. Like how can you, that's just insanity. Yeah.
*  But how does that, but how does that get through? How does, I mean,
*  how does someone in the Washington post go, okay, I like what you did there.
*  Yeah. You can't even fathom. Yeah. What's that guy? Head of ISIS. Yeah,
*  exactly. Here it is. A store. How do you say that word?
*  I never say that word. I just read it. Yeah. That was the first time in my whole
*  life, 52 years of age. I've said it out loud.
*  Religious scholar at helm of Islamic state dies at 48. What in the fuck?
*  Wow. Religious scholar.
*  Well, at least when you zoom in on his eyes there,
*  you can tell he's completely insane. Yeah. Zoom in on that. Jamie,
*  let me get a zoom. What? Yeah. Whoa. Jesus Christ.
*  He got a whole, the Trump suit of fed. Look at him.
*  That title is so bananas. Yeah, it is. It's crazy. That's as Tulsi,
*  just pointed out, that's someone driving a narrative, right? Yeah.
*  That's someone driving a narrative because somebody that doesn't understand this,
*  that's their first glimpse of, of this reality and their glimpse of this reality.
*  Is that this guy was an austere religious leader.
*  What is the actual definition of austere? Let's,
*  let's pull that up because I want to find out how hilarious this really is.
*  Cause I think it's really hilarious.
*  Which by the way, as Jamie's doing that Washington post owned by, oh,
*  here we go.
*  Severe or strict in manner attitude or appearance and austere man with a rigidly
*  puritanical outlook. Too nice.
*  This guy was a puritan as far as they're concerned. Yeah.
*  Puritan piece of shit.
*  Having an extremely plain and simple style or appearance unadorned.
*  Okay. He's dressed like a genie.
*  He's living in a hole in the ground and he's running ISIS.
*  You people are out of your mind. It's offensive. It's so strange. I mean,
*  there's real monsters in this world.
*  And when you add a bunch of words to a description of a real monster that make
*  that person seem like they're a contributor to culture.
*  It's just, and that's what it seems. Religious scholar. Oh,
*  he's a religious scholar. Must be a good guy's helping people.
*  He's throwing gay people off the top of buildings.
*  Right. Because they don't agree with his quote unquote religious scholarly
*  beliefs.
*  Such a strange choice. The fact that that's a mainstream publication,
*  a huge newspaper and that that somehow or another slip through the net.
*  Like what the headline like that front page, that's not slipping through the net.
*  You know what I mean? That's that's planned.
*  But to someone like you who's actually had to go over there and risk your life
*  to fight guys like that, how sick does that make you to just read that?
*  It's awful for a couple reasons.
*  Obviously it's awful for the kind of straightforward reason that you realize
*  that people are learning the wrong thing. They're,
*  they're going to understand this in the wrong way. That's one part of it.
*  But the other part of it is that there's someone that wrote that headline.
*  There's someone that wrote someone that has a position of influence in the world
*  that wrote that headline and said, yeah, this guy's an austere religious leader,
*  scholar.
*  There's a guy, I forget his name. He's a, he's a, a famous Muslim,
*  a commentator who's online,
*  but he attacked that so viciously and talked about what a piece of garbage that
*  guy actually was and how awful he is and how this is,
*  this goes against everything that a modern Muslim feels and thinks and that this
*  have this person represent and to, to,
*  to say a religious scholar is so deeply offensive.
*  And that's fantastic.
*  I wish I could remember that guy's name who did it. Meti, M-E-D-H-I.
*  But this is the Washington Post. I mean,
*  this isn't like someone's blog on Tinder or something or whatever,
*  wherever you have blogs these days. It's,
*  this is a huge mainstream publication and it just,
*  the distorting of narratives is such a strange factor in today's culture that
*  this, we don't have a Walter Cronkite,
*  giving us the straightforward news every day on the air with no lean or slant and
*  just give you the facts. We don't have that.
*  We don't have what we thought of as a top level newspaper from 1980 or whatever
*  where they were doing real journalism,
*  trying to break down a story in a way that you could understand while you're
*  drinking your coffee trying to, hey, is the world blowing up?
*  Let me see what's going on here.
*  Yeah. My dad pointed out to me, you know,
*  you were talking about there's nothing that unifies us anymore and you're like,
*  Hey, everyone changes. I obviously agree with that.
*  But what my dad was telling me that in the sixties and the seventies,
*  there was one unifying thing that everybody did,
*  which is watch Walter Cronkite on the news.
*  And so when you showed up to work the next day,
*  everyone had heard the same narrative and they,
*  and they could have disagreed on it,
*  but they all had kind of the same basic fundamental facts.
*  And so now we actually have people going home and I'm going to jump into my bubble
*  over here and watch Fox news and you're going to get jumped into your bubble
*  over there and watch MSNBC. And like,
*  how do you even communicate with each other? Yeah. Yeah, we don't.
*  We have so many choices, but so few paths.
*  I was, I was, I was, I caught some, um,
*  Rachel Maddow one time and I'd never watched her before. So I was like, okay,
*  I'm going to watch her. And I was like, wow, just completely different,
*  completely different than what I would see on Fox news,
*  completely different. And I'm thinking to myself, wow, this is hard to,
*  hard to imagine.
*  And you've seen the clips of when Trump won of all the compilation of everyone's
*  reaction, all the, all the liberal reaction they were, but on the news, yes.
*  I mean, does, does, does MSNBC, they don't claim to be like, you know,
*  nonpartisan at all, do they? Or news for that matter.
*  I think, I think they don't have to. It's just, they are MSNBC.
*  They don't have to have a directive. They just say, everyone knows. It's like,
*  we, there's, there's an understanding when you're going there,
*  you're either going to hate view,
*  like you're either a Republican who's going there to see what these silly
*  liberals are up to, or you're one of the converted and she's preaching to the
*  choir.
*  I think one interesting, um, proof point of this is, um,
*  I think a poll came out yesterday on where the American people stand on
*  impeachment and something like 75,
*  80% of Fox viewers oppose impeachment and
*  75, 80% of NBC MSNBC viewers support impeachment.
*  And they're covering the very same impeachment inquiry and hearings and, you
*  know, witness testimony and all of that.
*  I don't think people even understand what that all means and whether or not it
*  even has a chance of happening, you know, based on, I don't think,
*  I don't think people do either. They don't, they just,
*  it seems like some fun talking point, some gotcha thing where they've got them,
*  you know, Ukraine got them. We got them. We got them this time.
*  Stormy Daniels didn't stick, but this one, this one's going to sink.
*  Yeah. Hey, you know, you think yourself if Stormy Daniels didn't stick,
*  come on, what else are you going to do? He might as well.
*  He just might as well as backed off and just try and work with the guy at that
*  point. I would've been like, okay, you know what? He's, he's Teflon.
*  We just need to move on, move forward.
*  There's a hilarious girl. I don't know who she is.
*  Did I send you that video where the girl was getting people to get pumped up
*  about impeachment and she's got like, like, uh,
*  rainbow colored hair and she looks like a liberal.
*  I think she even has one of those pink kitty cat hats on and, and she gets them.
*  She's like pro impeachment. They're like, yeah, impeach him. Fucking impeachment.
*  She goes, yay. President Pence. Yay. And they're like, what? Yeah.
*  She's like president Pence. So if he gets impeached and we get president Pence,
*  and they're like, hmm. She's like, maybe we should just like, let this play out.
*  Yeah, probably, probably just let him finish his term. But it is,
*  it is hilarious. It's hilarious because it's a sport.
*  It's it's it's basically replacing it's for,
*  it's a sport for people who don't like football. It's like their,
*  their idea of who's winning or losing this game is very personal.
*  And they feel like their team got killed in 2016 and they were able to come back
*  and kick ass in 2020. And that's what's going on.
*  Everything they can get at them.
*  Well, not, not only that, I mean, it's, it's that,
*  but then you've got some folks who some,
*  some Democrat leaders in Washington who are saying, well, you know,
*  we need to get rid of Trump through impeachment to protect ourselves from
*  possibly losing the election in 2020, which I think is just like a, an open,
*  Ed, you know, Ed middle of, well,
*  we don't think that we can actually beat him at the ballot box.
*  So we're trying to use this political maneuver in order to get rid of him,
*  even though it's, it's highly unlikely that even if the house does vote to
*  impeach, which isn't fully clear at this point, but even if that were to happen,
*  the Senate is not going to convince 20,
*  it's highly unlikely the Senate's going to convince 20 Republicans to vote
*  with every Democrat to,
*  to actually physically kick Trump out of office. And this is why, I mean,
*  I've, I've always maintained that, you know, look,
*  I look forward to beating Donald Trump at the ballot box where the American
*  people can unequivocally let their voices be heard saying, Nope,
*  we're done with the leadership and,
*  and all that Trump brought to office and we're choosing to go in a new
*  direction.
*  Have you thought about what kind of nickname he'll have for you?
*  Cause you know, he's going to come up with a nickname.
*  Did you see how they, they played you on Saturday night live?
*  I did.
*  I was, what I went on there cause I said, Oh,
*  I've got to see what they did to her.
*  And I was really curious about what they were going to do,
*  how they were going to make you out and he made you out to be like this super
*  evil person. I got a kick out of it.
*  What they do.
*  You didn't see it. No, it's funny.
*  It's a, it's a, it's a super short clip, but basically they're like,
*  there is a villain amongst all of these candidates and that villain is Tulsi
*  Gabbard strikes fear into the heart of every other person up here.
*  Something like that.
*  Like a despicable me type cartoon villain.
*  They portrayed me as like a Cruella DeVille.
*  The thing is I was thinking as it was playing out out,
*  they don't show you for a while and I go,
*  they're not even going to put her in here. I was like, they're not even,
*  they're not even going to put her in here. They, they, you know,
*  Clinton got to her and said, no, I don't want this girl to get any airtime at
*  all. It's just so interesting to me that they,
*  it's so clear that you're a vibrant candidate,
*  but that they don't want to get behind you.
*  But yet they do want to get behind Joe Biden who can barely get through a
*  sentence. That poor guy is falling apart.
*  Someone needs to give that guy like growth hormones, steroids,
*  like kale shakes, fat steaks, like bro, you need to take some time off.
*  We need to get you in a hyperbaric chamber. You need, you don't have any energy.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially cause Donald Trump has energy and he goes on stage for an hour and a
*  half at a rally with no teleprompter, no 30,000 people there screaming,
*  no drink, no bathroom break. He's just up there going,
*  he's like an animal up there and it fuels him. And then you,
*  meanwhile you're looking at Biden and you're like this,
*  how is this even going to work out? His teeth are literally falling out.
*  The campaign is horrible.
*  People's names wrong. Did they want to win or don't they?
*  They do. That is the question.
*  But they don't want to win with someone they can't control. Exactly.
*  You know, it's like the first UFC,
*  you know they had hoist fight in the first UFC because they couldn't control
*  Hickson. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Hicks is the family champion, but Hickson was like,
*  Hicks is going to do whatever the fuck Hickson wants to do.
*  They had no control out of him. So Horian was like, well, if hoist loses,
*  then we'll go with Hickson for now. Let's get hoist in there.
*  Cause he couldn't control Hickson. Yeah. Yeah.
*  No, that's literally what they're afraid of.
*  If you wanted to show what you Jitsu could do everyone on earth that knew Jiu
*  Jitsu knew Hickson Gracie was the baddest man on the planet.
*  How do you navigate this Tulsi? It seems like the,
*  it seems like, okay, if you want to get the democratic nomination,
*  you've got to be pretty far to the left, right?
*  But if you want to actually win the presidency,
*  then you got to be more moderate.
*  So that seems like a tough little thing to try and get through as well.
*  I think that that is the conventional so-called wisdom.
*  That just isn't true anymore. I think this is what, you know,
*  you hear a lot of the political pundits talking, who's far left, who's centrist,
*  moderate, who's this, this, that, um,
*  I think what's, what's proving to be true is, is more about,
*  you know, who is, um, who is,
*  who's the establishment candidate versus who is anti-establishment and that,
*  you know, I, I don't fit into any one of those boxes because I look at every
*  issue based on its merits. I'll look at the substance of the issue,
*  look at the arguments for and against and go with the approach that I think.
*  This is a radical idea.
*  It is. Exactly.
*  And that's the thing. Like these people, they're like, Oh my God,
*  we can't figure her out because she doesn't have any of these labels. Um, but,
*  but that is where the vast majority of the American people are. You have these,
*  these extremes on the fringes who are all about these, uh, you know,
*  purity tests where you are either with me on every single issue or you're done.
*  You're finished. You're unacceptable. But the vast majority of Americans, again,
*  they're looking at what is real leadership, real leadership,
*  whether you're talking about the guy who's working in the manufacturing
*  warehouse, you're talking about a blue collar worker, you're looking at, okay,
*  here's, here's the, here's the issues that keep most people up at night.
*  You know, you want to make sure that if your kid is sick, you're going to be,
*  they're, they're going to be able to get the healthcare they need.
*  You want to make sure you have a roof over your family's head. They're,
*  they're basic things, uh,
*  approaching them in a way that is pragmatical, common, pragmatic,
*  common sense, uh, and solutions oriented, um,
*  is not only the right thing to do.
*  I think it's the thing that makes it so you don't have to say, well,
*  in the primary,
*  I'm only going to talk to Democrats and the most radical and extreme among them.
*  And then I'm totally going to flip the script and then speak to the whole
*  country after I win the primary election. That's, that's ridiculous.
*  This is why, you know, I'll, I'll go on Fox news, MSNBC,
*  CNN, and I'm delivering the exact same message to people. And we're,
*  we're building and growing support and people who watch those three different
*  channels who are actually listening like, Hey, like she, she makes sense.
*  Like she's not crazy. She's not spouting some party talking point. She's not,
*  you know,
*  going down a radical path just to appeal to the,
*  the Twitter winds that are blowing one way or the other. It's just about, Hey,
*  let's do what's, what's best. Let's do what's best for the people.
*  And for the country.
*  I'm stunned by the blowback too, for you going on Fox news that people are
*  actually upset that they do not think that you should grace this,
*  the Fox news screens that you, you're doing a disservice to your party.
*  Which is interesting. Well,
*  I get the same stuff and because I go on Fox news and why do I go on Fox news?
*  Fox news invites me onto Fox news. You know, who's never invited me on ever.
*  And again, as you pointed out earlier,
*  like it's pretty hard to pin me down politically and I'm not one to sit there
*  and try and make radical statements to try and get more, you know,
*  likes on a Twitter thing. You don't do that. Yeah, I don't. It's like, Oh,
*  I'm here to try to make some points about the way, you know, most of the,
*  most of what I talk about is, is about leadership. Yeah. It's like, Oh,
*  because of what we're doing as human beings is we're leading other people,
*  whether it's just your family or whether it's your business or whatever,
*  or it's troops out in the field. So yeah,
*  it's weird that you would get attacked for going on Fox news when actually
*  anybody that looks at that from a strategic view would think, Oh,
*  she's actually accepted by, by this, this right wing,
*  um, news organization. Maybe she could get some other, you know,
*  moderate conservative votes.
*  Maybe we should think about bringing her in as a candidate because she could win.
*  Well, not only that,
*  what's wrong with going on stage or going on camera with someone that you
*  oppose someone you disagree with and having a dialogue about what you disagree
*  with. That's the weird thing about this cancel culture,
*  this strange time we're living and you're not even supposed to communicate with
*  people about ideas that you disagree on.
*  Like I saw people criticizing you for being on Tucker Carlson show in
*  particular. Yeah. And that's, I was going to say, you know, yeah,
*  it's one thing to say, okay, you're going to go on Fox news and, you know,
*  tussle with Sean Hannity about things you disagree on.
*  But I think what they see as more dangerous is finding areas where you
*  actually do agree. And that's, you know, on Tucker Carlson. Um,
*  I have a platform to be able to speak to millions of people across the country
*  about the kind of leadership that I bring in the area of foreign
*  policy, what I would do here in this country,
*  what I would do there in that country if I were president today.
*  And I have the opportunity to deliver that message directly to people's living
*  rooms or offices or wherever they are. And, um, you know,
*  I think in some of these areas, Tucker,
*  Tucker and I will disagree on a whole host of things,
*  but on some of these issues of foreign policy, he'll say, yeah, I,
*  I agree with you. And I think when you look at this, this cancel culture,
*  how, you know, I was attacked on the debate stage for going on Fox news.
*  How do you think you're going to lead this country, all Americans,
*  if you're completely,
*  not only shutting out and not willing to talk to half the country
*  that watches Fox news,
*  but you're in fact disrespecting and dismissing them just because they may
*  disagree with you or they watch a different news channel than you do.
*  I think that's the bigger issue here is, yeah, you know,
*  there's a political consequence.
*  You're never going to be able to have a dialogue with what to speak of win
*  support from people who you treat like garbage, who you disrespect,
*  you call names, who you call deplorables.
*  But how do you expect to lead as the president of every single American in this
*  country when you've thrown half of them away and saying, you know what,
*  I actually don't care about you. I only care about people who I agree with.
*  That's that's to me, the, the, um, the worst part about all of this.
*  Yeah. I couldn't agree more.
*  Does that deplorable thing was a big hit.
*  And then you also remember when Mitt Romney said, Hey,
*  there's 47% of the country that there's no way of voting for him.
*  We just need to forget about him. Yeah, exactly. Those two,
*  those two things completely divided and sent people to vote for the opposing
*  candidate. Like you're gonna call me deplorable. Oh, really? Watch this.
*  I'm voting for, or you're going to ignore me or you're just going to dismiss me.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  I think also it speaks to what both people have that is distasteful that they're
*  calculated.
*  And one of the things that I do appreciate you about you is that I think you're
*  not,
*  I think the way you view things is you would far rather speak your mind and be
*  truthful and have real legitimate opinions on things rather than have some weird
*  slimy sort of shifty take that's been created by a bunch of people that think
*  that this is going to be the right thing that you could say that's going to,
*  you know,
*  and get you a little closer in the polls and move you this way and move the
*  needle that way that that shifty style of politics I really feel is dead.
*  I just, I just don't think you can do it that way anymore.
*  I think people because of the open access to information that people have today
*  and the way that people can communicate and find out information,
*  I just don't think we want to buy that shifty politician talk anymore.
*  I think we're done with it. I think we realize it's antiquated. It's,
*  it's never served us. It sucks. And it just,
*  it just gives you the same thing every time you get someone who gets into office
*  and they do completely different things than what they said they were going to do
*  before they got in. Yeah, that's even, you know, I thought about, Oh,
*  the people are, they heard deplorables, they heard 47% and that's bad.
*  But yeah, you're right. What it really made people think is, Oh,
*  behind the scenes you're totally different than you are when you're standing
*  on stage. I know what you're like and I'm not voting for you. Yeah.
*  You're manipulative. You're following this, you know, you're following,
*  whether it's polls or you're following these,
*  these groups that are going out and trying to figure out which way the tide is
*  turning on social media. I mean,
*  there's so many groups now and so many companies that are just,
*  just looking at data online and opinions.
*  And then they give this data to people that are trying to influence folks and
*  they lean one way or another.
*  And they try to manipulate their message in order to have a more favorable
*  rating. And it's so slimy.
*  And it's also the,
*  the kind of hypocrisy of this whole thing is these are people who are asking to
*  lead the most powerful nation in the world.
*  Yes.
*  And yet they are not leaders at all.
*  They're followers.
*  Have you given any consideration to the fact that this is basically an impossible
*  job, that everybody who gets in there ages 150 years, except Trump,
*  he doesn't seem to age at all. He looks great. I mean,
*  he looked like shit when he got in, but he looks exactly the same now.
*  I mean, you would think he looked like a skeleton by now. He'd be a corpse,
*  but no looks, looks like it's not even, it's like,
*  he eats a lot of fast food. I hear rolling off his back, whatever it is.
*  There's a lesson to be learned. I mean, he should give,
*  he really should give a class on not giving a fuck and like how it,
*  how it affects you.
*  He's got a master's degree in that without a doubt.
*  You could say you don't give a fuck,
*  but that's when the whole world is angry at you. Like half the world,
*  maybe more than half the world because it's half of America.
*  And then who knows what percentage of the rest of the world is upset at you.
*  Not a lot of supporters internationally, right? And that guy's like,
*  shakes it off like a duck. It just keeps, it just keeps moving.
*  But have you given any consideration to that?
*  This is a job that almost no one really nails.
*  No one gets out after four years or eight years and is like, boom,
*  fucking nailed it. No one.
*  Thanks.
*  No one is creating all these visual images in my mind.
*  Nobody gets out. They're like, Obama, you did it.
*  There's half the people are going to hate you no matter what. And this,
*  this legit, there's a legit argument that it's a ridiculous position.
*  That to have one alpha chimp dominate the entire clan in 2019,
*  when there's 320 million of us, it seems insane.
*  It doesn't seem like you really can pay attention to everything,
*  whether it's the economy, the environment or foreign policy or all the social
*  issues is so much going on.
*  How can one person really have that job?
*  So the first thing I'll say is that if,
*  if you're going into this to be popular or to have everybody love you,
*  then you should not be president at all.
*  That's why I'm never going to be president.
*  You can come over and have dinner with me in the white house.
*  When we get there.
*  So I think, I think that's the most important thing.
*  And that's the problem that we see in a lot of our politics is,
*  and what we're seeing on Twitter is people are,
*  are putting stuff out for what they think will get the most likes or we'll get
*  the most retweets rather than putting out what they believe in or what's true
*  or what, what's actually really, really important.
*  So I think that's the first thing about how I would govern and lead as president
*  about continuing what I've always done, which is actually just focusing on,
*  Hey, let's, let's do the best job we can do to deliver the best result for the
*  American people.
*  None of us are perfect and won't always get it perfectly right.
*  Um, all the time.
*  Um, I think understanding that we have often forgotten these days, we have three
*  co-equal branches of government.
*  So the president alone in the executive branch does not have absolute or
*  ultimate power over our government or over making decisions that impact,
*  uh, the lives of Americans across this country. Um, I think our,
*  our founders set up our government with this in mind that we left the monarchy
*  for a reason so that we don't have one person with absolute power,
*  but instead we have a president,
*  a commander in chief who is leading our country,
*  working with the United States Congress, the house and the Senate,
*  which is made up of people who are elected from their communities or,
*  and from their states to be able to, um,
*  form and shape the policies that do impact the lives of people in this country
*  so that these decisions are not being made within a vacuum by one single
*  individual,
*  but instead by a representative form of government with the judiciary branch as
*  the check and balance to say, Hey, this,
*  this one does not fall in line with the constitution of the United States.
*  We're going to throw that one out, making sure that these elected leaders, um,
*  you know, are, are doing the right thing for the people. Uh, so I think,
*  I think the, the opportunity that's here and I think what's necessary is having a
*  president who leads with the best interests of the people in mind,
*  take seriously the principles enshrined within our constitution,
*  does not abuse that executive power,
*  which is something that we've seen growing in one consecutive administration
*  after another crossing both party lines. Um, but instead, um,
*  really take seriously that oath that we all take that we took as a member of
*  Congress,
*  that we took in the military that the president takes to uphold and defend our
*  constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
*  Well said.
*  Yeah. And I think, you know, Tulsi is a military person as well.
*  And when you go and you do the best you can and you make the decisions for the
*  right, you make the, you make the decisions for the right reasons,
*  which aren't necessarily going to turn out right.
*  Sometimes you make decisions and they don't turn out okay,
*  but you had the right intentions. You tried to do the right thing.
*  It didn't go the way you wanted it to.
*  You don't point your fingers or blame anybody else. You say, okay, here's,
*  here's the mistake I made. Here's what we're going to do to fix it.
*  And at the end of the day, you can walk away and say, okay, well,
*  I know that I did the best I could with the right intentions. And generally,
*  just like you were talking about people being able to see through when someone's
*  lying behind says people see, you know what they're trying to do the best job.
*  They had the right intentions in mind. And I think you,
*  I think you actually could walk away from the job, not saying I did a great job,
*  nailed it as Joe Rogan would say, but,
*  but to walk away with your head held high and be able to say, yeah,
*  I did the best I could do. I made some good decisions. I made some bad decisions.
*  I tried to get us on the right path.
*  I tried to support the principles that I believe this country is based on.
*  And you move forward. I think that's completely doable.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have a long-term idea? Like if,
*  if you don't win in 2020, are you going to stick around for 2024?
*  Like how, what is, what are your thoughts on that?
*  I'm focused on 2020.
*  And then once that passes, whether you win or not,
*  then you think about the future assess, but you're only 38, right? Yeah.
*  I don't buy that gray hair either. I think it's fake. I think,
*  I think you decided that you look too young.
*  What about my gray hair?
*  I believe it. You and me are close to the same age. Mine's real too.
*  But then with you, I don't buy it. I think you just said like,
*  we just need a streak, just a cool looking streak. No, it's real.
*  No. Yeah.
*  You going to keep it if the whole thing goes gray?
*  So far. I don't want to hold you to that.
*  Yeah. No, no, no. I, I, um,
*  I started to go gray during my first deployment. And so,
*  um, I decided to keep it just as a physical
*  reminder of those we lost and the price that so many people paid.
*  If you win, will you be the youngest person ever to be president?
*  Or were there some weirdos in the 1700s?
*  No, I will be, um, actually I believe I'll be the youngest.
*  Yeah.
*  Youngest and a woman. Pretty bad ass. Double first.
*  You would think that a lot of people would be really excited about that instead
*  of just attacking you.
*  Well, again,
*  it just shows you how people are so committed to the machine.
*  And you're one of the best examples of that, I think,
*  because there's so much exciting about what you're saying.
*  There's so much that resonates as being honest and straightforward and well
*  thought out and nuanced and balanced. And yet still so much resistance.
*  But I think the machine is strong and the machine knows that it doesn't really
*  have a grip on you.
*  Yeah, they don't. And they, they never will. And I think that's it.
*  You mentioned earlier, I think that's, that's, um, uh,
*  creating fear and concern. Um,
*  I just think it's important to point out the difference when we talk about the
*  people, um, who are concerned about this.
*  It is the people whose power is built off of, you know,
*  they've built this foundation of power, uh, based on the status quo,
*  based on continuing this narrative that benefits the very few, you know,
*  the most rich, the most powerful,
*  the people who can purchase this influence in Washington, um,
*  as opposed to, you know, the vast majority of people in this country,
*  unfortunately, whose voices are not being heard in Washington,
*  whose concerns are not being met by and large, and, uh,
*  who exist outside of this, this bubble of corruption within Washington,
*  and who are looking for a leader who's going to hear their voices and amplify
*  them and serve their interests. And I think that's where, again, um, you know,
*  we've got great opportunity, um, and responsibility to,
*  to reach those people, uh, all across this country and let them know who I am.
*  And to hear my message so they know that there, there is a choice,
*  that they do have a choice between more of the same old, same old,
*  more of the pay to play corruption that exists in Washington,
*  more of the perpetuation of the same foreign policy of, of, of interventionism,
*  regime change that's failed us and cost us so much versus fresh leadership with
*  a new approach that puts our, our,
*  the interests of our country and peace and security at the forefront of the
*  decisions that are being made.
*  I think this is an interesting time too,
*  because it's one of the first times that I can remember where politicians that
*  are running for president are pushing back against the media machine.
*  Like Andrew Yang recently said,
*  I'm not going to go on MSNBC unless they apologize publicly for a lack of
*  representation. I mean, they didn't get it, give them a chance to talk.
*  And they treated, meanwhile, there's a giant well of support behind him as well.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I, yeah. People, people are, are seeing through the, um,
*  you know, the,
*  the facade that is presented by the corporate media and I think finding the
*  power in our voices on, uh, you know, through alternative media, new media,
*  social media, and, and, um, and I think that's,
*  that's what we're seeing with people. Hey,
*  if they're given my campaign $5 or you know, $10 a month,
*  like there's so much power that is, that is, uh,
*  I think people are discovering within their own voices that can,
*  that that really is the only thing that can overcome the obstacles that the
*  political and media establishment are placing before us and before the people in,
*  in having their voices heard.
*  Who is in the lead now? It's still Biden, right?
*  And behind Biden is Elizabeth Warren. Is that what the idea is?
*  It seems like it. It seems like,
*  I think when you look at some of these polls,
*  I think that's the other thing is,
*  is they most often represent who is most well known in the country,
*  who's most famous, um,
*  rather than who actually has the most support.
*  And Elizabeth Warren, wasn't she a Republican for a long time?
*  Yeah. When did she not be, when did she become a Democrat?
*  I may be wrong, but I want to say she was in her forties,
*  maybe early fifties, something like that.
*  Do you get a chance to talk to these people briefly? I mean, it's,
*  it's usually in passing at different campaign events or before the debate or,
*  or something like that. I know Bernie Sanders best, obviously. Um, no,
*  no, a few of the others who I've,
*  I've worked with in the Senate in Congress on different issues, Andrew,
*  Andrew Yang. I've enjoyed getting to know. I liked him a lot. Marianne as well.
*  I liked Bernie a lot too. I like him a lot more than I thought I would.
*  Like sitting down and talking to him for three hours on a podcast. It's just
*  like, Oh, you're just, you're a person. Yeah.
*  You're not some crazy old dude who screams out at these. I mean,
*  cause that's when you give a man 30 seconds and he's good. Yeah.
*  That's all you can do. One minute sound bite, 30 seconds sound bite.
*  That's who he is.
*  So what's next? Like where, where, where are you at right now?
*  Um, I think our, our initial challenge are the initial goal that we're,
*  we're seeking to meet here is, uh, to get,
*  I have not qualified yet for the next debate in December.
*  What do you have to do to qualify?
*  Um, we need to do two things. One is, um,
*  we've got a surpassed 200,000 individual donors. That's hilarious.
*  You need money. Where are you at right now? We are at, uh,
*  I think at about 199,000.
*  Oh, we got, we're close. Joe Rogan's got you covered.
*  You're listening to help. Yeah. 2020.com.
*  They'll jump on that like a grenade.
*  Um, and then the second thing is, is, uh,
*  I think require a certain number of polls and I think I need one more poll to
*  meet that requirement, which is again, is directly linked. You look at,
*  look at a guy like, uh, I think Pete Buttigieg,
*  he spent $9 million on social media ads in order to get like a 4% bump in the
*  polls. Um, you look at what some of these other guys have spent,
*  some of the billionaires,
*  I think Steyer spent $37 million in order to qualify in the polls on the
*  debate. And so our challenge is we just need to,
*  we need to get out and get in front of people, um,
*  in order to make sure that that we're bypassing the corporate media and we're,
*  we're actually talking directly to folks at home.
*  Is there a real possibility that sometime in our lifetime,
*  they can take money out of politics like that?
*  Yes, there has to be, there has to be. Um,
*  the more people learn about how completely lopsided our,
*  our campaign finance system is that does two things.
*  It favors those or it helps those who are taking money from,
*  uh, corporations and PACs and lobbyists, um,
*  further deepening the divide, uh,
*  between the politicians and the people that they are supposed to be serving and
*  representing. And instead, you know, you've got this,
*  this insider culture of lobbyists and politicians who are just hanging out and
*  making the decisions. Um, and, uh, yeah,
*  I mean, look, this is the second thing is that, that you're seeing how, um,
*  how, how corrupting that influence has is on the, on the,
*  but the politicians and the influence that they have over people and how much
*  it's disproportionately helping the strength in the power of a two party system
*  where those parties can, can literally take like for me, if,
*  if you wanted to give me a contribution, you could give me, uh, the limit is,
*  uh, $2,800 per the primary $2,800. That's it. You can't,
*  no matter how much you want, you can't give me any more money.
*  But if you wanted to write a check to either the democratic party,
*  the Republican party doesn't matter unlimited amount of money that you can give
*  to the party. So what does that actually mean? It means the power,
*  the party has a hell of a lot of power that they can leverage over individual
*  members of Congress, elected leaders to say, if you don't play ball,
*  if you don't vote the way we want you to vote,
*  we're not going to be there to help you out in your election.
*  We're not going to run TV ads for you.
*  We're not going to help you out when you're getting attacked by the other guy,
*  which just makes the problem that we already have worse where instead of leaders
*  voting based on what they believe is right for their constituents or right for
*  their, the, the country or, or based on their conscience,
*  instead they're being goaded into voting for the interests of the political
*  party, putting party ahead of the interests of the country. And so that,
*  that's, I think the more people are learning about the consequence of our
*  existing campaign finance system,
*  the more they're demanding change and reform so that we are electing leaders who
*  are accountable only to the people.
*  Have you ever had a conversation with someone where they have tried to influence
*  your vote in one way or another in that way that you just described?
*  I have, um, so, so, you know,
*  I have met with lobbyists who will say, Hey,
*  here's why I want you to vote this way. And, and, oh, you know, by the way,
*  we'll, we'll, we'll be there at your next fundraising dinner or something like
*  that. Um, I have,
*  you know, they hang up.
*  Come on, man. That's the deal right there.
*  And, um, and by the way, years, years ago,
*  when I stopped taking PAC money, I got no calls from any lobbyists.
*  None. When I said no PAC money, no lobbyist money automatically, they're like,
*  well, obviously we can't talk to her for not giving her money.
*  This crazy lady's not playing games.
*  Exactly. Um, and then I haven't seen it. You know,
*  I established very quickly in Congress that, uh,
*  that I don't play political games and that I'm not going to be bullied into
*  taking anybody else's position if I don't think it's the right one to take.
*  So I have not experienced that kind of, like the, the,
*  the party has never helped me in any of my elections ever for city
*  council, for state legislature, for Congress. So them coming in and saying,
*  well, we're not going to be like, dude, you were never there for me ever anyway.
*  But I've seen it happen with some of my friends who, uh,
*  maybe represent a swing districts or who are Democrats.
*  You got elected in Republican district. They're always going to have a really
*  tough race. Um, I,
*  I have seen it happen in real time where that,
*  those bully tactics come into play.
*  Speaking of tactics, speaking of tactics,
*  leadership strategy and tactics from Jocko.
*  They have a right now. You're going to need this when you're madam president.
*  Do I have to call you madam president? How's that work? Is that the word?
*  Madam president? That's what they use. It's not Mrs. President.
*  It's Mr. President and madam president. Yeah. That's a weird thing, right?
*  Yeah.
*  We're about to find out.
*  Mrs. President would be your last name is president. Yeah.
*  Which is weird. Mrs. Mrs. Generally means you're married. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
*  So yeah. I, I, madam president is, is what I've seen. Yeah, it has to be.
*  It's just never been done. You should call, always call me Tulsi.
*  All right. Madam Tulsi. Yeah. Well, whatever.
*  That seems like a dominatrix.
*  Madam Tulsi seems like that could be a real issue. Yeah. All right.
