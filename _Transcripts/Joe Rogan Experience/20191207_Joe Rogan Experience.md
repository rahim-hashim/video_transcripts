# Joe Rogan Experience #1395 - Glenn Villeneuve
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNocQzhPyac)
*  Boom, here we go. What's up Glenn? How are you man?
*  Hey Joe.
*  Nice to meet you in person.
*  Good to come down here. Good to meet you.
*  Dude you're one of my favorite characters on that show. It was always weird watching
*  you. For people who don't know, Life Below Zero, it's this crazy show where people live
*  in this very rugged terrain and you had the most interesting life because when you would
*  live up at the cabin, you would live by yourself. Just you in a very small room, just hunting
*  all your food and hiking around. You didn't use any vehicles and you just kind of had
*  a rifle and a frying pan and a pot and a place to sleep and you seemed really happy up there.
*  Oh yeah. I'm having a good time. I just wanted to strip everything away that I could dispense
*  with. I got the idea. I wanted to go back to living like a hunter-gatherer. Back in
*  97, I just got this idea. I was actually living in a tent in the woods down in Vermont, having
*  such a good time. I thought, where could I go with this? What could I do with this kind
*  of lifestyle? And I decided to move to the Brooks Range of Alaska.
*  What made you go live in a tent in the first place?
*  I just always liked the outdoors. I just loved nature. I was doing other things too, but
*  this one summer when I was in my 20s, when I found this really cool spot in the woods
*  and I thought, hey, I'll set up a teepee over there and I'll just hang out there this summer
*  as much as I can. And I just had a great time. So I started thinking more about, instead
*  of just living in the woods kind of as a recreational thing, I started thinking about, hey, how
*  could you actually make a life living like this? Get up every morning with the animals
*  around, the sky, the water. I started thinking about it. I started reading anthropological
*  stuff about hunter-gatherers that summer and I started getting ideas. It took me seven
*  years to make it to the Brooks Range and to get out to that lake that you've seen on TV
*  and to actually start living that way. It took me a few years just to organize my life
*  enough to move up to Alaska. And then once I got to Alaska, I was kind of in Fairbanks
*  for about four years before I could really spend long periods of time in the wilderness.
*  But once I got it all arranged, I just drove up the Hall Road, which is this industrial
*  road that goes up to the North Slope Oil Fields. It's very, very unimproved in areas, just
*  gravel road for hundreds of miles. I drove about 300 miles north of Fairbanks. I parked
*  my van and I walked 60 miles off of that road by myself out into the wilderness and started
*  figuring out how to live off the land.
*  How did you know where to go?
*  Oh, I had found the spot a few years before. I had actually found that lake flying around
*  in a little bush plane because part of my plan originally, when I formulated this idea
*  back in Vermont, I thought I'll become a bush pilot. That'll be a thing I can do in Alaska.
*  So I was thinking about starting an air taxi service. I had been studying flying for a
*  few years. As soon as I got my private license, I jumped in the plane and flew to Alaska.
*  But then when I got up there, I was getting my commercial and all that. And in the meantime,
*  as much as I could, I'd go out and explore, look around. And I discovered this lake one
*  day when I was flying across part of the Brooks Range. And I set up a little tent camp there
*  that summer, 2000. But it took me another four years before I could actually walk out
*  there and start living.
*  60 miles walking. That's a long fucking way.
*  Hey, I walked the length of Vermont when I was 13 years old. I walked from Massachusetts
*  to Canada. But the difference is when you're-
*  When you're 13?
*  Yeah. I actually started when I was 12, gave up. I was with my uncle. We went for about
*  a week. And then the next summer, I convinced my mom to drive me back down and drop me off
*  alone where we had given up the year before.
*  But that's-
*  Just you by yourself?
*  Yeah. When I was 13, I was alone. But that's a trail. That's called the long trail. And
*  it's marked. There's a little paint mark on the trees up ahead of you telling you where
*  to go.
*  Yeah, Brooks Still. You were 13.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a little kid.
*  Yeah.
*  And your mom's like, go, go ahead.
*  It was amazing. I was given a lot of freedom.
*  I guess so.
*  I mean, I'd already quit school by the time I was 13, you know?
*  Really?
*  I went back a few times, but yeah, I mean, I never finished the fourth grade, to tell
*  you the truth. But I went back. I went to one year of high school. Eventually, I was
*  curious about what was going on over there.
*  Did you ever get a GED or any of that jazz?
*  No, I never needed a GED for anything I did. But I went to ninth grade, and I did my own
*  thing after that.
*  But you seem like an educated guy. Are you self-educated?
*  If I got any education, it's self-educated. I mean, I like to be learning all the time.
*  Whatever I'm doing, I like to learn. But if I'm making a TV show, I want to learn everything
*  I can about it. If I'm flying airplanes, I want to learn a lot more than I need to know
*  And it's the same thing with going out there and living, just learning as much as I could.
*  There's so much to learn out there.
*  How long did it take you when you were 13? What did you do for food?
*  Oh, well, that was easy. Bite at the store and carry it on your back. I never hunted
*  when I was a kid. I mean, I remember going once or twice with some uncles of mine. We
*  never got anything. I didn't have any real hunting experience until that summer I walked
*  out to the lake.
*  Really? So you really just had a rifle and didn't quite know what you were doing?
*  I'd read a lot about what to do. The biggest thing, Joe, I got out there, I had two months
*  food. I left two months worth of food at the lake, okay, to get me started. And I walked
*  out there in July.
*  Can I pause you for a second? When you say two months food, what did you bring?
*  Oh, I had left basic stuff, grains, some beans, some rice.
*  A jug of oil, you know, basic, some flour was out there. And I left that the year before
*  when I had a plane. My whole plan to become an air taxi and do the bush flying, at that
*  time I realized this doesn't go together with living off the land and the wilderness. So
*  I actually sold that plane that summer and drove up the road and walked out to where
*  I had left these supplies the year before and decided that's what I really wanted to
*  just go live off the land. I don't need an airplane anymore. I don't need to fly. So
*  when I got out there, there was a 55 gallon barrel and it had some food in it, had a few
*  supplies. I had a tent, you know, it was insulated, but it hadn't really become a cabin yet. It's
*  the same place that you've seen, but it was just a little less solid back then.
*  And the cabin as it stands you built?
*  Yeah, well, I flew in the plywood and stuff. And then when I got out there, I put, I put,
*  I had a wall tent originally. I'd had a tent camp out there since 2000. I built a plywood
*  cabin under the wall tent basically, is what I did. But when I got out there, I had some
*  food. I had my rifle. I had fishing equipment. I started living. I started improving that
*  little cabin, you know. And by September I ran out of food, like complete. I had one
*  bag of flour, this little plastic bag of flour. It was all I had left when it got cold enough
*  that I figured I could start moose hunting. So that was my plan. I got to get a moose.
*  Why did you have to wait till it got cold? There's regulations?
*  Bugs. You got to preserve the meat. I've got no freezer. I had, you know, I had to wait
*  until, like I still do when I hunt moose. My moose hunting season starts the day I can leave a piece,
*  a scrap of meat out on the ground all afternoon and go look at it. There's no fly eggs on it.
*  That makes sense. Wow. That's crazy. So you have to, other than the rifle aspect of it,
*  you don't mean you're really living like a primitive hunter gatherer.
*  I would have used a bow and arrow if I thought I could have survived.
*  There's your spot right there.
*  There it is. Hey.
*  Well, if you only want to gather meat, the rifle's the way to go.
*  You know, I was always trying to just let go of everything I could do without,
*  but I never got to the point where I thought I could make it with just a bow and arrow myself.
*  You know, people used to survive out there before they even had archery. They survived
*  out there with spears, but there were groups of people. They would build a fence. They would
*  corral animals. They would put nooses up between trees to get a moose, things like that.
*  There's also probably a lot more animals.
*  I don't know that to be the case.
*  Maybe not Alaska. Alaska, probably not too much different, but throughout North America,
*  like if you listen to, or you read rather the tales of
*  Boone and, not Boone and Crockett, Lewis and Clark, when they made their way across the country,
*  they found a lot of game. There was a lot of animals. I mean, it was just an abundance of
*  animals. And then of course, if they ran into Buffalo, obviously there was millions and
*  millions of Buffalo.
*  Unbelievable. That's the difference between Alaska and down here. Down here,
*  we've modified everything. We've paved everything over.
*  Alaska's still wild.
*  Northern Alaska is the most wild place left in this country. That's why I went there.
*  It's barely this country too. I mean, it's not even attached.
*  Yeah, some people don't really think of Alaska as the United States.
*  It's not. It's not. It's a frozen Puerto Rico. It's way up there. It's not even connected to us.
*  It's one of those weird ones.
*  But it is wild. And you see, actually, that's what drew me to it. The first time I ever saw
*  the Brooks Range was years before I moved to Alaska. I was on a flight. I used to get jobs
*  as a courier. When I was in my 20s, I was real interested in traveling. And I found out this way
*  I could travel all over the world as a courier. So I would go to New York City. I'd get these jobs
*  as a freelance courier and take off to wherever they needed me to go. And one time I got this
*  flight to Tokyo and I'm flying right across the whole length of the Brooks Range. Great circle
*  route. New York, Tokyo takes you right across it. 600 miles of mountains from the Canadian border
*  over to the Chukchi Sea across from Siberia. And there's one road across it in 600 miles.
*  And I was just glued to the window the whole flight looking at that.
*  Wow.
*  I thought someday I'm going to go check that place out on the ground.
*  I mean, it's incredible when you see those mountains. They're big mountains. They're up
*  to 9,000 feet high.
*  Pete Slauson And that one road is the Hall Road?
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, the Hall Road, also known as the Dalton Highway. That was built in 1974
*  just to construct the Alaska pipeline to get to the oil up at Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope,
*  the oil fields up there. They built that road in one summer. It's an amazing story in itself.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, they started in April and they had the whole thing done in one summer from the
*  Yukon River all the way up to the Arctic Ocean.
*  Pete Slauson So, when you got down to one bag of flour,
*  was there a part in your head where you're like, what am I doing here?
*  Jared Slauson No, I never wondered what I was doing there.
*  Pete Slauson No?
*  Jared Slauson No.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, it always felt right for you?
*  Jared Slauson Oh, yeah. What I was doing there was looking for a moose.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Slauson And you already had that whole shed built for meat?
*  Jared Slauson Oh, there's no shed for meat.
*  Pete Slauson Well, what's that thing that you do where you have everything like
*  Jared Slauson The sod house?
*  Pete Slauson Covered up the sod house? Yeah.
*  Jared Slauson No, that came like four years later.
*  Pete Slauson Oh.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah. No, no, I didn't have that yet. I didn't even have a meat pole.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Jared Slauson No, I built the meat pole after I got the moose. The same meat pole that's still
*  there that you've seen is 20 feet high and I built that with a piece of parachute cord
*  and a little block and tackle that you can fit in the palm of your hand that just had parachute
*  cord around it and I had to get, well, that big, I'm actually talking about that platform that's
*  right beside the meat pole. The meat pole is 20 feet high. The platform is 15 feet high.
*  Pete Slauson Let's explain to people what a meat pole is so that they know.
*  Jared Slauson That's like my freezer. I don't have a freezer out there, so I just hang meat up and I
*  live in the freezer, the Arctic's your freezer, from September until usually sometime in May.
*  I can keep meat without anything other than the open air around it.
*  Pete Slauson That's a long time.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, it's most of the year.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Slauson The lakes only thawed out from June until
*  most years around the first of October, it freezes over. So, you get about four months open water,
*  about eight months of ice.
*  Pete Slauson So, you're basically living off of fish for those months?
*  Jared Slauson No. There was one year when I caught a lot of fish there
*  because I stayed there, I stayed there one time 15 months without going to town.
*  Pete Slauson Just by yourself?
*  Jared Slauson No. I was only there for four months totally by myself, but I'm not totally crazy. I
*  went back out and I got my woman to come in there with me after the four months.
*  Pete Slauson She's totally crazy.
*  Jared Slauson She may be true. I got divorced from her later,
*  but actually, no, most of the time I've been out there, I've had a family with me, most of the time.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Jared Slauson I went out there, you know, I actually was, I got married before I went out there.
*  I went out there for four months, I went back, I got Sylvia, my ex-wife, and we were out there for
*  years, you know, we would go back and forth. We would go to Fairbanks for six months or sometimes
*  a year, we'd go out there for a year, you know, we would go back and forth. And then what happened
*  was after we split up, I was out there one winter totally alone and that's when I got on the show,
*  right after that. It all just, the timing was perfect. I'm up there by myself,
*  I'm living real close to the land. I mean, I'm sleeping under caribou hides that winter
*  and I'm eating just caribou, like I had a little tiny bit of store bought food with me, hardly
*  anything. And I hadn't seen a human being in four and a half months.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Jared Slauson And the executive producer of the show flies from LA all the way up there to meet
*  me in lands. And it was –
*  Pete Slauson How did they know you were there?
*  Jared Slauson The summer before I was in Fairbanks and for a few years, I was trying to figure out
*  how can I share this stuff I'm experiencing because it's incredible. I'm just, I'm realizing that
*  this is not ordinary life anymore. And there are a lot of people that don't even realize what's going
*  on out here in the middle of the wilderness. So, I'm talking to people, I'm trying to find some
*  kind of a filmmaker or somebody and I don't know anything about it, but I'm trying to find somebody
*  to help me do something like a documentary or something like this. So, my friends know this,
*  somebody handed me an email address. They said, you should write to this person. They're looking
*  for people like you. They told me it was a filmmaker, I didn't know what it was. I sent off an email,
*  I said, hi, you know, I live in the wilderness. I'd like to talk to you about if you're interested
*  in making a documentary. And a few days later, I started walking from the road again to get back
*  to my camp. So, I left them a satellite phone number. I said, this is my only means of communication,
*  it's a satellite phone. I don't keep it turned on because it runs on a battery. You can send a
*  message to it, I check it once in a while, it's basically for emergencies only, but you can
*  communicate with me this way. And I put that in the email, how to do it. Well, that whole winter
*  went by, eight months went by, I hadn't heard from them. I'd forgotten about that person,
*  I'd sent emails to a lot of people. And then one day I turned on my phone, there's this message
*  there. They want to talk to me. So, I called them up and we start talking. And they tell me it's a
*  reality TV show. And I had literally never seen a reality TV show in my life. I hadn't watched TV
*  for many, many years. And- So, you had no idea what that even meant? Not really. I talked to them
*  about that. But they mostly didn't, they mostly wanted to talk about me, not about them. And I
*  kept trying to get information. Like, what is this? Exactly. You know? And because I kept, I remember,
*  I kept saying, what I really want to do, I want to talk about nature out here. And they're like,
*  well, we don't want to make a show about nature, we want to make a show about you. But in any case,
*  I learned what reality TV was over the next few months. Because after we talked for two weeks,
*  the executive producer flew all the way up from LA. He flew from Fairbanks on a little ski plane
*  out there to meet me. And he landed and met me to make sure that I wasn't the biggest bullshitter
*  they'd ever talked to. They had no idea. I mean, they're just talking to me on a satellite phone.
*  And I was telling them, okay, you know, right now I'm living off these two caribou I killed last
*  month. And they came out there and they saw that it was real. And they were like, yeah,
*  we want you in the show. Wow. And a few weeks later, we were making TV.
*  So they had to come out just to check to see if your story was legit.
*  Yeah. I mean, come out to the actual lake. Yeah. The actual lake where you're living.
*  I couldn't give them references. I mean, I was all alone out there.
*  Wow. That must have been very surreal for you. The guy lands out there, some Hollywood jackal
*  comes out to visit you. It was great. It was like getting out of solitary. I hadn't seen anybody
*  four and a half months. That's a long time. When I say jackal, I mean, without due respect,
*  I just mean a Hollywood person, you know, like a LA television producer flies out to meet you
*  when you're doing your wilderness thing. Like what a convergence of worlds. There's no world
*  that's more removed from the world of living by yourself in the woods than Hollywood. That's like
*  the most opposite of it. In some ways, but we're all human. Yes, we're all human.
*  And we had a great afternoon together. We had an awesome afternoon together.
*  So did you take them and show them your routes and all the places where you go?
*  It was in April. I had a packed trail on the snow. That's still winter where I am. And I took him
*  out for a walk up onto a mountainside so he could get a view of the whole country there. And
*  it just happened that the first grisly track I'd seen that spring that had come out of hibernation
*  was right there in front of us. The bear had hit my trail and was walking down my packed trail
*  right in front of us. It was that day, totally fresh track. So that was exciting.
*  And did you see the bear?
*  No, we didn't see the bear. It had headed up the mountain.
*  And it was walking a lot faster than we were. But we saw a lot of beautiful things that day.
*  He shot a sizzle reel and he brought it back for the network to see and everything.
*  Wow. So what were you thinking when the guy left? What was this gonna be?
*  That was fun. That was cool. I got to show somebody around out here because other than
*  my immediate family that had been there with me, my wife and we had two kids by then,
*  that they hadn't been there since the year before, but nobody had ever seen it with me.
*  I never had had anybody out there to walk anywhere all these years. By the time this happened,
*  I'd been out there for nine years off and on. I'd had my camp out there since 2000 actually.
*  And I'd been kind of living there at least half the time for nine years.
*  I'd gotten to know that country so well. All the mountains. I'd walked some days 20, 25 miles,
*  over 5,000 foot mountains and everything, hunting sheep, hunting caribou, and just looking around,
*  trapping sometimes, but always alone. Why was this life so appealing to you from such a young age?
*  The fact that you're 13 years old and you make that walk all the way across Vermont,
*  I mean, that's a long ass walk. I grew up in a small town right near the base of the highest
*  mountain in Vermont, Mount Mansfield. And some of my earliest memories are looking at that mountain
*  wanting to go up there. And I got to the top of the mountain by the time I was nine, but it took
*  me nine years just to get up there. Things take time. So this has always been something that
*  you're drawn to for some reason. You're drawn to being in the wilderness.
*  I'm drawn to a lot of things, but the wilderness is definitely one of them.
*  When you get there, do you feel like everything's right?
*  Like when you finally got to your place and you finally started, when you walked 60 miles out there
*  and started living, did you finally feel like, I'm in my spot. This is where I'm supposed to be.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like you knew.
*  I had literally been planning to do exactly that in the Brooks Range for seven years. Like,
*  that's what I was doing every day was preparing to do that.
*  Wow. But what was it about it that was so compelling? Like why was that a thing that you were
*  so drawn to?
*  Because when I was living in the woods before that, when I was in the teepee in Vermont,
*  every single day I'd wake up with a smile on my face. I'd just be excited what was going on,
*  get up, look out, see the fog coming up off the water on the lake. Oh wow, there's something
*  over there. There's a loon, whatever it is. I was just excited about what was going on out there.
*  I just felt really connected to it. And there are a lot of really positive aspects to being out in
*  the woods. I mean, just the physical part. Like I like to stay in shape. I like to be active.
*  You can't help but be active out there. You can't help but stay in shape.
*  I like the diet. I mean, once I started eating animals, I killed myself and food that I collected
*  myself, you know, plant food too. It was, that was the best food I ever ate in my life.
*  When I ate that first moose I killed. I mean, I never had anything better.
*  It's a crazy way to live, man. It's interesting because most people would tell you, hey, you got
*  to get a job. You got to be a normal person. You can't just go out there and live.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's what I told them. I said, I'm going to make a career out of this. Now,
*  I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out, but I was always confident that it was a
*  valuable thing to do and that it would not only benefit me, but in the long run, that I would be
*  able to share this with people and that it would pay off. And it did. It just took time.
*  Now, what did you do for money?
*  What I did for money was two things. One is I didn't go out there until I was 30 years old.
*  I didn't go to Alaska until I was 30 years old. I had to have some savings. And number two is I
*  arranged everything in my life so I had literally no expenses or almost no expenses. I didn't have,
*  I never had any debt. I didn't have student loan. Like I said, I left school early.
*  I didn't have a mortgage. When I got to Fairbanks, I found one acre of land on the edge of town
*  for $6,500. I built a little log cabin myself, 200 square feet, no plumbing,
*  just a wood stove to heat it with. I lived in a tent all winter before that cabin was done.
*  40 blow zero, that wasn't easy. And that was right on the edge of town.
*  And then moved into that cabin. I had everything arranged. I got a vehicle,
*  but it was all paid off. When I went to the Brooks Range, I literally didn't have any expenses except
*  about $300 property tax a year for that little cabin in Fairbanks.
*  What were you doing for jobs before that? You said you worked as a courier?
*  I did a lot of courier flying. That was mainly because I wanted to travel. But when I was in
*  my 20s, I was managing some real estate in Vermont. It was timberland. And that wasn't
*  something that I was interested in doing as a long-term career, but I was able to make some
*  money from that. And then the next thing that I was planning to do was to get into the aviation.
*  But the thing with the aviation is if you're going to have an air taxi service, you're not
*  going to be living out in the bush. I didn't realize that when I started down that path.
*  You see, I also did a lot of other preparation in terms of studying. And one of the things I did
*  too was I made these shorter forays into the wilderness. The first place was in Northern
*  Canada. And I went up to Northern Quebec five different times. One time, my girlfriend at the
*  time and I, we spent six weeks canoeing across part of Northern Quebec. Never saw a single person
*  in six weeks. During that canoe trip, we would see these small planes flying over.
*  And that's when I started getting the idea, these little float planes. I started thinking,
*  okay, I'm going to become a pilot. That's one reason it took me seven years to move to Alaska,
*  because I had to study aviation. There was a lot of different things I had to do. But that's when
*  I got that idea after that trip to Canada, I started studying flying. And that did slow me
*  down moving to Alaska. But that was a good thing too, because now I can actually afford an airplane.
*  I just got back into flying last year. And the next stage of my life, I think that's going to
*  be quite important. So when you first got there and you set up your shack, you're living out there,
*  you're hunting food, and did you feel like, I mean, this has been something that was like a
*  calling for you for a long time. It had to feel very strange that you were actually making it
*  happen. Like it must have felt cool. Oh, it always does when you do something you've been dreaming
*  about for a long time. Like what was it like to wake up there and go, I'm actually doing it?
*  Like this crazy pipe dream of living in the woods next to a lake. Now it's real. Yeah. Yeah. And I
*  just felt super fortunate. And that's still how I feel. Like all these things that I've experienced
*  out there, I realize how few people in this day ever get to experience these things.
*  Pete O'Reilly Oh, yeah. I mean, you're right next to grizzly bears.
*  Chris Wolfe Wolves, grizzly bears, wolverines, these animals inhabit the same area that I do.
*  And I have a lot of interactions with them because I'm out there so much.
*  Over the years, a lot of things have happened. I've spent a lot of time around wolves.
*  Amazing things that if you had asked me, I never would have thought would have happened,
*  could have happened. I mean, there have been times when I ran out of food and I've literally
*  tracked wolves and taken food away from them when they've killed caribou.
*  Pete O'Reilly What?
*  Chris Wolfe Yeah.
*  Pete O'Reilly How many wolves were there?
*  Chris Wolfe One time there was a lone wolf that got a caribou just ahead of me. He didn't have
*  time to do anything except gut it for me, literally. That's what they started eating is the guts and he
*  had opened up its belly and pulled the guts out and the whole caribou was there.
*  Pete O'Reilly Wow.
*  Chris Wolfe What happened that day? I was really hungry.
*  We had run out of food. I was out there with my ex-wife and we had –
*  Pete O'Reilly And your kids?
*  Chris Wolfe Had one baby at the time.
*  Pete O'Reilly So, you're out there with a baby and you don't have any food?
*  Chris Wolfe The baby was fine. She was nursing.
*  Pete O'Reilly And your wife doesn't have any food?
*  Chris Wolfe Yeah. Well, we always had something to eat,
*  just not enough. But I never, ever have been out there when I didn't have something to eat
*  every single day. Some days it was just one rabbit, some days it was just one ptarmigan,
*  which is very little food. But I've always been able to get something to eat. But this particular
*  year, it was kind of early on, this was the winter 2006, 2007. I hadn't been out there that long,
*  made a miscalculation. I was counting on caribou showing up because so far I'd always seen a lot
*  of caribou in the winter. That winter they didn't come. If I had known, I could have prevented the
*  situation. But we had taken one moose in the fall, I'd killed a moose in September. And I thought,
*  man, we got 500 pounds of meat. We're set, the caribou will come later in the winter. But it's
*  amazing how much meat you can eat when you're not eating much of anything else. And all that I was
*  eating at that time really was meat, fat, and maybe a cup of berries a day that I had gathered in the
*  fall and froze. So the moose, we went through that pretty fast. Found out that two adults can
*  eat a large bull moose in three months, if that's all you got to eat. I've eaten by myself a large
*  bull moose in six months. Yeah. For people that don't know, a large bull moose is about 2000
*  pounds. I don't think they're quite that big, but they're probably 1500 pounds. You probably
*  get 500 pounds of meat. So like a Yukon moose is like 2000 pounds? People exaggerate a lot of things,
*  Joe. So but a big one, like a 60 inch bull, how much does that get? Yeah, that's actually what that
*  bull was. It was about 60 inch bull. Wow. That one was actually 57, if I remember. I don't pay too
*  much attention to the exact measurements. So somewhere in the range of 1500 pounds, which is
*  like how many pounds of meat you think that is? I would guess that you probably are getting five,
*  600 pounds of meat out of there. Are you taking the femurs and getting bone marrow out of them
*  and doing all that jazz too? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's really important part of my diet when I'm
*  living off an animal is I like variety and the animal has a ton of variety in it. One caribou
*  will give you so many different options in terms of food if you know how to utilize it. I've eaten
*  everything out of a caribou except the poop, literally. You can even eat part of the antlers.
*  Oh yeah. In the spring when they're growing, they're soft on the ends. It's like a pickle.
*  You skin them, you take the velvet off. In the last inch or two, it's just, it's got the consistency
*  of a pickle. They're great. Really? You eat it raw? Yeah. I eat a lot of animals raw. I eat a lot
*  of parts of a caribou raw. But anyway, you get a lot of variety because you eat all the organs,
*  you eat the eyes, you eat the brain, you eat the liver, the brain. Oh yeah. Really? Spinal cord.
*  Whoa. Like I said, I've eaten everything except the poop out of a caribou, literally. I mean,
*  you can even, the cartilage, you can get all kinds of variety and it's nutritious. It's good for you.
*  I mean, I learned about all this from the old people that used to eat this way. I wouldn't have,
*  I would have been reluctant to eat certain things if I hadn't been educated by other people that you
*  can do this. I was talking to this nine-year-old woman in Fairbanks, and I asked her, so you eat
*  the brains? Because I'm thinking mad cow disease, prions. She's like, oh yeah, the brains are great.
*  And then I did a little research. They've never found prionic disease in Alaska and any of the
*  animals up there. So I was like, okay, I can start eating the brains. That's an issue that's
*  happening more and more here in the lower 48. You're getting a lot of CWD, which is another
*  prion disease. Very scary stuff. There's parts of Wisconsin where my friend Doug Durin lives where
*  50% of the deer they test, test positive for CWD, which is a real fatal disease and hasn't made the
*  jump to humans yet, but they're very concerned. And this is coming from the deer. Like you said,
*  there's a lot of deer and where deer and moose live together, the moose get it. We don't have
*  any deer. So other than moose and caribou, that's why we don't have the prionic disease.
*  You have no deer up there at all? Well, moose are a deer. Caribou are deer, but we don't have
*  anything other than moose and caribou. You don't have black tail. Those are much further south,
*  down in Southeast Alaska. I don't know their exact range, but nowhere near where I am.
*  That's interesting. It's too harsh of a country. It's not the right habitat.
*  Wow. So when you take this caribou away from the wolf, how does that go down?
*  What happened that day was... Thanks for reminding me. I've forgotten that story.
*  That's what we were talking about. I had a trail up the mountain. There's a lot of snow in the
*  winter, two, three feet of snow. So you've got to have packed trails to walk efficiently,
*  pack them down with snowshoes and stuff, and pretty much follow the same routes. I'm following
*  my trail to go up the mountain looking for food that day. And I came on. There were no caribou
*  around. I couldn't find a caribou anywhere. I didn't see caribou track for months.
*  They're migratory. And if they happen to migrate 10 miles away, I'm not going to see them. That's
*  out of my range. I come on a track of one caribou. It's wounded. It's bleeding. It's
*  being chased by one wolf. And it crosses my trail. So I start chasing. It was real fresh.
*  It was snowing out. And I could tell that this has just happened. This injured caribou,
*  this wolf is chasing it up this mountain. They're right ahead of me. I've got to follow this.
*  So... Do you have a rifle?
*  Yeah. Yeah. My rifle is my constant companion. I mean, that rifle goes just about everywhere.
*  I go up there. So I start just jogging up the mountain as fast as I can go. It's a 5,000 foot
*  mountain. And this caribou is wounded pretty badly. He's bleeding almost continuously.
*  And it's clear to me that if he doesn't make it over the top of that mountain,
*  this wolf is going to get him. I mean, going down the other side, I don't know, but this wolf has a
*  good chance of getting this caribou. This is usually the way they... They injure him and it
*  takes time. It's not like they just run up and knock him down. You know?
*  Usually hamstring them, right?
*  Yeah. They'll jump on their back. I see a lot of them injured on the big muscle right here on the
*  back legs. Is that what you mean? The hamstring? Yeah. Right in here?
*  Yeah. Yeah. They'll get them in there. You find a lot of caribou injured real bad that get away.
*  They get away with big pieces of hide ripped off of them.
*  Phew. I killed a caribou once that only had two good legs. It couldn't even walk anymore.
*  Wow. But anyway, I start chasing them up the hill, they're kind of zigzagging up the hill.
*  And this caribou obviously doesn't know this mountain. It doesn't know where it's going.
*  It heads in a direction where there's some cliffs on the other side of this ridge. And
*  I'm getting real hopeful at this point. And I still haven't seen them. They're ahead of me
*  on the mountain. And sure enough, the tracks come right up to the edge of the cliff, both the
*  caribou and the wolf and go right over the top of the cliff. And I'm like, there's no way that
*  caribou survived getting down. Because I know this mountain like the back of my hand. And
*  I just sat down there and I listened. And I sat there at the top of the cliff. And sure enough,
*  it's real quiet out there in the winter. The Arctic is just like dead silent. And I start
*  hearing the crunching in the snow of this wolf. And he's down in the ravine and he knows I'm up
*  there. He can sense that I'm up there at the top of the cliff. And he wants to bug out of there
*  at that point. And he just walked up the other side of the ravine. I'm looking across the ravine
*  and I see the wolf going up. And I know, hey, that caribou is down in that ravine somewhere.
*  So he's just getting away from you.
*  Yeah.
*  Do they already know you by then? Because you had shot quite a few wolves, right?
*  I trapped a few. I shot a few, not tons, but-
*  We shot a few on the show. The one time on the lake where it's frozen and-
*  Yeah. I didn't have a cameraman with me. That was actually, that story was told on the show
*  and I documented it a little bit as much as I could with my little camera at the time.
*  That day I shot three wolves, but that was a very unusual situation. Those wolves were actually
*  trying to get me, which is almost unheard of. But this was years before that. This wolf and
*  almost every other wolf encounter I've ever had, every other wolf encounter I've ever had,
*  the wolf wants nothing to do with you. I mean, the wolf knows I'm dangerous.
*  How do they know you're dangerous? Are they having any interactions with other humans?
*  Wolves know this all across North America. I've only been able to find two documented
*  bone of fighty cases where wolves have killed humans in North America in recent times. There
*  was this one guy, young guy up in Saskatchewan several years ago. There was one woman in Alaska
*  apparently was killed by wolves. It almost never happens. They just know that people are dangerous.
*  They've been persecuted. I mean, there were bounties on wolves. I think it's in their DNA now.
*  All wild animals, grizzly bears, they don't want anything to do with people 99.9% of the time.
*  It's interesting you saying that grizzly bears where they're hunted don't want anything to do
*  with people. They're having a real problem with grizzly bears in places like Montana where they
*  don't hunt them, where they don't have any fear, many, many generations of no fear of human beings.
*  And you're getting a lot of maulings because of that.
*  Yeah. I wouldn't be crazy about walking out in a national park where you're not allowed
*  to bring a gun.
*  Yeah. Well, Montana in particular, they have a lot.
*  So in this case, the wolf wanted out of there. It walked up the other side of the ravine. I watched
*  it. It was about three, 400 yards from me. When he got up to the top of the ridge,
*  he stopped way, way up high above. I remember looking at him through binoculars or maybe it
*  was the scope of my rifle. I just remember him giving a yawn. He laid down on the ground
*  when he knew he was safe way up there and he just gave a yawn and I could see his tongue.
*  It was just like a dog. I could see him give this yawn like he had just climbed up this big
*  mountain in about 10 minutes. So I just walked around the cliff, went down in there,
*  got that caribou. I actually made a backpack out of his rib cage to carry it home.
*  Wow.
*  It was cold. It was like 25 below. That was pretty brutal getting that thing
*  back to the camp from up on the mountain there.
*  How heavy was it?
*  I don't know. A lot of things I don't weigh, but I'd say a caribou like that probably weighs about
*  250 pounds, something like that. I obviously don't take all of that
*  weight at one time with me. I carry as much as I can.
*  Did you have a backpack that like a pack frame?
*  I had a frame and I just stuffed everything in the... I remember it was so cold and I was
*  so tired up there running up this mountain in the winter. And it's dark. It's dark up there.
*  There's no sun in the winter. I just remember getting the head off that thing, throwing the
*  legs and stuff in the rib cage and throwing it onto that frame I had. It was all inside
*  the big rib cage. Still had the skin on it and everything.
*  Was the wolf watching the whole time?
*  He was up on top of the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention to him after that. I don't know
*  how long he hung out up there. I would think that you would want to keep an eye on that fucker.
*  He knows you're stealing his food. I've done this other times. Wolves...
*  I spent a lot of times around the wolves. This is in a lot of times. When the snow conditions are
*  just right, you can actually keep up with wolves, believe it or not. I've stayed with wolves all day
*  long going eight or 10 miles. When the snow is deep enough, they start walking single file and
*  every wolf in the pack steps in exactly the same track. Their stride when they slow down to a walk
*  like that is just right for me. I can step right in their tracks. I don't even need snowshoes.
*  If there's less snow, you can't keep up with the wolf. They're normal gate. They're trotting. You
*  can't even come close to that speed. When the snow gets deep and they get single file, if you're in
*  good shape, you can jog behind wolves all day long. I followed wolves. I followed a pack of 12 wolves
*  one time, eight or 10 miles. They were hunting caribou right in front of me. There was another
*  time I remember taking caribou meat away from a pack of wolves, which I didn't even see. They'd
*  killed the caribou, but there's a lot of brush and different stuff around. I discovered it because
*  ravens flew up off it. I went over there and judging by the tracks, there were half a dozen
*  wolves around. I took that caribou that time, brought it home and ate it. But I had a lot of
*  interactions over the years with the wolves and I never had wolves act aggressive to me.
*  I've had them act curious. I've had them act scared. I've had them act indifferent. I never
*  had wolves act aggressive to me until that time, January 2012, when a pack of 20 wolves literally
*  took after me out on the lake and I did shoot three of those wolves.
*  And what was that about? Why do you think they were taking after you?
*  It was a very unusual situation. First of all, there were 20 wolves in one place.
*  That's unheard of up there. That's totally unheard of. The largest pack of wolves I've ever heard
*  account of that far north was 17 wolves and that was back in the 1970s. Usually there's five,
*  six wolves in a pack up there. It's a real hungry country. It's hard for them to feed themselves
*  if the pack gets bigger than that. They have to split up and go somewhere new. But I don't know
*  what happened that year. I don't know if two packs combined. I don't know if the pack just grew to
*  that size, but it was unheard of. Anyway, I'm up on a mountain. I look down at the lake. It's in
*  January. It's just twilight in the middle of the day. I see this big brown spot on the ice. I'm
*  like, what the hell's that? It's like out in front of my cabin about 500 yards. This big brown spot.
*  First I thought it was water overflow that comes up through the ice sometimes when you get a crack.
*  I get out the binoculars. I'm looking and holy cow, that's a giant pack of wolves that just took
*  something down on the lake. I can see one of them is breaking off, one of them is breaking off,
*  and then coming back over. I realize what's going on. There was very little snow that year,
*  even though it was January. It had been cold since September, but very little precipitation.
*  There was only about maybe four or five inches of snow, so I could literally run down the mountain.
*  I was down at the lake within 20 minutes. I went right to my cabin. I got my camera.
*  I got my tripod. I'm like, this is phenomenal. I got to document this. I start walking across
*  the lake out to where they are to get pictures of this. I get about 350 yards from these wolves.
*  I still don't know what the animal is that they got there. I can hear them. You can hear bones
*  breaking and stuff. The wolves, it's just amazing. I start taking pictures and I run out of batteries.
*  I'm like, oh shit, I ran out of batteries. I got to go back to the cabin. That's like 150
*  yards behind me. I turn around. I start walking back to the cabin. When I get about 30 yards or
*  so from the cabin, I look back over my shoulder and the whole pack of wolves is racing across
*  the lake straight toward me. I'd never seen anything like it. I sprinted like Jesse Owens
*  through the door of that cabin. I was only 30 yards from it. I turn and I look back out the window
*  and these wolves came right up into my yard. They were 50 yards from the front door, 20
*  wolves. Whoa. Yeah. This is unheard of. Wolves are usually high tailing it out of there when they see
*  people. I get my new batteries. I get the camera set back up. I go back out. By the time I get back
*  out in the yard, they're back over at this thing they've killed like 500 yards away. I want to get
*  more pictures of this. I got my rifle too, of course. I start heading back over. When I get
*  about 350 yards from them, I start taking more pictures. I got a great picture. You could pull
*  it up maybe. Yeah, I'm going to see that. It's in the notes section on my Facebook page is a story,
*  an unusual occurrence with the wolves. Anyway, they're all eating and I start taking pictures
*  again. After I take some pictures, first one, then two, then three, the wolves, I can see they
*  stop eating and they're looking at me. They're like 350 yards away, but I can just see that they
*  notice that I'm back out there on the lake and they're sizing me up. Then I see some of them
*  are just really slowly moving toward me, like walking a few steps and stopping. I'm thinking,
*  yeah, I got my rifle and everything, but there's a lot of wolves there. How do I know they're going
*  to stop when I start shooting? I decided maybe it's best just make a slow retreat. I started
*  backing up and walking back toward the cabin. The wolves, it looked like they were slowly walking
*  towards me as I'm walking toward the cabin. When I got about, if I remember right, it was 100 yards
*  from the cabin. Those wolves started galloping. All 20 wolves started galloping towards me.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, wow, look at this picture.
*  Yeah, those wolves right there, they start galloping towards me
*  and I dropped that tripod right there where I was. I was 100 yards from the cabin. They were
*  400 yards from me and I ran as fast as I could for the cabin because I thought, hey, if I start
*  shooting, what if they don't stop? It's 20 wolves there. I got four or five rounds of,
*  if I had one in the chamber, I had five rounds of ammunition there. I ran for the cabin. I go in the
*  door and just like the time before, they're right there in my front yard. I look out and they're
*  50 yards away. They're all milling around 20 wolves. I'm like, Jesus Christ, this is amazing. I've
*  never seen anything like this. But I'm safe and sound in the cabin. So I just collect my thoughts.
*  I'm like, man, it's time to teach these wolves a lesson. If I let those wolves leave now,
*  they're gonna think I'm just food. I run away when they see me.
*  I mean, I could be out there in the night, in the dark, not even know wolves are around and get
*  ambushed by them or something. So I had to shoot some of those wolves. So I loaded up the gun,
*  made sure everything was perfectly right, put some extra ammunition in my pocket,
*  checked everything out. Okay, I'm set to go out there with this gun and talk to these wolves
*  about this situation. And I go back out and they were back at the moose. It turned out to be a
*  moose they'd killed. They were back over there at the kill. So I thought, well, it'd be a lot safer
*  if I shot from close to the cabin, you know, rather than go out there on the open ice. So I'll just
*  see if I can lure them back over here. And I started running back and forth right in front
*  of my cabin on the ice just to get their attention. And sure enough, it worked.
*  That whole pack of 20 wolves started racing across that lake, a full gallop straight toward me. I
*  couldn't believe it. I was right in front of my cabin. I just run back and forth like 50 yards
*  out to my little water hole in the ice and back to the cabin a few times. And they just started
*  running right at me. So I sat right down there on the bank on the shore, right, you know, 15 feet
*  in front of my porch and started shooting. I think if I remember right, the first one I hit was 264
*  yards. I measured it all off the next day. It was kind of interesting just checking out the tracks
*  and seeing what had happened. I hit three of them. Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson What happened when one got hit?
*  Chris Bounds They stopped at the closest tracks to me were about 40 yards, you know.
*  Pete Slauson That's pretty close.
*  Chris Bounds When it was happening,
*  Pete Slauson That's so close.
*  Chris Bounds It was happening so fast. I was just sitting down, you know,
*  braced, shooting. I remember reloading after I shot five times. It all happened so fast. But then
*  the next day when I had time, I went out there and looked at all the tracks and measured everything
*  and sized up the situation, figured out where I had hit different wolves and stuff. And I wrote
*  that all down. That's what I was mentioning in the notes section there on my Facebook page,
*  that story because I wanted when it was fresh in my mind to really have the details because I knew
*  right then that something happened to me that doesn't really happen to people. I mean, to get,
*  have a pack of wolves come after you is a very unusual occurrence. You can read all over the
*  place that wolves don't attack humans. I've read that many times.
*  Pete Slauson But they have.
*  Chris Bounds They have.
*  Pete Slauson Well, particularly historically.
*  Chris Bounds Historically.
*  Pete Slauson The whole little red riding hood,
*  that's all because they were trying to warn children about wolves.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Do you know the story about World War I and the wolves?
*  The Germans and the Russians had a ceasefire in World War I because so many of them were getting
*  killed by wolves. They decided to stop killing each other and kill the wolves because they were
*  losing so many guys. And then, you know, if guys got shot on the battlefield, the wolves would find
*  out and the wolves would tear the guys alive. Yeah, it's a crazy story. If you go to TheMeatEater.com,
*  this is a story that I had told before and, you know, Steve Rinello, my friend who runs the media,
*  those guys were like a little skeptical of it. So, they historically researched it. It turns out to
*  actually be accurate. And there's a lot of stories from the New York Times and James Poynting, what?
*  Chris Bounds There has been an update on the story as of April of this year.
*  Pete Slauson Oh.
*  Chris Bounds I'm finding an article about it where they're talking about that and it links back to an
*  article from the New York Times in 1917. And this team researched a little bit farther before you got
*  too far. It turns out they debunked it in some way.
*  Pete Slauson In some way?
*  Chris Bounds Trying to figure out exactly how. It says there's no mentions of any wolf truce
*  and some Russian stuff. The Christmas Truce of 1914, I guess, is what it was called or something.
*  Pete Slauson I think that's a different truce.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, they just said there's no, I guess, there's no,
*  they couldn't find anything in the Russian sources, I guess, to prove that.
*  Pete Slauson They couldn't find anything in the Russian sources, but didn't they find things in
*  the German sources? I mean, there was absolutely recorded instances of people getting killed by
*  wolves. And I think they definitely did have some sort of a ceasefire to kill the wolves.
*  Like, the guys at meateater.com, they went over this really thoroughly with many sources.
*  Chris Bounds This is the information found its way into newspapers at the time,
*  but no one dared to check the New York Times sources.
*  Pete Slauson The New York Times might have bullshitted?
*  Chris Bounds This says, Meanwhile, Russian hunting scientist Sergei Matveyevichuk said there were no
*  Russian sources for this information. The earliest information appeared February 15, 1917,
*  in the Bridgeport Evening Farmer newspaper. Which would be an American newspaper, I guess.
*  Pete Slauson Go to the meateater.com story on it. I think it's the meateater.com. How the
*  fuck do they not have meateater.com? I don't understand that. Buy that, please. But anyway.
*  Chris Bounds It is difficult.
*  Pete Slauson Wolves have killed people.
*  Chris Bounds It's difficult though to get to the truth. I mean, it's hard. There's so much BS,
*  who knows what's true, what's not sometimes. But I know that historically, there are a lot of
*  reports of wolves in Russia killing people for some reason. And you know, in maybe Scandinavia,
*  in the older times when there were more.
*  Pete Slauson Do you know about Paris? Do you know about the wolves of Paris?
*  Chris Bounds No.
*  Pete Slauson It's a very famous story. Apparently,
*  at one point in time, and now they're starting to see wolves around Paris again. But at one point
*  in time, wolves had actually invaded Paris. And there's an historical account of the townspeople
*  getting together and spearing these wolves. Google the wolves of Paris.
*  Chris Bounds Their article on the meateater was updated in August of this year. And their
*  takeaway at the end of that, because they said it was actually mentioned in multiple newspapers,
*  but it might have been a bar room tale. But there are reports of people dying
*  from wolves. Hundreds of people killed wolves in the war. There was a ceasefire of some kind, but
*  the actual events all being together at that exact one may not be accurate.
*  Pete Slauson I think what had happened was,
*  what they were saying was because of war itself, all the gunfire, these wolves had moved away from
*  certain areas. And then they had found wounded soldiers and they started eating the wounded
*  soldiers. So, then they started to associate gunfire with wounded soldiers. So, they started
*  actually going towards where the gunfire was, which is what you hear with grizzly bears.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, people talk about that with bears. I've never experienced that. I'm a little
*  bit skeptical, to be honest, about animals associating gunfire with food and going toward
*  gunfire. That to me seems a bit farfetched. Pete Slauson Apparently, it's an issue in places
*  where the grizzly bears aren't hunted. Chris Bounds People claim that, yeah.
*  Well, they have rules in certain places where if a grizzly bear finds your elk, you have to leave
*  it alone. Like, you're not even allowed to scare it off. You have to get out of there. Like, it's
*  not yours anymore. Which is a fucking bummer. Pete Slauson Yeah, and I have that issue. Bears
*  find kills. When you're working alone, you got to leave meat. You got to make multiple.
*  Chris Bounds Yes, of course.
*  Pete Slauson With a moose, I have to make 10 trips.
*  Oh, of course. Now, when you found these wolves, and you like, when you started shooting and you
*  hit one, did the other ones freak out? Did they realize what's going on?
*  Chris Bounds They started putting on the brakes, but like I said, the first wolf I hit was over
*  250 yards. I think it was 264 yards, something like that, from me. And some of the tracks came
*  about 40, 40 to 50 yards from me before they had stopped. They were doing U-turns, you could see.
*  They were all just milling around. When I was reloading, I just remember seeing all these
*  wolves milling around in front of me, like running around in circles, and I was like,
*  holy cow, and I'm reloading. And I remember shooting one more time as they were headed away,
*  but they all took off. They headed into the woods, and one of the wolves that I had hit was
*  paraplegic, but he was still going on two legs. So, I ran in –
*  Pete Slauson So, it spined him.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, I ran in the cap. The other two had just dropped immediately. One of them was hit
*  right in the head, but I ran in the cap and grabbed my 22 because I didn't want to put a big
*  30 out of six hole in this wolf that was paraplegic. And I chased him down, caught up with him, shot him
*  with a 22. Then, I could hear all the other wolves howling and howling. They're like, you know,
*  probably almost half a mile away from me by then. They were up in the woods on the other side of the
*  lake, and I just ran – I ran over to that – what they had killed, and this was the first time I saw
*  it. It was a year and a half old bull moose, and it was still all there. The legs were still on,
*  and I got pictures of it and stuff. They had just started eating it not long before I started
*  photographing. Pete Slauson Were the pictures on your Facebook page?
*  Chris Bounds Not of that moose. They put those on LBZ, I think.
*  Pete Slauson What's LBZ?
*  Chris Bounds Life Below Zero.
*  Pete Slauson Oh.
*  Chris Bounds When they showed that story, that was way back – you know, that was like six years ago.
*  That was one of my first stories. That's a different moose. I got charged by one out there.
*  Pete Slauson So, when you find the wolves that you did shoot,
*  and you shot and killed three of them, do you eat them?
*  Chris Bounds You know, I ate some of those just because I was law and food. I don't like to eat
*  wolf meat, if I can help it. To me, there's like cleaner meat and there's dirtier meat. I don't
*  really like to eat bears. A lot of people eat bears. I've eaten the one grizzly bear that I ever
*  shot. I didn't shoot him because I wanted to eat him. I shot him because I needed to shoot him.
*  But if I have caribou and moose, I don't really want anything else. Really ungulates is what I
*  like to eat. Pete Slauson Right. Of course.
*  Chris Bounds They're cleaner. If you see the stuff that bears eat,
*  I don't know why people are so crazy about bear meat. Some people really like bear meat. But I've
*  seen what bears eat and I don't really want to be eating bears.
*  Pete Slauson Rotten food a lot of times, right?
*  Chris Bounds Oh, yeah. And I mean,
*  they just got a lot more parasites that can actually harm you.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Chris Bounds Like a caribou is a clean animal. There's a couple things they can have that can
*  hurt you, not too bad normally. But a grizzly bear, I mean, you skin it and there's worms this long
*  crawling out their ass and they got a lot. And those worms can hurt you. They're bad if they
*  get into a person. They can cause serious problems because they don't stay in your intestines. They
*  go into your brain and different weird places. If the eggs get into you and they hatch because
*  they're an unfamiliar host, they don't know where to go.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, Jesus.
*  Chris Bounds They go into spinal cord. They go all over the place.
*  Pete Slauson What do they do if that happens to you?
*  Chris Bounds A lot of kids have had big problems. The same kind of,
*  very similar kind of worm lives in raccoons. So kids playing on the playground,
*  they, you know, raccoon feces has the eggs in it.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, wow.
*  Chris Bounds It's, balis ascaris is the genus of worm. It's like a round worm.
*  Normally, it doesn't cause the bear too much problem. It just lives in their intestines.
*  But if that larva, if you get an egg in you and the larva doesn't know where to go,
*  he's an unfamiliar host and they act differently, they'll migrate into weird places in your body,
*  like nervous tissue. They get in your eyes and stuff.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, look at that. Someone's got one in their eyes.
*  Oh, Jesus. The parasite on the playground. Round worm. Wow. Look at that, man. In the eyeball.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson What do they do?
*  Chris Bounds Well, I've never got one in my eyes.
*  Pete Slauson Fuck that. Look at that thing. Traveling around inside this person's eyeball.
*  Chris Bounds You know.
*  Pete Slauson Fuck that, man.
*  Chris Bounds There's a lot of parasites out there. That's the thing people don't realize is like,
*  humans used to have a lot of parasites in them.
*  Pete Slauson How many people have them in their eyes? Look at all those pictures, the eyeballs.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, I killed this one bear one time and those worms, they were –
*  Pete Slauson That one on the left, Jamie. Right to the left of your cursor, right there. Click on that.
*  Chris Bounds It says 15 worms in that one.
*  Pete Slauson Click on that. Oh my God. Their eyeballs overcome with fucking worms.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, I've had to deal with those worms, but not in me.
*  Pete Slauson 15 centimeter, that's what it says.
*  Chris Bounds Oh, okay.
*  Pete Slauson That's so long.
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, they're long. They're about as big around as your pinky.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, God.
*  Chris Bounds This is 14 worms in this woman's eye.
*  Pete Slauson Oh my God. Look at her fucking eye.
*  Chris Bounds It's disgusting.
*  Pete Slauson Oh my God, that's so insane. Fuck parasites, man.
*  Chris Bounds There's so many parasites, it's creepy. Like, I've seen a lot of parasites,
*  but most of them won't hurt a human. Those are one that will. And the one that's in the grizzly
*  bear is just a slightly different variation from that one that's in raccoons. It's – Bayless
*  iscarus transfuga lives in the grizzlies up there. And yeah, I've had them.
*  Pete Slauson So, are you wearing rubber gloves when you kind of open and everything?
*  Chris Bounds No. Hell no.
*  Pete Slauson No?
*  Chris Bounds No, but I did build a big bonfire right there because it was right in my yard,
*  and I just burned the ground because I got little kids up there and they were, you know,
*  crawling around that time playing and stuff. And I just built this huge bonfire because I want to
*  make sure no eggs – the eggs are very resilient. They can last for years and years in the environment.
*  They can survive being frozen all winter.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Chris Bounds Oh yeah. They're microscopic eggs. That's what you got to worry about. Not the big
*  worm. You got to worry about the eggs. Fuck! A lot of bear hunters don't know this. When you're
*  handling a bear skin, those eggs are on the fur. Yeah. If you're playing around with a bear skin
*  before it gets tanned and then you go like this or something, all of a sudden you got those eggs
*  in you. Scary shit.
*  Pete Slauson Dude!
*  Chris Bounds Fuck that! Oh, that's one of my number one fears. Something creepy crawly growing
*  inside me. Getting in my eyeballs and into my brain tissue. I have a buddy of mine, my friend
*  Justin Wren. He does a charity called Fight for the Forgotten, and he builds wells for the pygmies
*  and we help sponsor him and we do some things with him. He goes back and forth to the Congo
*  like a couple times a year. He went there recently, like six months ago, and has caught a parasite
*  that they can't identify. They think it might be in his brain. They don't know where it is,
*  but he'll work out really hard and then he'll be shivering with pale skin. They're trying to do all
*  these different things to him to try to eradicate the parasites. They don't even know exactly what
*  he has because he's so deep into the jungle. He's so deep in the Congo, he's going where a lot of
*  western people don't go. So, they're really baffled. They're like, we don't know what the
*  fuck you have. And he's had it for months, months and months and months of suffering and just,
*  it's taken a toll on him across the board. Every aspect of his health is deteriorated because of
*  this. It's really creepy. I've heard of people dying from parasites they picked up in the tropics.
*  So, when you eat the wolf, what do you eat? Do you eat the backstraps? Do you cook the hams? How do you
*  eat a wolf? The only way that I like to eat a wolf is I boil it for a good long time because wolves
*  too will have parasites. They'll have trichinosis. They're meat eaters. Anything that eats meat,
*  you want to make sure it's thoroughly cooked. I like to boil it. Boiled wolf. Yeah. I haven't
*  eaten a lot of wolf. I've eaten wolf three or four times when I didn't have much else.
*  And I figured, hey, I better take advantage of this food I got here rather than give it to
*  something else to eat. Do you feed it to your family? They've probably eaten wolf like my kids
*  when they were little, maybe once or something. That is hilarious. How many people could you ask
*  that to? And they go, yeah, my kids are probably eating wolf. I don't know. I met these Mongolians
*  once and they were like, oh, you shoot some wolves? We want wolf meat. We love wolf meat. Mongolians,
*  they're all into it. Yeah. A lot of Native Americans were into wolf meat. I don't like it.
*  A lot of trappers were into wolf meat. Well, that's what they had to eat. But some of them
*  actually preferred it. Really? Yeah. There was something from the Lewis Clark exhibition.
*  Oh, yeah. There's another thing that Expedition, that was something from
*  Ronella was telling me about. Some guys actually preferred wolf meat. It's like their favorite
*  meat. Well, domestic dog. Lewis and Clark Expedition, they would buy dogs from the
*  Indians and eat them because they didn't want to eat salmon. They had fish is what I heard.
*  They could have eaten, but they'd rather eat dog because they wanted red meat.
*  Oh, Jesus. Yeah. Wow. When they got way out, like the Columbia River area.
*  So did you eat these wolves that you shot? I ate a little bit of it because I was short on food
*  at that time, that winter. Not like the whole thing, but a few meals of it.
*  So you boil it and how do you do it? Like onions, potatoes, make a soup?
*  I didn't have anything like that. No?
*  I mean, no, I'm out there all winter long. That was 2012, 2013. I didn't have any vegetables.
*  Do you know where I get the vegetables? Out of the caribou's stomach. What the caribou
*  eats for plant food, that's what I get for plant food in the winter. That's the only...
*  So you would actually eat their stomach contents?
*  Yeah. Really?
*  Sure. People's done it for thousands of years. I believe you. I believe they have.
*  Not only that, but I pickle meat in it. I take tenderloins off of caribou are great
*  pickled in their stomach contents. Pickled in their stomach contents. Explain that to me.
*  How do you do that? Well, you gotta learn about caribou's stomach
*  because you don't want to go too far downstream. It starts turning brownish.
*  But like the first... The big chamber, the rumen, when they eat these lichens,
*  in the winter, that's what they're feeding on. You can't eat those lichens off the ground.
*  They're harsh. But when it's partially digested in a caribou stomach, it actually isn't edible
*  food. And the old people used to eat these a lot. I read about it and I even talked to some people
*  who had done it when they were kids and stuff. And sure enough, it's not bad stuff. I got hooked
*  on it, man. One winter, I was eating a lot of caribou stomach contents. And yeah, my family
*  wasn't into that. They were looking at me like... And I was like, oh man, it's like salad. This stuff's
*  good. I don't eat much of that anymore. Basically, I went as primitive as I could go,
*  and I satisfied my curiosity about living that extreme of a subsistence lifestyle.
*  So now, I eat much more store bought vegetables. I eat normal foods. But for a time there, for a
*  few years, I got down to where I was eating caribou stomach contents. I was doing anything.
*  I just wanted to just immerse myself in that whole environment out there. I wanted to get my food
*  right there, what I could see, what I could get myself. Just get right into it. 15 months without
*  even going out to town, not talking to other people. That time I had my wife there. But
*  just to really get into a different state of consciousness, it puts you in a different
*  state of consciousness. And it's a beautiful thing. Now, when you said pickled stomach contents,
*  how are you pickling a tenderloin in the stomach contents? You just take the caribou. You get to
*  the right chamber of the stomach. They got four chambers on their stomach. You just cut a little
*  slit in it. Just after you've pulled the guts out, and you just slip the meat in there. You slip it
*  right into the room and in the contents there. And what happens is, assuming the temperature's
*  about right, it will retain a lot of heat. It creates heat. I think the microorganisms in there
*  create heat. Because if you just bury that in snow, and the snow of course insulates it, it'll stay
*  warm for quite a while. And if it was really cold, it might not work out. It might freeze solid before
*  it pickled. But if it's the right temperature, the meat will turn brownish color over time,
*  and it'll be pickled. Old people used to do this all the time. I read about this 20 years ago. And
*  then I talked to people. And I said, yeah, this is safe to do. So I tried it. And there was a
*  winter there where that's where I got a lot of my vegetables was out of the caribou stomach.
*  And the meat will just, it'll turn brownish first on the outer part of the meat, and then
*  all the way through it. And it gets pickled. I've done a lot of different things with meat. You know
*  what I like to do with meat? A lot of people don't realize, because you live in the modern world,
*  and just like me when I grew up, right? Meat's dangerous if it's raw. You got to be careful.
*  You got to wash everything, be careful. Actually, what I found is that it just all depends on the
*  conditions. Once you learn how to handle meat properly, you can do a lot of things with meat
*  that most people would be scared to death of. And it's completely safe as far as I'm concerned. I
*  never had any problems with it. But like moisture is very important. If you buy meat in the store,
*  it's wrapped in plastic that keeps it moist. You let it sit around for a while, it spoils,
*  and it doesn't take long. Leave meat out of your refrigerator, it'll be spoiled in a day, right?
*  But if you take a muscle out of an animal and you butcher it properly, you separate the muscle
*  as one piece. You don't make a bunch of cuts in the fascia. You can take a muscle that's two or
*  three inches thick. Don't put it in plastic. Don't wrap it up. That'll cause it to spoil.
*  You leave it right out in the air. Two or three inch thick muscle. I set them on a rack
*  up high above my wood stove. It's like a hundred degrees up there sometimes. Other times it's cold
*  up there. It just varies during the day depending on how the fire is stoked, right? I'll let it sit
*  there for a week, 10 days, and then I'll eat it. Never cook it. Just let it sit there.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Never cook it.
*  No. Just let it sit there.
*  So it gets a crust on the outside?
*  It gets a crust on the outside, but it's too thick of a piece to dry like you would dry jerky or
*  something. It stays moist inside. It's like making cheese. It turns into something like cheese. It
*  gets different flavors.
*  You're aging it.
*  Yeah. It's actually fermentation that's taking place. I believe it's actually a fermentation
*  process, but it takes on different flavors. I really like it. I call it gummy meat because
*  that's what my kids used to call it.
*  Gummy meat.
*  Gummy meat because it gets kind of gummy.
*  Oh, God.
*  It's good.
*  No, it's good. It's good. It really is. I wish I had some. I was saying when I left Alaska,
*  I wish I had something like that to bring Joe down, but I didn't have anything.
*  So what's going on there?
*  I was looking for something about the caribou stomach and there's this thing called the polar
*  manual made by the government. I think the Navy. It says the caribou back fat is better than chewing
*  gum. I think this was made in 1961, so it might be even older.
*  Look at this. Old timers from the North mention many interesting Eskimo Indian and Siberian foods.
*  Pemmican. I've heard of that. It's the meat of bear, seal, caribou, and walrus mixed together
*  with fish, eggs, and dried into a hard frozen block. Trapper's peaches and cream is chewing
*  dried beaver tail. Caribou back fat is better than chewing gum. Don't overlook the contents
*  of a seal's stomach for a fresh fried fish dinner, nor the contents of a caribou stomach
*  mixed with the trip lining as a tasty, in quotes, salad of reindeer moss and lichens
*  properly, how's that word, acidulated? I like the next one there. Walrus milk that death gives 16
*  quarts of milk. I love dairy products. You can't get them out there.
*  16 quarts of milk from a walrus.
*  I one time, I was thinking about milk in a caribou after I killed her, but I didn't just
*  because she was in bad shape. She had been attacked by the wolves and she had an infection in her leg,
*  and I was afraid that somehow I might get sick. But I just remember this lactating caribou
*  that I had killed and I was thinking, I never heard of people doing that, but
*  milking an animal after it died until you just read that, but walrus milk.
*  So you were worried you would have taken the milk except for the fact that she had been infected.
*  She was the one that only had two good legs and her back leg going right up there towards her
*  udder. Oh, it was in terrible shape. It was full of pus.
*  Damn. I encountered that with an elk shot once. He had been stabbed by another elk
*  like in his, one of his back legs, and it was just all filled with pus. Like when we were
*  quartering him and taking it apart, there was this one section that was just all pus. It was
*  fucking nasty. I've seen the same thing in a moose stabbed in the back, like in the haunch there.
*  Yeah. By one of the tines.
*  So when you boiled the wolf, how are you eating that?
*  Just plain.
*  Just plain. Just chop it up?
*  You can fry it after you boil it, give it a little extra flavor.
*  Is that what you do? Or do you just-
*  If you get some fat.
*  Yeah.
*  Was that what you were doing or were you just eating it boiled?
*  Both.
*  What is it like? Is there something you could-
*  Tastes a little wolfy.
*  Wolfy.
*  I'm not much into wolf meat.
*  It's-
*  Right. It's a desperation food, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Is that how you would look at it?
*  If I didn't have something else, I'd eat wolf, but I got other things.
*  There's all kinds of stuff you can do with food. You can-
*  You can get as primitive as you want.
*  Yeah, I can imagine.
*  But there's so much else going on. For me now,
*  if you want to live that primitively off the land, that's all you do. It takes all your time.
*  If you want to share that life with other people, like what I've been trying to do
*  the last six years, you can't just do that.
*  Yeah, because you don't really have the amount of time to hunt and gather like you would.
*  Yeah. I wouldn't even have the ability to communicate.
*  Right.
*  I wouldn't even be able to arrange to be on your show if I was out there
*  living the way I was living six, seven, eight years ago.
*  Right. So I want to- How long did it take before you got it down or you knew what to do?
*  You said when you went out there the first time, you really had never even hunted before.
*  Correct.
*  So how long did it take before you had a system down where you're like,
*  okay, I got this. I know what I'm doing.
*  Well, I did my homework. I did a lot of reading before I went out there.
*  So I picked it up pretty fast. That first moose I killed,
*  the biggest thing I had ever killed before that was a snowshoe hare. But I did all right.
*  I mean, I salvaged that whole moose and it was 600 yards from the lake. I got it all down to the
*  lake. I got it back to the camp. I just believe in approaching problems in a measured way. Don't
*  rush into it. It could be dangerous. Kids that have gone out there, they want to live off the
*  land and they've starved to death. People have died. But if you do your homework, if you want
*  to do something like that, not just going to live in the wilderness. If you want to do anything
*  dangerous, do it carefully. So I studied so much before I actually started putting into practice
*  that it came pretty fast. Within a couple of years, I felt like I pretty much had things
*  together out there. A couple of years is a long time though. So for a couple of years, you're just
*  kind of piecing it together. Well, I was on a steeper learning curve the first couple of years.
*  I'm still learning. I mean, we're all learning all the time. But yeah, like that winter that I
*  learned that you can't count on the caribou. If you got two people out there, you better get
*  two moose in the fall because the caribou might not show up. So would you, like when you shot a moose
*  and you knew you had enough meat, you would stop right there? You'd say, okay, I'm good.
*  Yeah. I mean, in the fall, normally- Normally.
*  You know, like 14 falls I've spent out there, I've always gotten a moose in September, always. And
*  normally, if I'm alone, that's all I need is one moose that'll last six months, even if I didn't
*  get caribou. If I'm with a woman or I got two little kids out there like I did some years,
*  that's not going to be enough to go through the whole winter.
*  So you would get another moose? Some years I did get two moose.
*  What are the regulations? The regulations?
*  There's different regulations for subsistence hunting, right?
*  Not really. In that particular area, there really isn't much difference at all in subsistence
*  regulations. There are a lot of myths about that. The only difference where I was in terms of
*  subsistence regulations was federal regulations as they applied to migratory waterfowl. So I can
*  legally, when I'm living there, hunt ducks in the springtime. But all the other seasons are exactly
*  the same. But the truth of it is, Joe, when I first went out there, I couldn't even have a hunting
*  license. The hunting license expires in December. How the hell am I going to get a new one?
*  Right.
*  January, February, March, April. Sometimes I'd go to town in the summer and get a new hunting license.
*  I didn't even have a calendar. I didn't have a watch. I figured, okay, it's around the equinox,
*  it's late September, that's the moose hunting time. But what mattered to me was that the flies
*  were no longer laying eggs, then I could hunt moose. It was legal because the legal season
*  actually started even earlier than that, but I didn't care about the legal season. What I cared
*  about was when I can preserve the meat. And the caribou season is pretty much all winter long,
*  pretty much all year long. I think they got a month or two in the summer now you can't hunt them. But
*  the season didn't affect me too much. One difference in my life now is that I play by the
*  rules. I didn't used to play by the rules. It was illegal for me to even live there.
*  When I got up to Alaska, I discovered that, hey, you can't just go live out in the bush
*  legally. I went and talked to the state. I said, this is what I want to do. They said,
*  that's actually illegal. Well, it's actually illegal, but things were loosely enforced
*  20 years ago too. I got away with it for 17 years before I had a permit to live there.
*  So when you had to get a permit, do you have to tell them, hey, I've been living there for
*  17 years? Oh no, they flew out and told me, hey, you've been living here 17 years, you've got to
*  start paying for a permit. Really? Actually, you can't get a permit to live there. Oh yeah.
*  I'd been waiting for 17 years. I built the camp, the original tent camp in 2000. So I occupied that
*  spot since 2000. It was a known thing. I had told people at the agencies that are managing that land
*  that I was going to go out there and everything. But yeah, 20 years ago, it was just a little looser,
*  I think. And also I wasn't hurting anybody. Who cared? There was nobody else out there.
*  It wasn't like there were other people that wanted to do something with that spot or anything.
*  So some years there would be a state trooper that would land there in a little ski plane and
*  check on me. Ask me, hey Glenn, you need anything? I can bring you some toilet paper next time I come
*  by or something. It was never a problem, but as time went on, of course, and once I got in a TV
*  show, I thought when I got in the show, I was like, okay, I'm going to-
*  Blow your cover.
*  Blow my cover, for sure. I remember saying, hey, can we do this show without telling people where
*  I am? No, no, no, we can't do that. Oh no. So did people come to visit you?
*  People discovered where I was the first week I was on TV. I had people writing to me saying,
*  hey, is this your camp? And they had a satellite photo of it. They're like, we tracked you down.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. That had to feel weird.
*  That had to feel so weird.
*  I tell you, I kind of was like, I was like, wow, congratulations, you found it. I thought
*  it was amazing, like the skill that, because we didn't say exactly where it was on TV.
*  These guys figured it out, like looking at the footage on TV, the mountains and just knowing
*  that it was somewhere in the Chandler area, which is a huge area. And then they started looking at
*  satellite photos and they tracked me down. I was like complimenting them, like, good job.
*  Well, if not, you mean 60 miles off the hall road, all they have to do is make a grid.
*  Well, 60 miles as you walk, not as the raven flies.
*  Oh, okay.
*  We don't have any crows up there. But basically, yeah, it changed things. And there was one day,
*  just a couple of years ago when I was out there with Trisha, my partner now, and heard a plane
*  coming in the distance. And you just don't hear planes coming in low, like going to land very
*  often, like maybe three, four times in 20 years I've ever had a plane come out there and land when
*  I was out there. Well, except the state troopers landed maybe a half a dozen times. But
*  I hear this plane coming and I was like, they're landing here. And I said to Trisha, I said,
*  this could be the day I've been waiting for for 17 years is probably the state coming to talk to
*  me about the situation here. And it was. And-
*  You've been waiting for 17 years.
*  Well, I mean, yeah, it had been a long time. So I mean, I just believe in being honest about stuff.
*  I told everybody what I was doing, but just because it happened to be technically illegal,
*  I wasn't going to give up my dream of living in the Alaska wilderness.
*  So what's the first thing they say to you when they land? Hey, Glenn, saw you on TV.
*  Yeah, I was like, hi, how's it going? The pilot who brought him felt real bad,
*  because he knew me and they had hired him. But no, I didn't mind. I mean, what the hell?
*  I was living on state land. I didn't have a permit. I needed a permit.
*  Right. So how does that work? How much does it cost?
*  I paid a thousand dollars a year after that. I had to pay some back fees.
*  But honestly, you can't get a permit to live on public land. You can get a permit to do certain
*  things there. I was given a permit at that time for a commercial trapping permit or trapping
*  cabin permit, they call it. And then for the purpose of making television, I paid a thousand
*  dollars a year for that. I paid all my back dues. I paid everything off. I'm okay.
*  You're clear. We're clear. But what about hunting licenses?
*  I talk about it even if I'm open. I don't, I got no secrets.
*  But there's no risk of them taking away your hunting license because you've hunted
*  without one for a long time. I don't know what the statute of
*  limitations is on that one, but I play by the book now. Ever since, you know, six years ago,
*  I pretty much, I got on TV and by that time there was no problem getting a hunting license
*  because I got a lot of planes going back and forth. I mean, I always buy my hunting license.
*  There were in the early years, there were times when I literally had no way to get a hunting
*  license when it would expire in December. When I got to town the next time I bought a hunting
*  license, I mean, I always paid every year. But yeah, I mean, I try to do it by the book now.
*  Did you ever eat any Raven? No.
*  I heard Raven tastes good. I heard Crow. I heard Crow tastes good.
*  I heard it's very similar to like diver duck. Like if you prepare it correctly,
*  you know, diver ducks, they- Yeah, like a merganser.
*  More of a fishy taste to them. Oh, you mean like, yeah, like some of them,
*  yeah, like a scoter. Yeah. But apparently Raven,
*  the Crow, you can eat it. It's good. Oh, you can eat anything. It's whether or not you want to.
*  What's the weirdest shit you've eaten? Weasels.
*  Weasels. No question. That was the weirdest.
*  Yeah. It was like the hand to mouth period when ran out of moose meat, caribou didn't show up.
*  I was starving. I was literally starving and I was getting a little bit to eat every day,
*  but I was running all over the mountains hunting, burning up lots of calories. And I can eat three or
*  four pounds of meat a day. Some days all I was eating was a grouse or something. And there were
*  a couple days when the only thing I brought home were a couple of weasels. You know, I was trapping
*  Martin. I had Martin traps out and sometimes weasels go into them. And I've eaten weasel.
*  And I'll tell you something about weasel. They smell like a skunk. They got a scent gland.
*  They're terrible. If you ever want a weasel for food, you got to skin it real carefully.
*  You don't want to hit the scent gland. And then the other thing about a weasel is if you just fry
*  them up real hot, they're so small you can eat just about every bone in them. Like the legs,
*  just crunch, crunch, crunch. Really?
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. And weasels are probably carnivorous, right? So you probably have to
*  cook right through them, right? They live on voles. Oh yeah. Oh,
*  I fried them right up until they were like black. They live on little mice, right?
*  Well, voles are mouse-like rodents that live in the brook shrines. We don't have real mice.
*  So a vole's like a cousin of a mouse or something?
*  They're related.
*  So you just fry it until it's just everything's dead?
*  Yeah.
*  Hopefully.
*  That was not good. That was the weirdest stuff I ever ate.
*  What does it taste like?
*  It's not good. It depends on how good a job you do skinning them. They smell like a skunk.
*  I mean, you know, flavors mostly smell.
*  Your family eating this weasel too at the time?
*  Sylvia at the time was out there with me, yeah, she ate weasel.
*  What was the look on her face while she was eating weasel?
*  She had a good attitude about it. She was a pretty amazing woman in terms of taking to the bush.
*  She was an opera singer in Berlin before she met me.
*  What?
*  Yeah, she was.
*  Really? Wow.
*  And my partner Tricia that I've been living with the last five years, she was an attorney in Boston.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow. Why get that?
*  People are always telling me like, you're never going to find a woman to live like that out there,
*  but actually it's appealing to certain people. I think a lot of people, that's why people watch
*  on TV, people want to be free, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And people want to be alive.
*  Yeah.
*  And a lot of people don't feel it today.
*  It's true.
*  If you spend your whole life in an office or a courtroom,
*  and before that you were in school, you've never really...
*  Yeah, you just feel trapped. Yeah. And that grind, the grind of just keep showing up at
*  the office every day and cases are piling up and next thing you know she's living with Glenn
*  by the side of a lake dodging wolves.
*  I get it, man. The appeal of it is why those shows are so successful.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that show is really successful. I had Sue Aikens on the podcast before.
*  She's a really fascinating human too. Really, really enjoyed talking to her.
*  What a tough broad.
*  I'm not on the show anymore, you know.
*  Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. What happened with you and the show? Did you guys have a falling out?
*  Good question. Yeah, we had a falling out.
*  What was the falling out about?
*  They never told me exactly.
*  They just got rid of you?
*  They renewed my contract. We went out and filmed one episode and I never heard from them again.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. I mean, not about working on the show anymore.
*  Do you think they just decided you weren't a storyline that was as successful or is...
*  Oh, I think I'm very popular with the fans. Everybody that I talk to, I mean, the viewers...
*  No, you were my favorite guy.
*  I love it because people tell me that I really made a difference in their life.
*  Like they learned something, they got inspired, they actually made changes in their life.
*  And I hear this all the time, like yesterday, traveling, you know,
*  I had four different people come up and talk to me about it.
*  But I think I went about as far as I could go in this show because I was always pushing
*  to tell stories or to share things that didn't fit into the concept they had.
*  When you make a TV show, you got a concept before you find the people to put in it, right?
*  And I mean, Life Below Zero is a show about supposedly people living a subsistence lifestyle
*  in the bush. And that's part of my life, but there's a lot more to it.
*  And I'm a person who's always trying to learn and grow and do new things and expand. So
*  when they met me, I fit into their show like a hand in a glove.
*  But I wanted to do more and I wanted to share more. So I get bored. I think I'm in 85 episodes
*  of Life Below Zero. I made a lot of TV. I wasn't satisfied just to show people what it's like to
*  search for your food and chop down a tree for your firewood. I wanted to do more.
*  So I was always pushing to do stories that were a little bit out of the range or the scope of what
*  they envisioned for me to do in the show. I wanted to fly on a little eight pound paraglider off the
*  top of the mountain to get back to my camp. I've been dreaming about it for years. And I said,
*  hey, I'm going to do this. I'm going to paraglide off this mountain. I got a lot of resistance from
*  the producers about stories. You did something like that though.
*  I did it. I did it. And I was like, I want to film this. And hey, if you guys don't want to film it,
*  they didn't want to film it. I'll get somebody else from it. I am going to film this and I'm
*  going to do this because I was excited about it. They put it in the show, but I got a lot of
*  resistance. And I wanted to teach people all the time about things. And that wasn't really
*  maybe the best vehicle for it. I mean, I had a blast doing the show. I had an awesome time.
*  I learned a ton of stuff about making TV, about all kinds of things. And I made awesome friends.
*  The cameramen I worked with were some of the best people I've ever met in my life.
*  And overall had a great experience, but I was always pushing the limits of what they really
*  wanted to do, I think, because I wanted to make a story, for example, about finding a site where
*  Stone Age people had lived. That was very unpopular with the producers, but we did it. I mean,
*  why would that be unpopular? That's so interesting.
*  They said, you look like you're just walking around. You look like you're just out there
*  exploring, walking around. We want to see you finding something to eat. Go chop some,
*  can you cut some more trees for us? I was like, no, I've cut enough trees on camera. I want to
*  do something worthwhile. I wanted to teach people things. There's all kinds of stuff out there,
*  nature. I just wanted to climb the highest mountain anywhere around. I'd never been up there. I've
*  been looking at it for years and years. Those were the kind of stories that I had to really
*  twist people's arms to get on the show. The fans loved them, but the producers for some reason
*  didn't. Now, this Stone Age site, did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. Where was it? That was amazing.
*  It was like... Do you have photos of that? Not that we can get to right now. It was like...
*  We made a whole story on TV about it. It was amazing. I found the stumps. I heard about it
*  from somebody that had been there in the 1970s. He said, there's a place where you can find stumps
*  that were cut with a stone axe. I was like, that's totally amazing. Now, you got to understand,
*  the Stone Ages in Alaska was... We're talking like what, maybe... 50 years ago? Maybe 100, 150. Not
*  that long ago. Really? And everything's frozen eight months of the year, so stumps last a long time.
*  These stumps were old. They were still standing and you could touch them and you could knock
*  them over. They were right on the edge. They might not be there in 10 years. It was amazing.
*  But yeah, this gentleman I know who grew up as a little kid out there with his dad, his dad was a
*  hunting guide. They had been all over in this area. And he told me that there was this place
*  where people had camped and they had found rings of stones where they had had their skin tents and
*  they found these stumps that were cut with stone axes and whatnot. So we actually made a show. It
*  was awesome. I went with two cameramen. We walked for a couple of days just to get there from my
*  camp. Wow. And then just going by this verbal description that he had given me, I was able
*  to locate, he told me about a game trail and it was still there. The animals are still following
*  the same route. And he said, you get there, you turn this way, you're going up and the mountain's
*  going to be there and off to the side, you're going to see these stumps. And sure enough,
*  I found the stumps on camera. It was amazing. Wow. I got one of them in Fairbanks. I brought
*  down with me. That's so wild that it was just off of someone's description from the 1970s.
*  Yeah. Jack Recoff, he's an amazing man. He still lives in the Brooks Range in a small village
*  called Wiseman. And he was somebody that I learned a lot from after I got to Alaska.
*  Wiseman was on that show as well, wasn't it? Didn't they do film some stuff from that part of it?
*  Eric Salitan. That's right. Actually the only person on the show that I knew prior to the show.
*  You knew him? Eric and I had known each other for 10 years. I met him not long after he came to
*  Alaska. He's another really interesting guy. He is. Yeah. Unfortunately, Eric and I were friends
*  and I kind of replaced him on the show is what happened. But he was in Wiseman. But you guys were
*  on the show together at the same time. For a little while, there was a little overlap.
*  Yeah. First Eric was on for a year before me. Then they found me. Then we overlapped for a
*  little while and then they got rid of Eric. So they would just get rid of you if they decided
*  they were bored with your storyline. There's other people living up there like that. They just find
*  them and- Office politics, I think. Was it? And also just differences in creative vision.
*  I was not satisfied to just do the standard, I'm starving, I'm looking for firewood or whatever
*  stories over and over. I was always trying to push it. I was doing paragliding. I was doing
*  just exploring, showing people where Stone Age people lived, climbing mountains just for the
*  joy of climbing them and sit up on top and philosophize about life. Those are the kind
*  of stories I like to do. And that really wasn't the vision they had. I think that was a lot of
*  it. But honestly, they didn't talk to me about it after they stopped working with me. I still
*  haven't talked to them about it. So they just stopped?
*  Yeah. They didn't call you up and say- No, they renewed my contract.
*  Right. They had an option to renew for one more year. We shot one episode,
*  radio silence. After five months, I sent them an email and said, hey, what's up? You guys
*  planning on filming something or what's going on? And I got about two lines back from them that
*  said, sorry, the schedule's all full. We don't have any plans to film with you.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That must have been weird.
*  No kidding.
*  Seems like that's a lot of episodes to just sort of brush you off like that.
*  Were you difficult to work with?
*  The show producer told me a couple of years ago he'd fire me if he could, but he couldn't.
*  Really?
*  The show runner.
*  Why did he say that?
*  First of all, I didn't work with producers in the field. After the first year and a half,
*  I said, hey, I can produce myself in the field. I don't need to work with producers anymore.
*  And they went along with that. So I'm responsible for my own stories. As far as I'm concerned,
*  I'm the author of my own stories. It's me and a couple of camera men. And we're out there and
*  I'm making what I consider real TV. I'm sharing what I want to share. Nobody's feeding me lines.
*  Nobody's telling me what I got to do. I'm producing myself. I'm working with
*  awesome camera men and we were doing incredible things. I made whole episodes of LBZ
*  in the field with just one camera man. And then we send all the footage back to LA and they work
*  all their magic and edit it and everything and do what they want with it. But yeah,
*  I've made several episodes with just me and one camera man out there. But that's a lot of
*  freedom that's not normally given to people on reality TV, from what I'm told. And of course,
*  that caused some tensions.
*  So they wanted to control you more.
*  Why did he say that he would fire you if he could?
*  I guess he didn't like the kind of stories that I was creating out there.
*  Is that what it was? Really?
*  Because I don't remember the details of that conversation, but there was just a general
*  tension a lot. I got a lot of negative feedback about what I was giving them. And it was weird
*  because people were loving it. I mean...
*  People that you had contact with on social media.
*  Man, yeah. I didn't even have the internet when I started this show. I didn't have a cell phone
*  when I started this show. I just got all modern in the last years. But yeah, I got on Facebook and
*  I got thousands of people giving me positive feedback. And when I travel anywhere or even go
*  to Fairbanks, I was getting all this positive feedback. So it seemed to me like the viewers
*  really liked what I was doing. But I did get a lot of negative feedback from certain particular
*  people making the show, that that wasn't what they really wanted.
*  They have a formula, right? And the formula is survival.
*  Really the formula, like subsistence, survival, finding enough food to eat, chopping wood.
*  It's really appealing. It's one of the more interesting things about those kind of shows.
*  It's like, what is it that's tapping in? Or what is it tapping into? What part of your
*  ancient memory where this is really exciting to people? Because I think there's a lot of folks
*  out there, like your lawyer friend or your opera friend, that they just, there's something
*  about the idea of getting away from everything and just living a way more simple life.
*  It seems like the antidote for them. So when you watch this on television
*  and you see these people just chopping wood and living by the land and dealing with the dangers
*  of living in the bush, it's like, there's something about it. It's like, make you tune in every week.
*  Yeah. And I mean, it's beautiful stuff to share. I think it's awesome. Just for me,
*  I don't think it's the perfect vehicle to share exactly what I want to share because
*  I want to go a little deeper. I want more than a four second sound bite. And that's what I like
*  about this show, Joe. When I discovered your show, I was like, wow, there are people that just sit
*  down and have a normal conversation rather than everything being chopped up and edited into little
*  sound bites. Yeah. And you get a chance to really talk about stuff. You know, if you're sitting
*  around just having a conversation with someone for three hours, you get to really expand on your
*  ideas. And if you said something that you think maybe you didn't say it right, you get to say it
*  better. Or what I was saying was this, you get to explain yourself and expand and really get a
*  thought across. There's not a lot of places where you can do that in this world. No, no.
*  And those reality TV shows, I mean, your situation sounded like it was pretty much you producing it,
*  which would give you as much reality as they left in with editing. But a lot of reality shows,
*  you know, as well as I do, they just set things up like, hey, you're going to pretend like you lost
*  your keys in that lake. You know, like, fuck my keys. Where's my key? You see bad acting like,
*  oh my God. And I know, I know how it works. I've done those shows before. I know that there's
*  someone who's always trying to set up these scenarios. They're scripted. It's like sort of
*  non-scripted scripted. Like they have a place to go to. They have it. And you see them on these
*  shows. You can tell when people are acting. It's like a weird feeling that you get. Yeah. When you
*  know this guy has opened up this storage shed before and he's opening up now, whoa, what do
*  we got here? Like, come on, man, you're a terrible actor. This is awful. But there's something about
*  these formulas that these people have created. Reality television is a very strange animal.
*  Because it's not reality, you know, a lot of the times at least. And one of the things I think
*  that's really exciting about those shows like Life Below Zero, and your situation in particular,
*  was that there's only so much of that you can fake. I mean, just the actual,
*  undisputable reality of your existence is so fascinating. You have this tiny little fucking
*  house that you built yourself on a lake and then wolves are trying to kill you. Like that shit is
*  real. You know what I mean? I mean, and you're out there walking in the snow. You have like a rifle
*  and some snowshoes and a backpack. That's as real as is humanly possible. And anything that they
*  bullshit with there, it's like, so what? Because the scene itself is so crazy. Like just your life.
*  I always feel like, yeah, there's no need to bullshit. Why do people think they need to
*  bullshit? And it's not just reality TV, but in general. I mean, come on, it's in politics
*  and everything. Just being straightforward and honest can get you a long ways. But a lot of
*  people think for some reason that it's better to bullshit. Why do you think that is? Because in the
*  short term, it can work. For some people, it even seems to work for quite a while. I mean, come on.
*  Talking about the president?
*  Yeah. That's what I was thinking about. You can go a long ways on bullshit. But I don't know. I
*  mean, to me, how do you feel inside about yourself if you're making some false story up about yourself?
*  Yeah. Right. Yeah, there's something about it too, that when someone gets caught, like that
*  Jussie Smollett guy, when he got... Am I saying it wrong?
*  You said it like Dave did.
*  I did say it like Dave did. No, he said Jussie Smollett. Is it Jussie Smollett?
*  Jussie Smollett, yeah.
*  Smollett. Do you know who he is?
*  No.
*  Good for you. I should not even tell you. You don't need to know this nonsense.
*  No, I'm trying to get up to date.
*  It's a guy who was an actor on the show Empire. He was actually in one of the Alien movies too.
*  Which one was he in? He was in the one with... It was a good one. He was in a good one. He was
*  one of the people on the ship. Anyway, he was in one of the more recent Alien movies.
*  He was in The Mighty Ducks too, apparently.
*  Well, there you go.
*  I didn't know that.
*  He's been in a bunch of shit. Anyway, he's an actor and he made up a story, allegedly,
*  seems like he made it up, of getting beat up by these white supremacists with Trump hats on,
*  MAGA hats on. They put a noose around his neck and he walked into the hotel with a noose still
*  around his neck and told the whole story. He didn't even bother taking the noose off of his
*  neck, which is like, everybody's like, what? Wait, what? Everybody that heard the story,
*  it's such a badly concocted story. Everybody that heard the story was like, what the fuck?
*  And then the two guys that he got to rough him up, he got these two guys to rough him up,
*  and then they came out and said, no, this is bullshit. This guy paid us. And then the Chicago
*  police department is... They're prosecuting him and they're trying to get him to pay for their
*  investigation. There's lawsuits and he's still... It's the most obviously fake story ever. And it's
*  coming out of a guy who is a really successful actor. So it's so crazy. It's this racial hate,
*  this hate crime story that this guy concocted for attention. Apparently, the thought is that he
*  wasn't happy with his role on Empire or what, but it was a huge national story, because everybody
*  knew kind of right away that it was fake. Everybody's like, wait, what? He's got the
*  noose around his neck and he was holding a Subway sandwich. He went to a Subway. So he still had the
*  sandwich. Somebody smacked him in the head a couple of times and he had noose around his neck. He's
*  telling this crazy story and he wants to hold press conferences. He said he was the black Tupac or the
*  gay Tupac, he called himself. Sorry. It was just complete nonsense. And there's something about him
*  talking, telling his story where you know it's bullshit and you're like, what are you doing?
*  What is this? It's so compelling. When you see someone lie like that about some crazy,
*  wacky, made up story, it's so compelling. It's like, cause you know, when I was a little kid,
*  I would lie about shit. I'd make stuff up. Every little kid will tell you a lie. And I remember
*  thinking, this guy never stopped. He lied like when he was a little kid and he just kept lying.
*  That happens to some people.
*  It has.
*  It has.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  That's the dangerous thing about lying.
*  Oh yeah.
*  If you lie enough, I think some people actually start believing it.
*  Oh, for sure. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a psychosis involved for sure. Yeah. Some people,
*  when they lie about their past, you know, like one of the weirder ones is like when guys get
*  caught with stolen valor, like they have a crazy lie, made up story about their military history
*  and war record and-
*  That happened with somebody in reality TV that was working with
*  Cody Lundin. Wasn't there somebody working with him? Dual survivor or something like that?
*  Oh, one of his guys was a stolen valor guy.
*  I shouldn't say it. I never watched the show, but if I remember right, I heard that.
*  He's a weird one, huh? That guy just walked around barefoot with his disgusting feet.
*  I like to go barefoot.
*  Yeah, but his feet, they looked like the monster's feet.
*  He would show them, like it'd be like a thing, like a badge of courage would show these gigantic
*  cowl's feet. Like what? Because he didn't have any shoes. Because everywhere he walked,
*  he worked barefoot. So the bottom of his feet was like the top of this table.
*  Like this hard crusty fucking- look at that. Look at that guy's shoe. Look at his foot.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Look at that. But here's the thing, man.
*  Mine don't get like that, even when I go-
*  He's out there in the fucking desert constantly. Is that- that's not his foot, dude. That's a little
*  kid's foot. Really? It says Cody's flip-flops. Oh, it's like a flip-flop that he made?
*  He made it for someone, yeah.
*  Oh, okay. Yeah. There's something about walking around barefoot that seems really fucking gross.
*  I love it. In the summer, it's the first thing I want to do is get my shoes off.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah, I climb up the mountain barefoot until I get to where the rocks are, you know?
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah. I've walked like the 60 miles from the road to my camp, two-thirds of the way barefoot.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. Got a blister on my foot after about 20 miles, so I took my shoe off and I realized,
*  hey, the foot without a shoe feels a lot better than one with a shoe, so I took them both off.
*  Really?
*  Went the rest of the way. Oh yeah. I'm big into walking barefoot.
*  But you got like soft pack ground up there, right?
*  The ground's spongy. If it's damp, if it dries out, then those lichens get abrasive. Then it's
*  hard to go barefoot. They get very abrasive. But if they're damp, man, they're soft. You can
*  use them for toilet paper. Believe me, I do.
*  Do you use lichens for toilet paper?
*  I've used all different stuff for toilet paper, but lichens are one of the best.
*  If they're moist. If they're dry, they're good for fire starter. That's about it.
*  So that lake where you live, you live right off, you fish in that lake a lot?
*  There have been years I fished there. Like I said, there was one year when I never went out. I
*  stayed for 15 months and I fished a lot that summer. I caught like 75 fish or something
*  that summer, if I remember right. But I don't eat a lot of fish. I'm not a big fish eater.
*  But you eat a weasel?
*  Those are desperate times. I wouldn't eat one now.
*  Is that the lake right there?
*  Hey, there's my camp.
*  Oh, that's so pretty, man. Wow. Look where you live.
*  Well, I mean, lived. I don't live there all the time.
*  Like, this is the other thing is the situation is changing with my permits. I mean, you can't get
*  a permit to live there. And I can't even get a permit to make TV there now. I don't have a TV
*  show anymore.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Why can't you get a permit there anymore?
*  I'm not making TV. So right now I'm in the process of losing my permit for commercial use.
*  I have a trapping cabin permit, but honestly, I'm not interested in trapping. I did some trapping
*  when I first went out there, but it's not something that I'm going to do to, you know,
*  sell fur and make money. And that's what that permit's for. So I'm probably going to be giving
*  that up. So.
*  But so you're not allowed to even keep that cabin up there?
*  That cabin?
*  If that's the case?
*  I had to take it down.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. I had to take that cabin down. Right now I have a tent up there
*  because that cabin was illegal. When they gave me my permits just last year,
*  um, I had to remove the illegal cabin and then I had a permit to build a new cabin.
*  What's the difference between the new cabin and the old cabin?
*  The new cabin was going to be legal because it had a permit. They can't give you a permit
*  for an illegal cabin, but they-
*  So they can't give you a permit for a cabin that already exists.
*  They're bureaucrats, okay? They're bureaucrats.
*  Why don't you tell them, listen, come back tomorrow and take this apart and put it back
*  together again exactly the same way. So tomorrow when you come back, it'll be the new cabin.
*  Exactly.
*  This is the old cabin.
*  It was time for an upgrade. I've got four kids now, Joe. That place is 100 square feet.
*  I was kind of excited about building a new cabin, but-
*  Get a 200 square foot model, right? Something huge.
*  I was thinking 400. They said I could go up to 400.
*  Is that what they said?
*  Yeah. But-
*  How big is that? Is that the size of this room?
*  Right now, we live in a-
*  What is this?
*  This room's bigger than 400 feet?
*  Wow. So you live in something smaller than this whole room?
*  Right now, we live in a 600 square foot cabin.
*  Whoa.
*  In Fairbanks. Yeah. 600.
*  That's huge for me. We lived in a 200 square foot one until just, well, I think it was like a year
*  ago. So you live in the place where you built when you bought the piece of land?
*  Yeah, except I've expanded over the years. I started off with one acre and then as I
*  could afford it, I bought up my neighbors. I got six acres and three cabins now.
*  Oh, nice. Now, do the neighbors look at you weird because you're that guy who lives in the
*  woods on TV?
*  Not that I know about. They didn't mention it. Maybe they do.
*  Do they know?
*  Yeah, they know.
*  You tell everybody what you do?
*  No, they know.
*  They just know?
*  They watch TV a lot. I mean, Fairbanks Alaska is dark and there's nothing to do.
*  Right. Are they weirded out by you? See you on TV and see you right there?
*  I don't think so.
*  No?
*  No, I mean, I'm just a normal person.
*  Yeah, but even if you're a normal person, if you're a normal person on television,
*  you're not a normal person. People get weird.
*  But they mention it. They mention, hey, you're on TV.
*  In the beginning, I mean, I've been on TV now for six years. It's not like we talk about it
*  normally.
*  What are like the people in your town? Like Fairbanks is a real city.
*  It's about 40,000 people, I think is a small city, but it's as big of a city as you got in
*  Northern Alaska. The only place bigger is Anchorage and that's an eight hour drive away.
*  Yeah. And how many people is Anchorage? That's quite a few.
*  It's got to be, what is Anchorage? Now 300,000 maybe, 400,000 almost somewhere in there.
*  I love Anchorage.
*  Like half the people in Alaska live in Anchorage, I think.
*  Really? I've only been there once, spent a couple days there. We did some gigs, me and my friend
*  Ari Shafir and did some salmon fishing up there.
*  Comedy gigs?
*  Yeah, we did comedy up there.
*  Oh, cool.
*  Yeah, we just had on a whim. We said, hey, let's book a gig where we can fish during the day and
*  then do stand up at night. So we did that for a couple of days. It was fun.
*  But it's just the people up there were really cool, man. Like a really, there's something about
*  people that live where nature is inescapable, like nature and the wilderness. And it's like,
*  it is impossible to not be aware of where you are. Like where we live here in California
*  is so alien and so non-intuitive. It's just not how human beings have evolved.
*  And it's a really recent thing that any human beings ever live like this.
*  But there's something in your DNA that sort of cries out to the times that make sense,
*  to the places that make sense. And that's one of the appeals of your show. That's one of the appeals
*  of living very close to the wilderness, living very close to the woods, because these tasks
*  that you have to do, just acquiring food and water and staying warm and dealing with nature,
*  all those things are enormously appealing to people that are stuck in a situation like I am.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I don't say I'm stuck, like I'm in some terrible place, but it's great.
*  I probably get a little better than most of us. But the thing is,
*  we're separated more and more from our origins, and it definitely has an effect. We gave up a lot
*  for comfort. We gave up a lot. We gave up a lot of our vitality. I love to jump in the lake and swim
*  every day from the time I can get in the moat next to the ice, and that water is like 32.5 degrees.
*  And it's so invigorating.
*  Yeah, it's great for you.
*  It's amazing.
*  Ice baths. It's the reason why athletes do them.
*  Yeah. And just little things, like if you don't have a toilet, which I still don't have a toilet,
*  even in Fairbanks. I mean, if you squat...
*  You don't have a toilet in Fairbanks?
*  No.
*  Why don't you build a toilet, bro?
*  A toilet's a big thing, man. I don't know if I can afford a toilet. You gotta have a septic system.
*  You gotta have plumbing. I don't have any of that stuff.
*  But you're buying all this land. You're buying all this land. You can't buy a toilet?
*  You can't buy a toilet? Land's cheap, toilets are expensive.
*  You gotta have the right kind of land to have a septic system.
*  Yeah.
*  The land that I buy is boggy. It's spruce forest. It's complicated. Then you leave town. I like to
*  be able to go to the bush for six months in the middle of winter. Your pipes freeze. You gotta
*  have a house sitter then. You gotta have a furnace run 21st day. All it's got is a wood stove.
*  It gets complicated, man. I like to keep it simple.
*  Wow. Really simple.
*  I mean, maybe I always tell people, they say, why don't you have a toilet? I was like,
*  I can't afford a toilet. They're like, come on, you can afford a toilet. You got an airplane.
*  You got this. You got that. I was like, maybe if I had, I don't know, 5 million, 10 million,
*  I might think about getting a place with a toilet. I don't have that much.
*  That's so crazy. That's your number. If I had 5 million bucks, I'd get a toilet.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe. 5 million. I have to think about it.
*  Wow.
*  Because it's a huge change. First of all, I couldn't live on that land where I live, really.
*  I mean, I could, but it'd be way too complicated. And you get, like I said, I don't want
*  worry about house sitters, freezing pipes, oil furnace.
*  So what do you have? Outhouses?
*  You have outhouses?
*  My favorite way to go, I don't like outhouses. I like to squat and just poop on the ground.
*  And I'll tell you something.
*  If you want to poop inside, five gallon bucket with plastic bag in it.
*  You poop in your house?
*  In a bucket?
*  Yeah. This times.
*  Oh, Jesus. But you're in this tiny little house.
*  Look.
*  You're in a 600 square foot house.
*  Oh, that's big. The little one, 100 square feet. No, I don't use the poop in there.
*  But usually...
*  Sometimes you got to when it's like 30 plus zero.
*  I go outside. When I'm in a 100 square foot, always. Look, people, I think the UN's working
*  against open defecation. I think that's what they call it. They spend millions of dollars a year
*  trying to get people to stop pooping on the ground. In the Brooks Range.
*  In cities.
*  Um, all over the world. India, Bangladesh, I don't know.
*  Yeah, but that's because there's people living next to this raw sewage.
*  Too many people. That's the only problem. Population density. If you have enough land,
*  it's not an issue. In the Brooks Range, I've been pooping in the same spot for the last 20 years.
*  Probably about a quarter the size of this room and you can't even tell I've ever pooped there.
*  Really?
*  It goes back to nature. I don't even compost. I don't even do anything. I just poop on the
*  ground in the same area and it just goes back into nature. The only thing-
*  Are you trying to make a little mound?
*  No, it doesn't build up.
*  Just animals or something. We're rats, right? Rats eat a lot of shit.
*  Grey Jays. Grey Jays eat it.
*  Grey Jays? What's a Grey J?
*  Wolves. I've had wolves come eat my shit when they're old.
*  Oh boy.
*  First wolf I ever trapped, set the trap right in front of my poop pile.
*  Oh God. He came in for your shit and got killed.
*  Yeah. He'd eaten shit before there and I figured it out.
*  God, let me lure him in with this tasty treat.
*  No, but it really does. That's the thing is people are separated from nature now
*  and so something simple, like a simple solution to a problem, pooping on the ground.
*  If you're in a rural area, if you've got space, there is no problem with that really.
*  It goes back into the earth. Where do you think the bears, the moose,
*  the caribou, they all go underground. It's not a big problem. It goes back into the earth.
*  Well, you're living in a largely uninhabited place.
*  Yeah. That's in a largely uninhabited place. Yeah.
*  So when you dropped a log next to the trap for the wolf, you knew what you were doing?
*  You were doing that on purpose to lure him in?
*  Well, I always poop in the same place, the same general place, but
*  a wolf had come and eaten the poop.
*  You'd noticed?
*  Yeah. I see the tracks. I go up to poop. Oh, a wolf came here last night
*  and ate my last poop.
*  How'd you feel about that? Just normal?
*  You feel different when you live out in the woods, Joe. You get a whole different mentality,
*  different ethics. You don't think about, that's no big deal. There's poop, there's blood,
*  there's guts, there's poop, there's wolves and caribou with their legs ripped open. It's different.
*  So were you trapping and selling the skins?
*  I usually was trapping for my own family use. Like the kids had mucklucks and mittens and
*  ruffs and all this stuff. Trapping out of wolf, out of wolverine, out of martins,
*  those are the main things up there, wolves, wolverines. There's some martin, there's a few
*  fox around.
*  You ever eaten a martin?
*  Yeah. I've eaten just about everything.
*  What's a martin taste like? Like a weasel?
*  More like a wolf.
*  They're better. To tell you the truth, to me, a martin's just about as good as a snowshoe
*  hare, but I don't really like snowshoe hares. Like I said, I like to stick to ungulates.
*  Why don't you like snowshoe hares?
*  I don't think they're very good compared to a caribou or compared to a moose.
*  Just taste-wise?
*  Taste-wise, they're small, tedious. I'm just not, I'm not big on small game.
*  Tedious in terms of like removing the bones.
*  The amount of effort, the time, to go catch them, to skin them. Some people really get into it,
*  but for me, okay, I have caribou usually most years in that area. I have moose always in the fall.
*  I go out hunting maybe five, six days. I got a moose, I got 500 pounds of meat.
*  There's not very many snowshoe hares around where I am. There's not that much brush.
*  I'm up high in the mountains.
*  So how many bullets are you bringing with you when you go out there for long periods of time?
*  Oh, I'll have a few packs of ammunition. It's a funny story though, because when
*  Trisha came to meet me the first time, you know, we had a long distance meeting. We met over
*  Facebook, over the internet after I got on the show.
*  Paula.
*  So-
*  Did she slide into your DMs or did you slide into hers?
*  DMs?
*  You don't know about that?
*  No, I don't.
*  Okay.
*  Keep you in the dark.
*  Keep you in the dark.
*  I'm trying to get up to speed. Like I said, I didn't have the-
*  Direct messages.
*  Oh, direct messages. Right. I have heard about that. What happened? She sent me a friend request and
*  I was looking for a woman. That's why I went on Facebook actually in the beginning.
*  Really?
*  That was one of my motives for doing the show. I remember when the producer came up there and
*  met me, I was like, hey, you think this will help me find a new woman? I'm looking for a woman.
*  I mean, I just spent the whole winter by myself.
*  Right. I get it.
*  I'm only human.
*  I get it.
*  Trying to find a woman out in the woods.
*  It isn't easy. I mean, every day I get up, you know, fix up my hair and stuff,
*  go out and didn't see any.
*  I mean, you think it's hard hunting moose and caribou up there. Try hunting for a woman up there.
*  Yeah, I would imagine.
*  Few and far between. So I had to-
*  Slim pickings.
*  I had to get modern.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  Anyway, Trisha came for our first date. We had one date, a four-day date before she decided to
*  move up and live with me.
*  Jesus Christ, that woman's crazy. You got a good one.
*  And she told me she wasn't adventurous.
*  She wasn't adventurous.
*  That's what she said.
*  She hangs out with you for four days, then moves in with you.
*  She quit her job?
*  We spent, oh yeah, she left her, you know, gave up her apartment, sold most of her stuff.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  But we talked every day, you know, for what, three months before the date.
*  Wow.
*  We were communicating every day a little bit.
*  Was this while you were at the shack?
*  No, I was down in Fairbanks.
*  At that time, I didn't even have internet up at the shack. I did get internet in 2017, eventually.
*  At the shack?
*  Yeah.
*  How the hell did you do that?
*  I had to actually get certified as a satellite internet installer.
*  Yeah.
*  So you had to take a class?
*  Oh yeah, yeah. I'm a certified satellite internet installer. Maybe that'll be my next career.
*  I can, you know-
*  Wow.
*  If I can't get another gig in TV, maybe I'll take up installing satellite internet.
*  So you got certified, and what are you using to power it? Solar?
*  No, battery and a generator. I run a generator once in a while, and it doesn't take much electricity.
*  I got a big battery.
*  And then you link up with the satellite.
*  It's real slow. I can never post video or anything, but it was cool because then I could
*  start doing Facebook posts and, you know, other social media. I could put pictures from right
*  there right then rather than when next time I came to town.
*  Oh wow. So your upload is extremely slow, right?
*  Yeah, it's really slow. I don't think I'm even going to maintain that system, but
*  I don't even know if I'm going to maintain my camp, to tell you the truth, but I'm going to
*  keep going to the wilderness. I'm going to keep having experiences out there, and I'm going to
*  keep finding ways to share it with people, but I don't know exactly the future of that particular
*  spot and that particular satellite internet system.
*  Have you had anybody visit you up there?
*  You mean just random?
*  Yeah, just people that knew about you from the show?
*  No. They always say they're going to come or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Good luck.
*  I mean, if anybody's straggled in, I'd help them out, but no, it's a big project. People get,
*  and maybe, who knows how close they've gotten before they turned around, you know? Maybe
*  somebody drove all the way up the hall road and chickened out after the first day walk,
*  and I got no idea.
*  Yeah, I guarantee you some people have thought about it.
*  But how many bullets do I carry? How much am I missing?
*  How many bullets?
*  So Tricia comes up for a four-day date after we'd communicated for three months.
*  Tell her to bring some bullets?
*  She was, she had tons of ammo in her apartment down in Boston.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah.
*  She's a wild lady.
*  She had guns and ammo and everything, but she came up to visit, and after a day or so together,
*  I decided that I want to take her out to the camp. I said, hey, got any plans for tomorrow?
*  Want to go to the Brooks Range? So I wanted to fly her up there so she could see the place
*  to know what she was getting into, right? And we were packing, and I like, I think I threw in
*  like 10 rounds of ammo. We're just going to go for the day. She had to be back at work, you know?
*  She just came for a long weekend, and she was like, what? That's all you're taking? 10 rounds?
*  I'm like, well, we're not even going hunting. This is just like in case,
*  in case a bear happens to attack us. I mean, 10 rounds, that's a lot.
*  Like I go months without shooting 10 rounds of ammunition.
*  She convinced me to take a full box, I think. I don't carry a lot of ammunition.
*  I think I started carrying a little more than I used to. I think usually when I go moose hunting,
*  I'll throw in a box. I'll have 20 rounds of me, but I never use, I mean, I've never used
*  anywhere near that much.
*  It would seem to me that you would need, do you have a tool or anything to sight in your rifle,
*  just in case something goes wrong with the sight?
*  Talking about a target? Yeah, I got a target.
*  Okay, you have a target.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's tools where you don't have to fire off around.
*  Oh, no, I don't. Like a bore sighting.
*  Yeah, it's like a bore sighting. It's like a laser. And it has it set up. Literally,
*  you can have your rifle zeroed in at 100 in two shots.
*  I usually get it zeroed in three or six or something, but it never goes far out.
*  200 yards. I have my target at 200 yards. Right in front of my camp,
*  I shoot across the lake there when it's dead calm.
*  And I hardly ever have to adjust that scope. I mean, I'm so happy with that gun. That's the
*  only rifle I have ever killed a large animal with in my life.
*  Wow. What's the caliber?
*  30 out of six. I bought that gun for $550 in 2003, and I never needed another center fire rifle.
*  That's a classic rifle. 30 out of six?
*  Ruger.
*  There it is.
*  M77. What is it called? M77 Marked.
*  And what kind of sight are you using on that?
*  It's got a two to seven power scope. The difference is that's an older picture.
*  There was nobody up there with me. I actually took that picture myself, but
*  that was before I got my suppressor.
*  Oh, you got a suppressor.
*  Oh, I'm all about suppressors.
*  Yeah. I wish they were legal in California.
*  They're not.
*  No, they're not. I mean, I think they're worried that people would be sniping people or something.
*  It's kind of stupid. It's ignorant because for hunting purposes, one of the biggest problems,
*  like I have a friend of mine, my friend Cody, his ear's blown out because he was working as a guide
*  and someone fired off a shot right near his ear. Now he has to wear hearing aids.
*  So it takes one shot. If you're close to the muzzle, that's why I got a suppressor.
*  I really think this is a very important thing. So many people are damaging their
*  hearing without even realizing it.
*  Yep. 100%. A lot of guys did it when they're young. A lot of my friends,
*  they go with a suppressor.
*  That's actually a different gun, but that one I've never killed anything with, but
*  that is the suppressor. The problem is when you're hunting, it's not practical to use
*  ear protection. And if you hunt regularly, that adds up over time. It adds up. You shoot a rifle,
*  that's 160 decibels. Why are they making a law that you have to damage your hearing to go hunting?
*  Right. Why are they making a law where you have to cover your ears with something?
*  The reason being is because they're worried about urban situations. They're worried about
*  people shooting at people and you're not hearing anything.
*  You do hear something though.
*  Yeah, you hear a pshh.
*  Oh no, you hear a lot more than that. Have you ever shot a suppressor rifle?
*  Yeah, it's like a crack.
*  Well, it depends on what you're shooting, but assuming it's hypersonic, supersonic,
*  it's still loud. A .36 without a suppressor is about 160 decibels. That's deafening. You put
*  a suppressor on it, it's like 130. It knocks it down about 30 decibels more or less. It's still
*  very loud.
*  Are there different levels of suppressor?
*  I bought the best suppressor I could get. If you want to make a gun shoot like in the movies,
*  silent like a little pop, you have to shoot subsonic. That's not practical for hunting.
*  Oh.
*  Now I'm questioning whether or not I've actually used a suppressor.
*  I feel like I did at one point in time, someone somewhere let me shoot their rifle at how to
*  suppress around, but it might be a false memory now.
*  You can put subsonic ammo in there.
*  Yeah, I've shot subsonic .22s.
*  30, I would say. You can load it subsonic. You can buy .308 ammunition subsonic and it's very
*  quiet, but it's going so slow that it's not effective to hunt moose or caribou with.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  But yeah, they're still loud.
*  Pretty loud. I have a muzzle brake on my 7mm.
*  That's really loud.
*  It's a cannon.
*  Yeah.
*  But I actually met a person once who was just about deaf. He was like stone deaf from one
*  shotgun blast. He was in a canoe and somebody shot kind of in a position where the muzzle was
*  right next to his ear.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's how it always is. It's always someone shooting near you,
*  just blows your eardrums out. It's terrible. Yeah, but so in California, you cannot have suppressors.
*  But again, I think that's what they're worried about. And I think it's just,
*  there's a lot of ignorance. It's a lot of people that just don't know enough about
*  firearms that are making the regulations. But I think that would be the worry that
*  would people be shooting and you wouldn't be able to hear it.
*  Well, I think that there might be other ways to deal with that.
*  For hunting, I think it's super reasonable to be able to have something where you don't have to
*  have ear protection on all the time and you can make it look just less disturbing for all the
*  people also that are in the mountains. If you're on public land and you're hunting deer
*  and you hear a boom, like over the side of the hill, it's kind of gross.
*  Even in countries that have more regulations on firearms, there are places where you can
*  use suppressors from what I've heard. I mean, I haven't researched extensively, but I think in
*  Britain, even people have suppressors and in New Zealand, Australia, different places.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I do 99.9% of my hunting with a bow and arrow.
*  That's awesome.
*  But I'm not doing it because I need... It's not like a subsistence thing. I don't need it,
*  absolutely. I love archery. I love hunting archery too, because you have to get close.
*  That's where it's at.
*  That's what I love doing is getting close. Some guys will brag about,
*  oh, I shot this moose 600 yards away. I always like to get close.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just more interesting, isn't it? Because you learn more about the animal.
*  It's more intense too. It requires more skill. I feel like... This sounds fucked up, but I feel
*  like the animal has more of a chance. If I'm inside 60 yards shooting at an animal, that animal has
*  way more chance to get the fuck away from me, way more chance for me to blow it, to step on a twig,
*  or it to catch my wind. It makes it more difficult.
*  And it's just archery is... There's nothing... Rifles for sure are the best way to gather meat,
*  for sure. No doubt about it. Boom, one shot, they're down. You hit them in the bread basket,
*  boom, it's over. But archery requires way more discipline, and there's so many ways it can fuck
*  up. There's so many ways it can go wrong. But there's that requirement that you have of yourself
*  to practice and to be able to execute when the time is now. It's hard. It's very, very difficult
*  to do. And because of that, it's like that... From my brain, I find that very appealing. I gravitate
*  towards difficult things like that. But it's also very... People say it's not as humane. Listen,
*  man, people wound deer and elk and moose all the time with a rifle. If you make a bad shot,
*  and people make a bad... And I've made bad shots, people make bad shots. It's bad no matter what.
*  But with a bow and arrow, you'd be amazed how lethal it is.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, I'm not surprised because you get that big broad cutting edge going right through
*  their lungs. I mean...
*  Pete Slauson They hemorrhage quick. They die quick. I mean, I shot an elk at Tohono Ranch last year,
*  and it was down in four yards. It stepped one, two, three, four, boom, dead. Just shot it in the heart.
*  Pete Slauson And I've shot moose through both lungs and had them go 50 yards sometimes.
*  Pete Slauson They're so tough.
*  Pete Slauson Incredibly tough.
*  Pete Slauson They're so tough. Moose is such an enormous animal too. When you see one down,
*  and you look at the bones on that thing, you're like, good lord. What an enormous animal.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Just out there eating twigs and trying to stay the fuck away from wolves.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson What a crazy existence they have.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson But there's an amazing amount of respect and appreciation you have for them too
*  when they're down. When you're looking at them like, this is my food. I'm going to eat this.
*  There's going to be a lot of food. I feed my dog with elk. My dog mostly eats it.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, really?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. Most of it eats.
*  Pete Slauson You're allowed to do that?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson That's legal?
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Pete Slauson Why wouldn't that be legal?
*  Pete Slauson In Alaska, you can't feed game meat to dogs.
*  Pete Slauson Why?
*  Pete Slauson Because they're trying to allot the game to the people who want to eat it.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, okay.
*  Pete Slauson There's so many dogs up there, you know, dog teams.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson You used to be able to at one time in history, but you can feed the guts or something,
*  but you can't feed meat to the dogs.
*  Pete Slauson But you can feed salmon to them.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson People catch gigantic amounts of salmon just to feed their dogs.
*  Pete Slauson Because they're more fish than there are caribou and moose.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, I see. Well, the way I look at it, it's like, he's a member of my family.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I mean, my dog is like, he's my buddy.
*  Pete Slauson You're not feeding a whole dog team.
*  Pete Slauson Well, yeah. And also, I guess that's what it is, right? In Alaska, they have giant sled teams.
*  Pete Slauson There are a lot of dogs, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. That's interesting, though, that it's illegal. It seems like you should be
*  able to do whatever you want. You could feed your dog steak if you wanted to. You can go to the
*  grocery store and buy your dog hamburger if you really wanted to. Why couldn't you feed them game
*  meat? If you got a tag, you know, you should be able to, as long as the food gets utilized.
*  Pete Slauson There are all sorts of rules and regulations.
*  Pete Slauson They discriminate against dogs. That's what it is.
*  Pete Slauson They discriminate against all sorts of people. Anybody that's not there making the rule.
*  Pete Slauson I guess there weren't a lot of dog owners around that day. But no,
*  I mean, think about it. Every rule we make, it's just a game now. The technology exists.
*  If you wanted to use a guided missile, you'd kill every animal, right?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson So, you gotta have limits on the technology. For you,
*  you personally prefer to use a bow and arrow. For me, I use a rifle.
*  Pete Slauson I would definitely use a rifle if I was in your situation.
*  Pete Slauson Right. Some guys want to go hunt with a helicopter, right? And they've made that
*  illegal in Alaska because there aren't that many people that could afford to go hunt with a
*  helicopter. That's the way I look at it. There's not that many people that could afford to go
*  hunt with a helicopter. Therefore, they didn't have much power in making the regulations.
*  Pete Slauson When you say hunt with a helicopter,
*  you mean hunt out of a helicopter?
*  Pete Slauson No, you can't even use a helicopter to transport
*  hunters, game meat, hunting equipment, anything.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson So, the idea is to make it more difficult for them to get to some place like
*  the Chugash or something like that. Some place that's difficult to get to the mountains.
*  Pete Slauson The idea is the people that
*  don't want to use helicopters.
*  Pete Slauson Are the ones who get to vote.
*  Pete Slauson Don't want people to use helicopters. I understand. I mean,
*  I'm not saying I want people to be able to use helicopters. I'm just saying,
*  maybe if a lot of people wanted to use helicopters to hunt, you know, because they,
*  you've got a certain number of animals that can be taken and maintain the population.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson So, the technology to take them, it doesn't matter in terms of, the animals don't
*  care. They don't care if they're getting shot with a machine gun. They don't care if they're
*  getting hunted out of a helicopter. You got a herd of so many thousand caribou, you want to take a
*  certain number out every year, it's going to maintain the population. But now, it's all got
*  to be regulated. So, it's like, some people want to hunt on foot. Maybe they would prefer that you
*  couldn't use an airplane because the people that are flying with airplanes are then going to be
*  competing against this person on foot, right? Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson But the way it all balances out,
*  a lot of people like to use fixed wing airplanes. They're relatively economical, so you can use that.
*  You cannot use a helicopter in Alaska to transport hunters, meat, or hunting equipment.
*  Pete Slauson What about scouting? Can you use one to scout?
*  Pete Slauson A helicopter? I don't believe so.
*  Pete Slauson That would be a problem if you were on the ground, if someone's
*  flying above you in a helicopter spooking things. I've heard people say that that's happened to them
*  before. Pete Slauson
*  The regulations are getting so thick, I don't even keep up on every detail that doesn't apply to me.
*  I believe that now there's some regulations, you can't even scout out of a fixed wing
*  airplane, at least in certain situations. Pete Slauson
*  I know there's places like that in the United States, or in the lower 48 rather.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. Because a lot of people were doing that for
*  sheep. I would see that even in such a remote area where I am, there's a lot of guided sheep hunting.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson And you'd see these little super cubs flying around the mountains looking for the sheep.
*  Pete Slauson That's the ultimate rich guy trip.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I hear sheep hunting in Alaska. It's very, very expensive, and they go deep into it.
*  It's like their ultimate adventure. They have the Wild Sheep Hunting Federation, and all these guys,
*  you know, they spend shit tons of money to go to these really remote areas, get someone to take
*  them in to get a big sheep, get a big ram. Pete Slauson
*  And some people don't like that, but on the other hand, aren't those people that are spending
*  $20,000 to go get a sheep or whatever, they're tapping into the same basic desire that I have,
*  or that anybody that goes hunting has. I mean, they want that experience of getting out there
*  into the wild, hunting, doing something primal. Pete Slauson
*  I think people have an issue with anything that's really expensive that only a few people get to do,
*  as soon as you hear about that. And it's also, it's like, it becomes, it's a, sheep hunters are
*  like, it's an interesting breed of people, you know, they're really into sheep hunting.
*  And apparently, it's, a lot of the factors, like the danger, you know, you're hiking on shale and
*  like extremely, very, very, like steep heights and real big drop offs and very steep cliffs.
*  And it's like, I've never done it, but the people that say they're like, it's the ultimate.
*  Pete Slauson Oh yeah, it's exciting.
*  Pete Slauson Really exciting. They live in these really remote places,
*  it's hard to get to. And once you're successful, it's like, it's so difficult to do that once
*  you're successful, it's a huge, huge relief. It feels very exciting and happy and the food's
*  delicious. I've had sheep, I've had wild sheep before. My friend Remy gave me some, some back
*  straps. Yeah, I love sheep. Yeah. What other animals are you, were you hunting when you were
*  up there? Anything unusual? For big animals, the only, the only thing around is moose.
*  Pete Slauson You said you shot one, one grizzly?
*  Pete Slauson Grizzly. I shot one grizzly that was becoming a problem that night. I had a moose in
*  the camp. My wife and the little baby were there at the time too and my daughter was only three
*  years old. And my son was just months old and this moose was hanging there. I just killed it a week
*  or so before and a grizzly was coming around that night trying to get that moose meat. And I chased
*  it away a few times and it kept coming back. Eventually, I shot right over the bear trying
*  to scare it off because sometimes that'll work if just chasing them off doesn't work. But it still,
*  it was walking toward me at 16 yards when I shot it.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, God. 16 yards? They could run 16 yards so fast?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, he was just walking.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, thank God he wasn't running.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, he wasn't trying to get me but he was,
*  I just couldn't have that bear hanging out there trying to get that moose that I had there in the
*  camp. Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. So, you shot him and ate him? Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. Pete Slauson
*  What was that like? Pete Slauson
*  Oh, the fat was unbelievably good, man. The meat, for me, bear meat, like I said,
*  is not my first choice. I liked it but I'd only have a desire to eat it once every
*  four or five days. It's not like something I wanted to eat pounds of every day the way
*  I can eat caribou or moose. It's just different. The fat was unbelievable. It stunk terrible.
*  I took all the fat out of the abdominal fat and all that stuff too. And boy, did it smell bad,
*  just like bear guts. It just stunk. And I remember Sylvia saying, you're going to eat that stuff and
*  I was like, I don't know, try it. So, I rendered it and just heated it up until it liquefied.
*  And when that cooled back down, no bad flavor at all. It was almost tasteless. It was the mildest
*  fat you've ever had. Pete Slauson
*  Really? Pete Slauson
*  Yeah, that cured the bad smell. And I don't know why.
*  I don't know why. Pete Slauson
*  Get past that though. How many people?
*  How many people? Not a lot. And it's different. Bear fat's real soft. It's real soft at room
*  temperature. It's not like, sheep fat's hard. Moose fat, caribou fat is slightly softer maybe
*  than sheep fat but it's still hard fat. Bear fat is soft and creamy. So, it was nice variety
*  that winter to have all that bear fat. It was really nice variety. But I learned something from
*  that, just a practical thing that for some reason, I don't understand the chemistry behind it.
*  If you got some fat that tasted funny, if you heat it up really hot and cool it back down,
*  it'll take that away. I had it happen with moose fat once. It was getting old, so it was getting
*  a little rancid and I tried it. I heated it up until it got just about to the smoking point,
*  cooled it back down and it tasted way better. Pete Slauson
*  Really? Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. Pete Slauson
*  What do you think is doing that? Pete Slauson
*  I don't know. I never looked into it. Pete Slauson
*  Hmm. I think that would be something you'd want to look into.
*  Not really. Just a little practical boy scout trick.
*  Pete Slauson Once you know, you know. That's it. You don't
*  need to know the magic behind it. So, you take, what did you do with the bear hide?
*  Pete Slauson Turned it into a blanket. Still have that hide.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Pete Slauson It's a beautiful bear. It really was.
*  Pete Slauson How big was it?
*  Pete Slauson I think it was just over six feet. It wasn't
*  huge because the bears up there don't get as big. I mean, they don't have salmon up where I am,
*  way up in the mountains. But it was a real light color bear. There's a picture of that one you
*  might pull up. Yeah, that's it. There's another picture with right after I shot it on the beach
*  there. But in the photos right on the first page there, whatever they're called, those ones that
*  you can keep. Pete Slauson
*  Is this Facebook? Oh, you're just...
*  Pete Slauson I don't know because the Facebook page,
*  I can't zoom in for some reason. Pete Slauson
*  So, that bear was super light colored. All its claws are white. They're almost white.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  This is beautiful hide. It's really...
*  Pete Slauson And you keep the claws on the hide when you make the blanket?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it was the only bear I ever dealt with. I skinned it all out like taxidermy.
*  I left all the claws and the lips and the eyelids and everything. It took a long time and then I
*  tanned it myself. It was a big project. I built a big stretcher and had it all.
*  Pete Slauson Now, what do you use to tan it?
*  Pete Slauson I use the same thing I use on wolf or wolverine,
*  which is like a diluted battery acid basically. Pete Slauson
*  Really? Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. What's the old way that you used to do it? You used to use brains, right?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, you can tan with brains I hear, but I never got into that. Somebody showed me
*  this battery acid tanning system way back when I first went up there and started trapping and
*  it worked really well for me. So, I stuck to that.
*  Pete Slauson How does that work?
*  Pete Slauson It's been a long time since I did it, but you just dilute... The battery acid is very
*  diluted and I forgot the exact proportions because it's been a while, but it's very,
*  very diluted and then you add a lot of salt also. And you want to get the proportions right,
*  so you want to look into it before you try it, but that's all that's in it. The solution is just
*  battery acid, water and salt. Pete Slauson
*  And so, you brought battery acid up there just to have on hand?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's so concentrated. It's like a little package. I flew it out there,
*  like one time is enough for five years or something.
*  Pete Slauson And you flew it out there just for tanning?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, wow.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. And that system, then the other thing you need is baking soda. You have
*  to neutralize it. You have to get the pH back to neutral after you're done tanning it.
*  Pete Slauson Here it is. Seven gallons of water,
*  two pounds of bran. Pete Slauson
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute. That's not the one I used.
*  Pete Slauson 16 cups of plain or pickling salt.
*  Pete Slauson Salt's good.
*  Pete Slauson Okay, but there's the battery acid. Three and a half cups battery acid from Auto Part
*  Store. Two boxes baking soda.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's pretty much it except you can skip the bran flakes.
*  Pete Slauson What about foot oil? What the fuck is foot oil?
*  Pete Slauson Neats foot oil? You ever use that stuff? Oh, yeah. Well,
*  you got to soften the hide afterwards. You got to put the oil back into it.
*  Pete Slauson Is that what foot oil is?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, Neats foot oil.
*  Pete Slauson For people's feet?
*  Pete Slauson Nah, what do they make that from? Sheep feet or something?
*  Pete Slauson Oh, really?
*  Pete Slauson I can't remember. No, I don't know. They call it Neats foot oil, but it's just an
*  oil that you use to preserve leather. You put it on your baseball glove.
*  Neats foot is supposed to be one word, at least when I just Googled it.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, Neats foot?
*  Pete Slauson Yellow oil rendered from purified shin bones and feet of cattle.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, wow. How weird.
*  Pete Slauson So, go ahead. What were you going to say?
*  Jared Suellentrop I was just going to say, we're talking an awful lot about traffic, hunting,
*  stuff like that, but there's so much more out there.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
*  Jared Suellentrop It's like the whole – that was my problem in reality TV. When they hear that
*  you've been attacked by wolves, that's all they want to hear about.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure.
*  Jared Suellentrop But there's so much more. It's a whole different experience. Consciousness,
*  you get into a whole different space. Space is different. I mean, look at how confined we are
*  now. What you think about as space down here. I mean, you're riding an airplane now, you just
*  got a few feet around you. And out there, you've got space as far as you can see. You stand on the
*  top of a mountain, you look hard enough, you can see the back of your head just about. I mean,
*  there's a lot – those mountains stretch for 600 miles and it changes your perception because not
*  only is there all that space, but it's not all chopped up into little pieces. You can basically
*  walk anywhere you want, you can go anywhere your legs will carry you. You feel very free.
*  Pete Slauson Did you ever run into another person while you were out there?
*  Jared Suellentrop One time when I was walking from the road to my camp, I met another person.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Jared Suellentrop Headed the opposite direction. We were both traveling along a creek, of course.
*  You follow natural routes, walking the gravel bars.
*  Pete Slauson How weird was that?
*  Jared Suellentrop It was very weird. And this is the thing, when you live
*  without many people around and you spend periods of time totally in isolation,
*  you really appreciate humans. That's one of the great benefits of it. You appreciate anything you
*  go without. You go without food, you go without sex, you go without people. And me and this guy,
*  we sat down, we talked for like a couple hours.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Jared Suellentrop We just sat down.
*  Pete Slauson What was he doing?
*  Jared Suellentrop He was just going for a hike. He had hired a plane to fly him to a place that was
*  a long ways away. Like he was walking, I think, 100 miles back to that road that I had left.
*  And we just happened to be following the same creek, just walking down the gravel bars and
*  we met up, middle of nowhere. So, we sat down and we talked and talked and then we went our
*  separate ways.
*  Pete Slauson Wow. Did you exchange numbers or anything?
*  Jared Suellentrop No, I think I still remember his name though, but this was years and years
*  and years ago. Long time ago.
*  Pete Slauson That must have been really weird.
*  Jared Suellentrop It was.
*  Pete Slauson All those different times you're out there by yourself and all of a sudden you see a guy.
*  Jared Suellentrop Yeah. Yeah, that was really, that's the only time I'd met somebody at random
*  on the ground ever. And I've had one time when some hunters flew there and landed and they were
*  thinking of hunting there, but after they talked to me for a while, I convinced them to go somewhere
*  else. But I mean, there's plenty of space. There's no reason for two people to be hunting the same
*  area.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, especially out there.
*  Jared Suellentrop But yeah, I mean, I almost never meet anybody. So, it's different. You really
*  appreciate people and that's something that I've always noticed when I was out there a long time.
*  If you see anybody, if it's a state trooper that stops in and you haven't seen anybody for three
*  months, I mean, it's great. You invite them in, you talk to people, you don't just, it's not like
*  when you got a lot of people around, you can't communicate with everybody, you have to ignore
*  people.
*  Pete Slauson I know you liked a lot of aspects of living up there, but what's like, is there one
*  thing that really stands out?
*  Jared Suellentrop One thing would definitely be the autonomy, the independence. I think it's just a
*  natural need that humans have. You watch a little baby when they learn to crawl, they start
*  separating from their mother a little bit, then they start to learn to stand up, but they're still
*  holding on to the wall. Then they start taking their first steps and it's like, wow, I can stand
*  on my own feet. They get all excited and start running along before very long. I think we just
*  need that feeling of independence, some people more than others, but it's the same basic thing
*  for me. It's just like to be out there totally independent on my own, nobody else is going to
*  help me if I have a problem. If I'm up on a mountain and I don't have a satellite phone with me,
*  I've got to be able to walk back to my camp. I have to be able to. There's literally no choice.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Jared Suellentrop And just to have that degree of responsibility
*  that in modern society you don't have. You can't have that degree of responsibility in modern
*  society for yourself. You can't have that level of independence standing on your own.
*  Is it hard for you to come to a place like LA? Is it weird? What's the feeling when you're driving
*  on the 405 from the airport headed over to the studio? You have to be like, why the fuck would
*  anybody live here? No, no. I find it fascinating. It's interesting because it's a different
*  environment. I'm very curious about the way people live everywhere, but I do find myself
*  realizing why I don't live in a big city. I find it very, really nice. It's interesting to me.
*  I have a shower. It's like, whoa, this is cool. The water comes out hot. I don't like toilets.
*  Pete Slauson We have two toilets here. Did you use one yet?
*  Jared Suellentrop Yeah, I used one in the hotel, but they built them too high. I'm used to squatting.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, squatting. You can get a squatty potty.
*  You know what that is?
*  Jared Suellentrop No, they make them?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's like a thing that they put underneath the toilet. You put your feet on.
*  Jared Suellentrop Oh, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson So, it sort of puts your butt in the right position.
*  Jared Suellentrop I'll ask the front desk if they get one tonight.
*  Pete Slauson I don't think they will say yes, but that's what you're supposed to have, right?
*  You're supposed to be in a position where you're squatting. That's the natural position for humans
*  to shit. Jared Suellentrop It works for me. That's another thing I like about it out there. Okay,
*  there's the autonomy. The independence is very important. And I think a lot of people are missing
*  that and that's why they're attracted to learn something about that life. But also just, like I
*  said, when you do these basic things, it could be taking a crap, it could be taking a shower,
*  whatever, in a different way out in nature. I mean, you can't, a lot of people can't bathe
*  outside if they wanted to. They don't have the privacy. But when that's your normal thing,
*  I mean, it becomes a totally natural thing and it's like very healthy.
*  And it's beautiful. You're out there looking at mountains all around in nature,
*  little tweety birds flying by while you're bathing, you know. You're not sealed off in some little
*  fiberglass cubicle. You're connected to everything.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's a 100% different way of living life.
*  And your perceptions change, your senses change. In the modern world, there's a lot of extraneous
*  noise and imagery that we're filtering out all the time. You can't pay attention to everything.
*  Pete Slauson Did you ever get injured while you're up there?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, yeah. But you can't pay attention to everything. I'll get to it.
*  Pete Slauson Okay.
*  Pete Slauson You can't pay attention to everything. So,
*  you're filtering stuff out all the time, right?
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson And when you're out in that environment,
*  it's very quiet. You're not getting inundated with all of this extraneous noise and you're,
*  instead of filtering, you're tuning in. You're really tuning in. Like one little bird that
*  hasn't been around the valley flies through, I'll know it. I'll hear it. Wow, hey, that was a pine
*  gross big. I haven't heard one of those for a while. You're paying attention to everything.
*  Pete Slauson And that's really different. It changes. It changes the way you think.
*  Pete Slauson There's a feeling that you get when you're in the real wilderness. Like particularly,
*  we did some hunting on Prince of Wales. And you know, when you're out there, it's raining,
*  rains every day. And there's this feeling of beautiful isolation. Like you're really isolated.
*  I mean, you're really alone. You don't see anything, you don't hear anything. And there's
*  this indifference that nature has towards you that's really humbling. It's like it puts you
*  in your place. Humans need that. They need to be put in their place. Like I always say that some
*  of the nicest people live near mountains and live near the ocean. I think the reason being is the
*  ocean just lets you know, hey, bitch, look at that. You ain't shit. Look at that water. You can't
*  survive there. Knowing that there's something right there that you can't survive in. It's like
*  it checks you a little bit. The mountains check you. The sheer beauty and the vastness. Like if
*  you know you're looking out at the continental divide and you see the rocky mountains, it's
*  humbling. It's humbling. On the one hand, you feel really strong being able to do what you're doing
*  there. But on the other hand, you feel really small. Yeah. Really vulnerable. Really insignificant.
*  Tell me about how you got injured. I've had problems with tendons a few times.
*  I've had some weird medical issues at different times. Like things that most people wouldn't have
*  down here. Like what? It's okay if we diverge from injury to illness. Sure. Sure. Well, one time I was
*  starving. The time I ate the weasels. This was a protracted starvation. Like I literally was having
*  a famine for a couple months where I was always getting a little bit of food, but not enough.
*  How much weight did you lose? A lot. I didn't have a scale. Right. But I got real skinny.
*  Real skinny. Like first I lost all my fat. Then I literally lost my muscles and I got really weak.
*  I was still going out looking for food every day, but I couldn't go as far. I couldn't climb up the
*  5,000 foot mountains anymore. I got that weak. And this is over months. Over months. Wow. Didn't
*  have enough food for a couple of months. And you couldn't fish? This was in the winter. Ice? The
*  ice is very thick. Back then the ice used to get thicker back then. It was usually about four feet
*  of ice on the lake by late winter. Now some winters have only had two and a half feet. But anyway,
*  I would try fishing, but there's not that many fish there. This is a little lake a mile across
*  isolated in the mountains. The fish that are in the lake stay there. Like they're also smaller.
*  They don't grow as fast. You can expend a lot of effort chiseling through. Remember, I don't have
*  a power auger or anything. Chiseling through three, four feet of ice trying to catch fish that are
*  this long and this big around. So I was trying to be as efficient as possible. I had out a lot of
*  snares for snowshoe hares. There are not many snowshoe hares. There's not much small game,
*  but I was catching a little bit every day. I'd get a grouse, I'd get a timing in, I'd get a rabbit,
*  but I was gradually getting weaker and thinner and weaker and thinner. So
*  what happened to me health-wise though
*  was that eventually when I got food, I just ate as much as I could eat.
*  For three or four days, all I did was eat, sleep and shit, literally.
*  And I got refeeding edema. Whoa. Which at the time I didn't recognize, I didn't even know what it was,
*  but you can actually die if you refeed yourself too fast. Like World War II, when they were
*  liberating concentration camps, soldiers didn't notice they're giving prisoners all the food they
*  wanted to eat. And some people got this refeeding edema. They get pulmonary edema and literally die.
*  Whoa. And disaster really, people that go into famine areas and whatnot, they know about this
*  now. You can't give people unlimited food. I didn't know about that. So I got edema and
*  it was weird. I just thought I was getting fat or something, but it was actually retaining fluids.
*  And I didn't find out for months later. I was talking to a doctor about what had happened to
*  me. He said, you got refeeding edema. So you were just living with it?
*  Yeah. It didn't last that long. But I don't remember exactly how long it lasted, but within
*  two weeks of when I got food, I was all puffy and I'm like, what the hell's going on? I couldn't put
*  on weight this fast, but it was actually just fluid that my body was, like my chest was,
*  I remember Sylvia pushing on it and saying, you're all spongy. And I was like, yeah, isn't that weird?
*  Because I had been like, skin and bones. How'd you feel?
*  I just felt hungry.
*  Still?
*  Well, not for two weeks, but man, for days, all I did was I'd eat until my stomach just couldn't
*  take anymore.
*  Wow. What had you gotten? Is that when you had gotten the caribou from the wolves?
*  No. That's when I got store bought food. A friend of mine flew in.
*  The thing that had happened was we had had this arrangement where somebody was supposed to come
*  part way through the winter that we knew that was going to bring in food and some supplies.
*  And I kept thinking, I just want to survive. I want to get through it. My goal is to live off
*  the land as much as I can. And we got this arrangement anyway, Tim's going to bring us
*  some supplies later in the winter. I'm just going to see the best I can do. And I just kept going
*  out and getting small game. Then what happened was even when you got a plane coming, it's hard
*  sometimes to get in up there. And also, my friend was working during the week. He could only come
*  on weekends. The weather was bad this weekend and then he couldn't come. And maybe there was
*  some other issue with the plane or something. It just kept getting delayed and it got to be
*  a real problem. Finally, I sent him a message on that cell phone. I was like, hey, Tim,
*  I'm starving up here. I've been living on muskrats and snowshoe hairs and not enough of them. You
*  got to come next weekend or make sure somebody else gets in here. Because I was really worried
*  about my health at that point. So then he did get in there and he dropped off all this food and I
*  just pigged out. Wow. And I got refeeding edema. What kind of food? I always just would get basic
*  food. I'm talking like- Beans and rice. Oats, rice, legumes, powdered milk, something I used to get.
*  And then not long after that, in the middle of February, the caribou showed up that year.
*  And I got five caribou at one time out on the island on the lake. And then we were all set again.
*  Feast of famine.
*  Yeah, it is. It's like a hungry country, but there are a lot of animals, but they're different
*  places. You can fly over the Arctic all day long and not see hardly anything.
*  Yeah, that's the weird part about it, right? You would think there's animals everywhere.
*  No. It's almost like a desert.
*  It is. It's like the Sahara Desert up there a lot of times, but there are a lot of animals
*  concentrated. The caribou are concentrated. There's herds of a hundred thousand caribou.
*  But- A hundred thousand?
*  Yeah. At certain times of the year when they all congregate, there can be a hundred thousand.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah. Some of the big Arctic herds, I mean, they don't all get in one place at one time.
*  They are recognized as a herd. They get into the hundreds of thousands.
*  They're very cyclic. The population goes up and down. But they're in certain places. And if they're
*  not where you are, you're in the Sahara Desert. Then when they show up, it's like the Serengeti
*  Plain. I mean, all of a sudden there's caribou everywhere. You step outside, you hear the antlers
*  all over the valley if it's like in October when they're rutting.
*  Wow.
*  You hear the wolves howling, ravens croaking. It's like, what the hell happened? I hadn't
*  heard anything for the last two months. And all of a sudden-
*  Look at that. Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  We're looking at an enormous pack of caribou. What do they call them? They call them packs?
*  Herd.
*  Herd? Enormous herd of caribou. Look at all those.
*  Yeah. It's in the summer. Now in the summer, they're up on the north side.
*  God, that's insane. It's so big. It's delicious meat, huh?
*  I've sat there at the cabin looking out at the lake and caribou walking across the lake,
*  moving all the time. And I estimated at one moment I could see 800 on the lake.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. A lot of caribou. Like the way I hunt them sometimes is to run around out there on
*  the lake with them.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. Like, can you pull up a picture on Facebook or you can't do that? There's one of me running
*  in a caribou herd.
*  In your notes section?
*  Why would you-
*  It's right on the front page there where it's like the pictures that you can leave up all the time.
*  What do they call them? Not in the notes section. No, it's right on the-
*  You ran with them and that's how you were hunting them?
*  Echo chasing. I told you how I used to study a lot of anthropology. I used to listen to
*  anything that I could hear about how people used to live in the old days. And especially the Inuit
*  and people living up north. There was this anthropologist, Austin Balikse,
*  he made some films back in the 1960s of the Netsilic people, the Netsilic Eskimo series
*  it's called. It's fascinating. He went up on Boothia Peninsula in northern Canada
*  and filmed people that still knew how to do things in very primitive ways. And one thing I
*  learned from those films was how they would hunt caribou. And the way these people would hunt
*  caribou is there'd only be a few hunters. They'd build the little stone, anuksuks they call them.
*  It's like a scarecrow. Make a line going down toward the lake so it looks like people.
*  Then the few hunters would move around and they would use their voice and they'd yell and they'd
*  echo their voice around to confuse the caribou and chase them into a lake that way. They could
*  use their voice to get them down there and then one guy in a kayak could overtake the caribou
*  and spare him. It's amazing. But you were by yourself. Yeah, but this is something you can
*  use by yourself. You can use this technique of using your voice to confuse caribou and
*  herd them where you want them to go. You echo out on the lake, if they're caribou, it's wide open.
*  They can see me a half a mile away and they'll go out in the middle of the lake in the day and
*  stand around out there. If I try walking up to them a few hundred yards away they might just
*  take off, yell as loud as I can yell and project my voice over to an island or shoreline depending
*  on where I am and it'll bounce back and they'll stop and they'll run straight back at me. Wow.
*  I've had them come running by me where Tricia was like, oh my God, she thought I was going to get
*  run over. She was filming once and I could hear her when I watched the video and she's like,
*  oh I think he's going to get run over. She was like, really? You see that picture there Jamie?
*  You can't find it. It's right on the-
*  I'll pop it up so you can see.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah, scroll up to the top, right there,
*  the upper left most picture. Yeah. Tricia took that picture.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow.
*  Jamie Boudreau Now those caribou, those caribou, they were running away from me before this picture
*  was taken and I was screaming and hollering, echoing my voice off the shoreline and they
*  turn around and run back and I do it many times. I had these caribou run back and forth like five,
*  six times. I could stay within 50 yards of them a lot of times just by yelling as loud as I could.
*  Pete Liesveld You look really close right there.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah. Well, Tricia thought I was going to get,
*  you know, trampled.
*  Pete Liesveld And so, this is how you hunted them?
*  Jamie Boudreau This is a technique I've used for hunting but on this particular day,
*  I was just demonstrating it.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow. Now, did you run into any issues
*  where you really didn't have any vegetables other than the vegetables in the stomachs
*  of the animals you ate? You were just eating meat. Did you run into any
*  health issues just living off of meat?
*  Jamie Boudreau I've eaten a very high protein, high fat diet for long periods of time and
*  I think that there's a lot more to food than nutrition. The reason I was eating that way
*  had nothing to do with me thinking that it was the best diet. The reason I was eating that way
*  is because I just wanted to live as close to that environment as possible and that's what
*  was available. So, I know some people are thinking, well, this is a really healthy diet, maybe it is,
*  maybe it isn't, but that wasn't my motivation.
*  Pete Liesveld Did you feel healthy when you had a good amount of it?
*  Jamie Boudreau What I felt was that if I ate too much meat,
*  it had bad effects.
*  Pete Liesveld What kind of bad effects?
*  Jamie Boudreau My body started to feel weird. I believe that
*  you can only handle so much protein, but you can handle a lot of fat. What I found is I had to
*  eat most of my calories from fat. I would eat a half a pound of solid pure fat a day when I was
*  eating just meat and fat. I might eat two or three, even four pounds of meat a day, but like a half a
*  pound of it was pure fat.
*  Pete Liesveld But was the form of it, was it bare fat or where are you getting your fat from?
*  Jamie Boudreau It would be moose fat, it would be sheep fat, one year it was bare fat.
*  Pete Liesveld Their fat is weird, right? It's a different chewy fat, like a deer fat.
*  Jamie Boudreau Chewy?
*  Pete Liesveld But you know what I'm saying? It doesn't render down like beef fat would.
*  Jamie Boudreau Moose fat?
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Jamie Boudreau Oh sure. You can render it if you want. I rendered a lot of it.
*  Pete Liesveld The way you look at it on the animal, it just seems different.
*  Jamie Boudreau What's different about it is that those game animals do not put on fat within the
*  muscle. It's separate. If you get a fat moose, he'll have a big fat layer on his back.
*  Pete Liesveld And so you would render that fat or?
*  Jamie Boudreau Sure.
*  Pete Liesveld That's how you do it?
*  Jamie Boudreau I mean I'll eat it all the way. When I'm butchering the moose in the field,
*  I start eating the fat right there.
*  Pete Liesveld Really?
*  Jamie Boudreau Sure.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow.
*  Jamie Boudreau Grab it off the kidneys and stuff and start eating it.
*  Pete Liesveld So that was the key for you was to get enough fat?
*  Jamie Boudreau I had to eat a lot of fat and then I would feel better. If you're just eating
*  protein for me, it didn't work.
*  Pete Liesveld How did it make you feel?
*  Jamie Boudreau It made me feel like I had to drink an awful lot of water.
*  Pete Liesveld Like you had to drink an awful lot of water?
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah. I'd drink a lot of water or I'd feel kind of like just a weird feeling inside.
*  I also was working really hard physically at those times but I was definitely drinking more
*  than a gallon of water a day. Sometimes almost two gallons of water a day when I'd be like in
*  real cold weather climbing mountains and everything eating meat and fat all the time.
*  Yeah. I'd be drinking a lot of water. And the other thing that was really important to me,
*  like when I hear people talking about how they eat a high meat diet or ketogenic diet now and
*  they're just eating beef, I wonder you know what they're doing for variety because for me,
*  I was eating all different parts of the animal, all the different organs and things. And also,
*  a lot of it I'd eat raw or half dried for example was one of my favorite ways to eat caribou meat
*  when I was eating you know this meat fat diet. Now I eat more vegetables and fruits and I still
*  like to eat a lot of meat but I do eat more vegetables and fruits.
*  Pete Liesveld Do you feel better that way?
*  Jamie Boudreau Personally, yeah. I like variety. I like a mix. I mean,
*  I felt good when I was eating that stuff but like I say, I would not feel good if I was just eating
*  steaks every day. If I was just eating steaks every day, I would feel strange but if I took
*  a caribou backstrap and I just sliced it up thin and hung it over the wood stove
*  and left it there for half a day or something, it would get a little you know dry on the outside
*  but it would still be raw inside. That stuff was delicious. That'd be like candy for me. I'd just
*  pig out and I love that.
*  Pete Liesveld And what would you do with the crust?
*  Jamie Boudreau Eat it. Oh, you mean the crust on
*  big pieces that have been hanging around all winter? That gets turned into bait. That gets
*  fed to the animals.
*  Pete Liesveld Okay.
*  Jamie Boudreau If it's…
*  Pete Liesveld Do you ever try to eat that?
*  Jamie Boudreau The only crust that – because that's where the oxidized blood is basically.
*  It turns really dark. It'll get almost black. Sometimes, there'll be for some reason like down
*  around the shank on a big animal like a moose when you're cutting it up into smaller pieces,
*  the crust looks so clean and everything down there, you can eat it like dry meat. But most of
*  the crust on most of the big sections of meat get black and they get – I would not consider that
*  food. It gets like – it's not the same as dry meat that you take a fresh piece of meat and dry
*  it for a few days.
*  Pete Liesveld This is coming from a guy who ate the contents of animal stomachs. So, I trust you.
*  When you say it's not meat, it's not food, don't eat it.
*  Jamie Boudreau Not that black crust. It's just – it's oxidized blood.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Jamie Boudreau Blood's good, but you want your blood real fresh.
*  Pete Liesveld Right.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah. Like, that's the thing with blood is like a lot of times, I haven't even been
*  able to eat the blood from an animal because I'm just too busy. But that's the thing is you can eat
*  the stomach, you can eat the intestine, you can eat the colon. I've eaten the colon of a moose.
*  You can eat the lungs even, you can eat spleen. I've eaten all this stuff. But the truth is,
*  if you're one guy working along butchering a moose, you have a hard time getting all that stuff
*  preserved and prepared. You know?
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Jamie Boudreau Because like if you want to eat the colon,
*  you want to get the shit out of it fast before it gets hard.
*  Pete Liesveld Oh boy. What does the colon of a moose taste like?
*  Pete Liesveld Oh, like the colon of a donkey?
*  Jamie Boudreau No, it's great because well, when you do it right, all it is is fat. It's just,
*  it's like donuts. It's like fat donut. You slice it. What you do, if you want to eat the colon of
*  a moose, old guy that was married to an Eskimo told me this and it works. You gotta work fast.
*  When you take the colon out of your next elk, try this elk, Joe.
*  Pete Liesveld Okay.
*  Jamie Boudreau Turn it inside out. The poop all falls out.
*  Pete Liesveld Like a sock?
*  Jamie Boudreau Turn it inside out like a sock.
*  Pete Liesveld Okay.
*  Jamie Boudreau You got the outside, you got the inside out,
*  it's all smooth. You know how the outside of the colon or the large intestine is full of fat like
*  on any animal. You know, there's all this fat all over it. That's going to be on the inside.
*  Now, you just wash that, you know, take it home and wash it good. Get the lining all nice and clean.
*  And then you slice it like donuts and fry it up.
*  Pete Liesveld What it tastes like?
*  Jamie Boudreau Delicious.
*  Pete Liesveld Does anything that resembles that would resonate with people?
*  Jamie Boudreau Fat. It's like good moose fat.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow.
*  Jamie Boudreau I mean, there's all kinds of fat. I have a hard time describing exact taste. What
*  does it taste? People always ask me that.
*  Pete Liesveld Tastes like a moose colon.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah. I'm saying there might be four other people that know what that tastes like.
*  Pete Liesveld Oh, no. No. You go up in some village in northern Alaska and you talk to
*  a lot of people, old people. You find old people that eat stuff like they've grown up,
*  70, 80 year old native people.
*  Jamie Boudreau There's a lot of people today that follow
*  carnivore diet and that they just eat animal products and meat. But they're eating mostly
*  domestic steak and it's got a lot of fat in it already.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That would be different. I haven't tried that.
*  But I will say that I feel very different eating beef from wild animals. There's a huge difference.
*  Pete Liesveld Huge difference.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld Huge.
*  Jamie Boudreau Huge.
*  Pete Liesveld Like, and you just look at beef cattle. They look lethargic compared to a wild
*  animal. They're obviously overweight. They've been pretty much just bred and fed to be fat.
*  And you look at that and it's somehow, it doesn't feel like that animal's going to be as healthy
*  to me to put into my body as a caribou running around wild like those ones we're just looking
*  at a picture of. Jamie Boudreau
*  No, it's not as healthy. It's the, I mean, gram for gram, ounce for ounce. You take a caribou or
*  a moose, it's much more protein. It's much more dense material, much denser meat. It's way less
*  fat. It's just a completely different experience. It makes you feel different when you eat it.
*  There's a feeling that you get from wild game that's almost like a stimulant. There's a little bit
*  of a, ooh, like, oh. Pete Liesveld
*  And it's what you did to get it. Jamie Boudreau
*  Yep, that too. It's connected to it. Pete Liesveld
*  I mean, you get that bite, it just tastes so good after you did all that work.
*  Jamie Boudreau Yeah, there's nothing like it. There's nothing like it. And, you know, when,
*  I guess the closest you could get is to bison. You know, if you buy store-bought bison, it's pretty
*  close to what it would be if it was wild, if it's just grazing. You know, as long as it has that
*  yellow fat that they get when they're grazing. Pete Liesveld
*  Do you know anybody who's tried that for their carnivore diet? Like…
*  Jamie Boudreau Only eaten bison? No.
*  Pete Liesveld Get something closer to a wild animal?
*  Jamie Boudreau No, I only know a couple people that are doing it and they're all doing domestic
*  ribeyes and stuff like that. You know, they're just getting a lot of fatty meats.
*  Pete Liesveld I love ribeye steak, but to just live on that, I don't know how that would be.
*  I never tried just living on that.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, I'm watching these people, like, waiting for the shoe to drop, you know,
*  like, waiting for them to develop health issues, waiting for this. It's weird. It's very much like
*  vegans in a way, where they're completely committed to this idea and any other idea is stupid.
*  And they're just the ideological hardliners with meat. And they think that vegetables are bad for
*  you and you shouldn't be eating vegetables, despite all the evidence to the contrary.
*  And then the same thing with vegans. Vegans want to think that this is the only way to eat,
*  the only way to eat is with vegetables. If you eat meat, it's bad for you, meat kills you. I'm like,
*  alright. People have been eating meat for literally all of time. 97% of the population of the planet
*  eats meat. It's crazy to think that meat is bad for you. Meat is one of the reasons why we're human.
*  What's bad for you, most likely according to basically every study they've ever done,
*  when they look at like meat eaters versus people who are not eating meat, what they don't dissect
*  is what are the other things these meat eaters are eating? And what kind of meat are they eating?
*  Are they eating a sandwich from a fast food place, a cheeseburger with fries and a shake and soda
*  with a lot of sugar in it? Is that the meat eater? Or are they doing what you did?
*  Are they eating fresh caribou? What are they eating?
*  After spending a whole winter out there living primarily on meat and fat and very small amount
*  of wild plant food, gathered maybe 15, 20 gallons of berries in the fall, had some dried leaves from
*  the spring before, willow leaves, had a few roots, but the roots there are very small. So I'm eating
*  90% meat and fat at least of my calories. I got my cholesterol checked next time I came
*  down. I was just curious. I hadn't had it checked for many years and I thought, what am I doing,
*  eating all this fat? I'm eating like half a pound of fat a day. It might be really bad.
*  And my total cholesterol level was 138.
*  Is that good?
*  That's really low. In fact, the doctor checked it, 200 I think is like high,
*  200 is borderline high or something. And the doctor who checked it said,
*  that's the lowest cholesterol I've ever checked and test ever. Because I told him I'm a little
*  bit scared of eating so much fat this year, like unbelievable amounts of fat.
*  Yeah, but you're spending so much time burning energy. The amount of energy that you must get
*  from hiking 20 miles a day in the mountains, at elevation, wandering around the woods,
*  stepping over logs, all kinds of stuff you have to do. You're burning off an incredible
*  amount of calories. It has to be.
*  Just routine activities too. You want to get water, you go out there and open up that hole
*  through the ice with a chisel. You carry your water every day.
*  You have to boil that water too?
*  No.
*  You don't?
*  No.
*  No beavers up that high?
*  I saw one beaver in that lake in 20 years.
*  It took a risk?
*  There are a few beavers in the general region, but it's like the limit of their habitat.
*  So far north and so far up in the mountains.
*  Yeah, when we were at Prince of Wales, we drank right out of the lake. Just dunk your cooler,
*  your thermos into the lake and just start drinking. I was like, that's crazy. It feels so weird.
*  I drink out of puddles.
*  Do you really?
*  Up in the mountains. There's no other water. Sometimes you find a little puddle in the tundra.
*  I never got sick from drinking water out there. It can happen. I know two people that got Giardia,
*  but they were both like old timers that had lived most of their life out there in the Brooks Range,
*  and they each had had it one time.
*  What do you want to do now?
*  Good question.
*  Now you're not doing the show anymore. They sort of...
*  Yeah, good question. My contract just ran out two months ago,
*  and I've been thinking a lot about this because I love the wilderness. I love nature, and I
*  absolutely love sharing it with people, and I want to find new ways to do that.
*  And there are a lot of new ways now. I mean, that's what inspired me seeing your show is like, wow.
*  I mean, I presume that you don't have to ask anybody about what you put on here, right?
*  No, I don't have to ask anybody.
*  You can do what you want.
*  That's why you're here.
*  That's why I'm here. I mean, I didn't have to go through a series of producers,
*  and I would never do that. If we ever got to a point where they wanted to offer me like a
*  gigantic chunk of money to put it on a network, but they had to pick the guess, I'd be like,
*  there's no chance. There's no chance. There's not a chance in hell. The beautiful thing about
*  the freedom that comes with this show is I can talk to people that I find interesting.
*  I found you incredibly interesting. Your story is amazing. When I would watch you on the show,
*  I'd be like, wow, I'd love to talk to that guy.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, man. So when you reached out, I was pumped.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Cool.
*  Yeah, because what a crazy life.
*  I was like, man, is Joe Rogan gonna want to talk to me? He's talking to all these big time celebrities.
*  Oh, I would like to talk to you probably more than a lot of the big time celebrities.
*  Some of the big time air quote celebrities that I talk to, it's just like, okay, I'll do it.
*  That's my feeling on it. I don't do like the show by itself has become popular
*  through whatever reason, for whatever reason. I don't know how it happened. It just did.
*  But I never think like, oh, if I get this guest, that'll be really popular. This will help the
*  show grow. This will bring me to another level. I don't think that way ever.
*  That's awesome.
*  My thought is always, that guy would be cool to talk to. Like, oh, I'd like to talk to her.
*  She seems interesting. Oh, that guy's got a weird life. What the fuck was that like?
*  It's all 100% genuine curiosity.
*  That's awesome. You're doing something that most people don't get to do,
*  which is what you really want to do. You do what you want to do.
*  Yeah, that's the beautiful thing about it is that I found out a way to also do it where people enjoy
*  it, where it actually provides a service. So folks are driving, they have a long trip,
*  or they're on a flight. They can actually get it. It's free and it gives you something.
*  There's a lot of wisdom being conveyed by some of your guests. I mean, that's what got me interested
*  in the show is I'm hearing these people talking. Well, you just did too.
*  There's a lot of free education out there for people on the internet.
*  Yeah.
*  It opens up whole new possibilities.
*  It does. Conversations like this, although they're not technically education,
*  they expand your horizons. They expand your understanding of how people are living their
*  life. Just hearing people genuinely talk, hearing people have real conversations without anybody
*  interfering or anybody telling them, hey, Glenn, maybe it'd be interesting if you're just a little
*  bit more mysterious. We need you. We're going to get you an outfit. You're going to show up
*  to the Joe Rogan show with a fur coat that you made yourself.
*  Isn't it interesting that all the time I was on TV and that show did really well.
*  I never came down and talked to you, but then on our own we connected.
*  Yeah. It is interesting.
*  It's interesting.
*  Yeah. Well, life's weird. The way things happen and when they happen and why they happen that way,
*  it's like, psh.
*  Yeah. But as far as what I'm going to do next, I want to keep experiencing these things, which
*  to me are precious and rare. I want to keep going out into the wilderness. I want to keep
*  experiencing it and I want to share it with people. It doesn't mean anything to me if I don't share it
*  to people anymore. I have no desire to go live by myself in the woods and not talk to anybody.
*  It seems like you could have a skeleton crew of cameraman, editor, you.
*  Yeah.
*  And put it on YouTube.
*  That's what I've thought about. Yeah.
*  I think that's a move, man, because you can make real money off of YouTube now. Obviously,
*  see these YouTube celebrities, they're very wealthy and they're just doing things on YouTube.
*  You could just transfer your show over to YouTube and I guarantee you people would watch.
*  I mean, 100%.
*  It's captivating.
*  Definitely would need a camera. I definitely would need a cameraman, editor.
*  Yeah. Cameraman and editor. So it's like a three-person crew. So all the stuff that
*  you had to deal with with all these other folks that weren't even there, these producers that
*  were saying they wanted to fire you and all that other shit, you wouldn't have to deal with that
*  at all. It would basically... And if you had an idea like, hey, I want to try this, I want to make
*  my own bow and arrow and go shoot a caribou with it and do it with traditional methods and use the
*  tendons from animals to make the strings and all the stuff that the Native Americans did,
*  you could do that. You could do whatever you want.
*  You could do whatever you want. And that's what I think would be really appealing to people because
*  just like if you started a podcast or just like anything else where there's no one telling you
*  what to do, you get to find out who the person really is. And I think that would be a great way
*  to give you all the freedom that you want where I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to get enough
*  advertiser dollars to pay for an editor and pay for a cameraman and put it up there and start
*  generating revenue. Yeah. Some guys are really good. Les Stroud used to film himself a lot.
*  I tried that a little bit, but I can't film myself. It's like I need the interaction.
*  Yeah. Les is, I mean, he's the only one that really did that without any horse shit
*  that live in the woods for seven days and survive off of whatever scraps he could find then
*  find some sort of a scenario that they piece together for the show. You know, the reason why
*  Bear Grylls happened, the whole reason why that guy got a show is because they were trying to
*  tell Les to fake things. Oh, really?
*  And he wouldn't fake anything. And he's like, I'm not going to do that way. So they got the,
*  let's get this fucking guy. So he would just go along with them. Bear Grylls just slept in a hotel.
*  He'd pretend he's drinking his own piss, all that stuff. Les is out there really surviving that way.
*  When you would see he would do like a seven day trip and maybe he would find no food. And by the
*  end of that seven days, you could see how much weight he had lost. I mean, he looked terrible.
*  And then he would get rescued as per, you know, how he would have to go to a drop off point or a
*  pickup point. But now he's all Bigfoot. Les has gone crazy.
*  Bigfoot.
*  100%.
*  I get more questions about Bigfoot. What is it? You live in the woods and you're supposed to be
*  running into Bigfoot. You're supposed to be a Bigfoot authority. Two questions people are always
*  asking about. Global warming. I'm not a scientist and Bigfoot.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I'm-
*  You're not a scientist, but you said you did notice that the ice is thin.
*  Yes. Yeah. Anecdotally, I can say that it's definitely warmer where I am compared to what
*  it was 15 years ago. The winters have been warmer, but-
*  How many years in a row have they been warmer?
*  Oh, I didn't keep the data because I know there are a lot of scientists keeping it and those are
*  the people I'm going to defer to on global warming. And I believe in global warming. I mean,
*  I believe in the consensus of scientific opinion. What I have seen personally is just overall,
*  the ice is thinner on my lake. And that's a sign that over the whole course of the winter,
*  there have been milder winters. 15 years ago, I'd get around four feet of ice. Now,
*  the last few winters have been times when I went out there in April, which is when it's had its
*  thickest and there's only two and a half feet of ice. I'm like, wow, that's crazy. I never saw that
*  10 to 15 years ago. The other thing is the absolute coldest temperatures since I've been out there.
*  Three times it went to colder than 60 below zero. They were all the first couple of winters,
*  first two or three winters. I don't know if that was just coincidence or what. I'm not saying this
*  is global warming. I'm just telling you what I've seen. And they've been recent winters where
*  the coldest it ever got was once or twice to 45 below. One of the first winners I was out there
*  in March for two weeks, it never went above 40 below. I haven't seen anything like that in the
*  last four or five winters. Since I got on the show, the coldest temperature we ever saw was one time
*  it went down to about 50, 55 below one day for a little while. I've seen times, like I said,
*  where it would literally not go above 40 below for two weeks in March. That was the first or
*  second year I was out there. So anecdotally at least. Yeah, that's just, look, we got to
*  defer to science on this thing. I mean, they're collecting data all over the world.
*  You can see the Arctic oceans, there's less ice. You can measure the temperature of the ocean
*  by sending sound waves through it. There's all different methods. So it doesn't really matter
*  what one person sees in one place, but there's a consensus of opinion. That's what matters.
*  Yeah, but it is interesting, your own anecdotal experience, seeing that the ice is that much
*  thinner and the winters are warmer. It is. Well, I'm sure the National Weather Service
*  has all kinds of data on Alaska. I'm sure, I'm sure. I mean, for instance, in Fairbanks, Alaska,
*  they never used to use any salt on the roads at all. The reason being that it was too cold for
*  the salt to work. Salt will only melt ice if it's a certain temperature. If it gets colder than that,
*  it doesn't work. So they didn't even store salt there. The Department of Transportation didn't
*  use it, which was nice. Your vehicles didn't rust out. But now there are enough times in the
*  winter when it's warm enough that they actually are using salt in recent years on the roads of
*  Fairbanks. And you actually see times when it gets up to freezing, even freezing rain events in the
*  winter, which didn't used to happen hardly ever. And now that's not that outlandish to have it
*  get up to freezing in the middle of the winter some days. Bigfoot. What about Bigfoot?
*  I just can't believe people waste their time talking about stuff like that.
*  Well, for someone like you who actually lives in the wilderness, and you actually live in Alaska,
*  which is one of the places where people supposedly spot Bigfoot. Yeah. It's because a lot of nutty
*  people go to Alaska. They call them end of the roaders. Yeah. You drive until you can't go any
*  further and then you camp out in the woods for a while and see Bigfoot. Yeah. Does Les Strad really
*  see Bigfoot? I don't think he's ever seen it. But he believes it's out there? His show's sad. It makes
*  me sad. Because he was like a really respected guy doing the survival thing. And I think it was a
*  really interesting educational show and it showed people how hard it is. But then he got hooked up
*  with this guy and he was filming these Bigfoot shows and the guy was completely full of shit.
*  There's like a fucking he's wearing a mask pretending to be Bigfoot in the woods, filming it
*  high resolution. It looks so fake. You should see the show the fake because it's so dumb. It's so
*  dumb. It hurts your feelings. Like you're like what? You're doing this. But it's real popular.
*  That's the problem. If you have like a survivor show, you might get X amount of people to watch
*  it. If you have a Bigfoot show, you might get double the number. What does that tell you about
*  our culture? Not good. Look at this. This is the video footage. This is he says, they said this is
*  a close up high resolution of Bigfoot. Look, look at that thing. How fake is that? Like he's going to
*  zoom in on it. It says the Todd standing Bigfoot video as seen in Survivor Man Bigfoot show with
*  Les Trout. What's going on? People are really, are the people that are watching this stuff
*  actually believing it or they just find it entertaining? There's people in a food coma
*  sitting on their couch, sitting in front of the TV thinking about when they're going to go to bed.
*  Look how dumb that looks, man. Look at this fucking stupid fake Bigfoot face. And they're
*  sitting there going, whoa, they wish it was real. They wish it was real. They wish it was real. They
*  want it to be real. They want there to be some large primate living by itself in the forest,
*  a small number of them, not that many, just a small number of them. I've seen some crazy stuff,
*  but it wasn't Bigfoot. Well, here's the thing. If there were Bigfoot, why wouldn't there be
*  thousands of them all over the place? What's going to stop Bigfoot from breeding? Bigfoot would beat
*  the fuck out of a bear, kill a mountain lion. Like what would stop a Bigfoot? You're talking about an
*  8 to 10 foot tall gorilla? What the hell would stop that? That would be the king of the forest.
*  And what would stop us from seeing the thing?
*  And what would stop us from finding a body?
*  Yeah.
*  What would stop us from finding a-
*  The bones.
*  Yeah.
*  The skeletons.
*  I mean-
*  How about an ancient one? You know, in a site, like when they find these mastodons and saber-tooth
*  tigers and things that existed here 10,000 years ago, why don't they find a Bigfoot? Huh? Come on.
*  I can't believe it. It's amazing what people- Just think how productive would all be the society if
*  people were putting their energy into something more worthwhile.
*  Than Bigfoot.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you could say that same thing about just surfing Twitter.
*  How many people are just reading just mindless tweets over and over, you're looking for
*  something that's going to stimulate them that never comes their way. Hours a day. You ever
*  look at- I looked at my phone the other day. I was embarrassed. I had four hours of screen time
*  during the day. Four hours. I'm like, what could I have- Some of it was answering text messages.
*  Some of it was answering emails, but let's be honest, that might've been an hour.
*  So like three hours of me just fucking off. I could have been writing jokes. I could have been
*  researching things. I could have been doing a million things. I could have cleaned my-
*  Could have cleaned this desk. Could have done a lot of shit.
*  It's kind of cluttered.
*  Oh my God, dude. People keep bringing me things.
*  Stack them up there.
*  You know what? I used to really like Charlie Rose. You remember his show?
*  Sure.
*  It's two guys sitting around a table talking.
*  When I discovered you, I thought, I wonder if this guy ever saw Charlie Rose, if you were inspired by-
*  No, I never watched his show.
*  I always thought it was really interesting because he had interesting guests.
*  I've seen clips, I'm sure. I've seen clips of him talking.
*  I think he got in some trouble.
*  Yeah, he liked the show as hog. He was being a little loose with the ladies.
*  I think it was like women he's working with said he was harassing them. Yeah. Shocker.
*  Yeah, it's too bad.
*  It was an interesting show. It was one of the few TV shows I used to like when I was younger,
*  when I had TV.
*  Well, there was a time where I think it was really difficult to get people to sit down and have a
*  conversation. And so a show like his or any kind of show where people are just sitting down having
*  a conversation, particularly without an audience. Like a lot of these talk shows you see,
*  it's the most unnatural environment of all time. You're sitting sideways,
*  facing a crowd of people that you don't know with lights and cameraman everywhere,
*  and you're supposed to act normal. It's the least normal you're ever going to act.
*  But those are good too. Like Phil Donahue, remember him?
*  Oh yeah, sure.
*  Did you used to watch him?
*  Sure, yeah.
*  That was the same like, talking about something-
*  Dick Cavett. You ever see the old Dick Cavett shows?
*  Those were really interesting from the 60s and 70s.
*  Yeah, that's a little bit of-
*  Yeah. Well, there's videos of, I've watched almost all of them on YouTube,
*  but it's cool. People like conversations because they like to know how other people are thinking,
*  and they kind of decipher that and piece it together through listening to people talk.
*  Listen, man, I hope you do your thing on YouTube or somewhere else like that where they give you
*  control. I think that would be really the ultimate thing for you is to not have producers. Look,
*  if I had what you were going through at any point in this podcast, I'd probably have quit.
*  If I had producers telling me what to do and I had to argue with the network about what kind
*  of guests to have on or what, like we have to review a show, why did you talk like this? Why
*  did you say that? I would have never got here. It would have never happened. The only reason why
*  this happened was because the time I created it aligned with technology and it aligned with
*  the ability to get things out in this way, mass scale that just didn't exist previously.
*  I think that could be expanded to what you do easily, especially YouTube, something like that
*  or Vimeo or many, many of these other streaming services doing something like that. We just have
*  a cameraman and you just have an editor and you, and you're out there. I mean, be magic. Perfect.
*  You can give the 100% full vision of you. You don't have to have anybody else's input.
*  Give the vision of what's out there.
*  Yeah. Then you also have a direct line to your fans. If you put it on Facebook and the people
*  that like it or don't like it, hey Glenn, I'm tired of seeing you shit in the woods.
*  That's the amazing thing about this world is that people can connect.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's phenomenal.
*  Yeah. It's amazing. Listen, man, it's been cool to connect with you. I really enjoyed this. It's
*  a lot of fun. We did like three and a half hours.
*  Thanks for having me down. Oh, really? I wasn't paying attention.
*  It's almost 3.30.
*  It's a long show.
*  Yeah. It's great though, man. I really enjoyed it. If people want to find you on Facebook,
*  please tell them how.
*  Yeah. I'm on Facebook, Glenn Villeneuve, V-I-L-L-E-N-E-U-V-E, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram.
*  I got everything, but I'm most active on Facebook. That's what I mean.
*  What is your Instagram?
*  Under my name. Everything's just under my name.
*  Everything's just your one name. Okay. Thanks, Glenn. That was fun.
*  Thanks a lot, Joe.
*  All right, man. Bye, everybody.
*  We did it, man.
*  Wow. That is different when you...
