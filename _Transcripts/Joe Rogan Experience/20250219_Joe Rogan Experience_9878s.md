# Joe Rogan Experience #2274 - Mike Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6.0s)]
*  Mike Baker, good to see you my friend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=13.0s)]
*  It's good to be seen, thank you Mr. Rogan. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=18.0s)]
*  He's taking notes already? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=20.0s)]
*  I am. He said good to see you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I don't know what I do this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=24.0s)]
*  So tell everybody what you were doing in the Middle East, because it's pretty crazy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=26.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. Yeah, thank you for that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=29.0s)]
*  Look, it all started with some colleagues of mine from the UK Special Forces Club. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=31.0s)]
*  And these guys are tremendous, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=37.0s)]
*  But Howard Leatham and some others who came up with an idea. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=40.0s)]
*  They said, look, we have to do something to help the Benevolent Fund, which is for the UK Special Forces. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=43.0s)]
*  It's like wounded warriors here in the States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=48.0s)]
*  But, and I can say this because I'm a dual citizen with the UK. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=51.0s)]
*  The British don't tend to be very good at raising money or asking for money for very important causes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=56.0s)]
*  So here in the US where you've got a hundred thousand different groups that are advocating for veterans, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=63.0s)]
*  over there it's not the case, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=69.0s)]
*  But they have the same need, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=71.0s)]
*  And they have all these wonderful people and their families. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=73.0s)]
*  So the idea was, what can we do? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=75.0s)]
*  A big event, something massive that can really help to raise funds and awareness for the Special Forces Benevolent Fund. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=77.0s)]
*  They came up with this crazy idea at the time, still crazy, to recreate a 1917 epic journey [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=84.0s)]
*  that Lawrence of Arabia did through what was considered the unpassable deserts of Saudi and Jordan, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=93.0s)]
*  to go from essentially northwest Saudi through these unpassable deserts and then into Jordan and then down to Aqaba [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=99.0s)]
*  to route the Turks, who at the time controlled the area. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=106.0s)]
*  And with a small Arab army led by several sheiks, and Lawrence, they did this trek of about 1,100 kilometers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=110.0s)]
*  Took them several months because they had to stop along the way, plus they were fighting Turks along the way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=119.0s)]
*  So we took off in January, mid-January, five riders, ten camels, and an incredible support team. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=124.0s)]
*  An incredible support team. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=133.0s)]
*  Can I just stop you there? Is this your first time riding a camel? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=135.0s)]
*  Well, we went out in December, spent about a week and a half. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=137.0s)]
*  Howard lives out there, he has to do one of the other fellows. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=140.0s)]
*  So you had to go through camel riding training? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=145.0s)]
*  Camel riding training. That's exactly what we did. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=148.0s)]
*  What is it like riding a camel? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=151.0s)]
*  It is not comfortable in any fashion. It's not like a horse. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=155.0s)]
*  A horse has, you can fall into sort of a rhythm, and a horse has a much smoother gait. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=158.0s)]
*  So the camel, basically all you're trying to do, there's the crew. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=163.0s)]
*  They're up so high. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=167.0s)]
*  Howard, James, myself, Tomo, there's Craig in the back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=169.0s)]
*  An amazing crew. I've rarely worked with guys that are just so impressive. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=173.0s)]
*  And again, going with the support team. Everybody that was on that group, a small group of eight or nine folks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=178.0s)]
*  Why does everybody ride with one leg to the side like that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=184.0s)]
*  It's essentially a comfort issue. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=189.0s)]
*  And because you'll notice there's no, they're not really saddles. They're called shidads that sit on top of the hump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=191.0s)]
*  That's a Saudi shidad. The Omani shidad is different. It sits behind the hump and is even less comfortable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=198.0s)]
*  And now these things were probably designed some 2,000 years ago, and they've never felt the need to improve them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=204.0s)]
*  They're basically just some wood tied together. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=209.0s)]
*  And then you try to throw a couple of things on top of this piece of wood to make it comfortable. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=213.0s)]
*  And I think all the Bedouins and others were laughing at us because we just kept piling blankets on to try to see if we couldn't. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=218.0s)]
*  It was tough. And so ass blisters are a real thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=223.0s)]
*  So anyway, that's what you see there. But there's no stirrups on these things. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=228.0s)]
*  Like a horse, you know, you ride and you're on a saddle, you've got stirrups. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=233.0s)]
*  And it takes the pressure off your legs. You're just hanging on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=236.0s)]
*  So you don't want to ride with one leg on either side because it's just not comfortable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=239.0s)]
*  So you hit your leg over the front and then you kind of put your leg or your foot behind the other leg. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=243.0s)]
*  Is it because they're too wide? Is that why you don't want to ride one leg on the other side? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=249.0s)]
*  Or is it just a ball buster? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=254.0s)]
*  I'll tell you, it's a ball buster, particularly if that shidad shifts and it starts to like lean forward. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=256.0s)]
*  And then suddenly, like there's these large dowels in the front and large dowel in the back. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=261.0s)]
*  You know, they kind of basically look like big wooden dildos on this shidad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=265.0s)]
*  And so if that shidad shifts forward as it did on occasion, your package is just jammed against that thing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=268.0s)]
*  And you have to cover these guys. Look, I got injured. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=275.0s)]
*  I had some soft muscle injury and there's the crew walking through. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=279.0s)]
*  And I tore some muscles in my rib cage. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=284.0s)]
*  Just riding? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=287.0s)]
*  No, I was a rather inelegant dismount from the camel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=288.0s)]
*  And so I twisted really badly and then went the other way. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=293.0s)]
*  And then next thing you know, I had fucked up some of the muscles along my obliques and then rib cage area. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=297.0s)]
*  And so I spent the next couple of days, we had a team medic, Jed, a wonderful guy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=304.0s)]
*  Great sense of humor, as did they all. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=309.0s)]
*  And he eventually got tired of me like asking him for painkillers and anti-inflammatories. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=312.0s)]
*  And so eventually I had to tap out, which was more painful probably than the actual injuries. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=318.0s)]
*  And the guys just continued to grind it out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=324.0s)]
*  How far was left when you tapped out? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=327.0s)]
*  Oh, I was in the first 25% of the journey. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=329.0s)]
*  And then I went back for the end, for the arrival into Aqaba. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=332.0s)]
*  There's the whole crew right there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=336.0s)]
*  I just can't say enough about these people. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=338.0s)]
*  Again, 25, 26 days, longer than that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=341.0s)]
*  Actually a month out in really bad conditions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=344.0s)]
*  People think, that's the deserts, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=347.0s)]
*  Well, it's called the impassable deserts for a reason. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=349.0s)]
*  Massive sandstorms, freezing temperatures at night, bitter cold. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=351.0s)]
*  And we were sleeping in one man tents. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=355.0s)]
*  And then you'd get up, you'd get the camels ready. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=357.0s)]
*  How many supplies did you bring? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=362.0s)]
*  Did you have a supply camel? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=364.0s)]
*  We had Land Rover did a wonderful job of helping to sponsor this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=366.0s)]
*  So they provided vehicles that the support team used to kind of trail [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=371.0s)]
*  and then get ahead and help to establish the next. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=377.0s)]
*  And Howard and Craig had done the recce. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=380.0s)]
*  So we had the camps mapped out because this is a long trek, 1,100 kilometers. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=383.0s)]
*  And so they were able to supply and do all the work that kept these guys moving forward. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=390.0s)]
*  Imagine doing that without them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=399.0s)]
*  Oh, it wouldn't have been impossible, but they'd still be out there schlepping. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=401.0s)]
*  Jesus, you'd have to bring several camels just to carry your food and water. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's exactly right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=411.0s)]
*  There's no water out there, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=413.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=415.0s)]
*  Do you find the spring occasionally? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=416.0s)]
*  Yeah, you pass through a handful of areas near small. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=418.0s)]
*  I mean, when I'm saying small, I mean like this, nothing there, little tiny village. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=422.0s)]
*  Maybe there's a mosque and the mosque would have a water supply so you could stop [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=425.0s)]
*  and maybe refill, let the camels drink. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=429.0s)]
*  Are they getting water from the ground or are they getting water from, are they bringing it in? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=432.0s)]
*  They're getting it from a well. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=436.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=438.0s)]
*  So they have, I mean, because talking thousands of years, they've figured out where the wells are. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=439.0s)]
*  And part of this, you know, from 1917, look, the Turks never expected these guys to come from this direction [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=443.0s)]
*  because who's going to do that? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=448.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=450.0s)]
*  And they did it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=451.0s)]
*  These guys all did it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=452.0s)]
*  I was just, I was just honored to be a part of it, even though I had to tap out, which was, god damn, that was frustrating. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=453.0s)]
*  Jamie, can you show me what that looks like on a map? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=458.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=460.0s)]
*  It's February. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=461.0s)]
*  And by now, 80% of people have probably abandoned their New Year's resolutions. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=462.0s)]
*  And it makes sense. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=466.0s)]
*  Life can get crazy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=467.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you don't have the time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=468.0s)]
*  But one easy habit to stick with is AG1. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=470.0s)]

*  AG1 makes hard to get micronutrients, easy to get and replaces multiple vitamins and supplements with just one scoop. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=478.0s)]
*  You just mix it in some cold water, take a nice moment in the morning to do your body right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=485.0s)]
*  And honestly, it tastes pretty good. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=490.0s)]
*  It's not easy to pack this many high quality ingredients with this much nutrient density. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=492.0s)]
*  But AG1 makes it happen without added sugars or artificial sweeteners ever. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=497.0s)]

*  Joe Rogan. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=525.0s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=526.0s)]
*  Like what that area looks like. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah, I should have. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=529.0s)]
*  I should have included a map of the route itself. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=530.0s)]
*  So is it just like tell me where to look? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=533.0s)]
*  Look for Al Waj, Al Waj Saudi on the coast, sort of northwest Saudi. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=535.0s)]
*  And look at Jamie spelling it correctly and everything. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=546.0s)]
*  This guy. This guy's crazy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=551.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=552.0s)]
*  No, he's right there, right there at the top. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=553.0s)]
*  So we started in Al Waj and then yeah, there you go. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=556.0s)]
*  There you go. Now click out and then you start heading north. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=561.0s)]
*  You start heading northeast. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=565.0s)]
*  You can see Jordan is up there above that area. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=566.0s)]
*  You start heading sort of on a diagonal northeast. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=569.0s)]
*  You pass through all. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=573.0s)]
*  Just look at it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=575.0s)]
*  It's like, what the hell? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=576.0s)]
*  And you keep going. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=577.0s)]
*  You keep going. You keep going. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=579.0s)]
*  Eventually you get, if you zoom out a little bit so you'll see the border with Jordan. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=580.0s)]
*  Okay, you go up, pass, keep going in that direction. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=587.0s)]
*  That whole place looks inhospitable. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=590.0s)]
*  There's just not a lot there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=592.0s)]
*  And then you come up to where Jordan is. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=593.0s)]
*  But anyway, at the end of the day, you see Aqaba. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=595.0s)]
*  We came down through Jordan and into Aqaba, which is at the tip there, right there. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=597.0s)]
*  Which is where the fort was, which is where they routed the Turks. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=602.0s)]
*  And then eventually that created all sorts of opportunities for the Arab states. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=605.0s)]
*  Look at this whole area. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=608.0s)]
*  There's fucking no green. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=610.0s)]
*  No, no, there's not. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=612.0s)]
*  There's just tiny parcels of semi-green areas. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=613.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=616.0s)]
*  When I say it's desolate and there's nothing, there's nothing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=617.0s)]
*  Jamie, zoom back out again. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=622.0s)]
*  Look how wild that looks. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=623.0s)]
*  Like, what happened? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=626.0s)]
*  So these folks. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=628.0s)]
*  Doesn't that all look washed out, Jamie? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=631.0s)]
*  This is all Randall Carlson stuff, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=632.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we went through the Royal Reserve. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=634.0s)]
*  The Saudis were very good and the Jordanians were amazing as well. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=637.0s)]
*  Jamie, what were you saying? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=641.0s)]
*  In supporting this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=642.0s)]
*  It's a basin. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=643.0s)]
*  Looks like it all washed down. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=644.0s)]
*  Yeah, it totally looks like it washed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=645.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'll find like all these wadis that are in there that essentially there's a lot of dried up riverbeds. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=647.0s)]
*  And the danger is, of course, that they flash floods on occasion. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=654.0s)]
*  Not very often. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=657.0s)]
*  But so this thing took place and they eventually, the whole thing ended in Aqaba. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=660.0s)]
*  Again, the Jordanians couldn't have been greater about supporting this. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=667.0s)]
*  I think everybody, I know the better ones when we got started, they were staring at us like, what the hell are you doing? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=671.0s)]
*  They couldn't imagine that people would do this willingly. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=676.0s)]
*  Especially soft Americans and Europeans. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=679.0s)]
*  Man, I tell you what. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=684.0s)]
*  Soft. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=686.0s)]
*  I know when I got injured, I know every single one of those damn son of a bitches were laughing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=687.0s)]
*  They were like, what the hell? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=691.0s)]
*  And then they were looking at our shodads with all these blankets and furs on them trying to make it somewhat comfortable. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=693.0s)]
*  Those guys must have leather balls. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=700.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think or they just had them removed. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=702.0s)]
*  I don't know how you do it because and then you have to trot. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=704.0s)]
*  You can't just walk. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=707.0s)]
*  Walking was comfortable enough, but you have to cover the distance. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=708.0s)]
*  And the trot on a camel is not comfortable. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=713.0s)]
*  And so it was anyway, I just can't say enough good things about these people. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=718.0s)]
*  But the cause, the UK Special Forces Club Benevolent Fund, if people want to go and read more about this, they can go to what is it? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=723.0s)]
*  WWSFCBF. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=730.0s)]
*  That's all you are. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=733.0s)]
*  You keep using the W's. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=734.0s)]
*  Everybody else gave up on it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=735.0s)]
*  I guess I don't have to. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=736.0s)]
*  So that's three W's. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=738.0s)]
*  And then. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=740.0s)]
*  Everybody used to say that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=741.0s)]
*  People used to say HTTP, colon, backflag. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=742.0s)]
*  I still do because I think that's what you have to do. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=745.0s)]
*  So it's SFCBF.org. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=749.0s)]
*  You can go there. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=752.0s)]
*  You check it out. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=753.0s)]
*  And if you're so inclined, there's even a button you can click on to donate, even if it's a price of a cup of coffee. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=754.0s)]
*  If you get enough people putting in a price of a cup of coffee, it makes a huge difference for these people. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=759.0s)]
*  But it was one of those bucket list items that I just can't describe. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=765.0s)]
*  When you see some of the things that USAID fund, does it get you upset that they don't fund things like this? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=771.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really does. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=776.0s)]
*  It does me too. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=778.0s)]
*  It does me too. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=779.0s)]
*  It's just come on. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=780.0s)]
*  Because this is a direct, as is Wounded Warriors, as are all the other groups. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=781.0s)]
*  It's a direct way to help people. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=785.0s)]
*  And it's not like they've got massive administrative costs like the government tends to. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=788.0s)]
*  And so, no, absolutely goddamn right. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=794.0s)]
*  It seems to me, and so we were fortunate to have a lot of corporations that went in on it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=796.0s)]
*  There were some that looked at it and goes, okay, so let me see. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=802.0s)]
*  You're talking about five white guys on camels recreating what we think is a... [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=805.0s)]
*  It was still sort of the vestiges of that bullshit DEI thing, right? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=809.0s)]
*  From a corporate perspective. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=813.0s)]
*  So we were like, no, goddamn it. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=814.0s)]
*  It's sporting veterans and their families. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=816.0s)]
*  How tough is that to understand? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=818.0s)]
*  But some... [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=820.0s)]
*  You're just taking a difficult trek. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=821.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you support colonialism. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=823.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, exactly. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=825.0s)]
*  And by the way, the Arab sheikhs led the way. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=826.0s)]
*  It was their effort. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=828.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy how they have to look at things through this lens of who in the furthest left, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=829.0s)]
*  kookiest perspective is going to be offended by this because it's a bunch of white people in the desert. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=835.0s)]
*  If anything, it should give you a perspective on how unbelievably brutal the times were back then. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=840.0s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=845.0s)]
*  And you also think that honestly, it's just... [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=848.0s)]
*  Look at the cause. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=852.0s)]
*  Look at the reason for it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=853.0s)]
*  But I do think, I think we are on the downhill slope of DEI. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=855.0s)]
*  I think the grifters who built up that cottage industry are going to have to be looking for new jobs. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=863.0s)]
*  Because I think most companies are starting to think, you know what, let's get off of this thing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=869.0s)]
*  Yes, I think so too. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=873.0s)]
*  And I also think that if you look at the overall body of work that they've produced, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=874.0s)]
*  it's very obvious what many of them are doing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=879.0s)]
*  I think there's some genuinely good people that are involved in this that really want to do good work. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=885.0s)]
*  They're very sensitive, kind souls. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=889.0s)]
*  They probably grew up rich. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=891.0s)]
*  Probably grew up rich. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=892.0s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of grifters too, unfortunately. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=894.0s)]
*  And the grifters, they've been so egregious and obvious that I think it's turned a lot of people up. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=898.0s)]
*  Even rational, kind, compassionate, progressive people are like, enough. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=905.0s)]
*  This is fucking stupid. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=911.0s)]
*  Especially when you hear the anti stuff. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=912.0s)]
*  It's not just pro whatever you are. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=916.0s)]
*  It's anti whatever you're not. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=919.0s)]
*  And then you realize, okay, this is not rational. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=921.0s)]
*  This is cult-like thinking. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=925.0s)]
*  And this is a thing where if you don't agree, the punishment is very, it's very grave. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=927.0s)]
*  They'll go after you so hard if you don't agree with them. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=934.0s)]
*  And then you kind of realize what it is. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=937.0s)]
*  And then eventually they start to eat their own. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=939.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=941.0s)]
*  You can never be progressive enough. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=942.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=943.0s)]
*  The mob's always going to turn on, no matter who you are and how righteous you pretended to be. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=944.0s)]
*  And I agree with it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=949.0s)]
*  And I agree with it, yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=951.0s)]
*  Good people with good intentions mixed in. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=952.0s)]
*  But I think a lot of people saw this as a terrific opportunity. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=956.0s)]
*  And I also think that what it taught me was that, yes, I am racist. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=959.0s)]
*  I hate elite progressive white people. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=964.0s)]
*  I just can't stand them. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=969.0s)]
*  It's the one group that I would say that I just can't stand because they're very, there's [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=970.0s)]
*  something about them. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=974.0s)]
*  I feel sorry for them. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=976.0s)]
*  I feel like at this point in our culture, the divisions are so fucking crazy. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=979.0s)]
*  And it's so counter to what America should be standing for, which is a United States, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=985.0s)]
*  United country, a community, a large group of people that all agree on a few very key [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=992.0s)]
*  rules, one of them being freedom. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=999.0s)]
*  And I think that... [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1002.0s)]
*  Seems logical. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1003.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got to stop. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1004.0s)]
*  This division is set up not by us. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1005.0s)]
*  It's set up by world leaders. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's set up by the media. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1010.0s)]
*  It's set up by the people who benefit from keeping us divided. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1011.0s)]
*  Most of us agree on a lot. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1015.0s)]
*  One of the things you're seeing is from all these USA disclosures is the mainstream media [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1017.0s)]
*  cannot ever say that anything this administration is doing is positive. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1024.0s)]
*  So even if they find unbelievable corruption and they've found some really wild shit, what [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1028.0s)]
*  was the $4.7 trillion in untraceable money? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1035.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1040.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1041.0s)]
*  I sent that to you, right? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1043.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was Doge was digging through essentially the way that money is audited within the government. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1044.0s)]
*  And they look at the data sets and how things are divided and how you have to explain what's [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1054.0s)]
*  going on. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1061.0s)]
*  And the idea is that there's a lack of links to payments, outgoing payments, budget line [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1062.0s)]
*  items. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1071.0s)]
*  So this payment goes out, what is it for? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1072.0s)]
*  I mean, it would be the same thing if you had a... [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1075.0s)]
*  Well, I do, I have a business. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1077.0s)]
*  And in that business, you have to know what you're spending your money on, right? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1078.0s)]
*  That's a logical thing. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1082.0s)]
*  I'm not a rocket scientist. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1083.0s)]
*  But what they're saying is that they've... [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1085.0s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1088.0s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1089.0s)]
*  So it's the Treasury Access Symbol, TAS, is an identification code linking treasury payment [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1090.0s)]
*  to a budget line item, standard financial process. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1096.0s)]
*  In the federal government, the TAS field was optional for $4.7 trillion in payments and [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1098.0s)]
*  was often left blank, making traceability almost impossible. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1105.0s)]
*  As of Saturday, this is now a required field, increasing insight into where money is actually [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1109.0s)]
*  going. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1114.0s)]
*  So thanks to US Treasury for the great work. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1115.0s)]
*  It would be like if I got my monthly reports, my monthly numbers from our finance director, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1118.0s)]
*  and I looked at it, there's the outgoing line, so I can see how much money's going out. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1124.0s)]
*  But there's nothing that links it to, where did it go? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1128.0s)]
*  Did it go to pay a vendor? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1131.0s)]
*  Did it go to pay rent? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1132.0s)]
*  Did it go to pay staff? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1133.0s)]
*  Who bought a jet? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1134.0s)]
*  Yeah, who bought a jet? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1135.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1136.0s)]
*  By the way, when a company buys a jet, it's usually... [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1137.0s)]
*  That's a key fraud indicator. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1140.0s)]
*  If a company buys a jet, all companies? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1142.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not all companies. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1144.0s)]
*  The UFC bought a jet. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1145.0s)]
*  Not all companies. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1146.0s)]
*  Let me just make a note of that. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1148.0s)]
*  UFC, jet. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1150.0s)]
*  What I mean is, obviously it's not like if it's Nike or an established large business. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1151.0s)]
*  But you're making so much money, you can buy a jet. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1157.0s)]
*  If you've got a business in a space and it's a growing business or it's a new business [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1160.0s)]
*  or a startup, whatever, a purchase of a jet usually is a fraud indicator on the list of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1165.0s)]
*  all the fraud indicators. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1170.0s)]
*  Means you cashed in your meme coin. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1172.0s)]
*  I'm not cashing money in. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1175.0s)]
*  Have you thought about a Mike Baker meme coin yet? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1176.0s)]
*  It's funny that you say that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1178.0s)]
*  No. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1179.0s)]
*  It seems like it's legal gambling is what it is. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1180.0s)]
*  It seems like even though it's horrible to do and very unethical to dump it, to pump [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1183.0s)]
*  and dump it, it seems like that's legal for some weird reason. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1189.0s)]
*  I know that's the turmoil around the hoctua coin and that's the fear about the Trump coin. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1193.0s)]
*  I think... [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1201.0s)]
*  Didn't the president of Argentina do a pump and dump as well, allegedly? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1202.0s)]
*  Well, allegedly, yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1205.0s)]
*  What did he do, Jamie? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1206.0s)]
*  That is getting way messy this week. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1207.0s)]
*  I want to speculate. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1209.0s)]
*  There's all sorts of shit going on with that. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1210.0s)]
*  What do you think is happening? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1212.0s)]
*  Poppyzilla had a video come out late last night. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1213.0s)]
*  He's the guy you do not want investigating your shit coin. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1216.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1219.0s)]
*  Some guy's admitting to stuff that didn't sound... [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1220.0s)]
*  They're admitting it? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1222.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1223.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1224.0s)]
*  I was like, I didn't even watch the videos yet. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1225.0s)]
*  I just see in the stuff on Twitter. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1226.0s)]
*  We were trying to figure out as a way to do it where you don't pump and dump it because [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1227.0s)]
*  anybody can kind of make money now, which is so strange. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1230.0s)]
*  We're like, we make a JRE coin? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1233.0s)]
*  What if we didn't dump it? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1235.0s)]
*  What if we didn't pump and dump it? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1236.0s)]
*  What would it be for? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1237.0s)]
*  How can you just do that? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1238.0s)]
*  How can you just... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1241.0s)]
*  The regulations have not caught up yet. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1242.0s)]
*  No. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1245.0s)]
*  You see that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1246.0s)]
*  Any new emerging business, industry, technology, I think there are people who look and go, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1247.0s)]
*  there's an opportunity here because regulatory policy hasn't caught up. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1256.0s)]
*  So Bob's drunk. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1260.0s)]
*  Well, Dave Portnoy's been paying attention to all this and he's been buying coins and [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1261.0s)]
*  tweeting about them and then selling them and he's been making a lot of money. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1265.0s)]
*  And he's like, am I going to jail? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1268.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1270.0s)]
*  Because you're making real money. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1271.0s)]
*  Didn't he make like a million dollars off of one of them? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1273.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1276.0s)]
*  He's involved in this too now. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1277.0s)]
*  It reminds me of... [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1278.0s)]
*  He's involved in what? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1279.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1280.0s)]
*  The Argentina thing? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1281.0s)]
*  That's what I don't know. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1282.0s)]
*  Well, fill me in, dog. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1284.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find out. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1285.0s)]
*  I don't like... [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1286.0s)]
*  It's called Libra coin, I think. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1287.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's the same as the Argentina coin. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1288.0s)]
*  Libra coin. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1290.0s)]
*  And I think that's what it is. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1291.0s)]
*  They're going through whether or not he knew stuff before or who told him and what did [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1292.0s)]
*  he know? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1296.0s)]
*  The Portnoy? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1297.0s)]
*  And when did he know it? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1298.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1299.0s)]
*  He's pretty careful. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1300.0s)]
*  He's pretty careful. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1301.0s)]
*  I doubt he did anything illegal. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1302.0s)]
*  Also, he's so wealthy he doesn't have to do anything illegal. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1304.0s)]
*  I was going to say. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1307.0s)]
*  But then again, people get fucking crazy greedy. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1308.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1311.0s)]
*  How much is enough? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1312.0s)]
*  Well, they hang out with other billionaires. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1313.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1315.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you're always comparing yourself to the guy who's got three billion. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1316.0s)]
*  You got one billion and you're not... [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1318.0s)]
*  How the fuck can you have that much money and not be happy? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1320.0s)]
*  That's the part I don't understand. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1321.0s)]
*  Well, that's what it gets weird, but I get it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1322.0s)]
*  If I hang out with Elon Musk, I feel poor. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1324.0s)]
*  So does everybody else on the planet. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1330.0s)]
*  He's still the richest guy. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1331.0s)]
*  When you meet really, really rich people, you feel poor, even if you're really wealthy. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1332.0s)]
*  Well, that's the funny thing with him. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1336.0s)]
*  I always think, right now, the past couple of weeks in particular, it seems like people [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1338.0s)]
*  are just losing their shit and dropping onto the feigning couch over the idea that he's [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1342.0s)]
*  accessing your private information. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1347.0s)]
*  What's he going to do? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1349.0s)]
*  He's accessing your private information. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1350.0s)]
*  You think, okay, well, first of all, I don't think the guy is looking to scam you out of [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1351.0s)]
*  500 bucks. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1356.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1357.0s)]
*  The argument's good. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1358.0s)]
*  He shouldn't be able to scan your information. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1359.0s)]
*  But also, is there any evidence that he's doing that? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1361.0s)]
*  And here's the other question. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1364.0s)]
*  Who else has access to this? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1365.0s)]
*  Well, it turns out... [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1367.0s)]
*  Just about every company out there. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1368.0s)]
*  It turns out a lot of people have access to this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1369.0s)]
*  Even students that are interns who work in the department have access to this. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1371.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1376.0s)]
*  I think what they're doing is they're... [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1377.0s)]
*  They're making an argument, and it's a good one. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1378.0s)]
*  If you have a... [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1380.0s)]
*  Look, if he was evil, if you do have this evil billionaire who wants to control the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1381.0s)]
*  world and has access to everyone's credit card and just steals all your money, or does [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1386.0s)]
*  whatever... [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1390.0s)]
*  Didn't that used to be Jeff Bezos? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1391.0s)]
*  I thought he was the guy who they were focused on. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1392.0s)]
*  Well, they were for a while, but he's just ballin'. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1395.0s)]
*  Jeff is just hanging out on his yacht, bagging his super hot wife. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1399.0s)]
*  He's having a good time. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1403.0s)]
*  That sounds a lot better than chasing government waste and fraud. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1405.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1408.0s)]
*  I think Jeff's got it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1409.0s)]
*  I remember when Elon Musk was criticizing him for not working hard enough. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1410.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1412.0s)]
*  What does work for? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1413.0s)]
*  That guy's got $200 billion. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1415.0s)]
*  I think you can chill. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1418.0s)]
*  When you get $200 billion, then it's time to get that fucking crazy yacht. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1420.0s)]
*  Once you start launching your own rocket ships. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1424.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got a rocket ship like a duck. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1425.0s)]
*  You're literally trying to fuck space. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1427.0s)]
*  It's Austin Powers. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1430.0s)]
*  Have a good time. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1431.0s)]
*  I like the way Jeff Bezos is doing it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1432.0s)]
*  I appreciate the fact that Elon is so psychotic in his drive. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1435.0s)]
*  It's bizarre, but also in the face of overwhelming hate. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1439.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1443.0s)]
*  Part of me finds it very entertaining. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1446.0s)]
*  Part of me just looks at it and goes, all you got to... [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1448.0s)]
*  I think what they're having a problem with is two things, is the messaging and the means [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1450.0s)]
*  of doing this. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1456.0s)]
*  Everybody, you would think, would agree that, oh, you're going to go through government [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1457.0s)]
*  spending with a fine tooth comb? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1461.0s)]
*  You're going to find the waste and abuse and fraud? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1463.0s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1465.0s)]
*  Well, this is one of the things that Clinton ran on and implemented during his first term. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1466.0s)]
*  Actually implemented. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1472.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1473.0s)]
*  Very effectively, by the way. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1474.0s)]
*  It was a huge boon to our economy. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1475.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1477.0s)]
*  Again, the messaging was different. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1478.0s)]
*  It's also... [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1480.0s)]
*  And the means were different. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1481.0s)]
*  The Democrats were different. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1482.0s)]
*  That was a different kind of a Democrat. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1484.0s)]
*  That was the kind of Democrat I would vote for right now. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1486.0s)]
*  I'd vote for Bill Clinton, despite all the blow jobs and all the crazy shit. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1487.0s)]
*  Well, but you weren't involved in that, so... [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1490.0s)]
*  I think that they all did that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1493.0s)]
*  I think you get two types of people who want to be president, pussy hounds and warmongers. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1496.0s)]
*  I prefer pussy hounds. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1501.0s)]
*  Well, but you could be both. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1504.0s)]
*  You could be Genghis Khan. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1505.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1506.0s)]
*  You could just use both. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1507.0s)]
*  Good use of the pronunciation Genghis. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1508.0s)]
*  Well, I'm actually listening to an amazing podcast. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1511.0s)]
*  I'd love to recommend to everybody, because Elon recommended it on X, and I've been listening [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1513.0s)]
*  to it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1518.0s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1519.0s)]
*  Fall of Civilizations podcast, they're doing a series on the Mongols right now, Terror [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1520.0s)]
*  in the Steps, and I am listening to it right now, so that's why I'm saying Genghis correctly. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1526.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1531.0s)]
*  No, that's great. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1532.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1533.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1534.0s)]
*  They even explain the pronunciation. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1535.0s)]
*  They explain where it came from and how it got fucked up over the years of translation [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1536.0s)]
*  into languages that didn't have cheng. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1540.0s)]
*  They didn't have that sound, and so Genghis Khan became Genghis Khan, especially when [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1543.4s)]
*  European languages started translating it. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1549.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1552.0s)]
*  That makes... [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1554.0s)]
*  Everything I know about Khan I learned from Mulan. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1555.0s)]
*  Do you know they didn't even fucking know about this whole story until the 1800s? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1556.0s)]
*  They found a Chinese book, and the Chinese book was written, they thought it was nonsense. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1561.66s)]
*  They couldn't figure out what it was saying because it was written where the Chinese characters [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1565.72s)]
*  made the Mongol sounds of the words. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1569.4s)]
*  They had to translate it from Chinese to the Mongolian language, and then they realized [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1572.4s)]
*  this was the history of Genghis Khan and the Khan Empire. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1578.64s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1583.32s)]
*  It's fucking... [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1584.32s)]
*  The secret history of the Mongols. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1585.32s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1587.32s)]
*  This podcast is fantastic. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1589.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1591.32s)]
*  That does sound great because again, I think when you consider how we're all apparently [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1592.4399999999998s)]
*  carrying some of his DNA around... [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1596.4399999999998s)]
*  Not us. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1598.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1599.36s)]
*  Not us. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1600.36s)]
*  Not Europeans. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1601.36s)]
*  Mostly Asians, right? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1602.36s)]
*  Oh, damn it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1603.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1604.36s)]
*  Well, I have a little Asian. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1605.36s)]
*  I have like 1% Asian. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1606.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1607.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1608.36s)]
*  Yeah, 1% Asian, close to 2% African. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1609.36s)]
*  It's like... [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1610.36s)]
*  But I'm from Sicily. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1611.36s)]
*  My ancestors, and so I think those are the ones that got raped by the Moors. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1612.36s)]
*  That's in the movie True Romance. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1616.12s)]
*  Remember? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1619.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1620.96s)]
*  Christopher Walken. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1622.6000000000001s)]
*  Christian Slater? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1623.6000000000001s)]
*  No, not Christian Slater. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1624.6000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  Christopher Walken. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1626.6000000000001s)]
*  Who was it with him? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1627.6000000000001s)]
*  True Romance. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  There was a whole series of people. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1630.3600000000001s)]
*  Bruce Dern. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1632.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1633.48s)]
*  Who's laying there? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1634.48s)]
*  No, Dennis Hopper. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1635.48s)]
*  Dennis Hopper. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1636.48s)]
*  Dennis Hopper. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1637.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1638.48s)]
*  Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, right? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1639.48s)]
*  Is that who it was? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1640.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's who it was. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1641.48s)]
*  I remember they had a scene together that I remember. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1642.48s)]
*  Fuck that movie's good. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1644.48s)]
*  Fuck that movie's good. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1646.48s)]
*  That is a great fucking movie. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1647.96s)]
*  But yeah, I think if they had come in, if the administration had come in and said, here's [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1649.96s)]
*  what we're going to do. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1657.04s)]
*  We are going to root out waste and fraud. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  We're going to go after every dollar that's not spent on behalf of the American public [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1660.76s)]
*  and our national security and advancing American interests. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1664.14s)]
*  And we're going to do it in this efficient manner. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1669.08s)]
*  But again, don't get me wrong. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1673.24s)]
*  I think sometimes the disruption of fast action is extremely beneficial at times. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1675.28s)]
*  And sometimes you can't see the benefit until other things happen outside the bubble that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  we may be looking in. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1685.76s)]
*  But I think that if they had messaged it a little bit differently and then with the means, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1687.2s)]
*  rather than taking a blowtorch to everything. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1692.6399999999999s)]
*  Because again, not saying that it can't be effective, but what I'm saying is that they're [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1695.44s)]
*  losing, I think, important opportunity from a goodwill perspective. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1699.2s)]
*  And I know they probably don't give a fuck anymore. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1704.44s)]
*  But all those people who voted for them this time around, gave them that chance that didn't [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1706.64s)]
*  the previous time. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1712.3400000000001s)]
*  They said, oh, fuck it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1713.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm so done with the Biden administration and all this bullshit. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1714.3400000000001s)]
*  They need to see, I think, more stability, less chaos. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1718.52s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are very good. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1722.56s)]
*  I think we all thought perhaps that the progressives, the Democrats were just going to go into a [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1724.72s)]
*  cave and hide. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  But they're regrouping. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1729.42s)]
*  And they're starting to come back. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1731.0800000000002s)]
*  They're growing beards. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1733.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1734.72s)]
*  Suddenly the toxic mail is very attractive. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1736.6s)]
*  You know, shame they don't have any. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1738.8s)]
*  But I think that if you give them ammunition, obviously they're going to take advantage [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1742.28s)]
*  of it. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1749.04s)]
*  And I think some of the approach to this, again, not saying it's wrong in the sense [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1750.04s)]
*  of let's find that waste and fraud. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1754.72s)]
*  But they're giving them opportunities to start firing back. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1758.56s)]
*  Who's scoring big in the NBA this year? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1763.4s)]
*  You are with all new ways to get in on the action at DraftKings Sportsbook, an official [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1765.68s)]
*  sports betting partner of the NBA. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1770.94s)]
*  From monster slams to dishing the rock to cleaning the glass, get behind your favorite [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1773.88s)]
*  players and the prop bets you can make on DraftKings, the home of NBA player props. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1779.4s)]
*  Plus, for new DraftKings customers, bet $5 to get $150 in bonus bets instantly. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1785.64s)]
*  Take it to the rack with DraftKings Sportsbook. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1792.84s)]
*  Every point counts. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1795.72s)]
*  Download the DraftKings Sportsbook app and use the code ROGIN. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1796.72s)]
*  That's code ROGIN for new customers to get $150 in bonus bets when you bet just five [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1800.84s)]
*  bucks. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1807.12s)]
*  Only on DraftKings. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1808.12s)]
*  The crown is yours. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, I think the problem is they're trying to do it very quickly because they want to [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1822.84s)]
*  get a lot done before the midterms. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1845.56s)]
*  So they only have 24 months to enact real change. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1848.0s)]
*  Did you see Kevin O'Leary talking about on CNN? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1852.04s)]
*  He was saying they're not doing enough. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1854.28s)]
*  They should cut more. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1856.1599999999999s)]
*  He's like if you want to, because he's talking about it from an entrepreneur's perspective, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1857.1599999999999s)]
*  if you're taking over like a failing company that's filled with bloat and waste and he's [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1860.56s)]
*  like that is the government. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1863.96s)]
*  He goes, you got to cut more. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1864.96s)]
*  He goes, cut everything. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1865.96s)]
*  Cut it all out and then find out what's necessary and rebuild it from there. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1867.48s)]
*  Well, I would argue. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1871.1599999999999s)]
*  Because he was saying on CNN and CNN they were like, ooh, ooh. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1872.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1879.28s)]
*  Well, the five people that watch CNN still were probably. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1880.28s)]
*  There's probably 20. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1883.92s)]
*  But the thing about it is they're all united in their message, whether it's MSNBC. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1884.92s)]
*  I watched MSNBC the other day in the gym. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1889.28s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  It was awesome motivation to work out because these people look morbidly obese and they had [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1892.3600000000001s)]
*  this language that they were speaking. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1897.92s)]
*  It was almost like they were translating from another language. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1900.3200000000002s)]
*  It didn't make sense. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1904.52s)]
*  It's like, you know, we're in danger. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1905.96s)]
*  You know, we're it was the way they were talking. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1909.48s)]
*  It's like my people feel my people feel like they're in danger, like they're being criminalized. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1912.68s)]
*  We are, you know, we're being we're being pushed out of society. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
*  We're being told we don't exist. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1923.44s)]
*  And then, of course, you have to say you're an ally of the LBGTQ plus. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1925.96s)]
*  They're digging their heels in on all that stuff, though, which is that's not going to [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1930.56s)]
*  win anymore. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1935.52s)]
*  That's that's too crazy. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1936.52s)]
*  Even like kind progressive people realize like, you know, you've done a weird thing [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1937.72s)]
*  with with women's sports. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1943.04s)]
*  You've done a weird thing with the safety of women in bathrooms. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1945.0s)]
*  And it's not to say that some of these people who are legitimate trans people who really [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  do just want to use the women's room and be treated like a woman. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1952.8s)]
*  That's true, too. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1956.1399999999999s)]
*  But you open the door for perverts and you're not admitting that you open. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1957.1399999999999s)]
*  You just allowing guys with beards and hard dicks to wander around the women's room. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1959.72s)]
*  And how tough is it to just have a have a whatever a unisex bathroom? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1964.0s)]
*  Most places are a lot of places do. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1969.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1970.4s)]
*  So you find as long as a big bathroom. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1971.4s)]
*  The problem is a group if it's all single bathrooms, that's not economically feasible [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  at like a stadium. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1976.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1977.88s)]
*  You know, and that's that's where it becomes a problem. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1978.88s)]
*  And then it's also this like weird cultural line where like which bathroom do you get [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1980.76s)]
*  to use is like this is like a thing in Congress, right? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1985.44s)]
*  Because that one trans person in Congress who, by the way, said that they do not want [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1988.48s)]
*  to use the women's room. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1993.28s)]
*  So it's not even an issue. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1994.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1995.48s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1996.48s)]
*  And I think I said they that was very good. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1997.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=1999.68s)]
*  You're you're you're dance the line. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2000.68s)]
*  You're very sensitive. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2001.68s)]
*  People always say that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2002.68s)]
*  How damn Rogan is so sensitive. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2003.68s)]
*  But I think if if most most folks who are in alternative, you know, lifestyles, whatever, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2006.16s)]
*  how you want to put it, I think, yeah, they just want to get on with it, right? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2013.24s)]
*  They want to be accepted. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2016.48s)]
*  They don't want to make, you know, people make a fuss over. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2017.48s)]
*  They just want to move on. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2020.52s)]
*  And then you've got a small minority that just can't seem to get enough attention. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2021.78s)]
*  And when they can't get enough attention, then they do something, you know, even more [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2024.62s)]
*  wacky. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2027.46s)]
*  Well, I think it's a problem with a lot of the people that are, quote unquote, leftist [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2028.46s)]
*  in general is that they've been bullied and picked on all their life and they've been [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2033.66s)]
*  fucked with. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2038.72s)]
*  And now they have a gang and now they're going to go fuck with other people. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2039.72s)]
*  It's not much of a gang, though, is it really? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2043.02s)]
*  It's online. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2044.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2045.86s)]
*  The words they use online, they say it's like very attacking. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2047.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2051.02s)]
*  You know, it's like this is like a core aspect of progressives right now online is that when [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2052.02s)]
*  they're tweeting about stuff and when they're posting about stuff, it's very aggressive [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2058.06s)]
*  and very angry and insulting. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2062.7000000000003s)]
*  And that this is this is their way to demean, whether it's Pete Hegseth or Cash Patel or [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2066.3s)]
*  any of these people that are involved or RFK Jr. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2072.6600000000003s)]
*  Any of these people that are involved, even Tulsi, it's like the way they're doing it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2075.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like it's not about policy or agreeing or disagreeing about perspectives or the way [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2080.54s)]
*  they're choosing to govern. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2086.4199999999996s)]
*  It's not that. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2089.58s)]
*  Well, I think they're angry because for a while, right, the mob rule was working and [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2090.58s)]
*  everybody was being silenced from the bullying or the fear of being bullied. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2095.8199999999997s)]
*  And it lasted for so long. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2102.7s)]
*  It lasted for years. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2103.8599999999997s)]
*  You think about it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2104.8599999999997s)]
*  It lasted until Elon bought Twitter, really, realistically. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2106.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think that's fair. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2109.62s)]
*  If he hadn't done that and they were all controlled by the left, do you think Facebook would have [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2110.62s)]
*  like loosened up their grip? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2115.02s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2116.46s)]
*  Well, look, meta alphabet. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2117.46s)]
*  They're all they're all kind of rewriting toning down their their DEI policies, right? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2118.94s)]
*  I think that's also because Zuckerberg started doing Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2123.7s)]
*  I really do. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2127.3799999999997s)]
*  They start taking testosterone. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2128.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, shout out to Jack Machado. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2129.3799999999997s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu changed your mind, man. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2131.3799999999997s)]
*  It'll change who you are. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2134.02s)]
*  You realize like there's reality in this world. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2135.42s)]
*  He's looking a lot more manly. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2138.1s)]
*  He does. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2139.1s)]
*  Looks a lot more manly. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2140.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2141.1s)]
*  He's got a thick neck now. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2142.1s)]
*  I think that has a lot to do with it because you start looking at things from a more libertarian [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2143.1s)]
*  perspective from a merit based perspective. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2146.42s)]
*  Well, also, you know, you're just you're burning fuel. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2148.74s)]
*  You're feeling better. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2151.66s)]
*  You're you're focused on something other than your own inner angst. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2152.66s)]
*  Or how do you fit in with this? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2156.54s)]
*  Again, look, everybody just should be able to live their life. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2158.8199999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2163.1s)]
*  And that's what we all need to concentrate on. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2164.1s)]
*  As long as you're not hurting anybody else with the way you live your life. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2166.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2169.6600000000003s)]
*  Live your life. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2170.6600000000003s)]
*  If you want to wear a dress, God bless you. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2171.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2173.1000000000004s)]
*  God bless everybody. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2174.1000000000004s)]
*  But just be nice. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2175.1000000000004s)]
*  And I think most of the people, the reason why they're not nice is because people have [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2176.1000000000004s)]
*  been not nice to them. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2179.06s)]
*  You know, that's that old expression, hurt people, hurt people. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2180.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2182.7400000000002s)]
*  And the way to fucking unite us is not to keep hurting people. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2183.7400000000002s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2186.7000000000003s)]
*  No, I think it's simple enough. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2188.1000000000004s)]
*  I honestly I don't I don't care. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2189.54s)]
*  Someone's got an alternative lifestyle. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2191.46s)]
*  I don't need to play along with their imaginary idea that a dude's going to have a baby or [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2192.98s)]
*  can, you know, I like breastfeed or whatever. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2197.2200000000003s)]
*  This is one tick tock person who trolls. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2200.9s)]
*  And I don't even know if it's a biological woman, because that's one thing that the trans [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2203.3s)]
*  people are very upset with. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2207.5s)]
*  There's a lot of like really hot only fans girls that are pretending to be trans and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2208.62s)]
*  they put like a fake dick in their underwear. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2212.98s)]

*  Their argument is my identity is not a costume for you to wear. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2222.5s)]
*  Like wait a minute. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2226.94s)]

*  When somebody throws some shit out there and people buy into it, right? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2278.92s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2281.28s)]
*  Well, I buy into some of the dumb ones sometimes. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2282.28s)]
*  I have to send them to Jamie. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2284.32s)]
*  Jamie have to sort out what the fuck is real now. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2287.32s)]
*  It's so hard to tell. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2291.36s)]
*  I see things from myself that aren't real. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2292.36s)]
*  I saw me doing or I didn't see me. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2295.44s)]
*  I heard my voice over some narration of something of some TikTok story and I was like, I never [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2299.0s)]
*  saw this. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2305.0s)]
*  I never this is not me saying this. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2306.0s)]
*  It's all done through AI. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2307.8s)]
*  I'm like, this is crazy. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2308.8s)]
*  You're a prime case study for the impact and effects of and the sort of the the you know, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2309.8s)]
*  the downside of AI. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2317.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh, for sure with my voice. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2319.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2320.88s)]
*  You know, I guess now with video as well, you know, if you wanted to have a podcast [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2321.88s)]
*  video of me doing something. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2324.92s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2326.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's pretty wild now that I mean, we have a little bit of a problem where a [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2327.5600000000004s)]
*  bunch of people are selling like cheap things online and using my voice and we have to get [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2331.76s)]
*  them removed. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2336.04s)]
*  Yeah, but that's just you know, that's his opportunists are taking advantage. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2337.52s)]
*  You know, you're selling protein powders that I've never seen before. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2340.56s)]
*  All that kind of shit. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2343.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2344.72s)]
*  They're doing that with my voice. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2345.72s)]
*  I mean, there's there's very few we've talked about before. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2346.72s)]
*  There's very few because the the idea was always sort of detection. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2348.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2352.24s)]
*  OK, we got to create better systems to detect deep fakes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2353.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2356.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2357.68s)]
*  And but now I think the focus the focus has rightly shifted from sort of the detection [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2358.68s)]
*  to more proactive protection of material. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2362.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2366.84s)]
*  So so get it at the moment of creation. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2367.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2370.04s)]
*  Embed the ability within the the video clip, the audio clip, whatever, to show that you've [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2371.04s)]
*  got proof of of whatever you want to call it, reality, credibility, authenticity. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2377.84s)]
*  And that's the way it's all going, because you just can't keep up with you. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2383.96s)]
*  If all you're doing is trying to create better systems to detect deep fakes, it's a losing [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2387.32s)]
*  game. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2391.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2392.9599999999996s)]
*  And you're battling terrorists because, you know, you're coming up with an idea to prevent [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2393.9599999999996s)]
*  a terrorist attack based on the last terrorist attack. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2395.3999999999996s)]
*  And they're on to something else. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2398.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2400.4399999999996s)]
*  So it's it's an interesting world. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2401.4399999999996s)]
*  There's not that many companies out there that are doing a great job of it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  But there are some. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2405.24s)]
*  It's going to get to a point where it's impossible to tell. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2406.52s)]
*  I think that's not far away. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2409.4399999999996s)]
*  I think we're there. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2411.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2412.2s)]
*  Honestly, it's pretty close. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2413.2s)]
*  Most people aren't curious. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2414.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2415.2s)]
*  Most people are. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2416.2s)]
*  Well, they don't have time or they're not cynical. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2417.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2418.68s)]
*  Most people are willing to look at something and go, yeah, you know, I mean, unless it's [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2420.12s)]
*  just clearly bullshit. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2423.6s)]
*  But for the most part, if it's if it's a half decent fake. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2425.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2429.2799999999997s)]
*  I think most people will accept it and move on. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2430.2799999999997s)]
*  I like the ones that are they're obvious. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2433.3999999999996s)]
*  They're really good, but they're obvious. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2437.48s)]
*  Like to see the one with Kamala Harris after she lost presidency. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2438.96s)]
*  She's wearing a bikini top, walking with a beer. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2441.8399999999997s)]
*  It says unemployed. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2443.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2444.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2445.96s)]
*  That's good. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2446.96s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious that it's not real. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2447.96s)]
*  So it's OK. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2448.96s)]
*  Like the ones where Trump's playing the guitar and then there's all these other people like [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2449.96s)]
*  Putin's in the background with the drums. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2453.52s)]
*  You see that one? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2454.92s)]
*  That is good. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2455.92s)]
*  There's there's one where I haven't I don't think I've seen the one with him playing the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2456.92s)]
*  drums, but I've seen them where there's a whole series of world leaders and they're [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2459.6s)]
*  they're they're in a ballad together. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2463.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2466.0s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2468.0s)]
*  The one with Trump playing guitar. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2469.0s)]
*  I think they're doing it's fortunate, son, right? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2470.0s)]
*  It is right. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2472.88s)]
*  I think it's on my it's on my Instagram. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2473.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2474.88s)]
*  Creedence Clearwater Revival. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2475.88s)]
*  So good. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2476.92s)]
*  And it's obviously fake. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2478.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2479.44s)]
*  That's why I like it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2480.44s)]
*  It's like it's not tricking me. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2481.44s)]
*  But I'm like, wow, that's really good. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2482.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2483.44s)]
*  It's I mean, it's and it's interesting. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2484.44s)]
*  I mean, again, talk about regulatory policy not catching up. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2485.44s)]
*  I mean, what do you do? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2487.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2489.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, like if you were in Europe, right, you could you you could be fined and jailed [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2490.6400000000003s)]
*  for in a case for like pushing something that's disinformation or whatever or just or you're [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2494.76s)]
*  just goofing. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2501.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2502.08s)]
*  Yeah, you can't goof. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2503.08s)]
*  But you can't. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2504.08s)]
*  To your point, if it's an obvious goof, then OK, you can probably get away with maybe not [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2505.72s)]
*  if you're in Germany or somewhere. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2509.3199999999997s)]
*  But Germany is going crazy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2510.6s)]
*  They are going crazy. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2512.7999999999997s)]
*  And they were happy with JD Vance's speech. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2514.68s)]
*  I'll tell you that much. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2516.48s)]
*  I wonder why nobody in the EU was happy. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2517.48s)]
*  The head of the Munich Security Conference literally cried after the speech when when [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2520.44s)]
*  they were addressing EU leaders following the speech, right, talking about the impact [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2525.24s)]
*  and what it might have meant for US EU relations and everything. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2530.52s)]
*  There were literally tears being shed over over JD Vance's speech. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2534.2799999999997s)]
*  What was it about his speech in particular that was offensive? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2539.04s)]
*  Well, I think what they were anticipating at the Munich Security Conference was he was [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2541.92s)]
*  going to come in and he was going to talk about, obviously, the number one topic on [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2545.56s)]
*  the table for them was Ukraine. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2548.92s)]
*  And you know, where are we going with that? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2551.64s)]
*  Because obviously, the EU leaders are now very concerned about US commitment to NATO. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  What is the Trump administration planning on doing in terms of further support for Ukraine [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  really further support for NATO? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2564.68s)]
*  They look at the distance themselves. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2566.6s)]
*  And Vance instead came in and didn't really focus on any of that shit. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2568.44s)]
*  He turned it on on to the European Union and to EU countries in the UK, UK in particular, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2572.12s)]
*  talking about how, you know, their biggest threat isn't necessarily Russia or China. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2579.24s)]
*  Their biggest threat is what they're doing to themselves in terms of suppressing free [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2584.2799999999997s)]
*  speech from all the various groups out there, including conservative groups, far left, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2588.2s)]
*  whatever, determining that, you know, this this type of speech is illegal. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2593.64s)]
*  We're going to pursue you. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2597.56s)]
*  We're going to find you. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2598.44s)]
*  We're going to jail you armed raids against people that are pushing content online. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2599.08s)]
*  So he made it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2605.3199999999997s)]
*  Including anti-immigrant content. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2606.52s)]
*  Anti-immigrant content. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2608.12s)]
*  But to be fair, right, I mean, most of Europe at this point is pretty fed up with the immigration [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2609.48s)]
*  policies that their leaders. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2615.16s)]
*  Which is why they want to suppress the dissent online. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2616.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2619.64s)]
*  They're not doing it because they genuinely think this is a moral and ethical thing to do. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2620.36s)]
*  They're doing it because they sense an uprising. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2624.36s)]
*  Yeah, and they rightly should. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2625.96s)]
*  Look, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, he's not getting reelected. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2627.6400000000003s)]
*  And their election is coming up here and shortly. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2630.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2631.96s)]
*  And so he's not it's not going to happen for him. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2632.36s)]
*  So I think, yeah, they're rightly not rightly, but they are concerned about [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2635.88s)]
*  their own political power. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2640.1200000000003s)]
*  That's that's what it is. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2641.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's what people need to understand. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2643.32s)]
*  Rocket science. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2644.44s)]
*  It's not that the Europeans are the kinder, more progressive. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2645.2400000000002s)]
*  No, there's like they understand that it's coming. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2649.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2652.04s)]
*  And they want to do everything they can to stop it because most people are fed up. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2652.3599999999997s)]
*  Most people just want to be left the fuck alone. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2656.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2658.04s)]
*  And if you tell them that they can't put a flag meme on one of their Facebook pages or [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2658.52s)]
*  they get arrested, which is what happened in Germany. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2663.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2666.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2666.68s)]
*  Or talk about. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2666.92s)]
*  So if you talk about the immigration problem and you say, look, we've got to stop this. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2667.7999999999997s)]
*  We've got to, you know, maybe secure borders. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2671.8799999999997s)]
*  If you talk about the Ukraine war and say, I don't think we should be supporting, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2674.52s)]
*  you know, dumping more resource into Ukraine, all those things or reproductive rights. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2678.04s)]
*  If you're on the wrong side of that from a European perspective, you know, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2682.84s)]
*  they're coming after you in a sense. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2685.8s)]
*  And so that's what JD Vance came after. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2687.08s)]
*  He turned the tables on them and focused on that. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2688.68s)]
*  And that was, A, it was completely unexpected. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2691.72s)]
*  B, I think, you know, the reality of it, the fact that it's truthful, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2694.44s)]
*  I think upset a lot of them. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2698.04s)]
*  He is truthful and it also appeals to their citizens. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2699.32s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2702.68s)]
*  The citizens say this is the way we want our government to talk. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2703.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2706.92s)]
*  And I think it's funny because a lot of people on, you know, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2707.4s)]
*  there's a lot of people on social media right now are going, oh my God, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2710.6s)]
*  you don't realize how hated, you know, you are now as Americans and the US is so hated. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2713.08s)]
*  Now, I think, look, I spent most of my time overseas, right? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2717.7200000000003s)]
*  And most people are going, yes, it seems like it's common sense. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2720.84s)]
*  You guys are finally coming around. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2723.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2725.88s)]
*  And so I don't think they're going to win the argument that somehow the US is more hated. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2726.2000000000003s)]
*  Look, we've been hated in a variety of locations. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2730.92s)]
*  But we definitely are hated in Canada right now. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2732.52s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2734.44s)]
*  Is that a hockey game? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2734.92s)]
*  See, we're booing the national anthem so hard. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2737.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2739.7200000000003s)]
*  They get in three fights in the first nine minutes. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2740.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2742.6800000000003s)]
*  And then we kick Canada's ass, sorry, Canada, in Canada, which is not good because that's [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2743.2400000000002s)]
*  their fucking sport. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2748.36s)]
*  That's basically their only shot at beating us at anything. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2749.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2751.64s)]
*  Well, curling. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2751.96s)]
*  Curling. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2753.08s)]
*  They might be able to win at that. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2753.56s)]
*  If we practice it, we'd be better at that too. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2754.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2756.52s)]
*  Like they make great mixed martial arts fighters. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2757.08s)]
*  One of the greatest of all time, George C. and Piers from Canada. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2759.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2761.96s)]
*  But after that, let me think. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2762.28s)]
*  Get your football team. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2765.08s)]
*  Come fuck with America. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2766.12s)]
*  I'm trying to think of other things that I could throw out there. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2767.72s)]
*  Yeah, maybe baseball. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2769.72s)]
*  They got, Blue Jays are really good. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2770.92s)]
*  Molson. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2772.52s)]
*  Yeah, they have strong beer. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2773.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they've got good beer. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2775.0s)]
*  They have great people. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2775.16s)]
*  I love Canada. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2776.12s)]
*  I love the people. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2776.92s)]
*  Likewise, yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2777.24s)]
*  It's just they're too nice and they let communists run their country. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2778.04s)]
*  And that guy's a communist. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2781.96s)]
*  Well, it is one of those moments where you think, OK, I understand. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2783.64s)]
*  I get your point. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2788.36s)]
*  You know, the talk about turning Canada into a 51st state. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2789.16s)]
*  That's a little crazy. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2791.48s)]
*  That's a little crazy. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2792.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a little crazy. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2793.4s)]
*  He's serious. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2794.44s)]
*  He told me on the phone he was serious. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2795.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2797.24s)]
*  Well, first I was joking around, but then I was thinking maybe it's not a bad idea. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2797.56s)]
*  Now I think he keeps talking to him, refers to him as Governor Trudeau. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2802.4399999999996s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2805.72s)]
*  You know what I love is I was just out of the Middle East for some things, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2807.16s)]
*  including the amazing trek with the guys from the SF club. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2811.7999999999997s)]
*  And it was right during the period of time when President Trump announced his idea [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2816.2s)]
*  during that press conference with Netanyahu about, look, we're going to own the US is going to own [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2822.76s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2828.84s)]
*  Did you see a look on Netanyahu's face when he was saying that? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, which was priceless. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2831.48s)]
*  What in the fuck did I get into? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2832.84s)]
*  And now you know what they're all doing? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2835.7200000000003s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet is fully on board with the idea, in part because I think they understand [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2836.76s)]
*  that, OK, look, this is probably not going to happen. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2842.0400000000004s)]
*  But if we take this position, it's going to create chaos. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2843.6400000000003s)]
*  It's going to create some movement. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2848.6000000000004s)]
*  Maybe that leads to something of interest. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2850.44s)]
*  And I think when being out in the Middle East, when that idea came out and hearing some of [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2852.7599999999998s)]
*  the responses from people out there was amazing. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2857.16s)]
*  But what I like about it, look, you're not going to move 2.3 million Palestinians out of Gaza, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2860.2s)]
*  right? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2866.2s)]
*  Because none of the Arab states want them. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2866.44s)]
*  Egyptians have fought against this idea for years and years and years. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2869.4s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2873.16s)]
*  And some maybe a lot of people aren't aware of is that the wall on the side of Egypt is [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2874.04s)]
*  way bigger than the wall on the side of Israel. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2879.48s)]
*  That is an impenetrable wall that's heavily guarded. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2882.2000000000003s)]
*  They do not want Palestinians coming into Egypt, which is kind of crazy. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2884.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2888.36s)]
*  Well, from their perspective, look, it's a security issue. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2888.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of Palestinian refugees in Jordan, so it's not like Jordan hasn't [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2891.2400000000002s)]
*  tried to do their part. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2895.48s)]
*  But they also, what are they going to do? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2897.4s)]
*  Absorb another million, 2 million Palestinians? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2899.08s)]
*  No. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2901.32s)]
*  So the problem from an operational perspective is it's unlikely to happen, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2901.8s)]
*  And also, do you really want the US buying and owning Gaza, right? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2909.64s)]
*  And then being out there, you think that the cost of supporting Ukraine is high. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2914.2799999999997s)]
*  Wait till you see what the cost of not only the reconstruction, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2919.3199999999997s)]
*  but the security of the reconstruction, right? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2922.92s)]
*  What that's going to mean. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2926.3599999999997s)]
*  You think there was a boon in private security contractors during the Iraq incursions? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2927.56s)]
*  This will make that look like nothing. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2933.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2934.44s)]
*  Because they've got to guard their investments. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2934.92s)]
*  So exactly. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2936.2s)]
*  So the costs involved, the potential for just never ending trouble. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2937.0s)]
*  But what I do like about it is, look, now the Arab states are responding by having a summit, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2942.04s)]
*  right? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2951.56s)]
*  They're having a summit at the end of this month, and they've already been having little [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2951.72s)]
*  mini discussions amongst themselves, but all the key players in the area are now meeting [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2955.32s)]
*  to discuss what's an alternative, right? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2959.96s)]
*  What is the way to make this happen? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2962.84s)]
*  And it's not going to be by the US owning it and building the Riviera, right? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2965.08s)]
*  Or a series of casinos. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2969.96s)]
*  But the Arab states are having to react. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2971.72s)]
*  And so what that means is nothing's worked beforehand, right? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2976.12s)]
*  Nothing in terms of two state option, other security agreements, peace agreements that [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2979.32s)]
*  have held for some period of time and then fallen apart. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2984.6s)]
*  None of that shit's worked. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2987.4s)]
*  So I think the disruptive aspect of sometimes of what Trump does, even though you may look [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2989.16s)]
*  at the idea on the surface and go, it's not going to work, you have these other effects, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=2995.64s)]
*  right? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3000.04s)]
*  And so now you've got the Arab states having to respond, coming up with these ideas. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3000.36s)]
*  They're already, over the past couple of days, saying, well, Hamas can't play a role. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3004.44s)]
*  If you had said that a year ago, Egypt and Qatar and some of these other Arab states [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3009.7999999999997s)]
*  out there would have gotten on board with the idea that Hamas has got to go, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3014.6s)]
*  that wouldn't have happened, right? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3018.52s)]
*  I mean, before the 7 October attacks. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3019.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3021.96s)]
*  They're also talking about rebuilding it themselves. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3025.0800000000004s)]
*  They're like, we'll do it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3025.5600000000004s)]
*  We'll do it. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3026.84s)]
*  Just back off. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3027.48s)]
*  We'll do it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3028.36s)]
*  We'll take care of it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3028.84s)]
*  Which is great. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3029.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's when they have to say Hamas can't be a part of it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3030.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3033.0800000000004s)]
*  Because they know what the problem is. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3033.8s)]
*  And they haven't been willing to admit it before. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3035.1600000000003s)]
*  But because the Trump administration just thrown stuff at the wall to see what sticks, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3037.32s)]
*  they've got to respond. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3043.2400000000002s)]
*  And so now they're coming up with these ideas. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3044.2s)]
*  Look, Hamas, they are a shell of what they were. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3047.7999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3052.9199999999996s)]
*  But they're still supported by the Iranian regime, which is a big problem. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3053.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3056.3599999999997s)]
*  And the Iranian regime, do you think they don't want peace? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3057.0s)]
*  They don't want stability. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3060.9199999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3061.96s)]
*  That's not in the books. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3062.7599999999998s)]
*  One of the benefits from their perspective of the 7 October attacks was that it completely [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3064.2s)]
*  scuttled the normalization talks that were going on between Saudi and Israel and the US [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3069.08s)]
*  at the time. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3075.08s)]
*  So they're going to continue to be a problem. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3075.64s)]
*  But Hamas is now kind of on its back foot. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3079.3199999999997s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority is saying, well, we'll come in and we'll govern Gaza. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, the Israelis are saying, no, no, that's not going to happen either because you guys are [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  peas in a pod. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3092.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3093.4s)]
*  You know, Palestinian Authority has a program where they actually pay the families of people [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3094.6800000000003s)]
*  who kill Israelis. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3099.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3101.4s)]
*  It's called the pay to slay program. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3103.2400000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3105.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3105.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3106.04s)]
*  That's what it's called? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3106.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3107.48s)]
*  Pay to slay. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3107.96s)]
*  How much do you get paid? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3108.84s)]
*  You know what? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3110.12s)]
*  I'm not sure what the going rate is now, but for out there, it's a payment, ongoing payments [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3110.36s)]
*  to families who have family members who have attacked, wounded or killed Israelis. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3119.4s)]
*  And so that plus other ties between Hamas and the PA. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3126.2000000000003s)]
*  And look, there's been animosity, obviously. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3131.32s)]
*  Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza years ago. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3132.84s)]
*  But the Israelis see it as the same. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3136.6s)]
*  And so my point being is the Arab states are now reacting and you could end up with something [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3139.56s)]
*  that actually works as opposed to all the bullshit in the past that never did work. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3145.88s)]
*  And it continued to provide nothing for the Palestinian people. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3150.04s)]
*  And if you say, look, all this is about is we want the Palestinians to live a better life, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3155.0s)]
*  then you should want new ideas thrown at the wall. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3160.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3162.84s)]
*  And you should want something that eventually is going to work. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3163.08s)]
*  And from a US perspective, you should want something where the Arab states actually take [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3165.6400000000003s)]
*  it on board themselves. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3168.84s)]
*  There's also a problem with the reality of the region at this point. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3170.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3174.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like, what do you want to happen to that area? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3175.08s)]
*  Because someone has to rebuild it. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3177.7200000000003s)]
*  Look, absolutely Israel shouldn't have done what they did and kill who knows how many [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3180.12s)]
*  innocent people and literally destroy most of the buildings there. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3185.7200000000003s)]
*  We all can agree that's a horrible thing, but it's done. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3189.88s)]
*  So now what? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3192.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3194.2000000000003s)]
*  And we can also agree that it was not. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3194.52s)]
*  Look, yeah, I agree. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3197.8s)]
*  It was a very aggressive action. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3199.88s)]
*  I would argue that the US would engage in that same aggressive action if we had had [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3201.88s)]
*  a proportionate attack. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3206.44s)]
*  From Mexico or something like that. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3208.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3210.04s)]
*  Or Canada. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3210.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3211.6400000000003s)]
*  Goddamn Canadians. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3212.76s)]
*  They're plotting something. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3214.2000000000003s)]
*  I just know it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3215.2400000000002s)]
*  So that's true. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3215.88s)]
*  But again, it was a war that Hamas started. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3220.04s)]
*  I think you have to go back to the beginning of this one. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3223.1600000000003s)]
*  And yes, there's fault on both sides, of course. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3225.6400000000003s)]
*  But Hamas now at times has been acting like the aggrieved party. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3228.68s)]
*  It's fuck around and find out in the worst way possible. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3233.56s)]
*  They gave Israel the green light to just go ham. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3238.2s)]
*  And now when you see the overhead drone footage of what Gaza looks like now, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3241.56s)]
*  it's hard to even believe that it's real. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3246.52s)]
*  Everything's gone. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3249.16s)]
*  I get it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3250.9199999999996s)]
*  From a real estate developer's perspective, I'm sure he's seen overhead imagery. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3251.72s)]
*  Turn it into the Mediterranean, the Middle East. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3255.4s)]
*  This looks like a demolition site. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3258.36s)]
*  So let's clear it out. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3259.7200000000003s)]
*  The real question is if that doesn't... [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3261.0s)]
*  Okay, then what? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3263.1600000000003s)]
*  If you don't want that to happen, then what? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3264.6800000000003s)]
*  If the United States doesn't take it over or who should? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3267.0s)]
*  And what do you do with it? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3270.6800000000003s)]
*  And how do you get the money to rebuild it? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3271.88s)]
*  And where does it come from? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3273.7200000000003s)]
*  And how do you do it? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3275.0s)]
*  Who do you bring in to rebuild it? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3276.76s)]
*  Who governs it? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3278.92s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3279.88s)]
*  Who gets what building? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3281.32s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3282.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3283.16s)]
*  It's a very complicated thing when you destroy an entire fucking city. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3284.3599999999997s)]
*  See if you can find some of that overhead footage. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3289.3999999999996s)]
*  When you're talking about moving out 2.3 million people to other areas. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3292.12s)]
*  But look, I think, again, the answer is that the Arab states have to take this on. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3296.3599999999997s)]
*  They finally have to address this issue. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3301.7999999999997s)]
*  Some of them have used the Palestinian issue to their own devices [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3304.3599999999997s)]
*  without doing anything to their benefit of the Palestinians. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3308.12s)]
*  Look at this footage. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3310.44s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3312.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, this looks like they got hit with an asteroid. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3314.84s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3317.88s)]
*  The scope of it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3319.8s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3321.56s)]
*  It's insane to see. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3323.32s)]
*  Dave Smith had a very good take on this. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3326.84s)]
*  He was on one of those Piers Morgan, everybody yells at everybody panels, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3329.32s)]
*  which are really fun for about five minutes. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3333.32s)]
*  But let me send Jamie what Dave said, because Dave had, in my opinion, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3335.32s)]
*  the best take on this. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3340.68s)]
*  Where it's like you see, you're like, OK, yeah, that's correct. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3342.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the way to look at it, I think. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3348.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3351.64s)]
*  Because it's like, yeah. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3351.8799999999997s)]
*  It's, look, again, I think unless, I don't know who would be on board. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3354.12s)]
*  Take it from beyond this sort of the initial sentence of the US will take ownership. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3362.04s)]
*  I'm guessing. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3368.6s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3368.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm guessing if this is it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3369.48s)]
*  I don't know if I. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3370.28s)]
*  Is that Dean Cain on the right? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3371.48s)]
*  No. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3373.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3374.44s)]
*  It is? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3375.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3376.04s)]
*  Superman. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3376.52s)]
*  I don't know if this is the right rant. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3376.92s)]
*  I just didn't click it for me. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3378.2000000000003s)]
*  I'll click the one you sent. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3379.2400000000002s)]
*  If you just. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3380.28s)]
*  Yeah, click the one I sent. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3380.76s)]
*  It might be. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3382.6s)]
*  It's probably the same one. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3383.0s)]
*  Sometimes I love these Piers Morgan panels. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3387.2400000000002s)]
*  You never know who you're going to show up in one of those boxes. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3388.84s)]
*  And it's a bizarre mix of people. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3392.92s)]
*  OK. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3397.8s)]
*  Yeah, same one. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3400.36s)]
*  It's just like the commentary for Wimbledon where we just don't say anything. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3401.08s)]
*  Pictures of Gaza. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3404.92s)]
*  Are you telling me there was Hamas, there were Hamas missiles in every single one of those [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3406.36s)]
*  buildings that that's the entirety of the story is that Israel just had to blow up this building, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3410.44s)]
*  which by the way, still I don't think would be morally justified. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3414.92s)]
*  But like, come on, man. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3417.7200000000003s)]
*  It's just, again, even to Dean's point, I always find this fascinating because somehow [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3419.96s)]
*  Americans could say this about the people in Hamas and go like, you know, like you said, yeah, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3423.64s)]
*  I wouldn't like to be kicked out of my neighborhood. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3428.36s)]
*  But if my if my government had done October 7th, I'd accept it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3430.04s)]
*  Your government, Dean, destroyed Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3434.6s)]
*  the drone bombing campaign in Pakistan. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3441.8s)]
*  So like, what are can you get kicked out of your house now? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3443.96s)]
*  Is it not ethnic cleansing if we were to kick you out of your neighborhood? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3446.28s)]
*  This is so ridiculous that we impose these standards on these poor people [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3449.32s)]
*  that we would never dream of holding ourselves to that standard. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3454.28s)]
*  It's just it logically makes absolutely no sense. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3457.88s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter what Hamas's approval rating is in the same way that it doesn't matter [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3460.52s)]
*  that George W. Bush had record high approval ratings. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3465.1600000000003s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the innocent civilians in the United States of America are fair game. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3467.8s)]
*  And neither should any other group of civilians. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3472.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3474.04s)]
*  Perfectly said. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3475.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3476.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3476.84s)]
*  No, I mean, look, if you could do surgical strikes and do nothing but kill Hamas terrorists. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3477.08s)]
*  Great. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3481.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3482.52s)]
*  But, you know, that's not the real world. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3484.36s)]
*  Dave's talking about a world that we don't exist in. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3487.72s)]
*  I would argue. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3489.88s)]
*  This is where we would differ. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3491.0s)]
*  I like Dave Smith a lot and I think he's incredibly intelligent. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3492.04s)]
*  But, you know, we fundamentally look at things sometimes [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3496.2s)]
*  in a different worldview because of our experiences. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3500.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3503.48s)]
*  And my experience has been dealing with a lot of hostile actors who, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3504.12s)]
*  you know, you may look at and think, okay, well, can't we just, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3509.16s)]
*  I don't say we'll get along, but they exist and we exist and do we really? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3511.88s)]
*  There, that's not the world we work in. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3517.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3519.16s)]
*  And urban combat is really ugly. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3519.48s)]
*  It's not dismissing, you know, the horrific nature of it and the fact that, yeah, sure, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3521.72s)]
*  in a perfect world, it's morally repugnant. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3525.96s)]
*  And it is, you know, but it's the world that we live in. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3527.96s)]
*  So I think, okay, on one hand, I get what he's saying and I don't disagree [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3531.08s)]
*  on that moral side of things. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3536.04s)]
*  But, you know, from my background, I don't tend to live in that world. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3537.88s)]
*  I tend to live in sort of the operational side of things. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3541.4s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes you have to do things that are not good. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3543.72s)]
*  But even as extreme as that? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3547.56s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3549.72s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3550.68s)]
*  It's like it's so extreme. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3551.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3552.8399999999997s)]
*  And I don't disagree. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3554.2s)]
*  And they have, they went above and beyond. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3555.48s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3558.68s)]
*  But to my point, and I think to kind of what he was saying, look, we, you know, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3561.16s)]
*  we did after 9-11, right? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3565.8799999999997s)]
*  And we went above and beyond from a proportionate standpoint. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3567.64s)]
*  And we felt certainly justified in doing it. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3571.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3573.8s)]
*  We did. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3574.04s)]
*  I mean, we did. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3574.28s)]
*  America finally came together as a group, right? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3575.08s)]
*  As opposed to sort of the partisan way that we live now. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3577.2400000000002s)]
*  But but we were justified based on a lie, which is even crazy because they used that [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3580.36s)]
*  justification and went after a group of people that had nothing to do with it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3585.32s)]
*  Based on a lie of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3589.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3591.64s)]
*  Which is even crazier, right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3591.88s)]
*  We went to a completely different country. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3593.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3594.76s)]
*  Well, I think Hamas also, you know, these are disjointed statements and I'm not really [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3595.08s)]
*  tying it all together very well at all. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3600.6s)]
*  But but, you know, there's also this element that Hamas doesn't give a shit about the [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3602.04s)]
*  Palestinian citizens, right? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3607.4s)]
*  The civilians, I mean. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3608.52s)]
*  And, you know, if they did, they wouldn't conduct their operations. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3610.04s)]
*  Their methodology would be different, right? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3614.92s)]
*  They wouldn't they wouldn't bury themselves in their operations and their command centers [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3616.6s)]
*  and everything that they do, right? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3620.2799999999997s)]
*  Their their depots, their missile weapons supply centers within the public environment. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3622.44s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3629.3199999999997s)]
*  They just wouldn't. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3630.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3631.08s)]
*  Well, they probably never expected this. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3631.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3634.84s)]
*  I don't. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3635.7999999999997s)]
*  There's no way they would have done October 7th if they expected this response. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3636.12s)]
*  Well, there's no way that the Iranian regime, I think, would have allowed them to do this. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3640.04s)]
*  If they if they anticipated they would get this sort of response. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3643.72s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3646.84s)]
*  But, you know, and again, you know, this is this is the problem. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3649.08s)]
*  People that people only hear what they want to hear. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3652.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3654.2799999999997s)]
*  So they hear they hear me say from an operational perspective, I kind of I understand [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3654.44s)]
*  that they had an aggressive response and yet but then they stopped listening. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3658.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3662.12s)]
*  And so what I'm saying is it was it over the top? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3662.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, yes, it was over the top. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3664.4399999999996s)]
*  And could they have been more surgical about this? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3665.72s)]
*  Well, yes, they certainly could have. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3667.56s)]
*  Could they have prevented some loss of civilian life? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3669.64s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3672.6s)]
*  What would have that been a difficult? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3673.24s)]
*  Well, yes. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3674.68s)]
*  Why? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3675.3199999999997s)]
*  Because Hamas puts themselves in the center of civilian life there. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3675.64s)]
*  They know this is what's going to happen. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3678.68s)]
*  This is their currency. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3679.8799999999997s)]
*  Dead Palestinians. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3680.8399999999997s)]
*  That drives their narrative. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3682.3599999999997s)]
*  And they always know it's going to turn against the Israelis [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3683.96s)]
*  as we're having these discussions. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3687.24s)]
*  That's what happens. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3688.7599999999998s)]
*  And they've got enough of a track record to know that's what's going to happen. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3689.7999999999997s)]
*  So they use it to their advantage. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3692.4399999999996s)]
*  But, you know, again, it doesn't excuse the killing. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3693.7999999999997s)]
*  I keep coming back to that same thing. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3696.4399999999996s)]
*  You could have, you know, disparate multiple thoughts in your head at the same time. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3697.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3702.12s)]
*  You can feel bad about that. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3702.3599999999997s)]
*  And at the same time, you can go, yeah, it was fucked up what they did on 7 October. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3703.8799999999997s)]
*  You're going to go after Hamas. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3707.64s)]
*  And then what you're going to find is urban combat is really, really fucking ugly. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3709.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3713.8799999999997s)]
*  And you're going to have casualties that you really, really regret having. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3714.12s)]
*  Were there more than needed? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3718.52s)]
*  I would say yes. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3720.04s)]
*  They didn't need the extent of their response. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3721.0s)]
*  But I understand their mindset for why they went so hard after Hamas. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3724.04s)]
*  This is decades and decades, you know, built up saying no more. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3728.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3733.0s)]
*  We can't put up with this anymore. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3733.16s)]
*  Now, again, the problem is, you know, the problem is not that it's not really Hamas. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3734.7599999999998s)]
*  I keep coming back to the same thing. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3741.0s)]
*  The problem is the instigator of all this trouble, the instigator of the vast majority [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3742.12s)]
*  of chaos and instability and violence and death in that region is the Iranian regime. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3746.2s)]
*  Most Arab states will agree to that. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3752.52s)]
*  Maybe not the Yemenis. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3753.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3755.4s)]
*  But most of those Arab states are not going to be sad to see the Iranian regime fall for [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3757.3199999999997s)]
*  this very reason. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3763.16s)]
*  Everybody wants a better life. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3764.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3766.2s)]
*  However they perceive it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3766.3599999999997s)]
*  The Iranian regime, you know, the mullahs and the IRGC, you know, they've got a stated [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3768.12s)]
*  objective and they are pursuing that. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3773.0s)]
*  As long as those people are in charge, right, you know, ultimately we're not going to get [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3775.48s)]
*  a big sea change here. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3781.1600000000003s)]
*  We're not going to get a huge shift in the way things go. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3782.52s)]
*  But if you want a better life, then you got to look to the whatever you want to call it, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3784.92s)]
*  the head of the snake or the, you know, the top of the mountain. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3788.6800000000003s)]
*  There they are. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3791.4s)]
*  The Iranian regime driving a lot of this chaos. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3791.96s)]
*  So anyway, I'm getting away from the point but I don't disagree with Dave. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3794.52s)]
*  I always like a lot of the things that he says. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3797.88s)]
*  I just think that we come at it sometimes from a much different perspective. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3799.88s)]
*  I don't tend to believe that the world is full of good actors who are just trying to [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3804.28s)]
*  create a community of nations. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3810.04s)]
*  I don't think that's his perspective either. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3810.84s)]
*  I don't, well, yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3812.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not putting it well but I think what I mean is that there's, it's not, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3815.08s)]
*  I was having a conversation the other day and it was about, it was about US involvement in [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3821.4s)]
*  a variety of groups, activities, associations over the years looking to topple governments, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3830.36s)]
*  looking to change, you know, the direction of a government, you know, all the nefarious [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3836.28s)]
*  things that the CIA has been accused of over the years. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3843.4s)]
*  And I was like, well, god damn, what did you expect? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3846.6800000000003s)]
*  Of course that's what we're doing, right? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3851.6400000000003s)]
*  Of course we're trying to influence hearts and minds. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3853.48s)]
*  Of course we're infiltrating organizations to try to influence the direction of a government [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3856.04s)]
*  that, you know, you go all the way back to the Cold War, right? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3859.7200000000003s)]
*  We were convinced the Russians or the Soviets were going to blow us to hell, right? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3862.36s)]
*  Of course we're going to be doing a variety of things. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3867.2400000000002s)]
*  You want a government over there that's more friendly to you? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3869.32s)]
*  Okay, how are we going to go about doing that, right? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3871.1600000000003s)]
*  If that means VOA or Voice of America or that means infiltrating some organization [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3873.08s)]
*  that's going to try to win them. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3877.4s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, is that morally repugnant? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3878.36s)]
*  I don't know, you know. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3881.4s)]
*  You think it's necessary? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3883.16s)]
*  I think there's a, I think it's understandable. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3884.36s)]
*  And I think also. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3888.2799999999997s)]
*  So imagine a world without that. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3890.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3892.92s)]
*  So if that is a vacuum and we stop doing that entirely altogether, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3893.24s)]
*  does that vacuum get filled up by another power? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3899.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3902.12s)]
*  This is the problem, right? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3903.88s)]
*  That's the problem is that we don't live in a world of benign nations who, like, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3904.84s)]
*  if we're not the police, you know, at the top of the food chain, nobody needs to be there. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3908.68s)]
*  Someone's going to fill that gap. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3913.4s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3915.4s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong, but I've been around a long time and I've spent most of it overseas in [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3919.0s)]
*  unusual places. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3924.04s)]
*  We make a lot of mistakes as a country. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3926.2s)]
*  It's a human endeavor. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3927.7999999999997s)]
*  But we do try to correct and it can take time, right? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3929.24s)]
*  It can take a lot of time. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3932.6s)]
*  We make a lot of mistakes. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3933.48s)]
*  Of course we do. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3934.44s)]
*  But I've seen a lot of players out there and I'd rather have us and our allies [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3935.48s)]
*  trying to direct traffic rather than some of the hostile actors that are out there. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3943.24s)]
*  Because this is the best case scenario perspective. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3946.68s)]
*  Worst case scenario perspective is that these policy changes that we are initiating and [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3949.64s)]
*  that we are influencing is for corporations to make more money. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3956.36s)]
*  It's to control resources and to control areas and to make things friendlier for business. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3961.56s)]
*  That's the worst case scenario is this is done in a mercenary fashion. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3967.24s)]
*  But is that- [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3972.36s)]
*  But that's what- [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3973.24s)]
*  I mean, that's what- [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3973.72s)]
*  But is that just- [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3974.12s)]
*  A Chinese regime? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3974.52s)]
*  Sure, right. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3975.4s)]
*  That's what- [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3975.7999999999997s)]
*  And I would argue, yeah. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3976.36s)]
*  Here's my question. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3977.16s)]
*  Is that just what happens? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3977.72s)]
*  Like, when you do have the ability to control other regimes, isn't it almost logical that [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3979.64s)]
*  you're going to need a lot of money and you're going to need a lot of influence to do that? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3991.56s)]
*  And so there's going to be a bunch of people that say, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3994.68s)]
*  actually, we could use some of those minerals. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3996.12s)]
*  Actually, that natural gas is very valuable. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=3999.24s)]
*  Actually, if we could destabilize Russia's energy systems and pump up Ukraine's and control it, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4002.52s)]
*  that'd be pretty good. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4009.48s)]
*  And so then we start initiating things and we start the coup in Ukraine in 2014 and a [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4010.68s)]
*  bunch of different things. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4017.48s)]
*  We start helping things along that would benefit us both geopolitically, but also geopolitically [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4018.2s)]
*  in the sense that you're controlling the geology of the land, which is the real term geopolitical, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4025.72s)]
*  right? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4029.72s)]
*  That's the real term, right? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4030.2799999999997s)]
*  Doesn't it have to do with controlling regions? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4031.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, sure. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4035.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4035.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that it's- [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4035.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're talking about national self-interest. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4037.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4040.2s)]
*  I think in the world that we actually live in, every country is acting in its own self-interest. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4041.56s)]
*  Then it's also national self-interest that's kind of prostituted by corporations. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4047.8799999999997s)]
*  This is what people are worried about, is that we engage in certain activity that's avoidable [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4054.68s)]
*  simply for profit. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4060.12s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4063.4s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt about that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4064.68s)]
*  I think, look- [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4065.96s)]
*  Which is what happens when you have a system like this, right? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4067.56s)]
*  When you can influence foreign governments and you do have enormous amounts of resources [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4069.96s)]
*  and you do have the ability to change things and install a government that's more friendly to- [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4075.48s)]
*  But if you're not going to do that, let me go back to the- [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4081.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4085.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll go to the Cold War because that's probably our best example of what happens when you get- [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4085.32s)]
*  Because you actually had, it wasn't just a unipolar world, right? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4089.0s)]
*  You had the Soviets and you had the US. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4091.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes, there was concern over life itself. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4097.08s)]
*  There was this concern over mutual destruction, but there was concern over influence. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4103.96s)]
*  The Soviets were busy in a variety of places. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4110.599999999999s)]
*  Let's pick Africa. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4113.799999999999s)]
*  In the mid to late 50s, as Africa was moving clearly, strongly away from colonialism, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4116.36s)]
*  and independent states started sprouting up, then there was this concern. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4125.96s)]
*  Okay, the old colonial era is gone. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4134.12s)]
*  The Belgians aren't going to own the Congo, as an example. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4136.679999999999s)]
*  The Congo is rich in resources. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4140.04s)]
*  Uranium, cobalt, diamonds, obviously, but let's take uranium. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4145.16s)]
*  The Belgians were running Congo when we were developing the bomb. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4152.44s)]
*  Almost all that uranium came from the Congo. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4158.599999999999s)]
*  So that's a good example of the US looking and saying, okay, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4161.96s)]
*  are the Belgians good stewards of the Congo? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4168.52s)]
*  Well, no. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4174.28s)]
*  They were enslaving people and having them work in the uranium mines. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4175.08s)]
*  We were taking that uranium and using it to build the bomb, the Manhattan Project. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4178.92s)]
*  Now, all those years later, the Congo realized its independence. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4185.16s)]
*  Patrice Lumumba and all the rest of that history. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4190.04s)]
*  But now, the Congo is wrapped up in conflict still. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4192.04s)]
*  Why is it still in conflict? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4196.52s)]
*  Because of its minerals. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4197.64s)]
*  Cobalt now is the key. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4199.4s)]
*  Uranium you can get from a variety of places, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4201.4s)]
*  Australia and elsewhere, Kazakhstan and a variety of other locations. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4203.16s)]
*  But cobalt, they've got maybe 60%. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4206.52s)]
*  Don't quote me on that, but I think it's about that of the world's cobalt supplies. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4211.64s)]
*  What do you need cobalt for? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4215.16s)]
*  Well, electric vehicles, batteries. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4216.52s)]
*  Now, the Eastern Congo is still in conflict. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4220.36s)]
*  That place is a mess. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4222.44s)]
*  If it's not the poorest, it's like the second or third poorest country in the world. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4225.08s)]
*  And isn't most of those mines controlled by China? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4228.52s)]
*  Well, a lot of them are controlled on the eastern side by militias. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4232.44s)]
*  Congo's been a difficult place for everybody to try to wrap up licensing agreements. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4236.44s)]
*  You've got 100 plus militias out there vying for control because it's money. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4242.92s)]
*  And so I guess my point is, it's good you brought up China because yes, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4248.44s)]
*  they've been busy trying to lock up a variety of locations in terms of critical minerals. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4254.68s)]
*  And they've got a monopoly on refining those minerals essentially at this point in time. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4258.92s)]
*  But I just think it's... [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4263.32s)]
*  Maybe what I'm surprised by, because I'm so fucking cynical, is the idea when you say [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4269.48s)]
*  corporate interests, it's government interests, it's self-interest of a nation [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4278.12s)]
*  to pursue and do these things, I'll be honest with you. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4282.92s)]
*  I look at it and go, well, yeah, of course it is. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4287.0s)]
*  I don't know any other world. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4290.44s)]
*  I don't know that we're not going to walk that dog back over a couple thousand years. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4291.96s)]
*  People have been doing the same fucking thing, all human existence, I would argue. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4297.0s)]
*  So I just got to look at it. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4300.92s)]
*  Maybe because I'm not wired that way, I don't sit around and go, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4304.44s)]
*  that's fucking wrong, we have to rail against this. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4307.16s)]
*  I'm a very simple person, so I look at it and go, yeah, that's how it works. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4310.84s)]
*  And goddamn right, I'd rather be on the top of the heap than not. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4314.68s)]
*  So this is like a pragmatic perspective based on your experience overseas [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4322.2s)]
*  and your understanding of how these things are done is that if we don't do something, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4327.96s)]
*  if we don't act in some way to influence these governments and control these regions [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4333.24s)]
*  and do whatever we can to make sure that our interests are being, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4338.679999999999s)]
*  that we are the ones that are kind of directing the way things go. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4345.88s)]
*  I would rather be directing how things are going than not. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4350.599999999999s)]
*  And those are the two options. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4354.92s)]
*  And I think those are the two options because we're not going to live as a community of nations. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4356.04s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4359.0s)]
*  Hold hands and say, okay, everybody's going to live as a collective. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4360.200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure there's all sorts of flaws in the way that I'm thinking, but [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4371.240000000001s)]
*  I'm a very simple person. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4375.56s)]
*  When I was in operations, you tell me what to do, I'll do it. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4376.6s)]
*  I never sat around and got angsty about anything because I just didn't see any point in it. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4379.240000000001s)]
*  Again, pragmatic. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4386.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, or just being a douchebag. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4388.2s)]
*  There's a lot of people listening to probably come to that conclusion. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4391.0s)]
*  Yes, I think you're right. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4393.4s)]
*  This is the reality of that job, right? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4395.879999999999s)]
*  And this is the reality of international relations. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4398.599999999999s)]
*  And look, I'll tell you something. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4404.28s)]
*  Look, there are people over the years, I think the CIA leadership at times, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4405.799999999999s)]
*  over the years, I'm talking all the way back to World War II and beyond, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4411.16s)]
*  certainly during the Cold War. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4416.04s)]
*  Alan Dallas is a good example of that where they legitimately would sit around and say, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4417.96s)]
*  well, as far as I know, we're not in the business of overthrowing countries. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4422.28s)]
*  And you think like, well, that's bullshit. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4427.56s)]
*  Of course, that's what we're trying to do. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4429.88s)]
*  We're trying to influence countries because we want them on our side. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4433.16s)]
*  We want to create friendly governments that, yes, will be beneficial to our national security, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4435.96s)]
*  our economic interests, all those things. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4441.64s)]
*  So I've always been puzzled also by people who try to minimize that in a sense, right? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4444.04s)]
*  I mean, if you're doing something, then goddamn it, maybe you own up to it. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4448.76s)]
*  It's like John Brennan, who was a director at the agency, right? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4452.44s)]
*  He's a relatively well-known former CIA official for a handful of reasons. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4456.6s)]
*  He was very tight in the Obama administration. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4461.16s)]
*  But he said one time, I forget what year it was, but anyway, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4464.44s)]
*  he talked about the business of the CIA and says, we don't steal secrets. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4467.4s)]
*  God damn it, of course we steal secrets. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4471.64s)]
*  That's the point of the exercise, right? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4473.64s)]
*  You think the FSB or the Chinese intel apparatus isn't stealing secrets? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4475.72s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4480.04s)]
*  Why was he saying that? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4481.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, it's a kind of generalization, right? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4481.96s)]
*  He's trying to like sugarcoat. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4485.240000000001s)]
*  That was a laughable statement, right? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4488.76s)]
*  Why would you say something that's objectively true? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4490.76s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4493.400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, because again, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4494.12s)]
*  Or objectively false, I should say. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4495.4800000000005s)]
*  Maybe it's the world you want to live in, you know, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4497.320000000001s)]
*  instead of the one that we actually do have. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4499.160000000001s)]
*  Right, but when you're doing it publicly, that's not what you're doing. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4500.76s)]
*  It's a PR exercise. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4503.16s)]
*  It's a PR exercise. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4504.28s)]
*  You're kind of pretending that we're different than what we are. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4505.0s)]
*  Yeah, or you're trying to convince yourself, who knows? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4507.88s)]
*  I don't understand the thinking. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4512.12s)]
*  I just know what he said, but I think it's an interesting comment [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4513.32s)]
*  from the director of an intelligence organization [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4517.16s)]
*  that is in the business of stealing secrets. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4520.44s)]
*  So I'm sure you've seen Mike Benz take on USAID and what USAID was really all about. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4524.12s)]
*  His perspective is that it's for everything that's too dirty for the CIA. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4530.759999999999s)]
*  He's sending USAID. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4534.44s)]
*  Do you think there can be a rational argument, though, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4536.759999999999s)]
*  that a lot of these things that seem ridiculous, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4540.36s)]
*  like sending all this money to influence the votes in Pakistan or in India, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4542.599999999999s)]
*  and then we look at it like, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4547.48s)]
*  why are we spending $21 million on education here and $2 million there? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4548.44s)]
*  And that these things are actually beneficial to the United States as a whole, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4553.48s)]
*  because even though we're spending exorbitant amounts of money, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4558.36s)]
*  the results we're getting is we are maintaining peace by being in control of certain areas where [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4561.32s)]
*  someone else would come over, and then you'd get a regime that's not friendly to our interests. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4569.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look, USAID traditionally, they were set up during the Kennedy administration [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4574.36s)]
*  as an independent organization, because at the time, I think that the thinking was, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4582.36s)]
*  and they're not the only one that's set up as an independent agency, but at the time, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4586.84s)]
*  the thinking was we don't want it to be seen as like the US administration is picking and choosing [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4590.28s)]
*  and driving where the money's going, which again, is kind of a strange way of doing things. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4595.96s)]
*  It's coming from the fucking US government. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4604.6s)]
*  People aren't going to parse words or discern somehow that, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4607.4800000000005s)]
*  okay, well, it's an independent agency, so I guess it's not really what the administration wants. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4610.52s)]
*  It's what the USAID wants. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4613.96s)]
*  Is it ... Were dollars going into programs that the idea was, can we turn this country around? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4615.639999999999s)]
*  Can we change? Who's in charge? Is it Lumumba? Is it Sukarno? Is it ... God, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4626.36s)]
*  pick any number of folks during that period of time and create a government that's more [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4632.92s)]
*  friendly to our interests? Again, I look at that and go, well, yeah. Is USAID also projecting [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4639.0s)]
*  whatever they call it, soft power, diplomatic power? Well, sure. That's another way of phrasing [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4645.08s)]
*  it, I suppose. Were they also doing things like feeding the poor, providing medicines out there, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4650.36s)]
*  doing actually legitimate things that I think sometimes people in a righteous world are like, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4656.76s)]
*  well, that's exactly what they should be doing. Well, yeah, they should be doing that. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4661.48s)]
*  The USAID's got a lot of important programs that they run that actually help people around the [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4665.24s)]
*  world who don't have many options. I think what the perspective of this administration as state [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4671.4s)]
*  it is that they're going to review all these programs and keep the useful ones. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4678.2s)]
*  Yes. And I think they're going to run it through the State Department, right? Is that the idea? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4681.96s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to slim it down. They've already started. It'll be run through the State [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4685.08s)]
*  Department. Great idea. Take off that ... Don't pretend. It's a US government agency that people [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4688.36s)]
*  are going to assume ... Some people will assume the worst no matter what, right? But yeah, fine. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4697.08s)]
*  Again, under the same theory that what you do is you go in and you say, we're going to go through [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4702.12s)]
*  every program. We're going to keep the ones that are important. And I would argue that's food aid, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4706.2s)]
*  health aid, whatever it may be. And shit can, all those others that are being really helpful. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4712.2s)]
*  You mean like the $251 million on transgender animal studies? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4721.32s)]
*  Yeah. Is that helpful or not? I don't know. Well, they have to figure out how to do those [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4726.2s)]
*  operations. Yeah. No, I think ... Yeah. So is there waste in there? Of course there's waste. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4730.679999999999s)]
*  And are there programs in there that were designed to ... [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4736.679999999999s)]
*  So it's the baby with the bath water? Is that what it is? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4739.24s)]
*  Yeah. That's the point is I think going in there and calling it all waste and fraud [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4741.4s)]
*  and a criminal organization I think is not the right messaging. I think that the American public [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4746.679999999999s)]
*  would be fully on board if you simply said, again, we're going through, we're going to find [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4752.12s)]
*  the waste, we're going to focus on those programs that help people around the world legitimately. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4756.76s)]
*  I think the problem is the people that are opposed to this administration are never going to see the [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4763.8s)]
*  good in anything that comes out, even if it does uncover undeniable fraud. I think we're just so [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4768.599999999999s)]
*  dug in now, especially the fog of war post-election, which seems real in this country. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4775.08s)]
*  This fog of hate on both sides, gloating on the right and bitterness and anger and hyperbole [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4781.5599999999995s)]
*  as to the extent of what's happening on the left. It's all a constitutional crisis and a [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4790.84s)]
*  destruction of democracy and a real dictator that's in place and all the things that they [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4797.8s)]
*  feared coming into this election now have come to light in their eyes. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4802.84s)]
*  Again, yeah, and that is the messaging that's gone out. You can see them coalesce around it. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4807.96s)]
*  I think the first weeks after the election, there was confusion and they were going through that [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4812.68s)]
*  grief cycle on the left, but now I think you're seeing that they are coming together on that [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4819.24s)]
*  messaging. I think now they're starting to get more focused. They probably understand they'll [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4824.28s)]
*  probably take the house in two years, so they're getting their shit together again. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4828.04s)]
*  On the right side, I think you'd like to think that the gloating is a bit unnecessary. You, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4836.28s)]
*  one, focus on getting shit done now. Not only is it not necessary, it's counterproductive. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4842.5199999999995s)]
*  It's counterproductive, yeah. It just fuels the other side. It's stupid. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4846.84s)]
*  It's like this should be a uniting time for our country. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4851.08s)]
*  Again, you would think that creating a more efficient government would be a uniting concept. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4855.0s)]
*  I think it could be, but I keep going back to that same thing. I've never been particularly [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4862.92s)]
*  impressed with the messaging and I get it. When I say that, people always on the right come after [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4868.04s)]
*  me and go, oh, God, well, that's what makes maga-maga. That's what makes Trump Trump. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4871.8s)]
*  I don't disagree with, again, the benefits sometimes of being disruptive, but I do think [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4878.28s)]
*  that you can't just look at USAID and say it's a big old criminal organization. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4883.16s)]
*  You should be a little bit more ... Kevin O'Leary, you mentioned him earlier. For all that talk, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4889.96s)]
*  I guarantee you if he had a large company, he wouldn't just shit can everything right off the [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4896.12s)]
*  bat. I know maybe that's his implication, but- I think he's talking about failing companies. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4901.639999999999s)]
*  Failing companies. When you take over a failing company that's filled with bloat and waste, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4906.36s)]
*  you cut more out than even you think is necessary and then you figure out what you need. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4910.44s)]
*  But he would go through ... There would be a thoughtful initial review phase in a corporate [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4915.32s)]
*  environment. I think I would argue that, that even he would do that. He's not just going to [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4920.28s)]
*  pull the pin and throw it in the room and say, okay, now let's see what we actually need. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4923.96s)]
*  Well, isn't what this administration has done is putting a pause on everything [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4927.879999999999s)]
*  and then they're doing an audit of things and then a review. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4932.599999999999s)]
*  But that's not the way it comes across because in part because the media is not, like you said, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4936.44s)]
*  they're not going to give them a break. So even if they said that that's what we're doing and [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4939.88s)]
*  here's how we're doing it, here are the people on the transition team. Who are the people on [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4943.88s)]
*  Elon's doge team? Can you name half a dozen of them? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4948.6s)]
*  Big balls. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4952.4400000000005s)]
*  Big balls. Okay. All right, fair enough. There's big balls. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4953.08s)]
*  There's the kid who deciphered those scrolls from Pompeii using AI. He's a genius. It's very [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4956.84s)]
*  interesting because the approach is essentially ... He's mimicking the approach that Elon used [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4964.2s)]
*  at Twitter. Just you're saying, okay, I'm going to cut out 90% of this and see how it works. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4968.92s)]
*  Yeah. I just think that ... And again, you got to go after the waste, the fraud. Is there a blow? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4974.84s)]
*  Of course there's a blow in the government. Go after it. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4982.52s)]
*  But see, your perspective is that of course there's waste, of course there's fraud, but [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4984.28s)]
*  if you don't understand international relations, if you don't understand [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4988.92s)]
*  the ... This long tradition of supporting regimes that have our interests in mind, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=4994.04s)]
*  if we don't do that, someone else will. They'll gain control of these areas. This is just the [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5002.12s)]
*  reality of the world that we live in and we should be influencing other countries. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5007.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's said a lot better than I could say it. But yeah, that's what I'm saying on [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5011.08s)]
*  the international front, on the domestic front. I'm just saying, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5015.48s)]
*  go through all these organizations, but don't give the other side the ammunition to say, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5018.6s)]
*  you guys are firing useful people. I hear this all the time now in the past few weeks. It's like, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5029.96s)]
*  oh my God, they let this entire group of people who are going, working around women's health issues, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5035.4s)]
*  and they're just ... They're giving them ammunition that they don't need to by virtue of the way that [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5039.88s)]
*  they're going about it. Again, go about it, do it. All I'm saying is it's the means of which [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5048.52s)]
*  they're doing it. You can accomplish the same task and you can accomplish it quickly. It's not like [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5055.4800000000005s)]
*  your review process- How could you review USAID while this is all going on, while they're still [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5060.92s)]
*  able to spend money? Because they're still able to ... If there is corruption, if they're still [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5066.4400000000005s)]
*  able to dump a bunch of money into a bunch of different projects and funnel stuff around and [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5070.92s)]
*  move stuff into these areas where it can't be traced, which is apparently where at least some [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5074.92s)]
*  of it goes. Yeah. I would want ... Look, if you're doing a corporate fraud investigation, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5079.24s)]
*  you don't walk in and say, there's fraud everywhere here, where everybody's going. No, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5086.2s)]
*  you don't. You go in and you do your investigation because you don't know what the iceberg looks [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5090.68s)]
*  like. You don't know what's underneath the surface. You want to be able to go through it in a [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5096.36s)]
*  methodical way. If you walk into the World Bank and say, we think there's fraud here in this [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5100.2s)]
*  department over here, and the World Bank, just as an aside, if they think there's fraud somewhere, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5106.12s)]
*  they have to notify the people that they suspect of fraud that they're going to initiate a fraud [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5111.96s)]
*  investigation before they do it. How fucked up is that? Pretty crazy. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5115.8s)]
*  So anyway, that's- That gives them a little time. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5118.84s)]
*  Gives them a little time. So I don't know. Again, I respect the fact that they're actually making [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5123.5599999999995s)]
*  the effort. I think that's great. I'm not sure that it's ... There's an immovable object in [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5131.0s)]
*  Washington, DC, made up of lobbyists, defense contractors, self-interested politicians. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5140.44s)]
*  They're all like this. Doge is obviously bumping up against them, particularly when they start [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5147.08s)]
*  now talking about Pentagon spending. So I guess my point is it's complex. I don't know that blowing [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5154.36s)]
*  it up and then saying we're going to rebuild it. It's like when Cash Patel or anyone else for an [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5162.12s)]
*  organization, they talk about the FBI. Let's raise it to the ground and start over. What? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5166.12s)]
*  You got thousands and thousands of hardworking street agents out there doing very important [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5171.08s)]
*  work. You can't just say, okay, we're suspending 30% of them. You got to go through and say, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5176.12s)]
*  okay, well, where is the problem here? Is there enough time to do that? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5184.04s)]
*  This is the question. Is this a more time effective way of confronting the reality [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5189.08s)]
*  of what they're trying to accomplish, which is government efficiency? It's the department [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5196.76s)]
*  of government efficiency. We don't believe that the government is efficient. We do see that there's [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5200.12s)]
*  at least some waste and some fraud, but it's not being chased down. They're going to chase it down. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5204.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think I would argue that they're going to find this as a years long process anyway, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5210.2s)]
*  no matter how much of a jump they get at the starting block. But I think that- [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5214.599999999999s)]
*  Mike Pence thinks it's going to take 50, 60 years. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5221.24s)]
*  Yeah. I think he's right. Well, okay, I don't think it's going to take that long. I think if [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5223.32s)]
*  you're persistent about it, and I think your timeline is that you mentioned the midterms, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5228.759999999999s)]
*  that would be my focus. I want to get it well done before the midterm elections, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5234.28s)]
*  because I'd be concerned about losing the house. So you've got that runway to work with, then go. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5239.32s)]
*  But don't feel like you got to get it done in the first four weeks. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5245.719999999999s)]
*  Right. So there's a lot of messaging that you hear online that you got to decipher. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5249.24s)]
*  One of them is the price of eggs, for whatever reason. The price of eggs is a big one that gets [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5254.839999999999s)]
*  bandied about. People need to understand what the price of eggs is all about. Well, one of the [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5259.4s)]
*  things is they killed a lot of chickens during the Biden administration because of this bird flu [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5264.44s)]
*  thing. So they killed millions of chickens because the fear is that these chickens are going to- [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5269.08s)]
*  it's going to hop over to people. And right now, I think it's only in geese and ducks. Is that [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5276.5199999999995s)]
*  correct? Did it move to cattle? I think it has, in some cases, moved to cattle. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5282.759999999999s)]
*  But the question is, what happens? Is that treatable with antibiotics? Is this overblown? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5290.12s)]
*  What is the actual reality of this pandemic, so to speak? This is why egg prices are so high. But [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5296.599999999999s)]
*  then, unfortunately, it becomes a political talking point. So it's hard to get to the bottom of it [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5304.28s)]
*  because you're just trying to use it to cast blame. So they're trying to blame this administration on [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5309.32s)]
*  the price of eggs. They're fucking up. Regular people are going to starve. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5314.2s)]
*  Yeah. Look, he's been in office for 23 days. Egg prices haven't come down. You guys were lied to. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5319.0s)]
*  Guess what? It takes a long time for a chicken to be able to grow from a chick to an egg laying. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5324.76s)]
*  It takes months. So you're not going to get any discount in eggs anytime soon if they killed [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5329.64s)]
*  millions of chickens, which they definitely did. Oh, no. Remember the old mad cow disease [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5335.56s)]
*  years and years ago. Sure. England had a big problem with that. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5341.88s)]
*  Yeah. Beef prices. I had a buddy of mine who went to England and was living [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5344.44s)]
*  over there during the mad cow crisis. And to this day, he can't give blood. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5347.96s)]
*  Wow. Okay. Because it's a prion disease. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5354.36s)]
*  Okay. The idea is that if he does have it, what is it called? Yuckebe's-Kruxfeld disease? I always [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5356.12s)]
*  fuck that up. But what that disease, that prion disease is, is from cattle eating cattle brain [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5361.4800000000005s)]
*  tissue, which is so crazy. Or sheep's brains. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5369.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Somebody at some point thought, you know, what we could do with all these [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5372.28s)]
*  sheep parts is we could feed them to the cows. Jesus Christ. I know. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5376.919999999999s)]
*  Grind them all up and then the cows eat them and get the prion disease and then they're fucked. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5380.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The same thing, which by the way, happens to cannibals. That's the same thing with [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5384.5199999999995s)]
*  Papua New Guinea. And the cannibals get that same sort of problem where the neurological, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5389.48s)]
*  their body breaks down. Good God. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5395.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Good God. Yeah. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5398.12s)]
*  Ever read the story about a Rockefeller's kid? One of the, was it nephew? Was it a nephew that [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5399.48s)]
*  got killed and eaten by the- Yeah. He went over there to live amongst them, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5405.0s)]
*  I think. Well, he went twice. And apparently the first time he went, he insulted them by trying to [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5409.24s)]
*  acquire one of their sacred things. And the second time he went back, they decided to eat them. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5413.88s)]
*  And they didn't find out about it for a long time. I think he went missing in the sixties. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5422.04s)]
*  Yeah. We covered it, Jamie. Do you remember what year it was? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5426.36s)]
*  I think he went missing in the sixties. I remember that story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5430.36s)]
*  There was debate over whether he was actually killed and eaten by the cannibals or not. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5433.96s)]
*  And now they're pretty sure he was. Yeah. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5437.56s)]
*  And at least that's what they're saying. Who goes back a second time? You piss them [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5439.64s)]
*  off once and you get away. I don't think he thought he pissed them off. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5442.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. I think he felt like they just couldn't [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5444.280000000001s)]
*  come to an agreement on whether or not he could take home whatever sacred object he was trying [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5446.6s)]
*  to get from them. I forget what it was, but it was something that they would never sell or trade. And [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5451.0s)]
*  he was insisting on it. And they're like, oh, fuck this guy. And then I think they had some time to [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5455.96s)]
*  stew on it while he was gone. And then when he came back, like this dumb motherfucker's back. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5460.76s)]
*  Can you imagine how surprised they were when he showed up again? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5465.88s)]
*  Oh boy. We're going to beat him. Yeah, they're probably thinking, if he comes back, I'm going to [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5468.2s)]
*  fucking eat him. I get the haunch. Yeah. Well, again, this is rich liberals. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5472.12s)]
*  That's what he was. He was a rich liberal who wanted to fix the world and travel around and [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5479.400000000001s)]
*  went into a world that he didn't understand. Like literally didn't understand. He didn't [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5484.68s)]
*  understand what they were saying. Didn't understand the culture. It was fairly confusing. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5488.36s)]
*  Yeah. I'm here to help you in my own way. I'm going to bring enlightenment to you. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5494.28s)]
*  Yeah. And also what a great story when you get back to the university. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5499.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5502.759999999999s)]
*  Guess what I did? I went to Papua New Guinea. He's so interesting. God, so interesting. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5503.16s)]

*  Can you pull up a story where you see this cat? There's photos of this cat with the people. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5510.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I remember this. I remember. Can I just... Yeah. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5515.48s)]
*  There we go. So it's 62. Hold on. Go back up. It says the first public report that Rockefeller [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5520.2s)]
*  was killed and dismembered. Scroll up. And his long bones turned into weapons and fishing equipment. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5526.04s)]
*  Yo. Wow. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5533.16s)]
*  Was published by the Associated Press in March of 1962. A second investigation later that year [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5534.12s)]

*  conclusion. Van der Waal was given a skull bearing no lower jaw and a hole in the right temple, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5545.48s)]
*  the hallmarks of the remains that had been head hunted and open to consume the brains. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5551.5599999999995s)]
*  Which he turned over to Dutch authorities who never asked him to write a written report and [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5557.24s)]
*  never asked him to verbally report his conclusion. The information was apparently deemed politically [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5561.5599999999995s)]
*  sensitive in part because of the fragile state of the Dutch Empire in the Indonesian archipelago [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5566.28s)]
*  and in part because of Nelson Rockefeller's political celebrity in the United States. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5572.36s)]
*  The findings of van der Waal's investigation are restated in the written memoir of Anton van der [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5577.08s)]

*  Is he famous? No, I just added that because I thought he deserved it. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5590.92s)]
*  You'll see if you can find photos of that dude. That's crazy. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5595.64s)]
*  Because there's photos of him hanging out with the people that ate him. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5598.360000000001s)]
*  I love that. Go out and investigate. Oh, this isn't the conclusion we wanted. Don't [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5604.6s)]
*  bother giving us a report. Keep that to yourself. There he is. Yeah, I remember this guy with the [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5609.16s)]
*  glasses. There he is. Go to that one right there. No, the third one. The third one. Yeah, that one. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5614.6s)]
*  Look at that. He's like, I'm going to eat you. Those classic 60s glasses. And look at the smile [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5620.2s)]
*  on his face when he's looking at that dude. Oh, I know. Oh, look at him all. Look at the guy behind [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5625.16s)]
*  the front guy. He's looking and he's going, yeah. And eventually they ate him. Crazy. He looks such [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5630.28s)]
*  a nerd. Yeah. What a moron. Well, back in the day, he thought he was being, look at him, soy boy, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5636.04s)]
*  even back then. Yeah. Oh, I'm having such a wonderful time with all of you people. Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5641.8s)]

*  have a long history of that. You think about his family. Wouldn't his family have said, look, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5656.84s)]
*  I got to tell you. Oh, God. What is that? I don't know. I was just looking around. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5660.679999999999s)]
*  Is that supposed to be him? I don't know. Oh, God. Click on that. Could be anything. Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5665.4s)]
*  What is that image of? Does it say? Michael, that is him? No, no, no, no, no. It says Michael [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5671.16s)]
*  Rockefeller. That's probably a picture that he took. Oh, yeah. Could be that even more [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5676.44s)]
*  fucked up. Like he already knew they were doing that. Jesus, bro. I'm sure this wouldn't be me. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5682.5199999999995s)]
*  Someone brings out that like, hey, check this out. We did that to this guy. Yeah. Like, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5687.96s)]
*  look at that. Fuck scroll. Look at that fucking skeleton. That is so creepy. I got to tell you, [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5694.36s)]
*  they look well fed. I would worry about that. Yeah. That one guy on the right. He's got a big [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5698.679999999999s)]
*  old belly. Yeah. Just been eating people. Yeah. Well, a lot of them, they get bloated because of [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5702.92s)]
*  parasites, too. That's true. Tapeworms. 30 foot tapeworm. Oh, God. Well, there you go. So click [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5709.08s)]

*  Look, how fucking terrifying is that? Geez. Imagine that guy. You show them the beach and [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5721.72s)]
*  that guy's there. You're like, oh, fuck. You think they do like a movie that give you a 10 [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5727.56s)]
*  second head start into the jungle and then track you down? I mean, honestly- [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5731.16s)]
*  Inez Perce used to do that. If I was in the tribe, I would do that. Right? Why wouldn't you? I mean, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5735.4s)]
*  it's entertaining. Yeah. There's a famous story of a guy where they killed his friend, chopped him [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5738.84s)]
*  up, threw his guts on him, and then they gave him like, I think a 30 second head start and he [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5744.68s)]
*  escaped. He hid in a beaver den. Nice. Yeah. I think this is in Mont- [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5748.84s)]
*  That's smart. I think this is in Montana. A couple years ago. What was this? 1800s. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5752.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay. I think, I believe it was the Inez Perce and I think he hid in a beaver den and made his [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5759.08s)]
*  way naked all the way back to the fort. I think it was like a couple hundred miles too. Yeah. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5765.56s)]
*  People were tougher back then, I would argue. They had to be. They had to be. Yeah. Wow. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5772.28s)]
*  Here's the story on what happened to- Michael reportedly told his companions, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5778.2s)]
*  I think I can make it and jumped into the water. That was the last time they saw him. Oh, this is [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5782.12s)]
*  when he swam to the shore. 1961, Michael Rockefeller was traveling to this dangerous area [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5785.96s)]
*  of dense rainforest, mangrove swamps, and crocodile infested mudflats known as the land of [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5790.84s)]
*  the lapping death when a small catamaran capsized in rough seas. This is the- Oh, so Michael [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5794.92s)]
*  Rockefeller, a strong swimmer, immediately jumped in the sea and began to swim to shore. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5800.6s)]
*  But this is the second time, right? This is when they killed him. But- [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5804.68s)]
*  It says they don't know. No one saw him after he jumped in the water. So they don't know what [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5807.96s)]
*  happened. Right. They assume he- Here's an interesting thought. If you're offshore from [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5811.48s)]
*  whatever, the lapping island of death, and your catamaran capsizes, and so it's still there, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5816.44s)]
*  it's still floating, and you've got your shipmates and they're there, and your decision, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5823.24s)]
*  the way that you process this is to swim to the lapping island of death, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5828.44s)]
*  that doesn't show a lot of thought there. Well, he thought he could make it, and he's [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5833.639999999999s)]
*  already visited them before. There was another article that I had read, Jamie, that actually [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5836.839999999999s)]
*  recounted the moment he was killed, that they picked him up in a canoe and speared him in the [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5840.92s)]
*  canoe. That's what I was reading through the Wikipedia. There's been multiple times, starting [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5846.36s)]
*  with seven years later, to try to investigate what happened. And I don't know how you would really go [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5852.2s)]
*  about doing that. Yeah. The most recent article was like there was some recent revelation, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5857.16s)]
*  some information that was given to them by the tribes people about what happened. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5863.16s)]
*  The first one said that they sent a guy down there, a private investigator, who came back with three [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5866.52s)]
*  skulls, and they said one of them was the skull. So I don't know how they would improve that. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5869.4s)]
*  Well, yeah. Why they have skulls laying around. You know what's going to solve this problem is [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5874.28s)]
*  going to be the newly formed US government agency for the declassification of documents. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5879.48s)]
*  That's going to solve this problem. Federal secrets. Which one's that? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5887.799999999999s)]
*  Federal secrets, yeah, federal secrets. Is that the JFK UFO one? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5890.679999999999s)]
*  Yep. Epstein files. That hot lady's running it. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5893.96s)]
*  And a Polina Cruz. Why is she running it? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5897.0s)]
*  Because she's hot. I don't know. Maybe they should just release the documents. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5900.92s)]
*  If you're going to release the documents, release the documents to the people on the internet. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5906.52s)]
*  They'll figure it out. They don't need you. I know. They've got this new committee, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5909.8s)]
*  and they're going to sort of ... COVID is also on the table. UFOs, now Michael Rockefeller, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5914.76s)]
*  I would argue. See, the UFOs, I'm hoping that's where the 4.7 trillion went. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5920.6s)]
*  Yeah. Wouldn't that be good though? I'm hoping that's what it is. It's all these government [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5925.160000000001s)]
*  crashed retrieval programs and re-engineering and back engineering. That's what I'm hoping. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5930.04s)]
*  Developing our own technology that we've kept secret. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5935.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what a lot of it is. I could absolutely be wrong, but I think that's [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5938.200000000001s)]
*  what a lot of it is. I think we have some super sophisticated propulsion systems that are way ahead [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5942.360000000001s)]
*  of our time. Then also, I think we're being visited. I think there's a bunch of different [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5947.48s)]
*  things happening simultaneously. I think a 4.7 trillion. Okay, when you think about that, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5951.959999999999s)]
*  it sounds like a lot, but in terms of government spending, we could blow through that pretty quick. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5956.2s)]
*  I'm thinking, yes, I do ... Well, it's over how long though? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5963.08s)]
*  When they say 4.7 trillion, they don't give you a timeline. That was the thing about Politico. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5968.36s)]
*  Like there was this talk about ... We gave Politico $8 million. Well, sort of. What the real story was, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5974.360000000001s)]
*  there's a subscription model for Politico where you get news instantaneously and it costs like [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5980.2s)]
*  10,000 bucks. There was a bunch of those subscriptions that were in many different agencies. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5987.8s)]
*  Right, right. And so- [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5993.8s)]
*  And this is over the course of eight years. That $8 million was from 2016 to today. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=5995.0s)]
*  So say that. Roll that out rather than saying they've been funding Politico. Because [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6001.64s)]
*  in a short burst, it sounds much worse. You still can argue, is this really necessary? Do you need [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6008.12s)]
*  to be doing this well? I don't know. Well, if you want information instantaneously, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6013.4800000000005s)]
*  which would be very beneficial to someone in government. Yeah. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6017.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're paying for a database, for information that's going to hopefully inform [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6019.56s)]
*  better decision making. The problem is the way you say it. If you say, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6023.8s)]
*  we gave Politico $8 million. Oh, those motherfuckers. That's why they're fucking ... That's why they're [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6026.84s)]
*  biased. And then you realize like, oh, that's not exactly what happened. So I think the people that [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6031.64s)]
*  are doing this have to make sure that they're not hyperbolic. Well, I'm sure ... Yes, exactly. And [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6038.12s)]
*  that goes back to this whole thing that I've probably beat to a death is the messaging idea. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6044.12s)]
*  But I think- Well, this is important too, because today, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6049.08s)]
*  now they're talking about social security. And that people are receiving social security [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6052.5199999999995s)]
*  that are 150 years old. But I don't think that is the reality as it's being explained by people [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6058.12s)]
*  who understand COBOL. The language and this computer programming language that they use is ancient, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6065.719999999999s)]
*  right? Which is kind of crazy that they're still using that, right? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6073.08s)]
*  It's the government. Right. So some guy who understands it was explaining that if certain [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6075.879999999999s)]
*  factors aren't taken into consideration or certain things aren't entered in, like date of birth or [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6083.0s)]
*  when ... There's certain things- Or date of death. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6090.679999999999s)]
*  Right. But it doesn't even necessarily mean that all these people are receiving checks. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6093.48s)]
*  Right. They're just listed on the files. And it doesn't mean money's going out to them. And so, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6098.5199999999995s)]
*  yeah, again, from a messaging perspective, does Elon need to screenshot that and then send it out [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6103.48s)]
*  as a tweet or whatever we call X nowadays? Right. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6109.8s)]
*  And then suddenly you've got a couple million people going, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6112.28s)]
*  oh my God, we're paying dead people. Well- Right, right, right. That's the problem [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6114.76s)]
*  with being hyperbolic. I'm going to send this to you, Jamie, because I confused myself. And so I [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6119.08s)]
*  was like, what exactly are they saying? Because it seems like the people that understand that [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6123.8s)]
*  programming language are the ones that aren't jumping on board and saying, hey, this is what's [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6128.28s)]
*  happening. Vampires exist amongst us. There's 300-year-old people getting social security. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6132.92s)]
*  That's not what they're saying. The people that actually understand it are saying that's not [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6138.28s)]
*  really the case. Although how cool would that be if vampires existed amongst us and we found out [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6142.599999999999s)]
*  the 300-year-old people were making benefits? Yeah. That would be crazy. How crazy. Oh, so I'll [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6146.679999999999s)]
*  send you this, Jamie. This is this guy's explanation of it. But that 4.7, I'm sure we're going to find [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6152.12s)]
*  the trillion. Of course some of that money goes out. And I think if you follow money in the [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6159.5599999999995s)]
*  government, it's always more effective and interesting than anything else, right? You [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6163.48s)]
*  always get to the bottom of things by following budgets, depending on how it's hidden. And so a [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6168.12s)]
*  lot of that money is going to be, perhaps it's in black budgets for, who knows, for Defense [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6173.24s)]
*  Department activities. It's worth digging into because it's always fascinating. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6179.0s)]
*  So in that, this is a guy that explains it. I'll read this. I hope he's correct. This is a gentleman [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6184.5199999999995s)]
*  named House of Carter on X. He said, this isn't a vampire conspiracy. It's just COBOL, C-O-B-O-L. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6190.44s)]
*  Legacy government systems, especially social security, still rely on COBOL, a language [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6199.08s)]
*  designed before anyone thought databases would need to track people beyond 99 years old. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6203.48s)]
*  The numbers you're laughing at aren't literal ages. They're most likely misinterpreted [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6209.4s)]
*  and misinterpreted categorical codes or data artifacts from outdated formatting. Social [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6214.84s)]
*  Security isn't paying 150 year olds. The system uses fixed width fields. And when modern databases [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6221.4800000000005s)]
*  misread them, they mistakenly interpret grouping codes as real ages. This happens when old mainframe [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6228.2s)]
*  logic isn't properly translated into newer systems. So no, there aren't thousands of people over 150 [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6235.32s)]
*  getting checks, but there are a lot of outdated systems that need modernization, maybe focus on [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6242.36s)]
*  fixing that issue instead of hyping up a non-issue. So there's multiple people that have said the same [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6248.36s)]
*  kind of thing. This guy says, I'm an old programmer coder in today's parlance. As many old programmers [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6256.04s)]
*  know, COBOL, young coders don't. When Musk claims that social security is paying thousands of 150 [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6264.36s)]
*  year olds, I think someone should let him know that in COBOL, if a data is missing, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6270.36s)]
*  a data is missing, the program defaults to 1875. Example, 2025, 1875 equals 150. So for some reason, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6277.48s)]
*  if data is missing, the program defaults to this ancient date. And it's just a problem with data, [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6289.32s)]
*  which makes more sense than 150 year olds. Exactly. But again, so fine, I dig into it, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6296.52s)]
*  find out, and you know what? The end result is, you don't have 150 year old people getting benefits, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6301.88s)]
*  but the end result is that you modernize the way that we store information. I think, great, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6307.400000000001s)]
*  there's a benefit to DOGE right there. We've created a more efficient system for tracking [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6313.88s)]
*  and paying out and good. Again, everybody should not have a hard on about an organization called [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6318.92s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency. Ultimately, I think they're going to do a [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6327.32s)]
*  very good job. I just think let's- So this is something to think about with social security, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6332.5199999999995s)]
*  though. So there's that, which is probably a misinterpretation of data. But there's [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6337.24s)]
*  another one that I just sent Jamie. So there's this woman who's a whistleblower, and she's saying [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6341.719999999999s)]
*  they were incentivized to qualify illegals for long-term disability to qualify illegals for [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6345.96s)]
*  social security for life. So they were set for life. And in quotes, she says, they wanted us to [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6351.72s)]
*  try to identify them in such a way that they would qualify for long-term social security disability. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6357.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, long-term social security disability is for life. So if they got identified and qualify [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6363.24s)]
*  for long-term social security disability, they're as good as set up for life. That doesn't sound [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6368.68s)]
*  like a refugee to me, she's saying. Just being honest, it sounds like someone who's planning on [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6374.36s)]
*  staying here. So they're instructed to try to identify, to try to get the client because once [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6378.599999999999s)]
*  they arrive here, now they're called clients. So they told us that we needed to talk to the client [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6384.28s)]
*  and ask them if they had any headaches, reoccurring headaches, or any lower back problems, anything [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6389.5599999999995s)]
*  that would qualify them for social security long-term disability, which is crazy. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6396.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then, but again, trackable information, you would think, right? So you [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6402.12s)]
*  can go in, if you're serious and persistent about it, you should be able to go in and identify, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6408.52s)]
*  yes, we have the following. Let's listen to the client talk about this. So this is something that, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6414.52s)]
*  you know, when people are talking about the problems of social security, this seems, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6418.76s)]
*  if she's telling the truth, this seems real. Right. Just being honest, that sounds like [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6422.68s)]
*  somebody who's planning on staying here. A refugee stays until the problem's over and then goes home. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6426.6s)]
*  Well, that's right. And so they instructed us to try to identify, to try to get the client, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6431.48s)]
*  because once they arrive here, they're now called clients. They're now called clients. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6439.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. Because clients pay. Sure. Sure. I'm starting to see where this is leading. So [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6445.719999999999s)]
*  they told us that we needed to talk to the client and ask them if they had any headaches, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6452.919999999999s)]
*  recurring headaches, or any lower back problems, excuse me, anything that would qualify them [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6459.32s)]
*  for social security, long-term disability. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. So let me get this [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6466.759999999999s)]
*  straight. Part of the screening is supposed to be, are you sick, maimed, injured, whatever. Right. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6471.08s)]
*  Okay, good. You can come in. Yeah. You get on the airplane. Are you sick, maimed, injured, whatever? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6478.44s)]
*  Yes. Good. So we can give you disability. Correct. What? Yes. This is insanity. Yes. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6483.4s)]
*  It is insanity. But in order to get social security disability benefits, don't you need [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6489.32s)]
*  a social security number? Well, we are, we were instructed in the meeting that one of the first [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6494.2s)]
*  things we were supposed to do was sign them up for social security. Yeah. Wait. This is unbelievable. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6499.799999999999s)]
*  So they come over here and they get a social security number. Right. They become legal. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6509.24s)]
*  Correct. Are you pulling my leg? No, I'm not. And then after we process them for a social security [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6513.64s)]
*  card, then we were to process them for a U.S. passport. No, you're not. Yeah, I think we'd, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6522.52s)]
*  again, fascinating if it's true. It's outrageous. Fascinating if it's true. If it's true. But you [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6530.92s)]
*  need corroboration on something like that. Why is that lady? Yeah. That's odd. She's Russian [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6535.240000000001s)]
*  disinformation. They show who they are, what they did. Right. I don't even know where that came from. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6542.92s)]
*  See if you can find that out. I don't even know what that's. I mean, that's just due diligence, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6547.64s)]
*  right? Okay. So I think that's great. And the obligation then is to say, okay, well, who is [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6550.84s)]
*  she? Why does she have this knowledge? Is she credible? Can you corroborate it with other [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6556.04s)]
*  sources? And if you can, then yeah, you've got a serious problem. At that moment where she said, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6560.2s)]
*  get them a U.S. passport, that's where I started, that little flag went off and I thought, hold on [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6567.24s)]
*  a second. Wait, wait, wait. Let's dig into this and actually see. Is that possible? That video's [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6571.32s)]
*  from 2017. 2017? Wow. It's a radio show. A Missouri woman is interviewed by radio show Josh Tolle. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6575.48s)]
*  Wow, that's 2017. That's crazy. Yeah. God. So what would be the benefit of that? The benefit of that [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6584.2s)]
*  would be you get a voter for life. If you are in whatever party, whether it's the Republican party [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6591.96s)]
*  or whoever it is that allows this to happen and hooks these people up and sets them up, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6599.08s)]
*  you would think that those people are going to vote that way for life because those are the [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6603.96s)]
*  people that gave them American citizenship, essentially gave them social security for life. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6607.08s)]
*  All you have to do is tell them, look, you get this check for life. All you have to do is keep [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6613.48s)]
*  voting and you know the right way to go. Don't vote with your fucking conscience. I want you to [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6617.64s)]
*  vote with, you know. Yeah, I mean, do what I think, buddy. And we'll regularly remind you who to [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6624.76s)]
*  vote for. Yeah, we'll tell you. We'll tell you in the newsletters. Yeah, I mean, that would be [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6629.88s)]
*  theory and that is the theory, the narrative that says that's why the last four years we had [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6633.72s)]
*  essentially an open border policy was to bring in 10, 11, 12 million new voters. That's the way that [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6639.08s)]
*  story unfolds. That's one version of it? That's one version. The other version is cheap labor, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6645.24s)]
*  right? Cheap labor. Also just sort of the, you know, then there's the soft, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6649.48s)]
*  well, it's the way the world should work. You know, we need an open borders world. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6655.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not buying that version. Yeah, I don't think that's- [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6660.04s)]
*  That version's horseshit. Most people don't fall along the lines of I'm doing things for ideology. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6662.2s)]
*  Most people have other more base motives. My take is if you got a place that's awesome [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6666.599999999999s)]
*  and you got a system that's awesome, expand awesomeness. Don't bring in people that aren't [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6671.639999999999s)]
*  awesome and don't bring in people from places that aren't awesome. So the problem is if you [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6675.96s)]
*  bring people in that are criminals and then have a lifelong history of selling drugs and being [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6679.8s)]
*  involved in the cartel, they're not going to come over here. You know what? I need to join the union [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6685.24s)]
*  and be a pipe fitter. You know, they're going to continue to do what they've done their whole [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6688.84s)]
*  goddamn life. So like the problem is not that. The problem is where you're from sucks. So I think [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6694.28s)]
*  the best way, I mean, and I'm not saying we should take over all these countries and run them, but the [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6701.08s)]
*  best way is to get- Now you're talking. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6705.56s)]
*  That's probably the only way that it would really work. But the way to do it is to somehow or [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6707.4800000000005s)]
*  another encourage those countries to become more like the United States. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6712.84s)]
*  Well, yes. And then you would do that through soft power and organizations that could influence [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6717.160000000001s)]
*  hearts and minds. You're a lot of work. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6722.6s)]
*  So I'm trying to look at this from a bunch of different perspectives. This is a very complicated [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6727.0s)]
*  situation. It's not as simple as, you know, we need to stay out of the way of other countries' [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6731.0s)]
*  businesses. Right. Right. No, it's no, I don't, again, and that comes back around to it'd be [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6737.64s)]
*  lovely if we were all working on the same team. That's not how I don't think human nature is. So [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6743.0s)]
*  you know, I- Well, that's not the state of the world, right? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6750.28s)]
*  It's not the state of the world. And it's in the last four years, and I would argue during the [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6752.84s)]
*  Obama administration, they oftentimes from a national security perspective seem to run it [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6757.64s)]
*  based on how they hoped the world would be. Right. As opposed to how the world actually is. Right. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6763.240000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, like them or hate them, you know, again, the current administration tends to, [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6769.240000000001s)]
*  you know, I think look at things in a more pragmatic way. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6775.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think they'll be able to do that with USAID? Do you think they'll be able to convince some of [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6778.68s)]
*  these other people that are all these USA first people that don't think we should be spending [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6783.0s)]
*  any money overseas that maybe some of this money is well spent for our best interest? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6787.64s)]
*  Yeah. If, yeah, that's a good question. That's a complicated question, right? Because it really is. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6793.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Are you even allowed to say what you're actually doing then? Because how do we discern [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6800.04s)]
*  whether or not, how are you going to tell people that $20 million for Iraqi Sesame Street is [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6804.120000000001s)]
*  actually a really good idea? And here's why. And it's- [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6808.52s)]
*  But how are you going to tell them that, you know, buying and owning Gaza is a good idea? Right? I [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6811.8s)]
*  really don't think he's going to do that. I think that's one of those things. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6816.68s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think so. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6819.24s)]
*  Like turning candidates into the 51st state. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6820.04s)]
*  But do the people on that side of the fence who say no money spent overseas, you know- [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6822.5199999999995s)]
*  How are you going to justify that? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6828.5199999999995s)]
*  What are they going to do? Look at that and go, well, that's a fucked up idea, right? But, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6829.8s)]
*  you know, but it's still, you know, President Trump, so yay, we got to support it. I don't know. Do [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6833.8s)]
*  they discern or, you know, do people on the base, do they just say, yeah, everything that comes out [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6839.4s)]
*  of the White House is a great idea? Because that certainly runs counter to the idea that we don't [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6844.2s)]
*  want to spend money overseas. What are you going to do? Substitute Ukraine now because we don't [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6847.96s)]
*  want to spend money in Ukraine. You got to substitute it for Gaza. Again, that's- [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6851.24s)]
*  Is the idea that we would protect American interests better if we were in control of that? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6855.96s)]
*  And so like if Israel did something, if someone did something, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6860.5199999999995s)]
*  we'd be able to respond in minutes versus in days. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6863.4s)]
*  Well, that goes against the idea that we don't want to be involved in foreign wars, right? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6866.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, if President Trump doesn't want to be involved in foreign incursions and wars, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6870.2s)]
*  he's picked a hell of a spot to not be involved in foreign. You're going to drop yourselves in- [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6873.72s)]
*  No, he's going to fix it. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6877.88s)]
*  He's going to fix it. Well, I know. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6878.68s)]
*  He's going to make it nice. Big old Trump hotel. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6879.72s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, but again, hey, look, I think it's great in the sense that I never thought I'd [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6882.04s)]
*  see the day where some of these Arab states would turn around and say, Hamas has got to go. I [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6887.16s)]
*  mentioned it before, but that's a sea change. That's a big goddamn sea change. And it's kind [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6891.320000000001s)]
*  of like with Ukraine right now, right? He comes out and he says, you know, okay, we're going to [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6897.08s)]
*  start these. They finished already earlier today. They finished conversations in Riyadh, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6902.04s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia between Sergey Lavrov and Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff on the US side and [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6906.92s)]
*  to start the discussions about peace in the conflict, right? Without Ukrainian representation [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6913.56s)]
*  or the Europeans there. NATO wasn't represented either, right? So- [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6919.88s)]
*  And how do they have those kinds of conversations if they don't have Ukrainian representation? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6924.2s)]
*  A lot of people asking that question. But now that they've done it, right? Again, under this idea [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6929.56s)]
*  that, yeah, you can't, you have to bring them in. But the fact that you just jumped into the [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6935.56s)]
*  breach and got started, right? I mean, you think about it in the previous administration or in a [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6941.08s)]
*  normal administration, I'd argue, getting to the table where you'd sit down and talk, look, [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6945.56s)]
*  this is the first time we've talked to the Russians really in a serious way since the invasion back in [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6950.76s)]
*  2022. So the fact that most administrations would have taken a year just to map out, okay, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6956.12s)]
*  well, this is what the talks are going to look like. And this is what the conference table will [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6962.76s)]
*  look like and this is where people are going to sit and this is what we're going to be able to say. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6966.76s)]
*  And it would take months and months and months to get them. These guys just said, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6969.96s)]
*  ah, fuck it, let's go over. We're going to sit down. We're going to talk with them. Now that's [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6973.64s)]
*  forced, right? That's forced the Europeans to say, okay, how do we get involved? We got to be [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6976.68s)]
*  relevant. And they do, right? Look, the European nations and European institutions have allocated [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6983.08s)]
*  more money to Ukraine than the U.S. has, right? I mean, they're up to, depending on numbers you [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6989.16s)]
*  look at, they're up to maybe $130 billion allocated in financial. How much have we allocated? Probably [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=6994.12s)]
*  about 119, 120 billion. I thought it was way more than that. I thought it was 100 billion. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7000.12s)]
*  No. Where Zelensky said he hasn't received it. No. Well, when I say allocated, not all of it's [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7005.96s)]
*  been dispersed, right? So now the U.S. is the leading military provider of military hardware [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7010.28s)]
*  gear. But if you combine humanitarian, financial and military altogether, EU institutions in EU [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7016.12s)]
*  countries have actually allocated more than the U.S. has. And that, you know, logic would say, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7022.04s)]
*  buys them a seat at the table for any peace talks. Aside from the fact that they're sitting right [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7028.679999999999s)]
*  there, you know, close to Russia, they've taken in a vast number of Ukrainian refugees. You've [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7033.32s)]
*  got Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania sitting right there on the border with Russia. They've got a [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7039.96s)]
*  real reason to want to be involved. But again, Trump's saying, let's just start the conversation [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7044.68s)]
*  with Russia. It's forced the EU to say, okay, how do we get involved? How do we rethink? Much [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7049.8s)]
*  like the Arab states with the Gaza issue. So now they're saying, well, Keir Starmer over in the [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7055.08s)]
*  UK is saying, we'd be willing to put boots on the ground for some sort of peacekeeping force. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7059.0s)]
*  You know, and other nations, some are pushing back, you know, Poland, Germany. They're, I don't [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7064.36s)]
*  know about deploying troops to Ukraine to enforce some sort of peace deal, but they're talking, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7069.4s)]
*  right? And that accelerated the process. So, you know, they'll have to be involved, and Ukraine [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7075.32s)]
*  will certainly have to be involved. What are you going to do? You got an invaded country, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7081.24s)]
*  and they're not going to be involved in the future of what happens to the invaded country. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7085.48s)]
*  So they'll be involved, and Marco Rubio has said as much. But I think, so I think it's good. I [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7089.96s)]
*  think, you know, people are really up in arms over the idea that they've started the talk [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7097.4s)]
*  without the Ukrainians sitting at the table. But I don't think there's any intention in any [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7101.16s)]
*  plausible scenario where the US doesn't get them involved here in the very near future, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7107.08s)]
*  because otherwise it's going nowhere. When Zelensky says that he hasn't received [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7112.12s)]
*  $100 billion, what does that actually mean? Does it mean it just hasn't gotten to Ukraine yet? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7116.92s)]
*  It means, yeah. It doesn't mean it's missing? It's not, no, it's not missing, although. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7122.759999999999s)]
*  So this is the thing that people are saying. It's like Tucker Carlson was talking about this. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7126.12s)]
*  And he was essentially saying that there's a bunch of people that are spending money, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7130.44s)]
*  and he went to some wealthy ski town, and these Ukrainians, they're all super wealthy. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7134.28s)]
*  And he thinks that some of that is, you know. Yeah, he's not going out on a limb there. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7139.72s)]
*  Right? I mean, look, Ukraine, one of their big problems over years and years has been corruption [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7146.92s)]
*  and fraud. And one of the reasons why there was pushback against this idea of NATO, even though [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7151.88s)]
*  back in 2008 or 2009, 2008, at a European summit, they actually said, during the NATO summit, they [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7157.8s)]
*  said, yes, at some point in the future, Ukraine and Georgia will become members of NATO. We're [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7167.96s)]
*  not going to give you a timetable. We're not going to tell you what that's going to look like, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7174.6s)]
*  but you can become members of NATO. But one of the problems has been the level of corruption [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7178.04s)]
*  within Ukraine. So is some of that money, both from the US and from the EU, gone missing and [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7183.8s)]
*  lining pockets? Oh, absolutely. There's no doubt about it. Look at Iraq, the money that we spent [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7190.5199999999995s)]
*  in Iraq and how much, I mean, just any time you've got government disbursement of that size, look at [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7195.32s)]
*  fucking COVID fraud, right? Anytime you've got money going out in large buckets from the US [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7200.28s)]
*  government, you're going to have some fraud. Absolutely. Yeah, you're going to have people [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7205.0s)]
*  who are going to take advantage of it. So yeah, that's not a surprise. And Tucker's [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7207.88s)]
*  right for pointing it out. I'm just saying it's not rocket science. How much? Well, that's, again, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7213.08s)]
*  you would like to think that Doge, one of their jobs would be to go, and I think if there was [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7218.36s)]
*  more transparency in how the money is spent, as there should be, right? I mean, then maybe the [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7223.56s)]
*  taxpayers would be a little bit more understanding or lenient. But they're not going to be lenient [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7230.04s)]
*  or understanding for any fraud where people are getting rich off of this. There are people that [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7237.72s)]
*  are getting rich off of this. I remember there was one guy that had to resign because it turned out [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7242.28s)]
*  he had somehow or another moved around a billion dollars that he shouldn't have. Remember that [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7246.28s)]
*  story? A billion dollars, yeah. And he's like, well, I'll just step off. And so he kind of went [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7251.16s)]
*  away and he's living on a yacht. There's these stories. And it's so confusing because we're [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7256.6s)]
*  getting the mainstream media version of what's going on versus boots on the ground. Where's the [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7262.360000000001s)]
*  money actually going? What is actually happening? Why did Russia actually invade in the first place? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7270.120000000001s)]
*  Well, my company was out in Iraq shortly, actually a little bit before, but then following [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7276.200000000001s)]
*  the 2003 entry of the US into Iraq. And so we were there for a handful of years, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7283.56s)]
*  providing security assistance to a variety of organizations. And you didn't have to look hard [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7289.8s)]
*  or far to see. There'd be some group coming into town saying, hey, we just started up this company. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7299.400000000001s)]
*  It's an 8A company. Look, we're owned by Eskimos or handicapped women or whatever. They just set up [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7305.400000000001s)]
*  some bullshit company to get government contracts. No experience, no other. And yeah, so we watched [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7310.52s)]
*  that unfold. Anytime you have an environment that's steeped in chaos, yeah, fraud is definitely [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7317.64s)]
*  going to happen. So you have to be incredibly aggressive and willing to hunt it down. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7324.120000000001s)]
*  But I think sometimes the problem is in government, there's an accepted loss concept, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7332.76s)]
*  like with credit cards or retail operators. We ain't got an accepted loss. We know we're [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7337.400000000001s)]
*  going to lose a certain amount each year to fraud. Columbia Ricket and Tate Club. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7343.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I was a member. I was too. I think I still owe them money. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7346.84s)]
*  That's right. I'm still getting notices. I have not received my CDs. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7353.32s)]
*  People don't remember that. That was when you used to get cassettes and CDs in the mail [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7358.2s)]
*  and you sign up. It was a big hustle with the music industry to sell more copies. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7362.44s)]
*  You can never get rid of it. You can never get rid of it. But it made it look like they had a lot [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7371.48s)]
*  more people buying albums than they were. They weren't really buying them. They were getting [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7375.799999999999s)]
*  them from Columbia Record. And you get like 10 of them for a buck. And everybody's like, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7380.36s)]
*  oh, this sounds great. And then you get them for regular price afterwards. Like, well, fuck this. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7384.04s)]
*  They'd send you a little catalog and you'd check off which ones you wanted. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7388.12s)]
*  Everybody defaulted. Nobody paid. It's like all my friends did it. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7390.68s)]
*  Completely weird scam that went on in the 1980s. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7396.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember Netflix started by mailing you. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7399.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I remember that. And yeah. You used to get a CD or a DVD in the mail. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7402.360000000001s)]
*  I told that to my boys the other night. They put on Netflix. I said, you know how this got started? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7408.92s)]
*  And they couldn't believe it. They're still amazed when our postman walks by the house. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7413.16s)]
*  They think it's incredibly quaint that some guy walks by and leaves you with some mail. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7418.2s)]
*  I wonder what they would, I mean, imagine taking a kid to like 1988 and bringing them to a blockbuster [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7422.92s)]
*  video. They would walk around and go, what is going on? Well, we don't have the internet anymore. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7428.92s)]
*  I mean, yet. So this is how you get movies. They'd be like, shut the fuck up. You don't watch it on [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7433.96s)]
*  your phone. Like we don't even have phones. Yeah, no, no, no. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7439.0s)]
*  No one had a cell phone. Your evenings were spent with a bowl of unshelled nuts, walnuts, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7442.28s)]
*  and you'd crack them. And that was your activity while you talk to your mom and dad or something. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7447.88s)]
*  If you ever showed someone a phone back then and say, someday people are going to jerk off [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7451.48s)]
*  looking at that. They'd be like, what are you even talking about? That's the dumbest prediction of [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7455.4s)]
*  all time. That's not in Star Trek. You get a phone call. I remember some girl call and [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7461.0s)]
*  and my privacy was only as long as the cord on the phone. Oh yeah. Right. Right. Because everybody [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7468.839999999999s)]
*  was in. You had to go to the closet. Yeah. Yeah. If you had one of them ones that had the button, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7475.32s)]
*  like a little portable one with the cord attached and you're hanging up on that, like a desk one, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7479.719999999999s)]
*  you can bring a long cord if you're lucky. If you were lucky. But we had the wall ones. And so they [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7484.5199999999995s)]
*  had the curly cords. Oh, that was the worst. I could go around the corner and then, you know. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7488.759999999999s)]
*  The cords always fucking tangled. Spin the headset around to untangle the cord. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7492.599999999999s)]
*  People don't know the cord is dragged to the ground. Do you remember your landline phone number [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7498.759999999999s)]
*  from when you were a kid? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do too. It's the craziest thing I can still. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7503.879999999999s)]
*  I can't remember what I did two and three hours ago and I could still, you put a gun on my head [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7509.799999999999s)]
*  and I could recite the phone number I had when I was eight years old. Yeah. Isn't that weird? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7514.28s)]
*  We used to be able to remember so many numbers. I only know like three or four numbers [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7518.839999999999s)]
*  of my friends by heart. Yeah. You know, your kids numbers by. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7523.24s)]
*  My wife's maybe a couple of my buddies that have had like my friend Eddie's had the same phone. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7527.96s)]
*  But he's got a new one now. So it's weird that we don't have any numbers in our head anymore. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7532.12s)]
*  No, I will say, and I know this because just a day and a half ago I was doing something. I was [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7537.240000000001s)]
*  filling out some application for one of my boys, the middle boy, a scooter. And it asked for his [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7544.76s)]
*  phone number and I had to look it up. So I was thinking like, well, I don't know. I just push [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7551.88s)]
*  the button. I have to look up mine sometimes. Does that change it? When I give someone my number, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7555.72s)]
*  I have to go, hold on. Yeah. Yeah. I fuck it up. I haven't changed my number in fucking generations. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7560.92s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. It becomes an issue. Yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah. For you, I think it's a certain [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7567.56s)]
*  point in time you're just getting bombarded by people that you don't want to talk to. And you're [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7572.280000000001s)]
*  like, okay, there's only one way out of this. I've got all the friends I want. I got advantage. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7575.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. It's not even the friends you want. It's all transactional. That's the problem. The problem [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7580.04s)]
*  is like, you realize this person only texts me when they want something. Yeah. And the text before [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7584.44s)]
*  they want something or bullshit, the say hi text or bullshit because it's coming. Yeah. Here comes [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7591.24s)]
*  the thing you want. Yeah. And then that comes. Yeah. I get that from, it's interesting. I've got [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7596.679999999999s)]
*  a startup. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Here it comes. Do you want to invest? Fuck off. Yeah. I don't get the [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7601.16s)]
*  investments because nobody thinks I have money. But I'll get like sort of a request for, how about [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7606.28s)]
*  a hookup with somebody in some part of the country or government or, you know, so and I'm like, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7611.96s)]
*  I'm not going to put you in touch with anybody. Yeah. Those are the worst. Yeah. So it's, it's [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7619.08s)]
*  interesting. But you know what today is? You know what today is? Today is my 20th wedding [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7622.44s)]
*  anniversary. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I just, I was thinking about [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7627.4800000000005s)]
*  that. I know it was funny because you proposed the 18th for us to get together and immediately I [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7631.32s)]
*  thought, well, that's our anniversary. And then I thought, well, she loves Austin. So I could combine [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7640.76s)]
*  the two and I don't know that I got credit for it. I'm not sure. You won't. If you combine work with [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7646.76s)]
*  anything, even if it's the most awesome vacation, but it's also work, you don't get credit. Yeah. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7652.92s)]
*  Oh, you didn't even go out of your life to do this. Yeah. You know, you kept doing the same stuff and [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7657.08s)]
*  then you added a thing. And here it is. Yeah. 20 years and here you go. Yeah. I don't know. Well, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7664.4400000000005s)]
*  but we do a nice restaurant. Yeah, yeah, we are. And, and we had a, we had a dinner in, in, [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7669.48s)]
*  in Boise with a bunch of folks on Saturday night. That was really lovely. So we got everybody [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7676.919999999999s)]
*  together and you guys have wolves out there. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you, you put something out about wolves [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7682.28s)]
*  near Aspen. 30 minutes outside of Aspen. My friend has a ranch and they just released wolves there [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7689.4s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. And he's already finding, I took a photo of it and put it on my [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7695.08s)]
*  Instagram. He found a dead elk leg, the neighbor spotted the wolves and they're on his property [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7700.36s)]
*  and he has, I mean, they've released them on his ranch. Yeah. No, no one let him know. That's the [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7706.2s)]
*  leg we found in the snow. No one told him. And these are big Canadian wolves that they got from [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7710.84s)]
*  BC by the way. Oh no, the repopulation program. Look, the way you feel about it is entirely [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7716.68s)]
*  jurisdiction-based. What I mean by that? If you live in New York city or Chicago, you love the [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7721.88s)]
*  wolf repopulation program. If you're, if you're a rancher or, you know, you, you live out in the, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7727.0s)]
*  in the Northwest or the West, you're like, what the fuck are we doing? Where he lives, it's all [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7732.04s)]
*  ranchers. This is what's crazy. It's like they released the wolves where the fucking livestock [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7736.68s)]
*  is. What's crazy is they had a mandate to release wolves in Colorado. So the first wolves they [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7740.68s)]
*  released, they got from Oregon who they took out of areas where they were killing livestock. Yeah. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7745.56s)]
*  So they got wolves that were accustomed to killing livestock and then reintroduced them [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7751.08s)]
*  to Colorado where there's livestock. And what do you know? They start killing livestock. Yeah. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7756.44s)]
*  And kind of crazy. And it's true. And what, and what you said is absolutely true here. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7761.0s)]
*  Give us a short period of time and they're going to start laying on wolf hunts, right? And you're [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7764.84s)]
*  not going to find them. Yeah. Here's another thing my friend said. You can shoot them if they kill, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7769.64s)]
*  if you're killing your livestock or if they're killing a working dog. Yeah. But you can't shoot [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7774.6s)]
*  them if they're killing your pet. Yeah. This is what he said. I don't know if that's true. I can. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7779.88s)]
*  You can in Idaho. Well, in Idaho you can kill them. Yeah. In Idaho they're giving out tags [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7783.56s)]
*  and they're giving out tags in Montana. And this is what people need to understand. When they first [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7788.76s)]
*  reintroduced them, there was no way you could shoot them. Right. And then it got to a point [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7792.76s)]
*  they're like, okay, this is not just sustainable. This is a large population of animals that is [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7796.2s)]
*  doing a lot of damage. Oh yeah. And they do surplus hunting. So in one place in, I think it was [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7801.72s)]
*  Wyoming, they had killed like some crazy number of cow elk, like 15 or 16 of them. What the [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7807.8s)]
*  fuck are type A predators, man? Oh yeah. They're incredibly efficient. And they work together. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7812.12s)]
*  Yeah. They're the only animal in North America other than coyotes, which are actually wolves too. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7816.76s)]
*  They're a small wolf. Yeah. But they're the only animals that work as packs and they're so good at [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7821.320000000001s)]
*  it. They're so good at it and they're so fucking smart. They're so smart. They're all psychic. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7826.12s)]
*  They're all fucking think together. They're like a hive mind. Yeah. Their hierarchy is amazing. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7830.360000000001s)]
*  The way that they, yeah, I did several days out in Yellowstone one time for a TV show, an episode, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7836.04s)]
*  and following or trying to anyway, the lives of a family out there. And it was amazing. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7843.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're amazing animals. It's just incredible. They're amazing animals. It's just [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7852.280000000001s)]
*  this ballot box biology. These people that are in Denver and Boulder, they're the ones who are the [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7855.64s)]
*  big population centers. They're the ones that are voting for this, but you're not going to release [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7860.68s)]
*  wolves in the middle of downtown Denver, right? No, you're going to release them out in the area [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7864.04s)]
*  where these people voted against it. I wish that they would though. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7867.88s)]
*  The area where they released them first were areas where people voted against the wolves, [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7870.6s)]
*  which is like a big fuck you to those people. Yeah. Well, it always is. And if you're a ranch, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7874.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, even in Idaho, right? And you're constantly fighting for just kind of common sense [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7878.76s)]
*  decision making. And luckily, the state house is very favorable. Who knows? I mean, maybe that [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7883.24s)]
*  changes in 10 years, but for right now, they understand, look, this is what's important to [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7889.48s)]
*  this state, why it's such a great place to live. But yeah, so I saw that and it's front and center, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7893.959999999999s)]
*  but I know exactly who's voting in favor of it. Because I've talked to those people who don't [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7905.16s)]
*  understand at all how it operates. Well, apparently it's a pet project, no pun intended, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7910.679999999999s)]
*  of the governor of Colorado's husband. His husband is big on wildlife, which everybody should be. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7917.64s)]
*  Who's the governor of Colorado again? I don't remember. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7926.200000000001s)]
*  Oh well, yeah, not important. Not important. It is important if you live in Colorado. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7931.320000000001s)]
*  The reality is it's already started. The wolves are there. And they were coming into Colorado [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7936.76s)]
*  anyway. There's Colorado wolves that were moving in from neighboring states. Colorado borders Wyoming, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7941.160000000001s)]
*  and they don't stop at the border. It's not like they go, ah, it's Colorado. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7948.36s)]
*  Oh, they travel hundreds and hundreds of miles. We showed a video on here once of a friend of [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7950.599999999999s)]
*  mine filmed a wolf in Bakersfield, California. And I was like, well, these people that live out there, [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7956.28s)]
*  the ranchers that live out there, talked to me about it. One of my buddies who actually works [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7963.48s)]
*  on a ranch filmed it, filmed this wolf. And we actually played the video. It's a big black wolf [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7966.839999999999s)]
*  that's in a cattle field in fucking Bakersfield. It's just outside of Bakersfield. It's off the [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7971.4s)]
*  five. Well, we had Diane Boydon, who is a wolf reintroduction specialist. She's studied wolves [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7977.96s)]
*  her whole life. And she's not in favor of reintroduction of wolves. She thinks they should [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7986.679999999999s)]
*  reintroduce to areas naturally, and they were going to do that anyway. They were going to migrate [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7991.879999999999s)]
*  into these areas naturally, and that's the best way to let it happen. But she said they can travel [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=7996.28s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of miles, and that this wolf probably came all the way from Oregon and [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8001.32s)]
*  just made its way down. It probably wasn't even it because their fear was that some crazy wildlife [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8006.44s)]
*  group is like, we're going to reintroduce the wolves ourselves. And they're capturing these [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8011.4s)]
*  wolves and then bringing them to California. Fuck you rancher. You should be soybeans and just release [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8015.5599999999995s)]
*  them. She doesn't think that she thinks those wolves actually probably made it from the wild [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8021.48s)]
*  all the way down there because they really travel insane distances. Yeah. Well, I mean, [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8026.68s)]
*  no, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that she's after all that experience. She's not in [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8030.84s)]
*  favor of a program. I mean, that shows a lot of common sense. Well, it just throws a giant monkey [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8035.240000000001s)]
*  wrench into whatever ecosystem there is. But the reality of the ecosystem of Montana, where they [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8039.320000000001s)]
*  did reintroduce wolves was that they were very overpopulated with elk to the point where, well, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8044.200000000001s)]
*  she was explaining this, they used to have these winter seasons for cow elk. And it's basically [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8050.04s)]
*  shooting fish in a barrel because they're stuck in deep snow. And you could just pick them off. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8055.64s)]
*  And they did that because they were heavily overpopulated. The land couldn't sustain the [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8060.04s)]
*  numbers. And so they offered opportunities for hunters. Hey, it's great. You shoot an elk, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8064.92s)]
*  you get even a cow elk, you get like 150 pounds of meat, 200 pounds of meat. And it's great. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8070.280000000001s)]
*  That's your meat for a year almost. I remember a park ranger out in Yellowstone told me one time, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8076.04s)]
*  he said he was driving, he was out just sort of checking things and came across a large, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8081.96s)]
*  I forget what he called it. It was a van of some sort, but it was like a VW, hippie van of some [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8089.32s)]
*  sort. And there were four young folks, he said, early 20s. And they were trying to herd this little [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8093.5599999999995s)]
*  baby bison that had gotten separated from the herd and was now all on its own. And they'd been [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8101.4s)]
*  driving along and they saw it off in the distance in the fields. So they decided they were going to [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8107.8s)]
*  rescue this thing. So they were out there trying to get this thing to come towards their van. I [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8112.360000000001s)]
*  had no idea. He says, I don't know what they were going to do. Put it in the van? He had no idea [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8118.360000000001s)]
*  what they were trying to do. But he stopped and he said, what are you doing? He says, well, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8121.8s)]
*  we got this baby thing, we're trying to save it. He said, what the fuck? Get in your van and drive [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8124.360000000001s)]
*  off. He said, this is how this works. And they go, but it's not going to find its mother. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8128.12s)]
*  Have you ever seen the Instagram page, Torons of Yellowstone? It's one of my favorite. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8131.96s)]
*  Torons? Like morons that are tourists? Torons of Yellowstone? It's a great Instagram page. It's all [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8139.08s)]
*  assholes taking selfies with deer and selfies with bison. It's people trying to feed bears. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8146.2s)]
*  And it's all people just getting fucking thrown through the air by giant bisons. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8155.56s)]
*  I love that when they're like this and it's right behind them and they're just trying to get that [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8160.52s)]
*  picture. And once that bison starts staring, once it starts staring at you, you got problems. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8165.08s)]
*  Look at this one. This is one I saw the other day. These people are right, this black bear is eating [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8171.96s)]
*  fish right on the edge of this lake and they're getting right up to it. These kids are literally [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8176.2s)]
*  16 inches away from this fucking thing. And he gets closer too, by the way. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8184.2s)]
*  Look at the kid in the red jacket. He said, yeah, get our picture. Come on, I got my thumbed up. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8187.88s)]
*  One of them winds up touching it. Holy shit. Yeah, he reaches over at the end of this stupid [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8191.0s)]
*  fucking video and touches it. And the bear is just like, get the fuck out of here. I'm trying to eat. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8196.68s)]
*  They don't care, but they're so habitualized to being around people. No wild bear, a truly wild [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8201.960000000001s)]
*  bear would ever allow this. This is just a bear. They start eating people's garbage. They start [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8207.4s)]
*  taking fish from fishermen and that kind of shit. And look at this kid taking this selfie. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8213.56s)]
*  He gets closer. This fucking dumbass. Look at this fucking stupid kid. Look, [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8218.92s)]
*  he's going to move in and touch it. Oh yeah. That could have been the end of your life, buddy. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8223.72s)]
*  Holy shit. And look, he's got flip flops on. These kids, they're so silly. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8228.359999999999s)]
*  We go up fishing in Alaska and I'll tell you one thing we're not going to do. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8232.519999999999s)]
*  Bear comes out of the brush. We're not going to stop and take a selfie. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8239.32s)]
*  No, don't take a selfie. No, no, not at all. Alaska though, there are scared of people [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8242.6s)]
*  because they hunt them in Alaska. It's the only state in the United States. And they want to open [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8246.76s)]
*  up a season in Montana. And there's arguments about that right now because of the interactions [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8251.4s)]
*  that people are having with bears. This is part of what the governor of New Jersey ran on, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8255.800000000001s)]
*  that he was going to stop the bear hunt. And people are like, yeah, stop the bear hunt. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8260.76s)]
*  That shit lasted one year. And there were so many problems with bears. They said, all right, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8265.960000000001s)]
*  you're right, you're right. And then they reintroduced the bear hunt. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8270.36s)]
*  Most of those are black bears, right? Oh, that's only black bears. But New Jersey [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8272.68s)]
*  has more black bears per capita than any other state in the United States, which is nuts. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8276.2s)]
*  Yeah. You always forget the New Jersey, A, how big it is, but also just how green it is. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8281.08s)]
*  It's fucking rural. New Jersey is like Newark and Hackensack and those places. And then rural. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8284.36s)]
*  It's all pine flats and all the rest of it. Oh, mountains. You get into the woods of New Jersey. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8291.720000000001s)]
*  It's fucking real woods. And it just doesn't seem like it should be because New Jersey is the [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8297.8s)]
*  Sopranos. In our mind, it's, oh, it's Tony Soprano. Oh, go to the Italian. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8303.16s)]
*  Yeah. There's nothing green about Newark. Yeah, that's what we think about with Newark. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8307.88s)]
*  We think about- Is that your Soprano voice? [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8311.96s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, big pussy. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8313.8s)]
*  You excited about the JFK files release? We haven't even talked about that. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8317.16s)]
*  I feel like Charlie Brown with Lucy keeps pulling that football away. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8321.0s)]
*  Today's the day. I'm going to kick that football. And then she fucking yanks that football and [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8329.72s)]
*  Charlie goes flying through the air and lands on his head. That's how I feel. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8333.64s)]
*  It's going to be the way it is too. I think they'll actually kick out the door. This time around, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8336.92s)]
*  I don't think they can hold any more documents. And they don't have that many left to hold. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8342.12s)]
*  I think they just found thousands of new documents. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8345.8s)]
*  They found 2,400 more. That is actually a good way. The FBI says, oh, look at this. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8348.04s)]
*  What they did was they did a review. They started in 2020 and they said, okay, all our closed cases, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8352.68s)]
*  we're going to start compiling all of them in one place. Why weren't they doing that [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8359.640000000001s)]
*  40 years ago, 50 years ago? How do you not do that? Have a central repository? Anyway, [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8367.160000000002s)]
*  so they said, this is what we're going to do. So they did and they said, we're updating the way [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8370.76s)]
*  that we digitize and hold onto all our records. And during the course of that, then when Trump [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8374.12s)]
*  issued his executive order about the release of the files and also for RFK and MLK, then the Bureau [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8381.08s)]
*  says, well, we were able to, because we'd done this digitizing and this way of tracking our records, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8387.160000000002s)]
*  we were able to find 2,400 documents that are related that we just didn't know about. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8391.800000000001s)]
*  So there's those, and then there's maybe 5,000 other documents left that haven't been released. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8397.400000000001s)]
*  Trump was quoted as saying that if you saw what they showed me, you wouldn't release it either. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8404.28s)]
*  Right. What does that mean? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8409.560000000001s)]
*  What can that mean? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8412.44s)]
*  It's a really good question. Here's what I think. I think, and I don't, obviously, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8413.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what's in those documents either. Wait a minute, you don't? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8418.76s)]
*  Remember, I was a toddler when he was shot. Although that would have been the perfect cover [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8422.36s)]
*  because nobody's fucking looking for a toddler to come behind that. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8428.519999999999s)]
*  A toddler with a magnifying glass. Come off that grassy knoll. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8433.16s)]
*  It's not like they're going to say in the documents, we did it. So what could the [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8438.359999999999s)]
*  documents have that would be so incriminating that they wouldn't want to release them? What [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8443.64s)]
*  would you document if you assassinated the president? We'd say, well, me and Mike, [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8449.48s)]
*  we're sitting over here on the grassy knoll. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8453.08s)]
*  In their way. I think some of the documents, the redactions are really pedestrian. They've redacted [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8455.24s)]
*  in the old days, they redacted a person's name who was an investigator or a social security number of [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8463.48s)]
*  somebody who was interviewed or something like that. But there's whole pages that are redacted. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8469.720000000001s)]
*  Right. Those are weird. What's going on there? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8473.56s)]
*  I think they held on to, Biden administration held on to 2000 some odd documents. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8476.6s)]
*  In 2017, they were supposed to release them. Then this was when the Trump administration [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8482.68s)]
*  didn't do it and that's when people got mad. Like, hey, you said you were going to do it. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8488.12s)]
*  This time they are saying they're going to do it. Then they got this hot lady who's involved in all [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8492.44s)]
*  this, which is odd. Why'd they pick her? [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8496.6s)]
*  Yeah. Why'd they pick her? Is she a JFK expert? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8501.560000000001s)]
*  I think she's an assassination expert. Well, it's not just assassination. She's [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8505.16s)]
*  in charge of UFOs too, right? Right. And Epstein and all the rest. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8508.92s)]
*  I think what we're going to find is, this is just me speculating obviously, but I think what we're [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8512.359999999999s)]
*  going to find with the released documents is A, there's no smoking gun. B, it's not going to [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8517.16s)]
*  stop people from believing what they believe. It's not going to put anything to rest. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8525.16s)]
*  I think also there probably will be, one of the reasons I think some of these things were [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8530.679999999998s)]
*  withheld was because it's embarrassing perhaps to the CIA and the FBI also in terms of their [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8535.8s)]
*  collaboration. Look, Lee Harvey Oswald was on their radar for good reasons, for counterintelligence [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8543.88s)]
*  reasons. He had lived over in Minsk. He defected to the Soviet Union. He'd lived over there for [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8549.64s)]
*  three years, came back. And so that in alone puts him on the radar. Now suddenly he's a CIA concern. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8556.359999999999s)]
*  So the CIA is definitely monitoring him. And then he goes down to Mexico. He goes to the Cuban and [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8565.4s)]
*  Soviet embassies. He's desperate to get involved in the revolution, even though the Soviets by that [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8571.72s)]
*  time had decided he's a complete loser. Does that have the narrative though? Do we know what they [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8578.119999999999s)]
*  really decided? Well, I think, I'm just speaking again from experience in intelligence community, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8584.92s)]
*  at a certain point you look at somebody and go, there's nothing here. This person is more of a [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8591.64s)]
*  liability than an asset. Well, wouldn't that be the perfect person to make a Patsy? Well, [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8596.039999999999s)]
*  unless they decided the guy is just unstable. Look, I mean, reportedly he was finally granted [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8600.359999999999s)]
*  permission to exist in the Soviet Union after he tried to kill himself. When they said they [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8608.68s)]
*  were going to send him back, he couldn't stay there. How did he try to kill himself? No idea. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8613.0s)]
*  I don't know that part of it. So my point is that I think he was on the radar. And I think what [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8617.88s)]
*  happened was in the documents we may find that the CIA at the time was not proactive enough and they [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8625.16s)]
*  didn't work well with the FBI. There was real friction between those two. And I think that [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8633.64s)]
*  if they had, if they had brought in the FBI and formed them and said, look, we've got the Cuban [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8640.6s)]
*  embassy and the Soviet embassy down in Mexico under observation. We've had this guy on a radar [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8646.36s)]
*  for some time. He's now come back to Dallas and New Orleans. He's back in the States. We've got to [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8650.52s)]
*  keep an eye on him. I think if they had done that, maybe history changes, but I don't think they did. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8655.640000000001s)]
*  Obviously. Yeah, but this is assuming that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, which I'm not buying [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8661.480000000001s)]
*  into. Under this scenario. Yes. I'm not buying that at all. But I think that's what we're going [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8665.640000000001s)]
*  to see in some of this documentation. Well, if Trump really did say that, that if they showed [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8669.32s)]
*  you what they showed me, you wouldn't release it either. It has to be something. And that something [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8674.84s)]
*  might be a second shooter. Well, it's not. Or more. I agree because Trump has never been known to say [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8679.880000000001s)]
*  anything hyperbolic. So I mean, there's a chance that he was, you know, I don't know. Okay. He [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8685.16s)]
*  attempted suicide, a striking indication of how much he desired to remain in the Soviet Union. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8692.6s)]
*  Showed how willing he was dramatically and decisively when he faced an emotional crisis [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8698.52s)]
*  with few readily available alternatives at hand. He was shocked to find that the Soviet [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8703.08s)]
*  Union did not accept him with open arms. The entry in his self-styled historic diary for October [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8707.72s)]
*  21st, 1959 reports, I am shocked to exclamation points, my dreams exclamation point, I have waited [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8713.96s)]
*  two years to be accepted. My Fonz dream. I don't even know what that means. Fondest. Fondest. It's [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8720.2s)]
*  probably they forgot the T. He can't spell this. Fuck. My fondest dreams are shattered because of [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8725.96s)]
*  a petty official. I decided to end it. Soak fist in cold water to numb the pain then slash my left [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8731.32s)]
*  wrist. What a pussy. The then plague wrist. Oh, plug then. Then plunge. Plunge wrist. Boy, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8737.88s)]
*  you can't spell plunge either. Then plunge. Plunge. So he spells plunge. P-L-A-U-G. I guess it's plunge. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8745.72s)]
*  Wrist into bathtub of hot water. Somewhere a violin plays as I watch my life whirl away. I think to [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8752.039999999999s)]
*  myself how easy to die and a sweet death to violins. Oswald was discovered in time to thwart [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8757.48s)]
*  his attempted suicide. He was taken to a hospital in Moscow where he was kept until October 28th, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8763.4s)]
*  1959. Still in tent, however, in staying in the Soviet Union, Oswald went on October 31st to the [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8768.6s)]
*  American embassy to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Mr. Richard A. Snyder, the then second secretary [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8774.439999999999s)]
*  and senior consul officer at the embassy, testified that Oswald was extremely sure of himself and [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8781.64s)]
*  seemed to know what his mission was. He took charge in a sense of the conversation right from [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8787.88s)]
*  the beginning. He presented the following signed note. I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8793.0s)]
*  my present citizenship in the United States of America be revoked. And then they let him back in [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8801.8s)]
*  the United States. So this is why the more tinfoil hat wearing amongst us, say this fucking guy, [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8806.6s)]
*  he was working for the government. This was all bullshit. They were setting it up and they were [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8813.640000000001s)]
*  using him as a patsy. Oh no, I know that's, I mean, there's obviously like there's a strong [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8817.48s)]
*  belief that the CIA was involved, the mob was involved. And again, hey, I haven't seen all the [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8821.720000000001s)]
*  documents like, you know, Trump has. So I, you know, everything's on- I wonder if he's even seen them all. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8827.0s)]
*  Everything's on the table. I don't know if he's seen everything either. What, has he gone through [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8831.48s)]
*  all the files? Yeah, is he sitting there in his office, drinking Diet Coke, reading the documents? [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8834.36s)]
*  Who knows? But I think, you know, and who else, who else said he's, Cash Patel said he's seen all the [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8837.960000000001s)]
*  files. Oh, okay. He said he's seen everything. Now I'm not sure how, in what capacity, that was he [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8843.640000000001s)]
*  part of a review committee perhaps? I don't know. Interesting. But- We'll find out, right? Yeah, [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8849.0s)]
*  we'll find out. Well, you have long said that you think that the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8854.36s)]
*  was fishy. Yeah, yeah, I really do. I believe that. And I also, it's interesting that [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8860.52s)]
*  his family doesn't want this released. They don't want the remaining documents released. And I think [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8865.4s)]
*  the reason there is because, look, they, you know, Hoover and the federal and state law enforcement [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8871.32s)]
*  had a real hard on for Martin Luther King, obviously, right? And they were covering him [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8878.12s)]
*  three ways to Sunday. So including wiretaps, some that were signed off by RFK, right, by Robert [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8883.48s)]
*  Kennedy. So as attorney general. So I think, you know, the family is like, look, do you really need [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8890.199999999999s)]
*  to release these records? Because I think they're worried about, you know, embarrassing information [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8896.68s)]
*  about their, perhaps about his lifestyle. Hasn't a lot of that already been released? Yeah, it's [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8900.76s)]
*  been talked about and everything. But I think if you dump it out there, you know, whereas, [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8904.199999999999s)]
*  whereas with RFKs, or sorry, with JFKs documents, look, they've released some 5 million pages of [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8910.039999999999s)]
*  his, right? I mean, estimates are like, oh, we've released like 99% of the documents. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8915.88s)]
*  Right. It's not that it's not that high a percentage with MLK. So I think there's a potential for [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8919.8s)]
*  embarrassment. But I also, same thing, I don't think in those documents, because I don't think [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8925.72s)]
*  anybody's gonna, if they're not going to self incriminate, right? And I do think that there was [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8930.92s)]
*  something going on. Look, James Earl Ray is a much more interesting case study, I think anyway, [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8935.96s)]
*  than Lee Harvey Oswald. James Earl Ray and his behavior leading up to the shooting at the Lorraine [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8941.16s)]
*  Motel, kind of going off the radar, disappearing, the guy, you know, the guy couldn't keep himself [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8949.16s)]
*  out of jail. He was a failed petty thief, right? And he was just a fuck up. And then suddenly he [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8954.84s)]
*  disappears off the radar screen, and he shows up and he, you know, looks like a college professor. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8960.84s)]
*  And he's kind of got his shit together. And, you know, then after shooting him, he ends up in [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8966.12s)]
*  Belgium. He got money and guns. Yeah, he got money and guns. He had suddenly he had a bag full of [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8970.84s)]
*  cash to go buy himself a Mustang, which he used to drive around the south and kind of be off the [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8975.960000000001s)]
*  grid. I don't know. That one strikes me as and then the sort of the interplay with with federal [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8981.32s)]
*  and state and local law enforcement to me. But again, my point is that they released the [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8988.44s)]
*  documents. What do you think there's going to be some note in there saying must kill MLK? Yeah, [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8993.640000000001s)]
*  you know, somebody talked to Hoover. So that's why it's fun to think like, what are they going to [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=8998.2s)]
*  what's the JFK document is going to say? What is the MLK? What is what are they going to tell us [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9003.0s)]
*  about UFOs? But how much are they documenting? Like, if someone is involved in killing the [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9006.6s)]
*  president, I would imagine they wouldn't write that down. Yeah, you would think, right? Imagine [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9012.2s)]
*  Kyle, we're going to need you to make a statement here about shooting. So I think that there's [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9018.199999999999s)]
*  there's probably I don't know why I picked the name Kyle. That seems odd name for a shooter. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9022.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was. It wasn't a popular name, I don't think back then. But I just so I think you look, [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9027.08s)]
*  release everything. If they don't release all the documents at this stage, if they say we're going [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9033.32s)]
*  to we're going to hold on to or redact 1000 pages. What the hell are they doing? That doesn't make [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9037.8s)]
*  any sense. Doesn't make any sense. 1963. Just put it put it to fucking rest. And if there's [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9043.56s)]
*  embarrassing things in there, then then own it, right? Accept it, and fucking move on. But again, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9048.279999999999s)]
*  it's not going to change the narratives that are out there. I don't think I don't think there's [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9053.72s)]
*  going to it's not going to satisfy anybody. Wasn't it also a problem with so much time has passed [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9057.88s)]
*  that the waters are so muddy, in terms of like trying to see clearly exactly what happened and [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9063.32s)]
*  when it went down and how it went down, unless they did somehow another document everything, [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9069.72s)]
*  which seems insane, that they thought that they were just tucked that away somewhere. Yeah, it [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9075.88s)]
*  doesn't seem realistic. It doesn't know. It seems much more likely that that would be something that [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9080.279999999999s)]
*  you would have a conversation about in a closed room. And you know, yeah, if there was actually a [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9085.0s)]
*  cadre of people that did that, it's not in the documents, right? It's it's because those [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9090.92s)]
*  documents are like interviews of people on the grassy knoll interviews of people who knew Jack [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9095.4s)]
*  Ruby in his, you know, life. My friend Evan Hafer has an interesting perspective on it, you know, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9100.84s)]
*  Special Forces guy. He thinks that those guys who got fucked over at the Bay of Pigs when they [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9107.4s)]
*  didn't get air support from Kennedy, that if you were going to find a group of hardened individuals [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9113.16s)]
*  that were essentially assassins for the government, those would be the guys that would have a bone to [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9119.24s)]
*  pick with JFK. Yeah, yeah. I mean, again, until everything's visible and out there, I think [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9125.88s)]
*  everything's on the table. He's not wrong in the sense that they hated Kennedy, you know, but a [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9132.84s)]
*  lot of people hated Kennedy. The mob hated, you know, RFK immensely, right? Oh, yeah. Because he [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9138.119999999999s)]
*  wouldn't play ball. Well, also, he fucked them over because they got him elected in Chicago and [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9142.68s)]
*  they turned on them and then they started investigating them and like, hey, motherfucker. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9147.08s)]
*  Yeah. And then and then depending on who you talk to, Jack Ruby was either mobbed up or he did it [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9150.68s)]
*  because he was Jewish and he and he didn't want, you know, the Jewish community to take that or [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9156.36s)]
*  the MK Ultra version is the best version. That's Sir Hans Sir Han, Charles Manson, everything. Yeah. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9162.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I say it again, but read Chaos by Tom O'Neill, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. No, MK Ultra [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9168.6s)]
*  that is a dark history or chapter in the history of the agency. There's no doubt about it. And again, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9174.28s)]
*  it's one of those cases where you can't it's like we talked about with Alan Dulles saying, as far as [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9179.560000000001s)]
*  I know, we've never overthrown a country. It would be like if I sat here and said, well, as far as I [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9183.640000000001s)]
*  know, we never did anything. Of course, of course, it was never done any mind control. Yeah. Of course, [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9187.560000000001s)]
*  they did. Yeah. It was it was like the experimentation that went on and it was outsourced. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9191.880000000001s)]
*  Did you see the most recent thing that people are saying about China? I think Kurt Metzger sent it [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9196.28s)]
*  to me so I know it's got to be accurate. He's not out of his mind. Something about some new thing [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9201.16s)]
*  that they found, some Chinese mind control thing where you saw that, Jamie? The stuff that they [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9209.96s)]
*  burned the ether, that thing. I don't know. They burned the cryptocurrency and the guy said that [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9218.119999999999s)]
*  they're being taken over by. Yeah, that has to be it because it was going viral like yesterday. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9222.039999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. How would I miss this? I was not on Kurt Metzger's email list. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9226.36s)]
*  Actually, I just checked. It wasn't Kurt. He spent like a million dollars to do that. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9233.960000000001s)]
*  They're like wasted. That's how people saw it, I guess. It's a better way to put it. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9236.92s)]
*  What are you talking about? What I'm talking about is some mind control thing that they're [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9240.36s)]
*  involved with with like their version of like a Neuralink. Oh, OK. There's more than one different [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9244.92s)]
*  scenario that they're picking. This is crazy because what goes around comes around, right? [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9252.6s)]
*  Everything that's old is new again because when we talked about MKUltra, the whole reason behind [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9256.44s)]
*  MKUltra was fear that the Soviets were engaged in mind control. This is a different one. Someone [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9261.0s)]
*  burned 500. Yeah, this is it. ETH to accuse Chinese head fund CEOs of using brain computer weapons. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9266.68s)]
*  Allegations of mind control tech spark a crypto donation spree amid intrigue in Chinese finance [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9275.0s)]
*  circles. Yeah, this is it. So this dude, how do you say that name? Hulazi? Hulazi? Hulazi burns 603 ETH [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9281.96s)]
*  to allege Chinese hedge fund CEOs use of brain computer weapons. Large donations totaling of [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9291.16s)]
*  one thousand nine hundred fifty ETH. That's Ethereum. Were made to various addresses including [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9297.88s)]
*  WikiLeaks in Ukraine. A self-identified Chinese programmer has burned 603 ETH, approximately 1.6 [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9304.839999999998s)]

*  Chinese against executives of a Chinese hedge fund. And so this guy, I don't understand why he's [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9323.56s)]
*  donating the money. Yeah, I'm not getting this. So people would see it essentially. OK, he sent [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9329.4s)]
*  500 ETH to the burn address with this message. The CEO of Quandai Investment, Feng Jin and Zhu [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9335.56s)]
*  Yu Ji. I say it. Yu Ji. Yu Ji. Use brain computer weapons to persecute all company employees and [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9345.4s)]
*  former employees. And even they themselves were controlled like what? OK, the individual identifying [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9353.24s)]
*  as Hu Lezi sent multiple on chain messages accusing Quandai Investment CEO Feng Jin and Zhu Yu Ji [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9361.88s)]
*  of using what they term brain computer weapons against employees and former employees. Quandai [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9372.519999999999s)]

*  That old story. Yeah, so scroll down. It says this is a new mode of crime which the victim [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9385.8s)]
*  is gradually deprived of his senses of desire until he becomes a complete slave to the digital [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9390.68s)]
*  machine. And if one day I become a victim of the final stage, I will leave the world. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9396.36s)]
*  As the brain computer interface and mind reading technology keeps developing, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9402.2s)]
*  there is a new mode of crime in which wild animals become puppets or complete slaves [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9406.92s)]
*  to the digital machine. I saw this on South Park. It was the the human caterpillar episode. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9413.0s)]
*  Wow. OK, so I don't understand, and Jamie, maybe you do, why burning through and donating, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9419.32s)]
*  why putting all that money just to get it seen? It would draw a lot of attention to it that someone [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9426.36s)]
*  just just literally like lit a million and a half dollars on fire. So that's it. That's really. Yeah, [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9430.84s)]
*  just kidding. Same reason people light themselves on fire. Yeah. Wow. Get their message. OK. Get [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9436.6s)]
*  attention. Wow. Whether or not it's true, that doesn't. Right. Right. Right. It doesn't mean it's [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9441.4s)]
*  true. Well, it could be just China bullshitting us and saying that they have this. Yeah. Well, [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9445.48s)]
*  but again, the amazing thing is, is that is it like everything kind of repeats itself, I suppose. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9449.72s)]
*  You could look at it that way. I'm not going to go into some grand thought, but look, I mean, [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9455.48s)]
*  we're engaged in World War One style warfare in Europe now, right, with trench warfare between [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9459.48s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia. This we're talking about mind control from Chinese regime, right? There was a [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9465.0s)]
*  that was what started MK Ultra was fear of the Soviets and the North Koreans. Right. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9471.16s)]
*  Getting engaged in mind control and the worry that we were somehow behind the curve and that [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9475.8s)]
*  they had this technology capability to control minds. And so next thing you know, MK Ultra is [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9480.36s)]
*  born and I wonder what's the method they're supposedly using to control these people's minds. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9487.24s)]
*  There was pretty vague slaves to the digital machine. Like what? There's a different article [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9493.16s)]
*  saying the same kind of stuff we said with a couple more of the messages. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9497.48s)]
*  Elaborates and alleged activities they're engaged in, which include deploying [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9500.76s)]
*  brain computer chips to control all citizens until they become complete, complete slaves. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9504.36s)]
*  The digital machine, Simini Distraught Lazy, who described himself as an ordinary computer [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9509.400000000001s)]
*  programmer and entrepreneur. That's what I'd say too, if I work for the Chinese government claims [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9514.76s)]
*  he's been controlled by the mind control organization from the time he was born, [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9518.52s)]

*  they had a chip in his brain. Is that what he's saying? That's not real. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9528.04s)]
*  No. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9530.92s)]

*  Yeah. I'm concerned over the legitimacy of this. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9533.400000000001s)]
*  Or if they did, I'm concerned it's still the active brain. Like how do you not have brain cancer? [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9535.720000000001s)]

*  the mind control. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9570.44s)]

*  oftentimes you'll see some of this and I'm using big words and I'm talking about that. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9576.119999999999s)]
*  And it's like the fucking UFO hearings up on Capitol Hill. I don't know how many times I've [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9580.6s)]
*  had to sit and listen to, I've seen some stuff. I can't tell you what the stuff is. It's hidden [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9586.68s)]
*  stuff, but I've seen some stuff. I know. I get so tired of it all. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9591.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I think there's something out there. Again, I agree with you in the sense that we're [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9595.08s)]
*  certainly not the only ones out here floating around. I don't know what it means. I don't know [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9606.2s)]
*  whether we've been visited or anything like that, but every time there's a UFO hearing, [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9611.240000000002s)]
*  it's sort of that same thing. It's that tantalizing, oh, look, he's talking, he's talking. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9616.68s)]
*  And the thing about the release of those documents though, that seems to me that that's [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9620.6s)]
*  something that you would document. So rather than say, I killed JFK, where do I sign? Instead of [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9625.880000000001s)]
*  that, that's more tangible. If the government had recovered some crash in 1947 in Roswell, [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9632.68s)]
*  New Mexico and it really was an alien spaceship, that seems like something they would document. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9641.880000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I agree. And I think that's worth pursuing in a big way. They should, [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9645.880000000001s)]
*  there needs to be more transparency about it. And it's also the same like with the COVID files, [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9651.960000000001s)]
*  if there's such a thing as COVID files. But sure, go through and look. I mean, transparency, [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9658.44s)]
*  to the degree that you can, where you're not releasing national secrets that are going to [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9662.76s)]
*  get people killed, great. But the Epstein files, so I think there's real value in saying we've got, [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9666.68s)]
*  because the government always overclassifies, always overclassifies. And it's unnecessary [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9674.68s)]
*  and it creates this distrust, I think, half the time of the public. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9681.800000000001s)]
*  For sure. Yeah, they're just like, what the fuck, [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9686.12s)]
*  we don't believe anything you're saying now. So release everything, let the chips fall. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9687.88s)]
*  Because I don't think, honestly, I don't think there's a lot of information there. But I do [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9692.839999999998s)]
*  think with the UFOs, all the documentation and the investigations that took place of unknown [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9696.279999999999s)]
*  sightings, but it's still going to not convince people that we're not holding on to crashed [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9702.92s)]
*  spaceships. Right. Well, when you've got guys like David Grush, who's the whistleblower that comes [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9710.759999999998s)]
*  out and says, not only do we have these ships, but we have biological entities. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9715.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, then, maybe explain yourself a little more. You've already come out, [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9720.519999999999s)]
*  you kind of like opened your kimono a little bit, just fucking say what you know, and then put it [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9727.48s)]
*  to rest. Maybe you got an obligation to do that. I mean- [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9733.08s)]
*  I think he wants to, according to him, but he has to get clearance. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9735.64s)]
*  He's already, yeah, he's already, he's already pushed that door open, right? I mean, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9741.32s)]
*  I don't know. As an individual, right? So- [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9744.6s)]
*  He explained on the podcast that he's authorized to say what he's already said, but nothing more, [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9746.36s)]
*  and he has to be very careful. But then again, it's like, how do I know? [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9751.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. How do I know that's not horse shit? [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9754.28s)]
*  I know. And that's the problem. And that's going to be the problem with the release of the files is- [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9755.800000000001s)]
*  Also, if I was to obscure some sort of a government propulsion system that's like 50 years ahead of [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9759.880000000001s)]
*  anything we could imagine, that's how I would do it. I'd obscure it by saying, oh, there's some [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9765.0s)]
*  alien technology that's available and we don't really know how to use it, but they do visit us [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9769.56s)]
*  from time to time and occasionally they crash. They came over to New Jersey, the drones over New [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9773.96s)]
*  Jersey. Right. Now the Trump administration has said those were, they were running some tests, [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9779.64s)]
*  those were ours. Yeah. Yeah. So why wouldn't the Biden administration say that? What the hell? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9783.72s)]
*  Fuck. I mean, what's the point? Maybe you should tell me. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9788.039999999999s)]
*  Well, I do know, but I'm not authorized to say. We got to get you in a skiff. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9790.92s)]
*  But I know some stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just can't say the stuff anyway. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9795.64s)]
*  Listen, Mike, it's always great to talk to you. It's been a blast as always. Tell everybody about [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9799.48s)]
*  your show, where they can watch it. Oh, thank you. Yeah. And listen to the presidential briefing. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9803.72s)]
*  I can't think of a way I'd more rather spend my 20th wedding anniversary than right here. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9809.56s)]
*  You want to go out to dinner? Here it is, the President's Daily Brief with Mike Baker. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9815.96s)]
*  Subscribe YouTube, President's Daily Brief on YouTube. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9820.68s)]
*  That's very easy to listen to. 20 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the afternoon. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9825.16s)]
*  We just cover the news. We don't tell you how to think about it. It's a top stories happening [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9828.84s)]
*  around the globe. And I like the idea that it's not, it's not an opinion show. I mean, occasionally [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9833.16s)]
*  something sneaks in, but for the most part, we try to keep it based on the facts. And it's, [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9838.28s)]
*  it's really simple. It's, and you can find it again at President's Daily Brief on YouTube. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9842.28s)]
*  A real need for something like that today. Well, you know, it's doing really well because I think [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9847.32s)]
*  people will actually want that nowadays. And they also like the, they like the brevity of it, right? [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9851.48s)]
*  Nobody wants to listen to me for, well, I don't know, hours, but anyway. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9855.56s)]
*  We just did. We just did. All right. Hey, thank you, Mike. Appreciate you. All right. Bye everybody. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRH02-Z8F34&t=9859.16s)]
