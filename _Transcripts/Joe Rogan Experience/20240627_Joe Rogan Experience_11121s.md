# Joe Rogan Experience #2104 - Chris Williamson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6.0s)]
*  Cheers, sir. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=14.0s)]
*  Mmm. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=16.0s)]
*  What is that, black rifle? Black rifle, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=18.0s)]
*  What's up, Chris? What's up, baby? How are you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=20.0s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=22.0s)]
*  So, how long have you been in Texas now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=24.0s)]
*  Two years. Wow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=26.0s)]
*  So, do you like this is where you live, or do you like... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=28.0s)]
*  This feels like home. Really? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=32.0s)]
*  I went back home for Christmas in the UK, and it's so strange to go back to a place that you know so well, you're super familiar with, but you're kind of different. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=34.0s)]
*  And everything's changed, but everything's the same, and you fall back into old patterns. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=42.0s)]
*  You remember that tree that you used to walk past on your morning walk and all of... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=46.0s)]
*  It's very disquieting, but it's fun. It's nice. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=50.0s)]
*  The oddest thing for me is the contrast in the amount of freedom you have for things that you would never think were important. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=52.0s)]
*  Like these little nicotine things. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=59.0s)]
*  In California, you can't buy this because it's flavored. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=62.0s)]
*  In California, you can put a tent in front of people's houses and fucking cook meth, and no one says anything. No one does anything. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=68.0s)]
*  You could commit violent crime, and you get arrested and released with no bail. They'll never find you again. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=77.0s)]
*  The laws are so ridiculous, but you are not allowed to have flavored nicotine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=84.0s)]
*  Flavored nicotine is dangerous, Chris. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=91.0s)]
*  They're trying to ban flavored vapes in the UK very aggressively. Super aggressively. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=93.0s)]
*  That being said, I think it's like some non-insignificant percentage of school children are using vapes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=101.0s)]
*  It's very addictive. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=107.0s)]
*  There's a no vapes sign in schools. That wasn't something that was already self-evident. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, cigarettes were a big deal when I was in high school. A lot of kids smoked cigarettes. It was a cool kids thing to do. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=115.0s)]
*  What's the smoking age in America? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=122.0s)]
*  I think it's 18. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=124.0s)]
*  Legally, yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=126.0s)]
*  Legally? Yeah, it's 18. But when I was a kid, people got cigarettes. Someone got you cigarettes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=127.0s)]
*  I don't know. When I was young, I remember before I turned 18, they changed the legal drinking age. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=132.0s)]
*  Because the legal drinking age, I believe, used to be 18. And then they bumped it up to 21. I was like, damn it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=138.0s)]
*  Dude, have you ever seen the video of when DUIs came in in the 1980s and they're interviewing people in cars? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=143.0s)]
*  That is one of my favorite videos of all time. Please, Jamie, let me watch that video again. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, the lady's like, we're going to bring in communism. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=156.0s)]
*  I don't know what the world's coming to. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=160.0s)]
*  Maine can't work all day. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=162.0s)]
*  And she's got a kid. She's got a baby in the passenger seat. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=164.0s)]
*  No seatbelt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=167.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=168.0s)]
*  And even if you did have a seatbelt, there's no airbags. Those things are death traps. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=169.0s)]
*  It's one of my favorite videos. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=172.0s)]
*  There's this weird, it's something I've noticed since being in America, your guys' relationship with drink driving is a little bit more lax than it is in the UK. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=174.0s)]
*  Really? Not in Texas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=183.0s)]
*  If you have any alcohol in your system at all, they'll arrest you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=185.0s)]
*  Like if you get pulled over and they said, have you had anything to drink? And you say, yes, I've had one drink. You're getting arrested. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=189.0s)]
*  I fucking love this video. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=196.0s)]
*  Drinking and driving here is viewed by some as downright undemocratic. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=197.0s)]
*  It's kind of getting common this one. The fellow king put in a hard day's work, put in 11, 12 hours a day, and then get in your truck and the lease rank one or two beers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=201.0s)]
*  Look at the baby. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=210.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's wearing a seatbelt. It looks like the baby. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=216.0s)]
*  The baby is more protected than I thought it was. It had that thing in front of it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=223.0s)]
*  A little cushion in front of it. So it seemed like she was like a little bit more. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=224.0s)]
*  The funniest thing about that is their issue is it's not with not being allowed to drink, then drive. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=226.0s)]
*  There's this one worse. It's drink and drive. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=233.0s)]
*  You mean I can't drink and. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=235.0s)]
*  At the same time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=237.0s)]
*  Instantly. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=238.0s)]
*  I love that video. Oh my God. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah, you definitely shouldn't drink and drive. That's true. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=243.0s)]
*  But also you don't really want people telling you what you can and can't do. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=247.0s)]
*  And once they start doing it with anything, Bill, you won't bring in communism. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=251.0s)]
*  I see it's cartoonish. It's very cartoonish when they're saying that. It's very ridiculous. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=256.0s)]
*  Kind of they have a point that this is the only point. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=262.0s)]
*  If you let someone tell you what you can't do, they're going to expand that power of telling you what you can't do. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=271.0s)]
*  Always. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=272.0s)]
*  One of the problems is that puts sobriety was somehow not fitting with the American way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=273.0s)]
*  What? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=278.0s)]
*  Measuring sobriety. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=279.0s)]
*  OK, hold on a second. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=281.0s)]
*  OK, during the 1950s, the American public and the judicial system were still erring on the side of the drunk driver. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=282.0s)]
*  And oddly enough, some people were concerned with the mechanization of measuring sobriety was somehow not fitting with the American way. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=288.0s)]
*  Kind of isn't. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=294.0s)]
*  It kind of isn't. But also, you shouldn't drink and drive. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=296.0s)]
*  Like, both things are true. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=299.0s)]
*  We should teach people that you should never fucking do that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=301.0s)]
*  I went to high school with a kid. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=304.0s)]
*  And he was a good guy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=306.0s)]
*  I knew him from the time I was like 14. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=309.0s)]
*  And then when I guess a senior in high school, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=311.0s)]
*  he was drunk and he crashed his car and killed his friend. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=314.88s)]
*  And I remember running into him on the street, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=317.84s)]
*  we were both walking and I walked by him [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=321.38s)]
*  and he's had his head down. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=324.22s)]
*  And you know, I wasn't good friends with him, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=326.84s)]
*  but I was friends with him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=328.42s)]
*  I always said hi to him. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=329.26s)]
*  I said hi to him. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=331.0s)]
*  I said, hey man, how you doing? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=331.84s)]
*  He's like, he was done. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=332.68s)]
*  He was done. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=335.6s)]
*  His life was over, man. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=336.44s)]
*  He wasn't a regular kid anymore. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=338.2s)]
*  He was a kid who killed his friend [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  in a drunk driving accident. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=343.64s)]
*  It was a different human, like his life. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=344.96s)]
*  He was this one guy, he was a good normal guy, fun guy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=347.52s)]
*  People liked him. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=350.3s)]
*  He was a friendly guy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=351.24s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, a pariah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=353.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, everyone knows what you did. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=355.41999999999996s)]
*  All of a sudden, what you did, you can't believe you did. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=357.38s)]
*  This horrible, horrible, horrible thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=360.44s)]
*  And you did it when you were so young. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=363.12s)]
*  The kid. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=364.52s)]
*  He was 16, 17, whatever he was. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=365.36s)]
*  He didn't know what he was doing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=367.8s)]
*  He had no idea. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=368.88s)]
*  Nobody, no, you're so stupid when you're that young. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  Your brain's not formed yet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=373.24s)]
*  And you can't treat them like they're adults. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=375.32s)]
*  You just can't. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=377.74s)]
*  They're not adults. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=378.76s)]
*  You're talking about a 16 year old kid, a 15 year old kid? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=381.12s)]
*  Like, fuck. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  When they're doing things, they don't even know what's real. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=385.28s)]
*  I mean, and it's all completely dependent [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=388.52s)]
*  upon how they were raised. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  Like, you could get really lucky and have solid parents [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=393.0s)]
*  and really have a good understanding [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=396.72s)]
*  of how to behave in the world. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=399.0s)]
*  Or you could get fucked and you got some dad [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=401.04s)]
*  who beats the shit out of you and he's always on meth [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=404.24s)]
*  and your mother's a fucking liar and she steals money [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  and she sells people stuff. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=411.24s)]
*  You know, that could be your reality too. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=414.24s)]
*  And to expect a person like that to behave exactly [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=416.56s)]
*  the way you do with your nice life is crazy. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=420.56s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's one of the weirder things that we do. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=425.72s)]
*  And instead of looking at the origins of, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=427.76s)]
*  what are the origins of horrible behavior? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=432.8s)]
*  It's all terrible childhoods. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=435.16s)]
*  It's almost all terrible childhoods. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=437.0s)]
*  Instead of looking at that, all we look at is a crime. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=439.52s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=442.2s)]
*  It's a weird thing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  It's like to know logically that you just have to take [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=444.92s)]
*  a few extra steps and you say, well, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=447.88s)]
*  what's the root of this problem? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=449.48s)]
*  And how do we address that? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=450.88s)]
*  How do we make it better? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=451.9s)]
*  We have so much money for other things. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't have any money for that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=455.36s)]
*  That seems like one of the most fundamental problems [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=458.12s)]
*  any country would face is the amount of people [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=461.32s)]
*  that grow up that become violent criminals [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=464.04s)]
*  because they were fucked from the time they were young. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  They had no shot at life. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=470.52000000000004s)]
*  Their whole childhood was just violence and chaos. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=472.2s)]
*  And that's not an insignificant number of people [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=477.16s)]
*  in this country. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=480.16s)]
*  And yet any foreign conflict has to be addressed [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=481.36s)]
*  with the utmost urgency. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  When the things that are paramount to our daily existence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=488.0s)]
*  right here, with what our tax dollars pay for right here, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=492.04s)]
*  are just completely ignored, completely ignored, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=496.32s)]
*  never discussed, they'll talk to you about climate change. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=500.76s)]
*  Climate change, let me tell you something. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  If you live in the South Side of Chicago and you get shot, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=505.8s)]
*  climate change doesn't mean jack shit to you, okay? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=507.68s)]
*  We should address what the fuck is going on right now, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=510.68s)]
*  not climate change. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=514.52s)]
*  Do you know what the ideas of luxury beliefs are? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  You heard of this? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=519.16s)]
*  No. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=520.0s)]
*  So it's been repopularized by my friend, Rob Henderson. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=520.82s)]
*  So luxury beliefs are ideas held by the upper classes [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=522.88s)]
*  that confer status on them, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=527.36s)]
*  but often cause costs for the lower class. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=528.84s)]
*  So the seminal example of this is defund the police. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  I walked past a house in Austin, not far from where I live, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=536.48s)]
*  that has a defund the police flag in the garden out front [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=539.86s)]
*  and a private security sticker in the front window. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=544.9000000000001s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=548.1s)]
*  It's such a virtue. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=556.58s)]
*  Do you know Will Storr? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=559.22s)]
*  Of course, he's been on my show. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=560.5s)]
*  I went for breakfast with him yesterday. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=561.7s)]
*  He's great. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=562.9000000000001s)]
*  He's fantastic. Of course you don't. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=563.9000000000001s)]
*  Will Storr, who wrote that book, The Status Game, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=565.7s)]
*  was explaining all this and what people are doing, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=567.98s)]
*  what they're actually doing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=570.86s)]
*  He's outstanding. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=572.1s)]
*  So good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=573.3000000000001s)]
*  It relates it to so many behavior patterns in life. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=574.54s)]
*  It's just like, oh my God, this all makes sense. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=577.26s)]
*  He's a legend of storytelling. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=579.1800000000001s)]
*  He's one of the best writers in the UK. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=580.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's this really interesting example of, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=582.9s)]
*  my friend Mary Harrington talks about how [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=586.66s)]
*  the death of chivalry has caused an increase [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  in domestic violence. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=592.14s)]
*  So it's very interesting. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  So this is a good example of this luxury beliefs thing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=594.26s)]
*  So yes, during the 1960s and 70s, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=596.46s)]
*  if you were an upper class lady [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=600.5s)]
*  and the guys that you were dating were from households [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=602.02s)]
*  that had two parents that had taught them [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=605.34s)]
*  how you're supposed to treat people [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=606.98s)]
*  and they weren't mistreated and all the rest of it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=608.26s)]
*  They grew up like a well-balanced person. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=610.58s)]
*  To them, it might seem a little bit patronizing [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  for the guy to hold the door for you, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=614.6600000000001s)]
*  Or to pull the chair out [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=616.6600000000001s)]
*  or to make sure that you get home okay. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=617.82s)]
*  Because you live in existence in which the danger [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=619.5400000000001s)]
*  of that not happening, not going appropriately, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  isn't that great. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=625.34s)]
*  Now, what wasn't understood by a lot [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=626.74s)]
*  of the upper class feminists that were talking [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=628.82s)]
*  about this derogation of chivalry that they wanted [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=631.26s)]
*  was that that doesn't necessarily work [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=634.46s)]
*  for the working class or the underclass woman [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=636.22s)]
*  who is dating a man whose father beat him [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=638.86s)]
*  or stepfather beat him or didn't have a father [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=641.94s)]
*  or was homeless or addicted to drugs or in violent crime. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=643.9s)]
*  And she thinks it's a direct line, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=646.46s)]
*  a single spectrum from you should hold the door open [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=648.22s)]
*  for women to you shouldn't beat your wife. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=651.22s)]
*  And I think that it's true. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=653.6600000000001s)]
*  Women should be seen as something [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=655.5400000000001s)]
*  that requires additional protection, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=657.22s)]
*  that are precious and should be respected. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=659.7800000000001s)]
*  If you derogate the stuff up here, sure, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=662.74s)]
*  maybe it means that you liberate some of the working, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=664.94s)]
*  the upper class women to be able to go [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  and do whatever they want. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=668.74s)]
*  But what does this cause downstream [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=669.82s)]
*  when you don't have those guardrails in place [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=671.82s)]
*  for the men that the lower class women are dating? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=673.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, just all men, period. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=676.0200000000001s)]
*  And it should be, and it's, here's the thing, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=678.5400000000001s)]
*  this is how it's looked upon in the martial arts world. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  If I know that I can fuck you up and I fuck you up, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm probably a bad person. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=691.22s)]
*  It's never good that a guy who is like some trained killer [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=693.78s)]
*  goes after some regular guy, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=700.1s)]
*  picks a fight with him and fucks him up. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=702.98s)]
*  It's never thought of as good. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=704.54s)]
*  It's always negative, like almost entirely negative. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=706.62s)]
*  Like the entire fan base [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=709.5s)]
*  will recognize that terrible behavior. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=711.34s)]
*  So if you're a man and you have someone who is your wife [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=715.38s)]
*  and she's smaller than you and female, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=721.5s)]
*  you have the craziest advantage physically. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=725.46s)]
*  It's the most awful tyranny physically [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=728.34s)]
*  if violence is involved. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=731.42s)]
*  If you decide that you're gonna start swinging [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=733.1s)]
*  teaching people lessons and then lying to police [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=736.1s)]
*  about how someone got hurt and oh, she fell down the stairs. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=740.62s)]
*  And if you grow up seeing that, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=744.86s)]
*  that's even maybe more fucked up [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=747.54s)]
*  because that's your model for, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  and that's probably what their model was [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=753.02s)]
*  when they were growing up. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=754.5799999999999s)]
*  But it's, as men, we have to look at that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=757.02s)]
*  as the weakest of most disgusting behaviors. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=761.14s)]
*  Including beating up on people that are weak. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=766.18s)]
*  Well, that's the reason for the male monkey dance [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  as it's called. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=771.5s)]
*  The reason for that is that it's rivalry [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=772.34s)]
*  between two potentially matched males [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=775.86s)]
*  and we don't know who's going to win. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=780.02s)]
*  That's the reason for the conflict. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=782.22s)]
*  If there's a huge disparity, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=784.22s)]
*  what's the point for the conflict? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=785.78s)]
*  You already know who's going to win, right? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=787.06s)]
*  That's why beating up a 70 year old guy [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=789.34s)]
*  or a 10 year old boy isn't a big deal. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=791.62s)]
*  But if you're a 21 year old dude that's about this high, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=793.94s)]
*  this is exactly why you have weight classes, right? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=796.0600000000001s)]
*  It's to create this degree of intrigue [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=798.7s)]
*  and fairness in the rivalry. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=801.98s)]
*  100%, 100%. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=803.46s)]
*  Yeah, if a heavyweight beat up on a bantamweight, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=805.94s)]
*  everyone would be furious. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=808.86s)]
*  But that's what a lot of men are and a lot of women are. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=810.6600000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=813.46s)]
*  If that happened in the male martial arts world, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  people would be furious. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=816.58s)]
*  It's just fucking, it's horrible. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  It's weird that it's always been a part of cinema. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=824.1s)]
*  There's always been scenes [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=827.46s)]
*  like James Cagney smacks a girl in the face. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=828.5400000000001s)]
*  And there was one, God, I wish I could remember the movie. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=831.22s)]
*  It was so crazy. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=835.1s)]
*  But it was like a 1950s movie [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=836.78s)]
*  and the dad was spanking the wife, spanking her, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=839.22s)]
*  had her over his knee. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=843.62s)]
*  And the young girl was saying [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=845.82s)]
*  that that's how he shows mommy that he loves her. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=850.18s)]
*  God, you remember that movie, Jamie? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=855.42s)]
*  I know we played it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=857.1s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=858.1s)]
*  It was like this insane scene from a movie [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=859.82s)]
*  where you're like, what? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=862.1s)]
*  What the fuck am I watching? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=863.26s)]
*  But it's a time capsule into this evolving understanding [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=864.3s)]
*  of how human beings interact with each other. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=868.94s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=870.66s)]
*  And it's a time capsule from less than 100 years ago. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=871.5s)]
*  What was that super famous? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=874.1800000000001s)]
*  Is this Shirley Temple? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=875.7s)]
*  Yes, yes, it's Shirley Temple. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=876.7s)]
*  Bro. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=879.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=890.42s)]
*  Dude, you darn tootin'. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=892.02s)]
*  Darn tootin' I am. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=894.98s)]
*  The guy's got someone's daughter over his knee [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=895.98s)]
*  and he's spanking her into submission. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=900.78s)]
*  Spanking her, holding her and spanking her. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=903.7s)]
*  That means you love her, Shirley Temple says. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=906.46s)]
*  Shirley Temple was like the propagandist. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=908.86s)]
*  She was like a young propagandist. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=911.34s)]
*  I can't tell if that's actually her. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=912.66s)]
*  I'm trying to type it in and it's not. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=913.58s)]
*  It's not her? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=915.14s)]
*  So it might be someone else. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=915.98s)]
*  How many of them were there? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=917.02s)]
*  How many of them young famous girl actors were there? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=918.14s)]
*  How many of them came out great? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=921.66s)]
*  Zero? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=923.74s)]
*  It's a mixed bag. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=924.58s)]
*  Britney Spears is a work in progress. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=925.4s)]
*  I do not think children should be developing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=929.38s)]
*  in front of the world. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=932.22s)]
*  I think that's an insane amount of pressure. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=933.26s)]
*  I think becoming famous in front of the world [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=935.3000000000001s)]
*  is an insane amount of pressure. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=937.82s)]
*  Becoming a child as you're growing up, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  you're in front of the world, that's not manageable. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=943.0200000000001s)]
*  No one's designed like that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=945.9000000000001s)]
*  You're gonna blow the hardware. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=947.34s)]
*  I had this idea about, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=948.98s)]
*  we always hear the problems of child stars, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=950.5400000000001s)]
*  Macaulay Culkin, Britney Spears, too much fame, too young. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=952.86s)]
*  And I don't disagree that thinking about, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=955.58s)]
*  oh my God, this person's basically never known the world [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=957.86s)]
*  without adoration and attention and focus and scrutiny [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=961.7800000000001s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=964.98s)]
*  But there's a really interesting question [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=966.7s)]
*  about what happens if you're a, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=968.0600000000001s)]
*  let's say for example, Canadian psychologist [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=970.9000000000001s)]
*  who's been working away in the dusty annals [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=973.86s)]
*  of some university for a while. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  Yes, well. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=977.82s)]
*  And out of nowhere, you get thrust into the limelight [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=979.62s)]
*  and then this bald MMA commentator [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=983.1400000000001s)]
*  plucks you out of obscurity [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=984.98s)]
*  and now you're one of the most talked about people [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=986.5400000000001s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=991.1s)]
*  The interesting thing here is, as the child, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=992.4200000000001s)]
*  yes, you didn't know what the world was like before. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=994.78s)]
*  I understand that can be disquieting. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=996.62s)]
*  But what about when you had a sense of self? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=998.26s)]
*  What about when you thought you knew who you were [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1000.86s)]
*  and your place in the world [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1002.86s)]
*  and your place in the status hierarchy as Will would stay? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1003.98s)]
*  What about that? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1007.26s)]
*  And then you just get ripped from your moorings [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1008.1s)]
*  and you're just out in space [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1009.66s)]
*  and the ISS is going past you and you're. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1011.06s)]
*  You're certainly gonna make some mistakes. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1014.06s)]
*  There's no way around it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1016.42s)]
*  You've never managed those waters before. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1017.62s)]
*  If you just get in a raft for the first time [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1020.06s)]
*  and you're going down white waters to navigate, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1022.8199999999999s)]
*  you're probably gonna fall in. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1025.7s)]
*  You're probably not good at this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1026.54s)]
*  You don't know how to do that. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1027.38s)]
*  If the acceleration is quick as well. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1028.22s)]
*  Yeah, if you're in a kayak and you're hitting rocks, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1029.14s)]
*  you're probably gonna fall in. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1032.58s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you're doing. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1033.9s)]
*  But once you figure out what you're doing, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1035.06s)]
*  then you can kind of achieve some sort of level of balance. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1037.22s)]
*  But for him, I think a lot of it was exacerbated [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1040.34s)]
*  by the benzodiazepine thing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1043.7s)]
*  So he was taking anti-anxiety medication. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1047.3s)]
*  He didn't understand when it was prescribed to him [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1050.1s)]
*  how addictive it was [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1052.94s)]
*  and what the consequences were of getting off of it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1053.9s)]
*  And he talks about it a lot. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1057.5400000000002s)]
*  And I think he was sick for over a year. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1058.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that there's a number of psychiatrists [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1061.46s)]
*  that are hesitant about prescribing that [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1064.0600000000002s)]
*  for more than a couple of days. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1065.94s)]
*  And Jordan was on it for months and months and months. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1067.74s)]
*  It seems like even for a couple of days, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1069.94s)]
*  you're like, you're just kissing death. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1071.7800000000002s)]
*  I just wanna kiss you death. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1073.8600000000001s)]
*  Have you seen the Instagram account Mug Shorties? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1076.22s)]
*  No. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1080.26s)]

*  This is one of the greatest things on the internet. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1083.1s)]
*  I can't believe I get to teach you about Mug Shorties. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1085.22s)]
*  Come on, JMo, let's do this. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1087.7s)]
*  So it's images, mug shots of girls [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1091.02s)]
*  that have been taken in for questioning. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1094.78s)]
*  So it'll say in the top, in the description, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  what they've been charged for. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1102.5s)]
*  Look at the comment below. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1104.26s)]
*  She's driving me while intoxicated. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1107.98s)]
*  Your honor, we're under her influence. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1110.46s)]
*  Her eyes are intoxicating. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1113.3s)]

*  and well-constructed stuff in advance [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1323.02s)]

*  all of those things, the ability for someone [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1332.3799999999999s)]
*  to just turn it on like that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1334.3s)]
*  The verbal sparring aspect of it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1336.3s)]

*  And then there's some comics [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1339.54s)]
*  that aren't really good at that. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1340.74s)]
*  They're not good at dealing with audience members [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1342.3799999999999s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1344.5s)]
*  They're not good at answering questions. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1345.34s)]
*  But they're good at long takes on things [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1347.06s)]
*  where they sit alone in contemplation [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1350.98s)]
*  and go over some ironic aspect of a topic [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1353.26s)]
*  and then they write out really good material about it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1355.94s)]
*  It's still super valid. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1358.34s)]
*  It's like, there's no one that's better than the other. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1360.14s)]
*  But there's different personalities that get attracted [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1362.58s)]
*  to the idea of constructing a stand-up comedy routine. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1367.78s)]
*  And for some personalities, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1370.78s)]
*  they're not like a conflict personality [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1373.1s)]
*  or a yeah, well, you're a this. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1375.34s)]
*  They're not that guy or that girl. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1376.78s)]
*  They're someone who gets some subject bothers them, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1378.98s)]
*  whatever it is, climate change, whatever it is. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1383.8999999999999s)]

*  And then they'll be alone. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1388.8999999999999s)]
*  They'll be in front of the computer. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1390.4199999999998s)]
*  They'll get a notebook out. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1391.98s)]
*  They just sit on it for fucking days sometimes, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1393.1799999999998s)]
*  bounce it around, back and forth, twist it around, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1396.02s)]
*  start it from this way, start it from the back, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1398.6599999999999s)]
*  back it up, go from the conclusion first [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1401.34s)]
*  and then explain your conclusion in a hilarious way. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1404.58s)]
*  See if it works better that way. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1407.9399999999998s)]
*  And you'll do that. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1409.5s)]
*  And then that type of comic, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1411.34s)]
*  like that mindset can create great bits. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1413.02s)]
*  They're great comics, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1416.26s)]
*  but they just don't like to do the audience thing. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1418.02s)]
*  But that's okay too. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1420.06s)]
*  It's like, you can't ask someone [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1421.06s)]
*  to change their personality, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1423.9399999999998s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, and he's not physically imposing whatsoever. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1433.86s)]
*  So it makes it even more brutal when he comes after you. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1437.62s)]
*  The same with Michael Malis. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1440.06s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1441.22s)]
*  Michael once told me, he said, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1442.62s)]
*  I couldn't get away with half of the shit that I say [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1443.7s)]
*  if I wasn't five foot seven. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1445.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it helps. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1447.1399999999999s)]
*  It certainly helps. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1448.22s)]
*  It helps to be, yeah, like someone who you can't hit [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1449.1s)]
*  because they're weaker than you. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1452.78s)]
*  Yeah, but Tony walks that fucking line. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1454.5s)]
*  Woo. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1457.62s)]
*  Whitney was telling me before, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1458.74s)]
*  I did a little tour toward the back end of last year, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1460.6200000000001s)]
*  which was pretty interesting. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1462.42s)]
*  And I was saying, what should I expect? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1463.5800000000002s)]
*  She says, expect to get a bit more boring as it goes on. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1465.3s)]
*  It's like, what do you mean? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1468.06s)]
*  She said, well, in order for art to imitate life, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1468.98s)]
*  you have to live a life. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1472.3s)]
*  And the problem is, if you're on the road, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1473.94s)]
*  all you know are airports and hotels and dinners and shows. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1476.1000000000001s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1480.26s)]
*  And she was saying that she was [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1481.3400000000001s)]
*  in a Hollywood script writer's meeting. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1482.42s)]
*  And they were saying, it's a Saturday morning. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1485.38s)]
*  Where is she? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1487.3s)]
*  Someone shouted from the back. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1488.14s)]
*  She's at a baby shower. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1489.14s)]
*  Whitney was like, who goes to a baby shower? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1490.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, she's doing a wine tasting. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1492.46s)]
*  She's like, no one goes to a wine tasting. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1494.38s)]
*  And the room turned and apparently said, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1496.8200000000002s)]
*  no, Whitney, you don't. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1497.98s)]
*  Like other normal people do that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1500.3400000000001s)]
*  So you've got this vicious trap of success. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1502.5s)]
*  It must happen with musicians as well. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1505.6200000000001s)]
*  How are you supposed to, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1508.26s)]
*  if you're some heartfelt singer talking about your makeups [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1510.38s)]
*  and breakups of relationships, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1514.22s)]
*  and now you're dealing with the fear of me too. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1515.66s)]
*  That doesn't exactly give sort of beautiful romance [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1518.6200000000001s)]
*  around what you're talking about. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1521.22s)]
*  The same thing goes for comedians. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1522.0600000000002s)]
*  Same thing goes for anything. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1523.18s)]
*  The whole point of what you're trying to do [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1525.0600000000002s)]
*  is be a representation, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1526.5s)]
*  be representative for the normal person. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1527.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1529.42s)]
*  And the more that your life becomes strange [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1530.5s)]
*  and rarefied and on the road, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1533.1000000000001s)]
*  the less of that you get to experience, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1535.3400000000001s)]
*  which is less inspiration for the art. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1536.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a matter of like, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1539.22s)]
*  what are you doing when you're on the road? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1541.42s)]
*  Are you on the road just to make money? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1543.46s)]
*  Because then you just have to just treat it [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1545.1399999999999s)]
*  as a very fortunate job. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1546.5s)]
*  And you definitely are not gonna get [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1548.62s)]
*  the same kind of life experience. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1550.4199999999998s)]
*  You're not. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1553.4599999999998s)]
*  You're just not. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1554.62s)]
*  You're gonna be traveling all the time, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1555.5s)]
*  and you're gonna be staying in hotels, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1557.3799999999999s)]
*  you're gonna be doing gigs. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1558.62s)]
*  Most of your time you'll be thinking about [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1559.6599999999999s)]
*  doing the material that you prepared [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1560.8999999999999s)]
*  and getting your set together. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1562.4199999999998s)]
*  But you could still take stuff in if you choose to. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1564.5s)]
*  You can go to cities and check out museums. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1568.9399999999998s)]
*  You can go to cities and go on a tour [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1571.3799999999999s)]
*  of the town. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1574.58s)]
*  You just have to be proactive. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1575.82s)]
*  And you could watch documentaries. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1577.6999999999998s)]
*  I like to watch documentaries on the road. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1579.82s)]
*  I try to educate myself more on the road [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1581.5s)]
*  than watching something just entertaining. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1583.54s)]
*  So I'm on the road, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1586.06s)]
*  I'm supposed to be doing stand-up, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1587.46s)]

*  other than just performing and traveling. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1598.82s)]
*  But you have to choose to. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1602.4199999999998s)]
*  You have to choose to go to the gym. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1603.78s)]
*  Like when everyone's like, how's the jet lag? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1605.6599999999999s)]

*  It's just like a thing you have to do. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1609.54s)]
*  It's like jumping in the cold water. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1610.98s)]
*  Like it sucks, but if you do it, you'll feel better. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1612.94s)]
*  You gotta go right to the gym. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1615.54s)]
*  Like the moment you land, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1616.74s)]
*  plane lands, check into your hotel, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1618.74s)]

*  Go to the fucking gym. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
*  Or do a hotel workout. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1626.42s)]
*  You could do a great body weight workout. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1627.54s)]
*  You could do a yoga routine in your hotel room. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1629.98s)]
*  Staying in hotels with gyms is the easiest hack for that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1631.26s)]
*  Oh it's so nice. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1634.8600000000001s)]
*  If you go to a hotel and they have kettlebells, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1635.7s)]

*  and you'll settle in. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1646.24s)]
*  All that jet lag shit, it's nonsense. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1647.46s)]
*  It all goes away, even when you travel. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1649.26s)]
*  When I go to overseas, it's like, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1651.1000000000001s)]
*  just fucking workout one day really hard. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1652.34s)]

*  It's like a threshold. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1658.1000000000001s)]
*  You wanna really sweat, really get something, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1659.86s)]

*  Describing his experiences in the First World War, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1979.5s)]
*  he wrote, frankly, I had enjoyed the war. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1981.82s)]
*  There's dudes like that out there. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1987.1799999999998s)]
*  You just have to know there's guys like that out there. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1988.9399999999998s)]
*  This guy's story, let me tell you about him, man. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1991.2199999999998s)]
*  So he gets born in 1882, aristocracy in Belgium, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1993.58s)]
*  and you think he's just gonna go through [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=1998.58s)]
*  the typical aristocratic route. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2000.26s)]
*  He goes to Belial College in Oxford. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2002.86s)]
*  His father wants him to go and study law. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2005.1s)]
*  And you think, right, that's the end of the story there. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2007.4599999999998s)]
*  At 19, he decides that he wants to go and see war, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2010.02s)]
*  sneaks away without telling his father, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2013.2199999999998s)]
*  and literally offers himself to either the Boers [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2015.8999999999999s)]
*  or the British, the British take him. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2018.06s)]
*  So he was like, I just want to be in war. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2020.1399999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2023.1399999999999s)]
*  His father doesn't know. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2024.1s)]
*  So he's away in war. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2025.5s)]
*  He gets shot in the leg and the groin, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2026.6999999999998s)]
*  gets shipped back home. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2028.3799999999999s)]
*  His father says, you were supposed to be in university, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2030.06s)]
*  you've now been shot. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2033.06s)]
*  Okay, well, I'll bless this new military campaign [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2034.6200000000001s)]
*  you want to go on. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2036.98s)]
*  He says, I want to be redeployed. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2037.82s)]
*  Gets redeployed again to South Africa. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2039.38s)]
*  He was at the head of the Camel Corps, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2041.66s)]
*  which was literally a group of people [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2043.58s)]
*  who rode into battle on camelback. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2046.3s)]
*  So he gets shot, he gets shot in the ear, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2049.2200000000003s)]
*  and then in the eye, and then a bullet ricochets [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2052.18s)]
*  and hits him in the same eye again. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2054.66s)]
*  He's leading these guys into battle. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2057.62s)]
*  He gets sent back home. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2060.3s)]
*  The British military say, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2062.38s)]
*  he wants to go out on the First World War. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2065.26s)]
*  He wants to go to the front lines of the First World War now. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2066.82s)]
*  But they said, we can't send a guy with one eye out there [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2068.7000000000003s)]
*  because it's going to look like we've got really weak soldiers. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2071.0200000000004s)]
*  So they give him a glass eye and say, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2073.38s)]
*  the only way that you can go back out [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2074.5800000000004s)]
*  is if you wear this glass eye. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2075.82s)]
*  And he says, oh, okay. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2076.82s)]
*  In the taxi leaving the hospital, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2077.94s)]
*  takes it out, throws it out of a window [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2080.46s)]
*  and starts wearing an eye patch. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2081.86s)]
*  The first battle that he's in, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2083.5400000000004s)]
*  when he rejoins the army in World War I, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2085.5800000000004s)]
*  a piece of shrapnel explodes his hand [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2090.18s)]
*  and all that's left are two fingers hanging on [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2092.2599999999998s)]
*  by the skin of the palm of his hand. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2094.5s)]
*  And his watch actually embeds itself in his arm too. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2096.7799999999997s)]
*  So this is the first thing that he's encountered again, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2099.98s)]
*  goes to the field hospital. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2103.66s)]
*  The doctor declines to amputate the fingers. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2105.02s)]
*  So he just rips them off in front of him [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2107.8199999999997s)]
*  because he's in so much pain. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2110.2999999999997s)]
*  The arm then has to be amputated. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2111.7799999999997s)]
*  So he says to the guys again, I want to be redeployed. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2113.8199999999997s)]
*  They're like, you are now a one-eyed amputee. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2115.8599999999997s)]
*  I want to be deployed. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2120.06s)]
*  Battle of the Somme, his next battle that he goes into. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2121.2999999999997s)]
*  There's reports from other soldiers seeing Carton Duart [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2124.34s)]
*  running into battle, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2128.22s)]
*  pulling the pins out of grenades with his teeth, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2129.58s)]
*  throwing them at the enemy [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2132.22s)]
*  and reloading a revolver with one hand. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2133.2599999999998s)]
*  So this guy is a single armed killer. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2135.98s)]
*  During that, he gets shot in the, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2138.62s)]
*  he gets shot through the back of the head. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2140.7s)]
*  Through the head. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2144.02s)]
*  Doesn't die. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2145.5s)]
*  In subsequent battles, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2146.82s)]
*  oh, he got promoted for 24 hours [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2148.06s)]
*  before he threatened to punch his superior [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2151.14s)]
*  and then got demoted again. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2153.38s)]
*  So he's just like this totally wild dude. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2154.82s)]
*  Anyway, he goes through this series of different, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2157.14s)]
*  difficult military exposés. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2161.14s)]
*  He takes over three squadrons [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2163.38s)]
*  who don't have a commanding officer. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2164.98s)]
*  None of them have any communication. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2166.86s)]
*  So he, this one armed, one-eyed guy, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2168.86s)]
*  decides to run back and forth [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2171.54s)]
*  between the three different companies, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2173.7s)]
*  communicating his own orders. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2176.58s)]
*  Rather than using a messenger, he just does it himself. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2178.02s)]
*  That was what he got the Victoria Cross for, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2180.42s)]
*  which is our equivalent of the Medal of Honor. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2182.22s)]
*  During this time, he shot a bunch more. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2184.14s)]
*  You think, right, okay, this guy's just led [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2186.42s)]
*  the most insane campaign through the Boer War [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2189.1s)]
*  and the First World War. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2192.86s)]
*  Time for him to retire. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2193.9s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2195.7799999999997s)]
*  60 years old, in 1940, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2196.62s)]
*  he gets conscripted and drawn back up [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2199.54s)]
*  to help run secret missions. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2202.14s)]
*  So his first mission, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2204.38s)]
*  one of his first missions, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2205.74s)]
*  he gets shot down in a fjord going toward Romania. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2206.58s)]
*  There's a German plane that shot his plane down, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2209.9399999999996s)]
*  circling overhead. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2213.3799999999997s)]
*  Rather than get into the dinghy, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2214.62s)]
*  because it would be an easy target, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2216.18s)]
*  this one armed, one-eyed guy, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2217.98s)]
*  and all the rest of the crew just bob under the water [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2220.1s)]
*  until this German fighter plane runs out of ammunition. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2222.9399999999996s)]
*  That goes away. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2226.8199999999997s)]
*  He finally gets picked up. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2227.66s)]
*  Second time he goes up in a plane. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2228.8199999999997s)]
*  This plane crash lands, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2231.1s)]
*  and he swims to shore carrying a injured comrade [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2233.46s)]
*  who survives. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2239.14s)]
*  One arm, but swims carrying this other dude, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2240.1s)]
*  gets captured by the Italians. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2243.54s)]
*  He's then part of five escape attempts [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2245.2200000000003s)]
*  and digs a 60 meter tunnel with one arm [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2248.02s)]
*  and a bunch of other dudes. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2250.94s)]
*  Then he spends a full week hiding out in Northern Italy, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2252.42s)]
*  despite the fact that he's 62 years old, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2256.38s)]
*  one armed, one-eyed, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2258.94s)]
*  can't speak Italian and has covered in scars. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2260.18s)]
*  Then he finally, finally gets picked up and released. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2264.06s)]
*  They said that the only thing that the Italians [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2267.1s)]
*  had left to do was to use him to enable an armistice. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2268.8999999999996s)]
*  They wanted to no longer be a part of the war. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2271.98s)]
*  They use Carton-du-Watt to be an envoy [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2274.54s)]
*  between the two nations. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2278.3399999999997s)]
*  And they said, well, you've been a prisoner of war [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2280.66s)]
*  for nine months. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2282.2999999999997s)]
*  You don't look or smell the way that you should do. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2283.14s)]
*  Why don't we give you a nice Italian tailor? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2285.8999999999996s)]
*  And he rejected their offer to give him an Italian suit [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2288.58s)]
*  and said he would only wear one [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2293.14s)]
*  if they got it from Savile Row, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2294.34s)]
*  because quote, he didn't want to look like a gigolo. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2295.74s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2298.7s)]
*  This guy's a human badger. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2304.62s)]
*  He's 31 medals, shot nearly as many times, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2306.66s)]
*  got used, he insulted Mao, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2310.02s)]
*  he insulted Chairman Mao in China [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2312.2999999999997s)]
*  when he got used by Winston Churchill. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2314.34s)]
*  There's photos of him stood behind Churchill, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2316.3s)]
*  eye patch, just a fucking sleeve. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2318.7400000000002s)]
*  And he's my new, look at him, look at him. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2322.1400000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2329.2200000000003s)]
*  One of the coolest people from history [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2330.1400000000003s)]
*  that no one knows about. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2332.0600000000004s)]
*  What an animal. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2332.9s)]
*  What an animal. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2335.5s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2337.94s)]
*  Why hasn't anybody done a movie on that guy's life? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2340.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2343.1800000000003s)]
*  There's another that doesn't even really [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2344.02s)]
*  have a particularly good book. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2347.06s)]
*  He wrote a memoir called Happy Odyssey, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2348.06s)]
*  which is like, it's written by him [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2349.78s)]
*  as opposed to a bit more exciting. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2352.1s)]
*  Alistair Urquhart, this guy called The Forgotten Highlander. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2354.78s)]
*  This is probably one of my favorite books. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2358.22s)]
*  I taught Ryan Holiday about this [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2359.86s)]
*  and it fucking blew his mind. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2361.02s)]
*  So this dude was 18 years old [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2363.06s)]
*  and got conscripted in World War II. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2365.46s)]
*  He was Scottish, Scottish regiment, gets sent to, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2367.78s)]
*  I think Singapore, then Japan joined the war. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2370.42s)]
*  The Japanese just invade fucking everywhere, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2374.3799999999997s)]
*  take everything that they can, including him. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2375.8199999999997s)]
*  So this guy is made to forced march for weeks [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2378.7799999999997s)]
*  with nothing, a loin cloth, bloody feet [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2383.2599999999998s)]
*  being cut up by the surroundings. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2385.66s)]
*  He has every tropical disease under the sun [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2387.46s)]
*  for five years straight. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2390.46s)]
*  Dysentery and malaria and everything that you can get. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2391.9399999999996s)]
*  Probably yellow fever and full works. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2394.7799999999997s)]
*  He's part of the forced labor group [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2396.66s)]
*  that's made to build the bridge over the river Kwai, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2398.58s)]
*  famous movie. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2400.74s)]
*  One of the prison guards tries to sexually assault him. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2402.98s)]
*  So he kicks him in the nuts and runs away and hides. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2406.1s)]
*  But there's not much, like what are you gonna do? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2408.54s)]
*  What are you gonna run to? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2409.7799999999997s)]
*  You can't survive without the meager amounts of rice [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2410.62s)]
*  that they're giving you. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2412.8199999999997s)]
*  So they find him and lock him in an open tin box [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2413.8599999999997s)]
*  to bake in the sun for three days, doesn't die. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2417.02s)]
*  Like, right, okay, well this guy's sufficiently resilient. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2421.54s)]
*  We can probably use him. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2423.3799999999997s)]
*  If he's this resilient to survive this, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2424.3799999999997s)]
*  he'd probably be a good worker. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2425.74s)]
*  So let's keep him and we'll do the rest of it. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2426.7s)]
*  So they then pull him out. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2428.8199999999997s)]
*  They need to transport all of these prisoners. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2430.34s)]
*  So they put them on what they called a hell ship. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2433.2200000000003s)]
*  These hell ships were just huge tin boxes [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2436.02s)]
*  with no Swiss cross on the side, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2438.54s)]
*  which is what you should have to say [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2440.3s)]
*  that you're transporting prisoners of war [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2441.54s)]
*  so that it's not a military vehicle. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2443.1400000000003s)]
*  And they would just toss tiny morsels of food [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2444.7400000000002s)]
*  down to a hundred men that were in the hold of this ship. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2447.6200000000003s)]
*  And it was baking hot in the midday sun [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2451.5s)]
*  as they're traveling over the water. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2453.82s)]
*  And these guys still doesn't die. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2455.38s)]
*  They're stood in their own feces. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2457.02s)]
*  People are dying left and right, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2458.6200000000003s)]
*  starting to decompose. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2459.9s)]
*  So because they didn't put the Swiss cross on the side, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2462.14s)]
*  a US military, I think it was a boat or a submarine, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2466.34s)]
*  sent a torpedo at them. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2469.6600000000003s)]
*  So his boat that he's on explodes. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2471.26s)]
*  He then catches a piece of flotsam or jetsam or detritus, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2475.42s)]
*  like a little bucket that he can sit in [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2479.02s)]
*  so that he can float around. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2480.94s)]
*  Basically has a fight with another Japanese guy [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2482.54s)]
*  who's also doing the same thing, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2484.78s)]
*  finally washes up on shore. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2486.7000000000003s)]
*  He's free briefly, but he's in Japanese territory. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2489.5s)]
*  I can't remember what country he washes up on, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2492.94s)]
*  maybe Singapore again. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2494.5s)]
*  He then gets recaptured, put back to work again [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2496.22s)]
*  and gets knocked off his feet [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2499.06s)]
*  by the bomb blast from Nagasaki. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2500.46s)]
*  He gets hit by the bomb blast [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2503.1s)]
*  and knocked off his feet by it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2504.5s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2505.82s)]
*  50 years, this guy doesn't talk about it at all. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2509.34s)]
*  Doesn't say a peep for 50 years [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2512.7799999999997s)]
*  by orders of the British government. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2514.5s)]
*  And then finally writes this memoir [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2516.02s)]
*  as a call to arms to bring the Japanese [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2517.9s)]
*  to account for the atrocities. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2520.3s)]
*  We had the Nuremberg trials and stuff for the Germans, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2521.7000000000003s)]
*  but there wasn't that similar kind of reckoning [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2523.94s)]
*  for the Japanese. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2525.94s)]
*  And he thought this is unforgivable [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2526.78s)]
*  because of what he went through. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2529.02s)]
*  For the rest of his life, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2530.1400000000003s)]
*  he could only eat tiny, tiny amounts of rice. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2531.06s)]
*  His stomach, his whole digestive system [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2534.54s)]
*  was ruined by starvation, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2536.1400000000003s)]
*  just extended starvation for this five-year period [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2537.7000000000003s)]
*  and very, very tiny morsels of food. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2541.1400000000003s)]
*  So his stomach had adapted to that. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2543.94s)]
*  And that was this guy. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2545.3s)]
*  And then he died in the early 2000s [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2546.82s)]
*  and then wrote this book, The Forgotten Highlander. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2548.7400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2550.5800000000004s)]
*  I gotta get that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2552.6200000000003s)]
*  It's so fucking good, man. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2553.5400000000004s)]
*  That's on the list now. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2554.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2556.38s)]
*  Yeah, I read The Rape of Nam King. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2557.46s)]
*  Years ago. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2563.5800000000004s)]
*  It's about Japan during the war. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2564.78s)]
*  What they did in China. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2568.5800000000004s)]
*  Just the atrocities they did with people's children, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2571.3s)]
*  their babies in front of them, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2575.42s)]
*  like the way they just tortured people. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2576.6600000000003s)]
*  What people can justify doing in times of war [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2580.1400000000003s)]
*  is absolutely terrifying. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2584.1400000000003s)]
*  And when you read about it [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2586.6600000000003s)]
*  and you read about it from a time [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2587.7400000000002s)]

*  when we do that. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2679.9s)]

*  It's like, this is their chance. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2796.66s)]
*  This is what I think most people don't understand about evil. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2798.9s)]

*  I thought it'd be more action. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2957.86s)]
*  That's okay, Warren, don't worry about the soap. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=2961.6200000000003s)]

*  Fucking brilliant, dude. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3016.94s)]
*  But it's a sign of the times. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3017.86s)]
*  It's like that, did we find out [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3019.7799999999997s)]

*  I don't wanna have to pull it back up. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3026.38s)]
*  Frontier Gal is what the movie was called. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3029.62s)]
*  Frontier Gal. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3031.7s)]
*  And it wasn't Shirley Temple, Beverly Simmons is the name. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3032.94s)]
*  So that was a time capsule. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3038.34s)]
*  And Rambo is a time capsule too. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3041.06s)]
*  It's a time capsule to a time where the art form [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3042.82s)]
*  was just different, that was her. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3045.1s)]
*  Can I just check, I don't seem to recall [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3047.3s)]
*  the complex plot of John Wick. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3049.78s)]
*  Is he still killing people because of his dog? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3051.98s)]
*  Well, see, they dragged him back in. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3054.7400000000002s)]
*  See, here's what happened. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3057.58s)]
*  He killed everybody because of his dog, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3058.78s)]
*  and then he was ready to retire. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3063.22s)]
*  How far did that go? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3064.06s)]
*  First one, second one? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3064.9s)]
*  Second one. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3065.9s)]
*  Okay, so two full episodes of killing. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3066.74s)]
*  Yes, well he had to get his car back in the second one. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3069.22s)]
*  So first one was the dog, second one was car. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3072.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the second one, he shows up, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3074.46s)]
*  he kills everybody at the warehouse [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3076.18s)]
*  that's storing all the stolen cars. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3077.62s)]
*  And then he toasts, make a toast [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3079.9s)]
*  with the Russian mob boss to peace. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3081.74s)]
*  And it's like, can a man like you really know peace? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3084.62s)]
*  He's like, why not? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3088.06s)]
*  He's like, okay, cheers. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3088.9s)]
*  So the guy freaks out that John Wick doesn't kill him. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3089.98s)]
*  John Wick leaves, goes back to regular John Wick. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3092.8599999999997s)]
*  He doesn't have the slick back hair anymore. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3095.3799999999997s)]
*  He's not wearing the suit anymore, just like a regular guy. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3097.3399999999997s)]
*  And he's got his car, it's all fucked up, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3100.22s)]
*  and they fix his car. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3102.7s)]
*  And then a dude that he owed a marker to comes to visit him [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3105.06s)]
*  and says, I want you to kill my sister. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3108.7s)]
*  And he has to do it because he had this marker [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3110.5s)]
*  with his bloods in it, and so then he's back in the business. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3112.5s)]
*  That's the second one. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3116.14s)]
*  Yeah, and then he kills that guy, spoiler alert. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3117.06s)]
*  And then the whole world's after him. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3119.3799999999997s)]
*  That's John Wick 3. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3121.42s)]
*  And then there's a fourth one. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3122.86s)]
*  And then there's a fourth one, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3123.82s)]
*  which is basically a superhero. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3124.7000000000003s)]
*  And the fourth one, they're over the top crazy. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3126.1400000000003s)]
*  I enjoyed the fourth one, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3130.2200000000003s)]
*  but it's a very different thing than the first one. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3131.6600000000003s)]
*  The first one, you could kind of believe [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3133.6600000000003s)]
*  that all that could really happen. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3136.1400000000003s)]
*  By the fourth one, they had a band and all that shit. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3138.1400000000003s)]
*  They have bulletproof jackets, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3140.7000000000003s)]
*  and they're running into bullets. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3142.06s)]
*  And it's cartoonish, but it's fun. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3144.06s)]
*  The most crazy movie across into real world thing [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3147.5s)]
*  that I've learned about is this modified [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3151.54s)]
*  RX-9 Hellfire missile. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3153.1s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3155.14s)]
*  No. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3156.02s)]
*  This thing is insane. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3156.86s)]
*  Do the honors, Jamie, let's look at this. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3159.18s)]
*  So- Is it one of the hypersonic missiles [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3160.82s)]
*  that changes directions? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3162.54s)]
*  This is more precise. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3163.5s)]
*  So what they realized was that collateral damage [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3166.5s)]
*  is a big deal in war zones, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3169.14s)]
*  because if you kill people that aren't just the target, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3170.86s)]
*  you galvanize that group against your, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3174.42s)]
*  yeah, there it is. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3178.1800000000003s)]
*  America's secret ninja bomb packed with blades [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3179.82s)]
*  that shred militants alive. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3184.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3186.34s)]
*  So there's no explosive in the front of it. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3187.42s)]
*  It gets deployed using an existing platform, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3189.98s)]
*  but rather than having an explosive payload, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3192.82s)]
*  these razor sharp, six razor sharp swords [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3195.7000000000003s)]
*  come out the side of it, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3199.46s)]
*  and just turn human flesh into smoothies. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3200.7799999999997s)]
*  Look at what it does to a car. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3206.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3208.22s)]
*  But how precise this thing is, it's so precise. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3209.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the flying Jin-Su, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3212.7s)]
*  I think it's colloquially called the Jihadi Blender. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3214.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3217.3799999999997s)]
*  They just shoot it into cars. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3218.3799999999997s)]
*  So it's so precise that you need to know [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3220.1s)]
*  which seat of the car the- [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3222.18s)]
*  The bad guy's in. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3226.62s)]
*  Bad dude's in, yeah. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3227.62s)]
*  Because if it was a long enough vehicle, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3228.4599999999996s)]
*  front right seat and back left seat, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3231.18s)]
*  back left seat will be scared, but it'll be fine. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3232.3s)]
*  So there was this dude, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3234.18s)]
*  one of the, supposedly one of the masterminds behind 9-11, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3235.66s)]
*  they'd done surveillance on this guy, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3238.7s)]
*  and every morning he'd come out and drink his coffee [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3240.1s)]
*  on his balcony, same balcony, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3242.86s)]
*  come out and he'd drink his coffee and look out. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3244.7s)]
*  So they just timed two of those things, comes out, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3247.54s)]
*  and that's it. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3253.3s)]
*  There's no explosion, there's no nothing, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3254.14s)]
*  and this guy just gets turned into dust. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3255.58s)]
*  They shot two of them at him? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3261.26s)]
*  Two, just in case the first one missed, I think. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3262.54s)]
*  Laser guided, set it off, and here's the other thing, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3265.1s)]
*  because it only propels for the first two seconds, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3268.1s)]
*  and then after that it's just using fins, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3270.86s)]
*  so it works out the trajectory. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3272.5s)]
*  So there's not even the sound of engine coming toward you, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3273.94s)]
*  it's just silence and then blades and death. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3277.18s)]
*  Oh, it's a flying, it's a flying rage hypodermic. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3281.5s)]
*  Do you know what a rage hypodermic is? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3285.94s)]
*  Rage hypodermic is a wild mechanical broadhead [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3287.86s)]
*  that they invented for bow hunting. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3292.34s)]
*  So instead of a bow hunting broadhead being a fixed blade, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3294.7000000000003s)]
*  like a solid piece of metal [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3299.26s)]
*  that's screwed into the end of your arrow, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3300.86s)]
*  instead it's a mechanical broadhead [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3302.7000000000003s)]
*  that upon impacting tissue opens up into this huge opening. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3305.54s)]
*  They make giant holes, they call them rage holes, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3310.46s)]
*  and they kill animals quick. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3313.94s)]
*  And it's kind of controversial in that [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3316.18s)]
*  if your blade hits a branch on the way in, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3318.8999999999996s)]
*  or like a stalk of hay or something like that, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3322.7s)]
*  it could trigger it, and then it would fuck up [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3326.74s)]
*  the trajectory of the arrow, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3328.58s)]
*  and it might lead to a bad shot. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3330.22s)]
*  So there's that, and then there's it could get deployed [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3334.74s)]
*  accidentally in your quiver, and you might not know it [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3338.74s)]
*  when you're drawing and shooting, it could be open, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3341.74s)]
*  and it could open up in flight, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3343.8999999999996s)]
*  but if it stays closed and it does impact, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3345.54s)]
*  it makes a giant hole. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3348.1s)]
*  Cam took me to the bow rack. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3350.34s)]
*  Ah, you did lift, run, shoot. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3353.1s)]
*  I did, he fucked me up, he made me go up the hill. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3354.82s)]
*  That was brutal. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3356.82s)]
*  He made me carry that rock. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3358.5s)]
*  How long did you, what is it, like two miles? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3359.58s)]
*  I don't know, I think it's maybe about a mile up [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3361.66s)]
*  and a mile down, but it's pretty steep. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3363.2599999999998s)]
*  And I mean, there's a 72 pound rock with you. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3365.1s)]
*  You had to carry the rock down? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3366.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3368.42s)]
*  I think, did we carry it down? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3369.46s)]
*  I can't remember, I think it's supposed to. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3371.02s)]
*  But he made me do the trail, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3372.74s)]
*  but he taught me to shoot, and I was looking at, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3374.74s)]
*  with gruesome glee, looking at all of the different [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3376.9799999999996s)]
*  types of arrows in the bow rack, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3380.8599999999997s)]
*  looking at all of these different heads [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3382.9399999999996s)]
*  and all of the different attachments. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3384.58s)]
*  It advertises exit wound three inch diameter, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3386.3399999999997s)]
*  exit wound five inch diameter. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3390.2599999999998s)]
*  Cam shoots this thing called a carnivore, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3392.22s)]
*  and the carnivore is a broadhead that's got four blades. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3394.9399999999996s)]
*  It opens up a canal in these animals. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3398.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's like for bow hunting though, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3402.74s)]
*  it's extremely effective. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3406.2599999999998s)]
*  If you can get it into the vitals, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3407.7799999999997s)]
*  it's like, that's a lethal shot every time. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3409.62s)]
*  It's such a big hole. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3412.8999999999996s)]
*  I wonder how many, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3415.2599999999998s)]
*  is it more humane to kill something more easily, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3419.1s)]
*  is my question. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3422.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's more humane to use a rifle, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3423.02s)]
*  in a lot of circumstances. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3426.1s)]
*  That's literally just the non-rocket propellant. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3429.1s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3433.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a carnivore. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3434.5s)]
*  Go back to that carnivore thing, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3438.58s)]
*  so you can see what it is. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3440.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's a really big one. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3441.3399999999997s)]
*  So the controversy in bow hunting is always like, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3443.8999999999996s)]
*  fixed blades are more durable, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3446.5s)]
*  but mechanical blades have more cutting surface. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3448.54s)]
*  What is that? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3453.06s)]
*  What is that? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3453.8999999999996s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3456.18s)]
*  Turn stuff into pizza slices. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3457.02s)]
*  Colorful eagle, that's what it's called. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3458.2999999999997s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3461.22s)]
*  Yeah, that seems like it wouldn't fly good. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3463.2599999999998s)]
*  See, the problem is they have to fly good too, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3466.58s)]
*  and the more metal surface area you have, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3468.8999999999996s)]
*  the more you have a chance of what's called planing. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3471.1s)]
*  So as the crosswinds hit your arrows, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3473.3399999999997s)]
*  your blade can drift because the wind hits the broadhead. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3478.18s)]
*  So if you have a wide cut, solid, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3482.18s)]
*  fixed blade broadhead, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3486.1s)]
*  that's another sort of thing that can catch wind. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3487.46s)]
*  Yeah, people tune them. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3490.7799999999997s)]
*  So if you have a single bevel broadhead, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3492.38s)]
*  so there's a single bevel broadhead, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3496.42s)]
*  which is a broadhead, which is a fixed blade broadhead [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3497.94s)]
*  that has only had the edge sharpened on one side, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3500.7400000000002s)]
*  and that encourages rotation. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3503.62s)]
*  And that rotation has to align [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3505.42s)]
*  with the helical of your veins. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3507.02s)]
*  You don't want them to be fighting with each other. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3508.82s)]
*  So if you have a left helical on your veins of your arrow, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3510.5s)]
*  you also want a left helical on this broadhead. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3514.58s)]
*  And so these are tuned in tightly together. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3518.02s)]
*  And so it's a very painstaking process. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3521.46s)]
*  You have to make sure you're doing it right. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3524.66s)]
*  You're gonna move your rest a little bit. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3525.94s)]
*  But once you get it dialed in [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3527.7s)]
*  and you can shoot accurate out to like 60, 70 yards with it, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3528.86s)]
*  you know that it's called broadhead tuned. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3531.9s)]
*  So with field points, you don't really have to do that [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3534.86s)]
*  because the fletchings, they steer it enough [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3537.58s)]
*  and you just have to be kind of on target. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3539.66s)]
*  You have to be closer. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3541.38s)]
*  But with broadheads, you have to be like really, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3542.26s)]
*  really locked in. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3543.86s)]
*  So that's the negative of the broadhead. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3544.7s)]
*  They made me shoot through the paper [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3547.26s)]
*  to see where are you pulling accidentally [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3548.9s)]
*  and then they adjust and tune. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3552.38s)]
*  And dude, I loved it. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3553.2200000000003s)]
*  I love seeing anyone that loves anything that much. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3554.06s)]
*  That degree of passion to me is, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3559.06s)]
*  so me and my housemate Zach watch these videos [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3560.94s)]
*  of motocross, you know, the Colin McCray, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3563.2200000000003s)]
*  is that Rallycross, sorry. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3567.1s)]
*  And these dudes will go out to [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3568.86s)]
*  butt fuck nowhere Scotland in November. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3571.94s)]
*  And it's pissing down with rain and they're in ponchos. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3574.7400000000002s)]
*  And they do it to see [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3577.54s)]
*  and then they turn to each other and go, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3581.82s)]
*  ah, and they just lose their shit. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3583.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's so, dude, it makes the hairs on my arms stand up. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3586.5s)]
*  Jamie, see if we can find some of these videos. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3589.34s)]
*  It's the most pure loving audience of a thing. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3591.26s)]
*  And just finding anyone, the same as Wayne Endicott [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3597.66s)]
*  at the bow rack, just the way that they play with the bow [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3601.1s)]
*  and they know that if they add a tiny little bit of flame [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3605.42s)]
*  from a lighter to the site, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3608.86s)]
*  that it'll sort of cinch it in a different way. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3611.6600000000003s)]
*  And it heats the sinew of the thread and it tightens that. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3613.7000000000003s)]
*  Seeing anyone that loves anything that much is just, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3617.38s)]
*  there's something very gentle and honest and peaceful [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3621.9s)]
*  and beautiful about that. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3626.34s)]
*  It is. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3627.5s)]
*  Fires me up. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3628.34s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3629.1600000000003s)]
*  I love watching people make things and put things together. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3630.0s)]
*  And I love watching people work on cars, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3633.46s)]
*  do mechanical things. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3636.34s)]
*  I'd love that shit. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3638.26s)]
*  But the bow rack, one of the things that's interesting [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3639.34s)]
*  about archery is that even if you're just interested [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3641.6s)]
*  in target archery, any kind of archery that you're interested [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3645.58s)]
*  in, unless you are shooting a traditional bow [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3648.46s)]
*  where there's no sights on it and you're just kind of [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3651.88s)]
*  like doing it by feel, then you learn how to aim [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3654.14s)]
*  depending upon how much your arrow weighs, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3657.06s)]
*  you can get pretty accurate with those things, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3659.3s)]
*  but not nearly as accurate as you can with a compound bow. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3660.6s)]
*  And with a compound bow, it has to be fitted to your frame. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3663.42s)]
*  You have to go to a place like the bow rack. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3666.98s)]
*  And if you're lucky and you have a place like that, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3668.9s)]
*  that's great, because they're really good at it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3672.06s)]
*  But you might not be lucky. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3674.66s)]
*  So you might have to travel hours to go to some place. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3675.54s)]
*  People were. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3678.3s)]
*  When we were there, I think it was maybe a Saturday morning [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3679.14s)]
*  and we've driven six hours to come to this place. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3681.46s)]
*  And you have to go to a good place too, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3685.82s)]
*  because the first place I went to, my draw length, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3687.26s)]
*  they had an inch long that should have been, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3689.7000000000003s)]
*  the peep site was weird. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3691.7000000000003s)]
*  I had to cock my head weird to look at the peep site. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3692.98s)]
*  And then I went to a good place and they fixed it right. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3696.02s)]
*  And then I went, oh. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3698.3s)]
*  This is an extension of my body now. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3699.54s)]
*  It becomes, if you practice it enough, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3701.38s)]
*  it never really becomes an extension of your body, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3704.7s)]
*  but you do get so comfortable in that activity [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3706.98s)]
*  that it becomes a normal thing to you. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3711.78s)]
*  So then that activity is all just about the fine details [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3714.22s)]
*  of breathing and thinking and shot execution in your head. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3719.26s)]
*  The goal is always, at least the way I do it, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3724.5s)]
*  is always to make a surprise shot. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3727.3399999999997s)]
*  I never want to get it to go off. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3729.8999999999996s)]
*  I wanna be in full draw. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3732.7s)]
*  I wanna have my pin on the target [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3735.02s)]
*  and I wanna just be concentrated on that arrow [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3737.2999999999997s)]
*  hitting the mark and then I just go through [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3739.4199999999996s)]
*  this shot execution thing and it goes off. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3741.22s)]
*  And when it goes off, the ultimate goal [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3743.58s)]
*  is just watch that arrow go exactly where you want it to go. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3745.4599999999996s)]
*  And when I do that at like 74 yards, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3749.98s)]
*  it is the most satisfying feeling in the world. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3753.42s)]
*  Just targets. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3755.66s)]
*  Just shooting at a foam target. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3756.66s)]
*  It's so satisfying and it requires so much concentration [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3759.1800000000003s)]
*  that in that act of doing that, the world goes away. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3762.94s)]
*  And that's the key to it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3766.86s)]
*  That's the key to anything that I really enjoy doing [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3768.66s)]
*  that's very difficult. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3771.46s)]
*  I think you need little vacations from the world. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3772.66s)]
*  And if you have an hour and a half to shoot a bow, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3776.9s)]
*  it can provide you with a vacation from the world. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3781.06s)]
*  You are literally only think, it's so difficult to do [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3784.18s)]
*  and it's so involving and it's so rewarding [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3787.66s)]
*  when you get it right that you're completely locked [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3790.66s)]
*  into this one activity and the world goes away. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3793.5s)]
*  I love it, man. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3797.82s)]
*  I love the solitude and the peace that you get [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3798.82s)]
*  doing something that you know well [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3802.86s)]
*  and that you can get better at. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3804.86s)]
*  And I often think about like three types of crisps, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3806.7000000000003s)]
*  dopamine crisps, serotonin crisps and cortisol crisps. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3811.3799999999997s)]
*  And my goal is to spend as much time [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3813.8199999999997s)]
*  in serotonin crisps as possible. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3815.74s)]
*  But dopamine crisps plays on modern wisdom [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3817.8199999999997s)]
*  and growing the channel and money and new stuff [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3821.18s)]
*  and traveling to new places and novelty. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3824.8199999999997s)]
*  And cortisol crisps is dealing with the operations [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3827.42s)]
*  and its executive function, it's answering emails [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3830.1s)]
*  and it's dealing with challenges. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3832.06s)]
*  And cortisol is kind of exciting too, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3833.66s)]
*  but serotonin crisps is walking with your friends [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3836.58s)]
*  in nature and calling your mom and catching up [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3840.62s)]
*  and having dinner, going to a comedy show, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3843.2999999999997s)]
*  watching live music. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3844.8599999999997s)]
*  And I found that when I'm not feeling balanced in myself [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3846.18s)]
*  is when I'm spending too much time. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3852.3399999999997s)]
*  And things aren't bad, things are going well. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3853.66s)]
*  They could be even going excellently. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3855.42s)]
*  But I'm still in dopamine crisps a lot [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3858.02s)]
*  and he's gangster rap and a V8 engine. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3860.94s)]
*  And I wanna be magic mushrooms in a hammock. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3864.3799999999997s)]
*  But wait a minute, pause please. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3869.38s)]
*  Cause you just bought a Camaro. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3871.42s)]
*  I did. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3872.78s)]
*  You son of a bitch, you bought an SS too, right? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3873.62s)]
*  Two SS, yeah, 6.2 liter V8. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3876.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3878.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3879.62s)]
*  You embraced American culture. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3880.46s)]
*  I just need to get some beers. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3882.3s)]
*  Did you get a manual transmission? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3883.58s)]
*  No, I've spent, so in the UK, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3885.62s)]
*  almost everybody learns to drive manual. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3889.26s)]
*  So there's two types of license in the UK, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3891.38s)]
*  manual license and an automatic license. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3893.54s)]
*  If you learn in an automatic, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3895.58s)]
*  don't get to drive a manual. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3897.46s)]
*  You have to take the test as a manual. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3898.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh my goodness, that's a smart move. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3900.34s)]
*  Yep. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3902.42s)]
*  That's one case where England's got us. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3903.26s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3905.7000000000003s)]
*  You guys went on that one. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3906.54s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3907.58s)]
*  I think, you know, it's a dying thing obviously. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3908.42s)]
*  Cause it's not as smart. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3912.7400000000002s)]
*  Why do I have to use my left foot? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3915.82s)]
*  Dude, your entire, in the UK, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3917.62s)]
*  my whole, the left side of my body, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3921.62s)]
*  left arm and left leg, just go chill out, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3923.34s)]
*  go on holiday for the next hour while I do this journey. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3926.74s)]
*  I can use right arm only and right leg. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3929.14s)]
*  But yeah, I remember hearing, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3931.66s)]
*  I think it was Tim Kennedy talking about, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3933.8599999999997s)]
*  if you're a guy who is cared about preparedness [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3936.06s)]
*  and you don't know how to drive a manual car, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3939.2599999999998s)]
*  that's not preparedness. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3941.66s)]
*  Imagine that you're halfway up a mountain [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3942.8999999999996s)]
*  and only one car works or you need to get somebody down [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3945.02s)]
*  or there's been a car wreck or something [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3947.58s)]
*  and it's a manual car. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3949.02s)]
*  Are you going to work it out on the fly? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3950.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3952.62s)]
*  How many people know how to drive manual cars [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3953.74s)]
*  in America, do you think? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3956.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's guess. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3957.8599999999997s)]
*  I would say 10%. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3959.18s)]
*  I'll guess 10%. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3963.4599999999996s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3964.58s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3965.74s)]
*  I have no idea for America. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3966.58s)]
*  Maybe, I would have guessed like 50, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3967.8599999999997s)]
*  I would have hoped 50%, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3970.06s)]
*  but I don't know how many people are exposed to them. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3971.22s)]
*  In the UK, I would say 90%. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3973.02s)]
*  90% of driving license holders [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3975.18s)]
*  will be able to drive a manual car, at least. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3978.7799999999997s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3981.5s)]
*  Yeah, I saw a lot of them in Italy. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3982.3399999999997s)]
*  Everybody had a manual, everywhere. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3984.42s)]
*  That's all they had. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3985.9s)]
*  They don't give a fuck about their cars either. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3986.74s)]
*  They're just crashing, like little dinks. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3987.94s)]
*  You know, it's so precious, especially in the UK. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3990.02s)]
*  I don't know how it is in the US so much. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3991.54s)]
*  So precious. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3993.54s)]
*  But the little scratch on it, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3994.86s)]
*  oh, you better get that painted up in Spain or France [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3995.7s)]
*  or Greece or something. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=3999.18s)]
*  That's just, that's a bit of a, what's it called? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4000.46s)]
*  Patina. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4003.02s)]
*  It's a bit of patina on it. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4003.86s)]
*  It gives it character. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4004.7s)]
*  Well, some cars, they look at it like here. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4005.66s)]
*  Like if you have a Jeep or something like that, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4007.8199999999997s)]
*  you get it all scuffed up, that's fine. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4009.54s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4011.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good thing to know how to do. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4014.42s)]
*  It's also, the real problem is [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4017.7s)]
*  if there's some sort of an electronic blast, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4019.74s)]
*  if something happens, like a solar flare [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4022.62s)]
*  that takes out the grid, and the only, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4025.9s)]
*  because if electronics get fried, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4030.1s)]
*  and this is a real possibility, I know you're like, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4032.2599999999998s)]
*  what are you saying? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4033.9s)]
*  First of all, you have to understand, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4034.98s)]
*  entire planets get fried by supernovas. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4036.62s)]
*  It's not just electronics. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4039.1s)]
*  Things happen in intergalactic space [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4041.1s)]
*  that would end everything for us, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4044.46s)]
*  and it 100% could happen. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4046.86s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4049.42s)]
*  But solar flares taking out power grids, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4051.34s)]
*  that's a fucking real possibility. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4054.9s)]
*  Taking out satellites, that's a real possibility. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4057.02s)]
*  And one of the things about most modern cars [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4059.3s)]
*  is most modern cars are essentially run by a computer. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4062.34s)]
*  So if all the computers get fried, guess what? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4066.2200000000003s)]
*  Your car doesn't work. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4069.42s)]
*  If we're running into some sort of situation, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4071.86s)]
*  some horrible event, where all the computers get fried, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4073.62s)]
*  that means your fucking car doesn't work. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4076.6600000000003s)]
*  You also can't move anywhere. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4078.62s)]
*  Unless you have an old car. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4079.7000000000003s)]
*  Now if you have an old car that works on carburetors, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4080.78s)]
*  those are cars, like if you have an actual real 1969 Camaro, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4083.38s)]
*  not like the ones, I have ones that have new stuff in them. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4088.02s)]
*  So all the new stuff is computers, they'll be useless. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4091.82s)]
*  All the ECU that powers all the ignition [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4094.94s)]
*  and the electronic fuel injection, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4097.74s)]
*  that shit's out the window. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4100.18s)]
*  Your car's now controlled by China. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4101.18s)]
*  No, it's not controlled by anybody, it's a lump. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4103.14s)]
*  It's a lump, and unless I could figure out [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4105.38s)]
*  how to put a carburetor on it, and I can't, I'm fucked. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4107.14s)]
*  You know, you would have to gut the whole system, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4110.34s)]
*  all the electronics are wired into it, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4113.42s)]
*  the speedometer's wired into it. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4115.26s)]
*  I was hearing that my neighbor has a Tesla, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4117.38s)]
*  and I think he gets his insurance through Tesla, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4121.38s)]
*  but they can see the diagnostics of how he drives the car. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4123.5s)]
*  So his insurance is way more expensive, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4126.54s)]
*  because it knows how late he breaks, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4128.9s)]
*  how fast he accelerates, how close to other cars he is. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4130.54s)]
*  You wanna talk about encroachments on freedom? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4133.5s)]
*  I didn't know they did that. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4137.339999999999s)]
*  There's a algorithm that's used in China [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4138.86s)]
*  that when someone is applying for medical insurance, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4143.219999999999s)]
*  it uses the website to track the number of typos [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4146.0599999999995s)]
*  and the movement of the mouse, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4149.339999999999s)]
*  and they've mapped that with an algorithm [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4150.82s)]
*  to predict pre-Parkinsonian, pre-alxymic dementia, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4152.339999999999s)]
*  all of these things. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4156.54s)]
*  So basically, if you're filling in your medical insurance [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4157.46s)]
*  in China and you fuck up a little bit, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4160.9s)]
*  your premium goes up. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4162.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4163.58s)]
*  That's coming. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4167.14s)]
*  All that stuff's coming. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4168.26s)]
*  And a lot of dummies are gonna sign up for it, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4169.26s)]
*  because they'll attach it to something [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4172.34s)]
*  you think is important, like climate change. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4173.94s)]
*  And that's how they're gonna get you. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4176.14s)]
*  One third of Gen Z, because fucking, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4177.78s)]
*  Greta Thunberg again. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4181.54s)]
*  One third of Gen Z kids say that they would accept [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4183.46s)]
*  the installation of surveillance cameras inside the home [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4188.74s)]
*  to detect wrongdoing. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4193.46s)]
*  One third, 30%. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4195.5s)]
*  I wonder if they really believe that, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4198.22s)]
*  or if they say that because they know it's not happening [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4200.1s)]
*  and they just wanna say that they're a good person. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4202.62s)]
*  It's a lop. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4203.94s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4204.78s)]
*  You're also a dumb young person [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4205.62s)]
*  that doesn't understand what you're giving up. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4207.9s)]
*  Well, I think another potential reason for it might be [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4209.46s)]
*  you're part of a generation that has traded your [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4212.94s)]
*  Privacy. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4216.299999999999s)]
*  Precisely. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4217.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4217.98s)]
*  From the moment that you were born. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4218.82s)]
*  You know what they do? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4219.639999999999s)]
*  Snapchat. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4220.5s)]
*  They give each other their locations. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4221.7s)]
*  Yes, yes, the Snap Map, I think. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4225.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so all the kids know exactly [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4226.86s)]
*  where all the other kids are. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4228.62s)]
*  So if you're dating some gal, and you know. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4230.379999999999s)]
*  See her with that other person that's on your friends list. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4232.7s)]
*  And you see you're not where you said you were gonna be. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4235.0199999999995s)]
*  You know. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4238.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's a. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4239.78s)]
*  So what do people do now? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4240.62s)]
*  Where are you? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4243.02s)]
*  I see where you are. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4243.860000000001s)]
*  That's kinda weird. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4245.18s)]
*  You read the terms and conditions of TikTok a while ago. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4246.02s)]
*  I can't remember whether you saw. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4249.58s)]
*  TikTok has written into its user agreement [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4252.860000000001s)]
*  that it can use the front facing camera [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4255.38s)]
*  to detect micro expressions [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4257.58s)]
*  and use that to inform the algorithm. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4259.22s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4262.1s)]
*  Yo. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4262.9400000000005s)]

*  I bet if they have that app, that app. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4275.0s)]
*  They have that ability and you have it open. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4277.66s)]
*  I bet they use it no matter what you're doing. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4280.0199999999995s)]

*  I bet they see exactly what you're seeing. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4289.099999999999s)]
*  Well think about with the Apple Vision Pro [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4291.46s)]
*  that Jamie's gonna have to debate [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4293.3s)]
*  about whether or not he takes it back [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4295.5s)]
*  for the next 12 hours. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4297.58s)]
*  How much eye tracking? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4299.62s)]
*  What is that able to tell from what you're doing? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4301.14s)]
*  What about the latency between your fingers and your eyes? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4303.22s)]
*  Is that able to predict early onset dementia [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4305.76s)]
*  or some neurological decline? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4308.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4310.5s)]
*  Or could that be used against you if they decide [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4312.3s)]
*  what do we get Chris on? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4315.14s)]
*  I don't like Chris being the CEO of this company anymore. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4318.1s)]
*  Let's decide that he's in decline. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4320.34s)]
*  Oh and let's use that. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4322.200000000001s)]
*  And also start gaslighting him. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4323.04s)]
*  Like you okay Chris? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4324.780000000001s)]

*  Like you just seem off lately. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4326.860000000001s)]
*  Dude, did you. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4328.62s)]
*  Just hot gaslighting. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4329.46s)]
*  Did you see the outcome from this special council report [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4331.6s)]
*  on Biden? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4334.32s)]
*  No I did not. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4335.92s)]
*  Okay let me pee because this is a big one [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4337.76s)]
*  and I'm holding it to pee. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4340.32s)]
*  So let's. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4341.92s)]
*  Get your pee. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4342.76s)]
*  Let's pee together. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4343.58s)]
*  Okay let's do that. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4344.42s)]
*  We'll be right back folks. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4345.26s)]
*  Fun as well. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4346.08s)]
*  Yeah I'm watching a movie. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4346.92s)]
*  17 hours it's miserable enough as it is. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4348.88s)]
*  I don't need to make it any worse. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4351.0s)]
*  But yeah hydration. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4352.28s)]
*  Hydration on planes people don't think about. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4353.16s)]
*  No. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4354.88s)]
*  It's so important. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4355.72s)]
*  Or radiation. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4356.56s)]
*  Do we find out about that? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4357.38s)]
*  Do people die on planes? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4358.56s)]
*  Is there ever been a study on the radiation [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4359.8s)]
*  that pilots and flight attendants receive? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4361.8s)]
*  I'm just digging into it. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  There was not a lot of studies available. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4365.16s)]
*  One study I found was from 1982. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4366.84s)]
*  And it just said that pilots die sooner after they retire. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4369.24s)]
*  And it wasn't showing no. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4372.400000000001s)]
*  Not radiation. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4373.6s)]
*  Yeah but isn't that applicable to most men [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4374.4400000000005s)]
*  that quit their jobs? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4376.24s)]
*  Right it could have been something. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4377.2s)]
*  A lot of things could have gone into that. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4378.16s)]
*  People fucking die when they don't have meaning [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4379.16s)]
*  and purpose too. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4381.18s)]
*  That's a real factor. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4382.320000000001s)]
*  People that retire die significantly sooner. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4383.56s)]
*  Way sooner. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4387.12s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I think everybody [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4388.12s)]
*  when they retire should be issued a dog. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4389.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4393.72s)]
*  Like a little Carl. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4394.5599999999995s)]
*  How's Carl doing over there? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4395.44s)]
*  Is he sleeping? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4396.44s)]
*  Carl's the cutest little thing ever. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4400.08s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4401.5199999999995s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4402.36s)]
*  Yeah that would help. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4403.2s)]
*  But I think what also would help is [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4404.0199999999995s)]
*  have things you enjoy doing. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4405.2s)]
*  You know? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4407.48s)]
*  You can still enjoy your life without having a job. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4408.32s)]
*  And if you've got enough money where you can retire [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4411.64s)]
*  and you feel like you could pull that off. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4414.5199999999995s)]
*  You should do stuff. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4416.76s)]
*  Don't just fuck. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4418.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah but some people don't know what the fuck to do [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4419.280000000001s)]
*  when they're not working. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4421.52s)]
*  And work was their everything. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4422.360000000001s)]
*  It was their entire existence. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4423.88s)]
*  It was their social status. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4425.400000000001s)]
*  It was how they made a living. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4426.76s)]
*  It was their social community. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4428.68s)]
*  It was all their friends really. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4431.04s)]
*  Because you're with your workmates [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4432.56s)]
*  more than you're with your partner. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4434.88s)]
*  Your wife, your husband. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4437.62s)]
*  What's the number when you're awake at home? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4440.88s)]
*  You get home at six o'clock. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4443.1s)]
*  You're only gonna be awake till 10 if you have to work. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4445.32s)]
*  If you're doing a nine to five. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4447.799999999999s)]
*  If you're a crazy person, you're up at 11, 11.30. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4449.28s)]
*  And you don't mind being a little tired in the office. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4452.08s)]
*  But if you're like trying to be on the ball, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4454.2s)]
*  you're gonna go to bed as early as you can. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4456.36s)]
*  You gotta get up at fucking 6.30. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4458.32s)]
*  You gotta commute. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4460.08s)]
*  How much time are you together? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4461.5599999999995s)]
*  I've been thinking about this idea of [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4463.299999999999s)]
*  hidden and observable metrics for life. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4465.12s)]
*  So a observable metric would be something like [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4467.84s)]
*  the amount of money that you earn per year. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4470.88s)]
*  It would be the value of the car that you drive [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4473.72s)]
*  or the engine size of the car that you drive [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4475.56s)]
*  or the value of your house. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4477.400000000001s)]
*  A hidden metric would be something like [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4479.56s)]
*  the quality of your relationship with your partner. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4481.84s)]
*  The amount of time that you get to spend [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4484.52s)]
*  without tasks to do. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4486.8s)]
*  The length of your commute. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4489.08s)]
*  Things like that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4492.780000000001s)]
*  And it's my belief that a lot of people trade [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4494.240000000001s)]
*  observable metrics for hidden metrics all the time. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4497.72s)]
*  So someone will be offered, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4500.4800000000005s)]
*  hey Joe, we want to give you a raise. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4502.32s)]
*  You've been doing really well at work, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4504.28s)]
*  but this is gonna come with more responsibility. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4505.66s)]
*  We're gonna need you in the office earlier. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4508.259999999999s)]
*  And you're gonna be in charge of this floor of 10 people. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4510.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, how much more money have you got? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4513.88s)]
*  Well I've got $15,000 added onto the observable metric. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4515.8s)]
*  But what's the hidden metric cost [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4520.24s)]
*  that you're paying for that? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4521.96s)]
*  Well, peace of mind. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4522.8s)]
*  And time with your partner. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4524.74s)]
*  Or you take another job somewhere else [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4526.639999999999s)]
*  and your commute is now 45 minutes longer [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4529.16s)]
*  in both directions. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4532.32s)]
*  It's 90 minutes a day that you're not spending [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4533.599999999999s)]
*  with your kids or with your wife or with whatever. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4535.32s)]
*  Because money is the ultimate game. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4539.12s)]
*  It's the best game. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4541.5199999999995s)]
*  It's literally global. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4542.36s)]
*  It's universal. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4543.5599999999995s)]
*  It can be exchanged between different currencies. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4544.4s)]
*  I know your game can be compared to my game, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4546.2s)]
*  can be compared to anybody else's. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4549.42s)]
*  But I don't get to see the dashboard [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4551.4s)]
*  that tracks the quality of your sleep [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4553.96s)]
*  or the peace of your mind [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4556.28s)]
*  or the relationship that you have with your kids [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4557.5199999999995s)]
*  or your wife or the amount of time [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4559.4s)]
*  that you just get to yourself. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4561.32s)]
*  And I think people should be very cautious [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4563.799999999999s)]
*  of trading observable metrics for hidden metrics. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4566.48s)]
*  And one of the ways that you can try and fix this [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4569.44s)]
*  is to bring the hidden into the observable. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4571.4s)]
*  So using a tracker of some kind, maybe to track your sleep. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4573.599999999999s)]
*  That would be a good start. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4577.12s)]
*  Or if you were to note down in a journal [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4578.639999999999s)]
*  how you feel each day. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4582.16s)]
*  Oh, well maybe I feel a little bit better today [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4583.679999999999s)]
*  because I did some, that's just fine. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4585.56s)]
*  I'm just breaking this thing. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4588.0s)]
*  Put that thing down, no worries. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4590.52s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4592.88s)]
*  I think just overall general happiness [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4594.0s)]
*  gets thrown out the window [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4597.4800000000005s)]
*  in terms of the metrics of the numbers. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4598.72s)]
*  The numbers and the observable things [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4601.22s)]
*  that make you superior. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4603.200000000001s)]
*  The car, the watch, the stuff. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4605.04s)]
*  But yeah, I always tell people, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4608.400000000001s)]
*  one of the things about a house, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4610.8s)]
*  I've said this many times, unfortunately. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4612.56s)]
*  But when I first got my first really nice apartment, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4615.88s)]
*  when I first moved to California, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4618.32s)]
*  I realized pretty early on after a while, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4620.36s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is just my house. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4622.92s)]
*  This is just where I live. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4624.84s)]
*  It feels just like the place that I had in New York [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4626.2s)]
*  that was a shit hole. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4628.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4629.599999999999s)]
*  It's just where you live. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4630.44s)]
*  Could you adapt to it so quickly? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4631.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's just where, this is home. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4632.099999999999s)]
*  All you need is a safe, comfortable place, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4635.599999999999s)]
*  a place where you can cook and eat your meals [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4638.679999999999s)]
*  and a television or a computer. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4642.28s)]
*  It's basically the same experience. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4644.08s)]
*  Have you seen those memes of guys just need this to survive? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4645.72s)]
*  It's like a lawn chair, a PS5, big TV, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4649.76s)]
*  and a mattress on the floor. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4654.4s)]
*  It's like guy apartments or something. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4656.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, if you're living with all dudes, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4658.72s)]
*  there's a chance that you're both. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4660.96s)]
*  Or just you on your own, that's it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4662.04s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4664.28s)]
*  Tell you who I was talking to. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4665.4800000000005s)]
*  I was talking to Dan Bilzerian about this. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4666.64s)]
*  He's kind of on an interesting arc [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4669.04s)]
*  because he sort of stepped back a little bit [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4670.52s)]
*  from public life, from doing the stuff [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4672.32s)]
*  that he was doing before. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4674.32s)]
*  And I was asking him basically [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4675.88s)]
*  whether he thought he'd overshot dopamine Dan. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4678.32s)]
*  And he said he was considering shaving his head, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4681.679999999999s)]
*  shaving his beard, and going working [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4685.0199999999995s)]
*  in an Amazon warehouse for six months [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  to try and do a hedonic reset to see. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4688.42s)]
*  The problem is, it was kind of like [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4691.7s)]
*  when Tim Kennedy did the waterboarding thing, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4693.24s)]
*  there's a difference between electing to do something [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4695.8s)]
*  and being forced to do something. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4697.88s)]
*  And the fact that you know at any moment [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4699.639999999999s)]
*  that you've just got the ejector seat button [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4702.92s)]
*  or that it's going to be over in six months [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4703.76s)]
*  or that it's going to be whatever. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4705.16s)]
*  I wonder if that changes. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4706.32s)]
*  But yeah, he basically said this rapid use [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4707.5599999999995s)]
*  and abuse of all of the things that you can, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4711.5599999999995s)]
*  the partying, the cars, the girls, the jets, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4714.32s)]
*  the holidays, the travel, the drugs. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4716.16s)]
*  Where'd you go from there? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4720.08s)]
*  It seems like having things isn't fun. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4724.64s)]
*  Getting things is fun. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4729.16s)]
*  Not knowing if you're going to get things [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4731.16s)]
*  and then getting them is fun. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4733.24s)]
*  That's the middle of dopamine. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4734.8s)]
*  Right, Dan. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4736.24s)]
*  So once you have things and you know you can get things, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4737.08s)]
*  getting them doesn't become that exciting anymore. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4740.679999999999s)]
*  Then. How'd you mean? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4743.48s)]
*  Because if you could just get whatever you want, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4744.679999999999s)]
*  you don't get that excited about it. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4747.26s)]
*  Like if you, like, okay, when I got my first nice car, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4748.96s)]
*  I got a, I think it was a 95 Toyota Supra Turbo. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4753.719999999999s)]
*  And it was awesome. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4759.4s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4760.96s)]
*  It's like, this is like a real nice new car [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4762.36s)]
*  and like the car I wanted, a Supra Turbo, it was this shit. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4764.919999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe I had it. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4770.0s)]
*  When I drive it around, I'd be like, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4771.0s)]
*  oh my God, I can't believe this is mine. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4772.12s)]
*  I park it, I couldn't believe it was mine. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4773.44s)]
*  But after a while, you get another car [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4775.28s)]
*  and then you get another car [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4779.24s)]
*  and then getting a car is just like, this is a great car. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4780.2s)]
*  But you can just do it when you want to. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4783.679999999999s)]
*  So you get to a point where I call it guerrilla Buddhism. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4786.7s)]
*  So when people say that material things possess you, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4790.8s)]
*  they possess you if you're really connected to them [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4796.36s)]
*  and they are your only measure of worth. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4801.04s)]
*  But the only way to know that material goods [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4804.76s)]
*  aren't really, you're not a slave to them is get them. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4807.86s)]
*  Get them, have them, and then go, okay. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4811.78s)]
*  This is not that important. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4815.36s)]
*  This is bullshit, this is bullshit. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4816.799999999999s)]
*  You don't feel better in a $10 million house [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4818.599999999999s)]
*  than you do in a $5 million house [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4820.839999999999s)]
*  than you do in a $1 million house. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4822.24s)]
*  You don't feel better, you feel like you're in your house. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4824.12s)]
*  As long as it's not shit, literally it's like rats or bugs [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4826.42s)]
*  or you want cleanliness and safety. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4829.28s)]
*  You want normal stuff that people like. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4831.5599999999995s)]
*  You want to be able to chill on the couch. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4832.96s)]
*  Couches aren't that much money. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4834.679999999999s)]
*  Most of the stuff is bullshit. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4836.88s)]
*  Yeah, my friend James says all wins feel the same. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4838.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4841.48s)]
*  As you start to go up and up and up, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4842.32s)]
*  the first time that you hit 1,000 subscribers [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4844.48s)]
*  on your YouTube channel or the first time [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4846.44s)]
*  that you buy a Toyota Supra is the same [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4847.88s)]
*  or maybe even kind of less than when you get [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4850.96s)]
*  a Rolls Royce Cullinan or you get a gold plaque [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4853.639999999999s)]
*  from YouTube or you get whatever. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4856.04s)]
*  All of these wins feel the same. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4858.32s)]
*  So I got this other idea that I love [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4859.92s)]
*  about how people sacrifice the thing that they want [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4861.679999999999s)]
*  for the thing which is supposed to get it. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4866.2s)]
*  So a lot of the time we will sacrifice happiness [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4868.28s)]
*  in order to be able to achieve success [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4871.84s)]
*  so that when we finally have enough success, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4874.04s)]
*  we can allow ourselves to be happy. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4876.4800000000005s)]
*  So you sacrifice the thing that you want, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4878.76s)]
*  which is happiness, for the thing which is supposed [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4880.52s)]
*  to get it, which is success. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4883.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4885.16s)]
*  And it's a super common pattern amongst high performers. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4886.64s)]
*  They grow up and maybe their parents [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4889.360000000001s)]
*  have high standards for them. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4892.2s)]
*  And they say that the subtext is that love is contingent [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4894.12s)]
*  on what I can bring to the world. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4897.64s)]
*  And growing up, this person internalizes the lesson. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4900.24s)]
*  It is very important for me to overperform [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4904.12s)]
*  and they're driven by this desire to do more [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4906.84s)]
*  and to prove people wrong and a chip on their shoulder [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4908.88s)]
*  and all of this. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4910.92s)]
*  The problem is, I think that on average, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4912.8s)]
*  high performers are more miserable than the average person. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4916.04s)]
*  I think that more people are driven by fear and anxiety [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4918.72s)]
*  and a desire for validation and to prove themselves [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4924.28s)]
*  to the world and a desire for acceptance [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4928.56s)]
*  than some perfectly balanced, optimal loving, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4930.56s)]
*  I just want to make life the best that I can. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4935.080000000001s)]
*  That's not to say that there aren't people like that, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4937.52s)]
*  but I think on balance, most people are driven [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4939.240000000001s)]
*  by that fear of insufficiency and they're hoping [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4941.04s)]
*  that the next thing is going to be the answer. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4943.88s)]
*  But another friend, Alex, says, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4947.96s)]
*  you've already achieved goals [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4950.4800000000005s)]
*  you said would make you happy. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4952.56s)]
*  Mm. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4954.5599999999995s)]
*  You've already achieved goals [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4956.08s)]
*  you said would make you happy. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4958.76s)]
*  How can you presume that your happiness sits [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4963.72s)]
*  on the next side of the next set of goals, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4966.72s)]
*  given that right now you are on the other side [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4969.5199999999995s)]
*  of your last set of goals? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4972.0s)]
*  So is the key to learn happiness while you're succeeding? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4973.96s)]
*  It has to be, it has to be. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4978.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4980.28s)]
*  You just have to rewire your value system [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4981.68s)]
*  and the word gratitude gets abused, it really does. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4988.36s)]
*  It gets tossed into that word [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4992.44s)]
*  that just like it makes things sound stupid. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4995.64s)]
*  But gratitude is very important [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=4997.68s)]
*  and if you can actually appreciate where you are [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5000.2s)]
*  and what you're doing, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5003.88s)]
*  even if you're not doing what you want to be doing, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5005.28s)]
*  you're going to look back on these days [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5007.08s)]
*  if you're successful in life [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5008.8s)]
*  and you're going to look back on the days [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5010.12s)]
*  when you're kind of struggling like, wow, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5011.5199999999995s)]
*  like I was finding my place in the world then. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5013.04s)]
*  Those are exciting times. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5015.84s)]
*  If you could be excited while also motivated, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5017.08s)]
*  it'll just, it'll help your life immeasurably [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5021.16s)]
*  and I don't think it's going to steal [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5023.24s)]
*  from your drive and ambition. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5024.36s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5026.44s)]
*  I don't buy that either. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5027.28s)]
*  I used to think that. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5028.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't buy it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5029.44s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5030.5599999999995s)]
*  I know some pretty happy driven people exist. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5031.38s)]
*  There's a fear that some people have [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5035.04s)]
*  that haven't really thought about it [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5036.84s)]
*  that if I allow myself to be too happy [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5038.44s)]
*  or grateful for the things that I've done, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5041.16s)]
*  what if it kills my edge? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5042.879999999999s)]
*  It's like, dude, you are powered [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5044.2s)]
*  by a nuclear furnace of ambition. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5046.639999999999s)]
*  You think that giving yourself a little bit of gratitude [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5051.32s)]
*  or acceptance or love or serotonin [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5055.2s)]
*  for the things that you've done is going to nuke that? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5057.36s)]
*  No way. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5060.719999999999s)]
*  It's not going to nerf any of it. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5061.5599999999995s)]
*  It might if that's your only drive, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5063.4s)]
*  if your only drive is to achieve financial success, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5065.24s)]
*  but hopefully what you're doing is rewarding [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5067.68s)]
*  in a way on its own. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5071.12s)]
*  One of the beautiful things about standup [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5073.56s)]
*  is people do standup for free all the time. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5074.76s)]
*  Big name comedians like Dave Chappelle [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5076.92s)]
*  does free standup all the time. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5078.68s)]
*  Just show up at a club and do a guest set. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5080.6s)]
*  Just pop in. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5082.360000000001s)]
*  He's not on the list. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5083.84s)]
*  He's not supposed to be there. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5084.92s)]
*  Just does it for free. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5085.76s)]
*  What other, how many people's jobs [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5087.360000000001s)]
*  they just show up and just do them for free? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5089.0s)]
*  If you can find something like that, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5092.04s)]
*  then all the success and all this stuff, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5094.4400000000005s)]
*  that's all wonderful. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5095.96s)]
*  But you enjoy doing it so much. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5097.96s)]
*  It's such a fun activity that you're doing. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5099.08s)]
*  It's not just a making money vehicle. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5101.84s)]
*  It's an enjoyable activity. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5104.08s)]
*  It's so enjoyable. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5105.88s)]
*  You'll go out of your way to do it for free. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5107.24s)]
*  Yeah, Robert Sapolsky, who you've had on the show, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5109.96s)]
*  he says, dopamine is not about the pursuit of happiness. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5112.639999999999s)]
*  It's about the happiness of pursuit. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5117.28s)]
*  That it's as you move toward things. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5120.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5122.719999999999s)]
*  One step at a time. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5123.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not the destination. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5125.4s)]
*  It's the journey. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5126.599999999999s)]
*  But it's so fucking trite. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5127.44s)]
*  You're so right with what you say about gratitude. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5128.92s)]
*  Yeah, they get you. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5130.92s)]
*  We need to rebrand. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5131.759999999999s)]
*  There needs to be, it's not you, it's me. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5133.12s)]
*  How many people want to, oh, Netflix and chill. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5135.719999999999s)]
*  These things get captured by cliches [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5138.5599999999995s)]
*  and you're like, no, fuck, damn it. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5140.44s)]
*  I mean it my way, not that way. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5141.879999999999s)]
*  But yeah, that idea of it's far easier [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5144.0s)]
*  to achieve your material desires than to get rid of them, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5148.24s)]
*  than to renounce them. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5151.4s)]
*  It's way easier to drive a beat up Chevy truck [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5152.4s)]
*  if your last car was a Ferrari. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5154.24s)]
*  Because you've closed that little loop. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5156.04s)]
*  Mark Manson talks about, he has this great question, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5160.0s)]
*  what pain do you want in life? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5163.16s)]
*  He says that it's a much more accurate way [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5165.16s)]
*  of asking the question, what looks like work [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5167.92s)]
*  to everybody else but feels like play to you? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5171.76s)]
*  That's like a common thing. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5174.32s)]
*  Can you do that is play that to everyone else is work? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5175.88s)]
*  That's a competitive advantage. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5178.2s)]
*  That might be comedy for you, for Chappelle, et cetera. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5179.84s)]
*  I would happily do this for free. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5182.76s)]
*  There are other people out there [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5184.88s)]
*  who would need to be paid an awful lot of money [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5186.64s)]
*  to go through the drama of getting up on stage. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5188.56s)]
*  Mark's contention is that any pursuit, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5191.92s)]
*  even the most existentially aligned, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5194.4800000000005s)]
*  will regularly feel like work. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5197.64s)]
*  So what you need to look at is what are the pains [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5199.52s)]
*  that you can deal with better than everybody else? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5202.0s)]
*  Like if you, there is pain associated, I'm sure. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5205.12s)]
*  It's not just pure joy as you stare at a Google Doc [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5208.4400000000005s)]
*  or a note in your phone and you're like, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5211.44s)]
*  how am I gonna get this bit out? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5213.839999999999s)]
*  Like how do I actually, I can't, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5215.48s)]
*  I need to make this joke about cigarettes or something [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5217.679999999999s)]
*  and I just can't get it to work. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5220.48s)]
*  You're grappling with something. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5222.16s)]
*  There is a kind of pain. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5223.28s)]
*  It's not pure pleasure every single moment. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5224.919999999999s)]
*  And I think assuming that your pursuits [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5227.48s)]
*  are always going to be perfect, just blissed out, man, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5229.44s)]
*  and there should be no challenges, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5232.139999999999s)]
*  like no, that's not the way that it's gonna work, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5233.879999999999s)]
*  even if it's your calling in life. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5235.5199999999995s)]
*  So a better way is what pains can you deal with [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5238.16s)]
*  better than everyone else. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5240.76s)]
*  Yeah, and how much do you discipline yourself? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5242.08s)]
*  How much do you really put a rigid schedule [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5246.320000000001s)]
*  towards achieving goals and know, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5249.24s)]
*  and an understanding that there's gonna be [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5251.64s)]
*  these uncomfortable things. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5253.72s)]
*  You think like the creative process, it's uncomfortable. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5255.320000000001s)]
*  That's why people avoid it. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5257.88s)]
*  That's what Steven Pressfield's book is all about, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5259.04s)]
*  The War of Art. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5260.8s)]
*  I love that guy. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5261.96s)]
*  It's a great, great, great book. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5262.780000000001s)]
*  Such a good book. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5263.88s)]
*  Such a good book for creatives. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5264.72s)]
*  I tell everybody, I still have a stack of them out there. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5265.96s)]
*  We've got a fresh stack. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5268.6s)]
*  We've got a fresh stack. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5269.4400000000005s)]
*  I gave them out to so many listeners, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5270.88s)]
*  because there's so many creative types [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5272.84s)]
*  that don't understand that there's this fucking weird thing [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5274.16s)]
*  that's going on in your head called resistance, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5277.04s)]
*  and it keeps you from doing the work that you wanna do [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5279.2s)]
*  that's almost always satisfying when it's done. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5281.299999999999s)]
*  And when you're done, you're like, God, I did it. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5283.679999999999s)]
*  But part of you is gonna go, let's not do that. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5285.36s)]
*  Let's check out YouTube. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5288.88s)]
*  Let's look at this. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5292.719999999999s)]
*  Let's look at the news. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5293.5599999999995s)]
*  Let's go on the news, man. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5294.4s)]
*  Maybe some weird shit's happening [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5295.5599999999995s)]
*  that I need to pay attention to. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5296.799999999999s)]
*  And then next thing you know, it's an hour and a half later [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5297.92s)]
*  and you could have been writing the whole time. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5299.6s)]
*  And every time I do just sit down and write, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5301.64s)]
*  I'm always happier. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5303.360000000001s)]
*  But there's always this little bit of a resistance. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5305.0s)]
*  So it's kind of the same feeling that I get [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5308.04s)]
*  before a workout or before a cold plunge or before anything. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5310.64s)]
*  It's just this feeling of knowing [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5313.6s)]
*  that there's some shit you gotta do. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5315.200000000001s)]
*  There was this story that I learned about Victor Hugo. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5317.64s)]
*  The Jiu Jitsu guy? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5321.64s)]
*  No, this is a writer. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5322.5s)]
*  Oh, okay. I want to say. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5324.08s)]
*  Victor Hugo is a world champion Jiu Jitsu guy. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5325.56s)]
*  He might also be a writer from the 1800s. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5329.04s)]
*  He might be both of those things. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5331.28s)]
*  Could be. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5332.44s)]
*  He's a time traveling man. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5333.28s)]
*  So he was a writer and he paid his servant to come in [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5334.12s)]
*  every night during the middle of the night [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5339.12s)]
*  while he was asleep and pull the bedsheets off of him, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5340.84s)]
*  off his bed, leave six pieces of paper in his bedroom [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5344.32s)]
*  and a pen or a quill and lock him in. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5349.28s)]
*  And until Victor had slid all six pieces of paper [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5352.44s)]
*  written on underneath the door, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5356.68s)]
*  his servant wouldn't let him out. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5358.56s)]
*  The level that people get to. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5360.8s)]
*  But think about when you're really struggling [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5363.04s)]
*  with the creative process, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5365.56s)]
*  the ridiculousness of the things [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5368.080000000001s)]
*  that will look attractive to you. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5370.080000000001s)]
*  It's like, I haven't sorted the cigar cupboard [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5371.240000000001s)]
*  alphabetically in quite a while. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5375.84s)]
*  I really think that the cigar cupboard could do it. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5380.360000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5383.080000000001s)]
*  That brick that's been outside, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5384.4800000000005s)]
*  I really should find a place for that brick. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5386.0s)]
*  And the bird feeder needs refilling. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5387.36s)]
*  You just find these bizarre things [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5391.12s)]
*  because your body is just doing everything it can. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5392.839999999999s)]
*  But this is a Huberman's thing, right? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5395.719999999999s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5397.48s)]
*  The mid singular cortex, MSC, it's that thing. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5398.32s)]
*  Apparently Goggins has got like the biggest one in the world. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5400.719999999999s)]
*  It's just the thing that allows you [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5402.96s)]
*  to overcome doing hard stuff. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5405.92s)]
*  Right, that actually grows. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5407.32s)]
*  Yeah, it actually grows upon exertion. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5409.5599999999995s)]
*  Doing things you don't wanna do. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5412.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's real. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5413.839999999999s)]
*  I think I've always recognized that that's a thing. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5416.24s)]
*  Because when I take time off of working out, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5419.4s)]
*  it's really hard to go back to it. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5421.879999999999s)]
*  But if you do it all the time, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5423.16s)]
*  it just becomes a normal part of your life. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5424.759999999999s)]
*  Dude, routine is such a vicious cycle up and down. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5426.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think the whole body's that way. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5430.36s)]
*  I really do. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5433.5599999999995s)]
*  I think basically the way you can strengthen your muscles [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5434.4s)]
*  and you can strengthen your cardiovascular system, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5438.08s)]
*  I think your mind works this exact same way. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5440.2s)]
*  I really 100% believe that. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5442.4s)]
*  And I think also the neglected conjunction of the two [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5445.76s)]
*  is significant, it's very important. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5448.8s)]
*  So many intellectuals just don't think about their bodies [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5451.2s)]
*  and it's so unfortunate. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5453.72s)]
*  You're just wracked with inflammation [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5454.88s)]
*  and just weak joints and weak muscles [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5457.6s)]
*  and just you can't open up a jar of mayonnaise. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5461.72s)]
*  It's like you don't wanna live like that, man. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5463.8s)]
*  You don't have to. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5465.84s)]
*  It's like the idea that the two are mutually exclusive [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5466.84s)]
*  is stupid. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5469.28s)]
*  That's a stupid idea. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5470.36s)]
*  The idea that you shouldn't take care of your body [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5471.84s)]
*  and that you should really concentrate on your mind. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5473.56s)]
*  That's just dumb. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5475.76s)]
*  It's a dumb thing to do. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5476.6s)]
*  You're not gonna be doing complex math 24 hours a day. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5478.400000000001s)]
*  You can take the time to do some fucking pushups. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5483.56s)]
*  How many people do you think have it the other way around? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5487.16s)]
*  Oh, 100%, yeah. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5490.76s)]
*  Well, also because in today's day and age, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5492.24s)]
*  there's doing it for the gram, right? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5496.84s)]
*  So there's like people that are really jacked [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5499.12s)]
*  that want everybody to see their muscles. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5500.96s)]
*  And so you're doing it all day long. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5503.0s)]
*  You're lifting weights. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5507.24s)]
*  You're involved in recovery and all sorts of, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5508.4s)]
*  if you've got the time to do that. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5511.36s)]
*  If you have a job too, well, what the fuck? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5513.72s)]
*  How do you have the time? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5515.96s)]
*  But if you don't have a job, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5517.08s)]
*  if you're like a fitness influencer, you know? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5518.48s)]
*  That is your job. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5521.2s)]
*  You're fucking busy, man. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5522.28s)]
*  You wanna be jacked online all the time. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5523.96s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're probably not reading a lot of books. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5526.88s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5529.08s)]
*  Not meditating all that much. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5529.92s)]
*  Maybe you are. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5531.16s)]
*  Maybe that's part of your vibe. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5532.32s)]
*  Maybe you're giving off that holistic vibe. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5534.08s)]
*  That's what you're trying to push. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5536.88s)]
*  You're falling into that line. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5539.2s)]
*  You're bowing to people and shit, saying, I'm not staying. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5541.28s)]
*  You gotta be careful with that though. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5544.36s)]
*  I tried to come up with a name for a trend I saw in myself, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5547.0s)]
*  which was productivity purgatory, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5551.58s)]
*  which is even the things [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5554.04s)]
*  that I was supposed to be doing for leisure, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5555.599999999999s)]
*  I was justifying because they somehow contributed [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5557.639999999999s)]
*  to my output for work. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5560.76s)]
*  I wasn't taking a walk in nature [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5563.4400000000005s)]
*  because I wanted to enjoy it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5565.2s)]
*  It's because I once watched an Andrew Huberman episode [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5566.72s)]
*  that said 15 minutes of sunlight in the eyes [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5568.72s)]
*  improves your productivity throughout the day [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5570.360000000001s)]
*  by whatever, whatever. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5571.84s)]
*  It was like, if you're not careful, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5572.8s)]
*  everything that you do is infused with this desire, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5577.68s)]
*  this need, this compulsion to be productive. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5580.84s)]
*  And I think that that's dangerous. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5583.8s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5585.2s)]
*  It's just not good to be a human being with that. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5586.04s)]
*  But if you wanna be the best at something, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5588.96s)]
*  you've gotta be obsessive. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5590.8s)]
*  It's really the best strategy. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5591.64s)]
*  If you really wanna compete against other top dogs, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5593.68s)]
*  you're gonna have to do more or be better, be smarter, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5597.72s)]
*  figure something out that they're not figuring out. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5601.24s)]
*  Well, it's really a game [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5603.32s)]
*  of who's prepared to sacrifice most. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5604.16s)]
*  It's also who's prepared to learn the most, right? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5606.32s)]
*  Who's good at recognizing what actually happened [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5608.56s)]
*  versus what you've been comforting yourself with. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5612.56s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5614.96s)]
*  If there's a bad result, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5615.8s)]
*  whether it's a bad result of business [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5618.16s)]
*  or a bad result of your personal life, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5620.04s)]
*  there's always this desire that people have [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5622.76s)]
*  to find a reason why it wasn't their fault [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5625.96s)]
*  because it's uncomfortable. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5628.92s)]
*  But if you can recognize, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5630.12s)]
*  oh, this product tanked because of me, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5631.92s)]
*  this is a stupid idea, and I need to course correct, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5635.5199999999995s)]
*  and I need to realize what I did wrong. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5640.04s)]
*  Instead of blaming the suppliers [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5642.12s)]
*  or blaming the manufacturers [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5644.16s)]
*  or blaming the other people on the design team [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5645.96s)]
*  or blaming this, whatever the fuck you're making, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5648.84s)]
*  or whether it's an album you just put out [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5650.88s)]
*  that just everybody hates it, what did I do wrong? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5652.76s)]
*  Don't bullshit. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5655.8s)]
*  What do I need to do different? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5657.2s)]
*  And for a lot of people, that is an uncomfortable moment [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5659.56s)]
*  that they don't want to experience. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5662.24s)]
*  And so if you're a high performer, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5664.0s)]
*  the more you could recognize [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5667.36s)]
*  what you've actually done wrong and course correct, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5669.36s)]
*  and not just be, if you're like a CEO of a company, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5672.2s)]
*  you've got so many people kissing your ass, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5676.68s)]
*  it's like your ego's gotta be inflated, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5678.72s)]
*  it's gonna be so hard to see the forest for the trees, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5680.64s)]
*  just like being a movie star on a set. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5683.4800000000005s)]
*  Everybody loves you, here's your bagel. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5685.28s)]
*  Mr. Williamson, can I get you anything? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5687.400000000001s)]
*  You get a delusional perspective. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5689.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's like amongst those people, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5693.0s)]
*  how many of them can keep their humanity? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5695.04s)]
*  How many of them can actually just be human? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5697.12s)]
*  And then your metrics, how many of them are happy? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5699.28s)]
*  How many of these, if you can be a guy [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5702.400000000001s)]
*  who's a high performer and also be happy, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5704.68s)]
*  I don't know how happy Elon is, but I know he laughs a lot. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5706.4400000000005s)]
*  Like I've been around that dude a lot, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5709.88s)]
*  and he's always laughing about shit. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5711.16s)]
*  He's always laughing about shit. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5712.52s)]
*  He's clearly under an extreme amount of pressure. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5713.88s)]
*  He's clearly a high performer, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5717.320000000001s)]
*  but he's also seems to be enjoying a lot of it. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5718.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you see his interview recently with Lex? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5722.0s)]
*  I think it was maybe four months ago. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5724.72s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5726.16s)]
*  So on that is a really interesting point [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5727.0s)]
*  where Lex is asking him basically what it's like [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5729.96s)]
*  to be Elon. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5733.88s)]
*  And Elon says, most people think they would want to be me, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5735.400000000001s)]
*  but they do not want to be me. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5739.36s)]
*  My mind is a storm. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5741.12s)]
*  They don't know. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5742.52s)]
*  They don't understand. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5743.400000000001s)]
*  He said that to me too. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5744.72s)]
*  It's fucking like apocalyptic and terrifying. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5746.28s)]
*  We spoke about this last time, Tiger Woods, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5750.12s)]
*  the price that people pay to be the person [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5752.4400000000005s)]
*  that you admire. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5754.4400000000005s)]
*  Tiger Woods goes through this really difficult period [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5755.68s)]
*  with his father and all the rest of it. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5758.2s)]
*  This is the best remedy for envy that I can think of [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5760.72s)]
*  because people look at Elon as this dude, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5766.0s)]
*  he's sending rockets to Mars [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5768.68s)]
*  and he's making the coolest cars on the planet. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5770.28s)]
*  And he's on stage in Japan or China or whatever, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5772.16s)]
*  doing weird robot dances and shit. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5774.400000000001s)]
*  He's super rich. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5776.0s)]
*  You don't know the price that he's had to pay for that. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5777.08s)]
*  You don't know the internal texture of someone's mind. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5781.4400000000005s)]
*  Your heroes aren't gods. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5785.52s)]
*  They're just regular people who probably got good [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5786.92s)]
*  one thing by sacrificing literally everything else. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5789.0s)]
*  Especially as a high performing athlete, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5797.68s)]
*  what are your options? [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5801.2s)]
*  If you wanna be a fighter in the UFC, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5803.76s)]
*  you can't also be coding. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5806.96s)]
*  You can't also be working at Microsoft. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5812.76s)]
*  There's not- [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5814.76s)]
*  Can you also have a functioning relationship? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5815.84s)]
*  Can you also be- [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5817.72s)]
*  The thing about fighters is you do have a lot of downtime [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5819.280000000001s)]
*  when you have to recover. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5822.68s)]
*  You train a lot during the day, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5823.8s)]
*  but if you make a living fighting, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5825.280000000001s)]
*  you will be able to have a relationship. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5827.360000000001s)]
*  And with some of them, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5829.04s)]
*  that relationship offers them a significant amount [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5830.68s)]
*  of emotional reinforcement. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5833.320000000001s)]
*  Parasympathetic activation. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5835.76s)]
*  Yeah, it gives them comfort. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5837.72s)]
*  It makes them feel normal. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5839.12s)]
*  Some guys separate from their families for camp [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5840.12s)]
*  because they just wanna be animals. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5843.320000000001s)]
*  They just wanna sleep in a fucking hotel room [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5845.6s)]
*  and just get up and train every day like a soldier. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5848.08s)]
*  They just want, their mind is on one thing, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5851.0s)]
*  this six week from now event. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5853.2s)]
*  And until then, I don't wanna hear shit. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5855.6s)]
*  When Marvin Hagler's kid was born, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5857.68s)]
*  he didn't go to the hospital. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5859.52s)]
*  He wasn't at the hospital, he was in camp. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5860.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Marvin Hagler would go off to Provincetown, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5862.68s)]
*  just down the Cape, and he would run. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5866.96s)]
*  He would run in the fucking winter on the sand. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5869.320000000001s)]
*  There's that famous Darren Till interview [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5871.6s)]
*  where he's saying, I've got a two year old daughter, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5874.120000000001s)]
*  don't care, all I care about is legacy and greatness. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5876.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5880.56s)]
*  It's a high price that people pay. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5882.0s)]
*  I mean, Sean Strickland, who continues to seem to, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5884.0s)]
*  he seems to be sparring like any YouTuber or streamer [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5888.08s)]
*  that's prepared to get into the ring with him. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5891.76s)]
*  Well, he beat up that kid who's a smaller [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5893.56s)]
*  than him streamer named Sneeko, which is not a good look. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5896.52s)]
*  He beat the shit out of that guy. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5900.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5902.52s)]
*  I just don't know why he wanted to do that. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5903.360000000001s)]
*  It's so easy for him to beat that guy up. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5904.84s)]
*  It's not fair. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5908.0s)]
*  It was what we were talking about before. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5908.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's not fair. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5909.68s)]
*  It's just like, it's not really, I mean, the kid, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5911.0s)]
*  I don't know what that kid thought. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5913.92s)]
*  First of all, he's so silly for doing that, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5915.200000000001s)]
*  for agreeing to do that with Sean Strickland. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5917.4400000000005s)]
*  Because you know that he's never gonna have that hold back. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5919.320000000001s)]
*  If you agree to do that with Israel Adesanya, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5922.120000000001s)]
*  Israel Adesanya will take care of you, I swear to God. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5924.52s)]
*  He'll pop you a little bit [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5927.08s)]
*  and he'll let you know that you're helpless. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5929.08s)]
*  But he won't fuck you up. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5931.0s)]
*  He'll smile and laugh and he'll hug you afterwards. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5933.16s)]
*  You could spar with him. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5936.04s)]
*  I guarantee you could spar with him. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5937.04s)]
*  And then just touch your face just to let you know. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5938.44s)]
*  Like you would have been knocked out, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5940.76s)]
*  but I just touched your face. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5941.96s)]
*  Just gonna touch you a little bit. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5943.36s)]
*  Move around, you can't touch me. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5944.5199999999995s)]
*  I touch you. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5946.08s)]
*  Here's a sphinct and a gnats coming at you. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5947.32s)]
*  And if he's not, if he's kicking, you're fucked. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5950.5199999999995s)]
*  But even if he's just using his hands, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5952.68s)]
*  if you're some streamer, he wouldn't hurt you. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5954.0s)]
*  But Sean Strickland's a different animal. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5956.36s)]
*  Sean Strickland has, you know, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5958.24s)]
*  he's got this fucking man code and he believes in it. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5960.2s)]
*  Like you gotta get your ass kicked every now and then. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5963.96s)]
*  He spars all the time. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5966.28s)]
*  Spars constantly. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5967.639999999999s)]
*  And if you agree to get in there with him, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5968.599999999999s)]
*  you're essentially agreeing to let him beat the fuck [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5970.639999999999s)]
*  out of you, because you don't really have a chance. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5973.5199999999995s)]
*  Like you have no chance. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5975.8s)]
*  But in Sean's defense, when he lost to Alex Paheda, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5977.32s)]
*  one of the first things he did was go to Connecticut [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5982.599999999999s)]
*  to go over to Shera's gym where Alex trains [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5985.2s)]
*  and train with him. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5987.4s)]
*  When we was training with Alex Paheda, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5988.719999999999s)]
*  he was light sparring. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5990.44s)]
*  So this is fucking light. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5992.639999999999s)]
*  Watch, find the video of Sean Strickland training [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5994.44s)]
*  with Alex Paheda, because he's smart. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5997.759999999999s)]
*  Because you can't, that guy's not Sneak-O. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=5999.839999999999s)]
*  You can't just tool off. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6001.759999999999s)]
*  That guy already knocked you out. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6003.04s)]
*  Like Paheda knocked him out in the first round. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6004.48s)]
*  He hit him with a left hook and then a right hand [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6006.4s)]
*  as he was going down. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6007.96s)]
*  Like Paheda's a monster. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6008.92s)]
*  So he was sparring with this monster. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6010.16s)]
*  He's like, who's this fucking be friends? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6011.639999999999s)]
*  Let's just be friends, buddy. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6014.16s)]
*  Teach me your cheat codes. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6016.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6017.8s)]
*  Well, and Paheda teaches people, which is very interesting. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6018.64s)]
*  He's that confident in his ability [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6022.08s)]
*  that he'll take a guy that he just fought [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6024.02s)]
*  and a guy who is now the current, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6026.04s)]
*  look how they're sparring, nice and light. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6028.12s)]
*  See this? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6030.2s)]
*  They're just touching each other, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6032.0s)]
*  just using distance and sparring. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6033.42s)]
*  And there was an actual, see, these guys are sparring, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6035.56s)]
*  but they're not hitting each other hard at all. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6038.92s)]
*  And there was a very interesting video [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6041.92s)]
*  that I just watched yesterday [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6044.42s)]
*  where this guy was talking about that in martial arts. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6046.38s)]
*  I don't know if you'll be able to find it. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6049.42s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6050.66s)]
*  I guarantee you it's on my list of shit that I just watched [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6051.58s)]
*  because YouTube will give you a list of shit [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6056.5s)]
*  you just watched. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6057.78s)]
*  Oh, the history? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6058.62s)]
*  Yeah, which is nice. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6059.4400000000005s)]
*  But it was very interesting [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6060.82s)]
*  because it was talking about the importance of play [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6063.06s)]
*  when it comes to martial arts sparring. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6066.54s)]
*  In that sparring, the only way to learn [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6069.42s)]
*  is to not be under this intense high pressure, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6073.62s)]
*  high stress situation. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6076.62s)]
*  And for most people, sparring is terrifying, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6078.62s)]
*  especially sparring if you're sparring someone [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6082.18s)]
*  who's like really dangerous. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6084.38s)]
*  Is it in this video? Yes, this is that guy. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6086.14s)]
*  It's a long video, though. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6087.46s)]
*  Yes, and Max Holloway talked about it, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6088.3s)]
*  how he doesn't spar and see, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6090.22s)]
*  but what he's essentially saying is he breaks down the mind [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6091.74s)]
*  and where is your optimal time to learn? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6096.48s)]
*  And he talks about how animals play [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6101.42s)]
*  and about young animals, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6104.3s)]
*  like when a lion is jumping on another lion, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6105.62s)]
*  they're learning to play. Rough and tumble play. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6108.42s)]
*  And the ties, he also breaks down how the ties spar. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6109.9s)]
*  Ties spar very light, they just touch each other. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6113.68s)]
*  They're just touching each other. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6117.5s)]
*  I've been out to Thailand, I've seen it. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6118.58s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6119.84s)]
*  And high level guys do that. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6120.68s)]
*  And they do that so they can fight all the time [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6123.06s)]
*  because they fight almost every week sometimes. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6126.54s)]
*  So when they're training, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6128.76s)]
*  they can't be getting beat up all the time. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6130.7s)]
*  So they learn how to, and that's Firas Alhabi [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6132.58s)]
*  actually talking about that on my... [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6136.26s)]
*  That guy was fascinating. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6137.86s)]
*  Firas is a genius. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6139.54s)]
*  He's one of the greatest martial arts trainers of all time, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6140.58s)]
*  if not the best. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6142.5s)]
*  So see, these guys, they're training and they're touching. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6144.62s)]
*  See, they just touch each other. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6147.54s)]
*  And when you do that, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6149.0599999999995s)]
*  you don't have the fear of getting hit back as much [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6150.36s)]
*  and you learn combinations better, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6153.9s)]
*  you learn timing better. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6155.58s)]
*  When I first started coming to California, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6157.0599999999995s)]
*  I started training at this place called the Jet Center. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6159.58s)]
*  It was Benny the Jet or Kiedez, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6162.18s)]
*  who's this world famous kickboxer. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6163.48s)]
*  And he had this place in California that we... [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6165.5s)]
*  It was like two places I wanted to go to [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6167.74s)]
*  when I came to California. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6169.46s)]
*  One was a comedy store and one was the Jet Center. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6170.5s)]
*  And unfortunately, they had just been damaged. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6173.14s)]
*  They had the roof damaged from an earthquake. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6175.46s)]
*  And so they had like flooding problems and stuff [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6177.46s)]
*  and they had to move out of that location. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6180.26s)]
*  So I was only there for like a short period of time [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6181.9s)]
*  before they went under. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6183.82s)]
*  But there was guys you could spar there [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6185.46s)]
*  that were like really good kickboxers, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6187.5s)]
*  but they knew how to spar correctly. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6190.0s)]
*  So there was this one dude that I used to spar with [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6192.5599999999995s)]
*  all the time and I was getting so sharp [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6194.4s)]
*  because we never hit each other hard. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6196.5599999999995s)]
*  And I knew I could trust him and he knew he could trust me. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6198.599999999999s)]
*  So we were sparring all the time. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6201.72s)]
*  And I was not getting fucked up. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6203.44s)]
*  Like I'd spar on a day that I had to film something. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6205.24s)]
*  Cause I knew that I would- [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6207.84s)]
*  And you'd be able to still go to work [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6208.68s)]
*  without a bloody nose or a black eye. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6209.5s)]
*  So I did all my hard work on like the heavy bag, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6210.92s)]
*  but then when I was sparring, everything is just movement. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6213.42s)]
*  What is the, or what are the bad habits [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6216.92s)]
*  that someone who does that too much can, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6221.12s)]
*  would you maybe begin to habituate pulling your punches, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6223.56s)]
*  not telegraphing sufficiently? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6227.36s)]
*  No, you would never, you would never, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6228.2s)]
*  if you've fought before, you'll never pull your punches. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6230.0s)]
*  That's not a concern. But you know what I mean? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6232.34s)]
*  Because you're obviously, you are dialing back that power, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6233.24s)]
*  that penetration. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6235.64s)]
*  You could say that with point karate. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6236.56s)]
*  Cause point karate, they kind of dive in [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6238.68s)]
*  and just touch each other, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6240.6s)]
*  but they all know how to hit bags. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6241.6s)]
*  They all know how to hit mitts. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6244.4800000000005s)]
*  They all know how to hit tie pads. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6245.72s)]
*  They all know how to do that. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6247.68s)]
*  They know how to hit things. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6248.68s)]
*  It's just the real skill level is in control. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6249.96s)]
*  The real skill level is in be able to counter quickly, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6254.240000000001s)]
*  but know exactly where your hand is going. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6257.2s)]
*  And you can do that. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6259.72s)]
*  You can learn how to control force in a way that like, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6261.16s)]
*  when I used to do a Tae Kwon Do demonstrations, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6265.54s)]
*  like when we'd open up a new school, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6268.04s)]
*  one of the things you'd have to do is like, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6269.240000000001s)]
*  throw kicks at people's faces, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6271.6s)]
*  like stop it at their face, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6274.44s)]
*  just to show them like the kind of control that's possible. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6276.679999999999s)]
*  And you would have your foot like literally fly up, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6279.98s)]
*  like right in front of someone's face. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6282.5199999999995s)]
*  And you would have someone stand there [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6283.96s)]
*  who's another student, you would demonstrate on them. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6285.759999999999s)]
*  You just gotta stand there, not flinch. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6288.639999999999s)]
*  Yep. And you just stand there. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6290.04s)]
*  And my instructor used to do it to me all the time. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6291.32s)]
*  He would do it to someone in every class. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6293.16s)]
*  Like in the front row, [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6294.92s)]
*  he would demonstrate by stopping the kick in the air [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6296.12s)]
*  in front of your face. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6299.679999999999s)]
*  Fuck, that's cool. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6300.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And so you would learn how to do that [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6301.36s)]
*  when you would do that in like, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6304.06s)]
*  so the ability to pull a shot [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6305.3s)]
*  is a part of being a really high level martial artist. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6307.860000000001s)]
*  And the ability to spar without, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6311.54s)]
*  and spar fast without hitting each other hard [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6313.9800000000005s)]
*  is also, it's like something you should know how to do. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6317.1s)]
*  It's a part of the, once you know that you're hitting, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6320.740000000001s)]
*  the only thing is like the anxiety of being hit, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6323.660000000001s)]
*  that's in the danger of being hit. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6326.06s)]
*  Because if you're just used to like pulling shots, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6328.14s)]
*  you could get an uncomfortable sense of you, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6330.740000000001s)]
*  like a dangerous sense of your safety. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6334.18s)]
*  Your robustness and your safety. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6336.14s)]
*  Cause any one shot takes you out. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6337.3s)]
*  Any one good shot from a strong striker can take you out. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6339.34s)]
*  So you want no shots landing clean. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6342.64s)]
*  You want everything to be moving away from you. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6344.98s)]
*  This is new though, right? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6347.18s)]
*  I've heard a lot of guys, older school UFC guys saying [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6348.0199999999995s)]
*  that this light sparring thing [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6351.5s)]
*  is a pretty new invention. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6352.8s)]
*  Totally. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6355.0599999999995s)]
*  People were getting knocked out in sparring. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6355.9s)]
*  All the time, all the time. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6357.78s)]
*  Yeah. Some of the old school training camps, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6359.46s)]
*  like you'd hear stories about like, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6361.4s)]
*  particularly shoot the box in Brazil. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6362.98s)]
*  In Curitiba, they had some of the best fighters [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6365.139999999999s)]
*  of the golden era of pride. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6367.86s)]
*  They had Vanderlei Silva, they had Ninja, Shogun, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6369.66s)]
*  Anderson Silva, they had so many killers [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6374.74s)]
*  that came out as one gym. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6377.379999999999s)]
*  And bro, they beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6378.66s)]
*  They beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6381.7s)]
*  They knocked each other out all the time. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6383.82s)]
*  Vanderlei Silva and Shogun famously had a fight [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6386.5s)]
*  to see whether or not one of them would pay for a pit bull. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6392.46s)]
*  Because one of them had the pit bull. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6396.18s)]
*  I think Shogun had the pit bull [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6397.7s)]
*  and he was offered to sell it to Vanderlei [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6399.14s)]
*  and Vanderlei said, I'll fight you for it. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6400.54s)]
*  And so they fought and Vanderlei apparently won [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6402.54s)]
*  and got the dog. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6406.46s)]
*  Just in the gym. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6408.26s)]
*  Just fight. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6409.1s)]
*  No one's getting paid apart from in a dog. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6410.1s)]
*  No, they would fight, fight, like fight, fight. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6412.1s)]
*  So when they would go to fights, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6414.42s)]
*  they're so used to fighting. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6416.06s)]
*  I'd fight over Carl. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6417.42s)]
*  The thing about it is though, man, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6418.94s)]
*  it's gonna shorten your career substantially. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6420.82s)]
*  Substantially. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6424.0599999999995s)]
*  It'll shorten your durability [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6425.26s)]
*  towards the end of your career substantially. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6426.86s)]
*  You see it in every fighter [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6429.3s)]
*  that comes from that sort of environment. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6430.74s)]
*  And the traumatic brain injuries that they get [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6432.26s)]
*  when they spar like that all the time, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6436.38s)]
*  especially when they're not slick. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6438.78s)]
*  The thing about Anderson Silva above all those guys [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6441.0199999999995s)]
*  is that Anderson was slick. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6444.0199999999995s)]
*  He was very difficult to hit clean. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6446.099999999999s)]
*  So Anderson Silva, when he's sparring, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6448.46s)]
*  he's flowing and moving. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6451.58s)]
*  He's very difficult to catch. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6452.66s)]
*  Those guys would go to war, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6454.78s)]
*  just point on the mouthpiece and fucking, ra-ah. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6456.5s)]
*  You ever see Vanderlei Silva fight? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6459.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6462.0199999999995s)]
*  His next name's the Axe Murderer. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6462.86s)]
*  Vanderlei Silva in Brazil. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6464.86s)]
*  Was that the guy, let's go now, let's go now. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6466.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's one of the Chael. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6468.0199999999995s)]
*  Chael Sonnen, but that was at the end of his career. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6469.38s)]
*  That was at the end of his career [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6471.74s)]
*  when he came to the UFC. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6472.94s)]
*  Post TRT. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6474.3s)]
*  He'd gotten off of all the stuff that he was on [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6475.46s)]
*  when he was in Brazil. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6478.66s)]
*  You want fully-roided Vanderlei in Brazil [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6480.34s)]
*  when he was a young man. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6483.34s)]
*  He was a fucking animal, dude. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6484.38s)]
*  He was an animal. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6486.34s)]
*  He was so scary. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6487.82s)]
*  This was the bare-knuckle days. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6490.42s)]
*  This was like his first fight. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6491.74s)]
*  Bare-knuckle's coming back. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6493.5s)]
*  Yeah, it is coming back. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6494.58s)]
*  Well, bare-knuckle for UFC was how they first started. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6495.78s)]
*  Yeah, look, Vanderlei was, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6498.66s)]
*  and he had a cool tattoo on the back of his head. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6499.86s)]
*  He was an animal, dude. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6502.74s)]
*  He was an animal. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6503.9s)]
*  I saw him meet a fan. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6504.74s)]
*  I saw him meet a fan once. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6506.259999999999s)]
*  The guy had the same tattoo on his head [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6507.5s)]
*  and he was like, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6509.0599999999995s)]
*  oh, you can do head kicks on the ground. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6509.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, everything. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6510.74s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6511.58s)]
*  In little briefs as well. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6512.42s)]
*  I love the briefs. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6513.259999999999s)]
*  This is Vali Tudo. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6514.099999999999s)]
*  This isn't Brazil. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6514.94s)]
*  This is where it all started, man. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6515.78s)]
*  This is how they did it in Brazil, man. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6516.98s)]
*  In Brazil, bare-knuckle, Vali Tudo. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6518.5s)]
*  It's just when the United States got involved [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6521.66s)]
*  that it became the thing that it is now. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6523.42s)]
*  That's a pussy it up. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6526.0599999999995s)]
*  With gloves. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6526.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6527.74s)]
*  I mean, they were stomping [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6528.58s)]
*  and kicking each other in the balls. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6529.9s)]
*  This is Vanderlei when he got to the UFC. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6532.9s)]
*  So in these days, this was the UFC with zero testing. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6534.62s)]
*  And you see him, he looks fucking shredded. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6538.0199999999995s)]
*  And then, I mean, Vanderlei was a terrifying force. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6540.74s)]
*  And then he goes over to Pride [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6543.46s)]
*  and he becomes a champion of Pride. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6544.94s)]
*  But he was fucking people. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6546.179999999999s)]
*  And there's him against Guy Metzger, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6547.219999999999s)]
*  who was a very good fighter. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6548.78s)]
*  And Vanderlei just overwhelmed him. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6550.62s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6552.7s)]
*  Bro, overwhelmed him. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6553.54s)]
*  It's just head butts, everything. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6554.7s)]
*  Knees, see that head butt? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6556.42s)]
*  I don't think that head butt was legal, by the way. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6557.42s)]
*  I don't think that was legal back then, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6559.66s)]
*  but it didn't matter. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6560.9s)]
*  They weren't gonna stop it. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6561.78s)]
*  And then Vanderlei puts him away. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6562.86s)]
*  I wanted to- [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6565.099999999999s)]
*  Monster, dude. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6565.94s)]
*  He was a monster in his prime. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6566.78s)]
*  He had to get his face reconstructed [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6568.099999999999s)]
*  because his nose was so flat [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6569.54s)]
*  that he couldn't breathe out of it at all. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6571.179999999999s)]
*  So they took a big chunk of cartilage out of his rib [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6572.759999999999s)]
*  and reconstructed his face. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6574.96s)]
*  And he had a totally new face. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6576.42s)]
*  They made it big. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6578.62s)]
*  He got a big nose so he could really breathe. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6579.7s)]
*  Yeah, he looked like a different human. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6583.0199999999995s)]
*  Like after the surgery, he looked like a, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6584.54s)]
*  like he showed up one day and I was like, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6586.42s)]
*  what is going on? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6587.86s)]
*  I was like, we're at the weigh-in. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6588.7s)]
*  I knew that he had got his nose fixed, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6590.7s)]
*  but they just fixed, they gave him a different nose. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6593.219999999999s)]
*  It gets way bigger so he could breathe more. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6596.06s)]
*  He was beating the fuck out of people. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6597.9800000000005s)]
*  He wanted more air. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6599.26s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6601.320000000001s)]
*  Vanderlei was an animal. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6603.700000000001s)]
*  Who do you think's more, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6605.42s)]
*  is there anyone else that was more psychopathic [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6606.660000000001s)]
*  or more of an animal across your commentary career? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6609.06s)]
*  There's so many of them. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6612.1s)]
*  Who ranks close to the top? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6613.9800000000005s)]
*  Mike Perry, who's one of the bare-knuckle fighters now. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6616.02s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6618.900000000001s)]
*  He's about as ferocious as a human being gets. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6619.740000000001s)]
*  He's the dude that chipped Luke Rockhold's tooth, right? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6622.660000000001s)]
*  He told them what was gonna happen before the fight. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6625.94s)]
*  He's going, I'm gonna fuck you up and you're gonna quit. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6627.54s)]
*  And he just went out and made him quit. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6630.58s)]
*  Did exactly what he said. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6632.3s)]
*  He's an animal, man. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6633.54s)]
*  He's a real animal. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6634.78s)]
*  This BKFC thing's interesting. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6636.22s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a very different kind of fighting, man, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6638.18s)]
*  when you don't have the protection of gloves. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6640.94s)]
*  Every punch hurts way more. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6643.54s)]
*  And it also hurts your hands. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6645.5s)]
*  Is the wrapping on their wrists [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6646.78s)]
*  just to provide a little bit of support structurally [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6648.84s)]
*  when they're hitting? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6650.9s)]
*  Yeah, structurally, it'll probably prevent some breaks. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6651.82s)]
*  That's basically all it does, is prevent some breaks. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6655.9s)]
*  It connects your thumb to the hands, too, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6658.38s)]
*  because the thumb breaks easy. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6660.0599999999995s)]
*  The thumb, like on a missed punch, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6661.66s)]
*  you might hit a forehead with the thumb, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6663.259999999999s)]
*  and the thumb will snap. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6664.5s)]
*  So it'll protect a little bit. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6666.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, see, Luke cracked him there with a good left hand. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6667.5s)]
*  And Luke was a fucking hell of a fighter in his prime, man. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6669.78s)]
*  He was UFC middleweight champion, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6673.099999999999s)]
*  and in his prime when he beat Chris Weidman, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6675.62s)]
*  he was a motherfucker, man. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6677.74s)]
*  He was a motherfucker. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6679.86s)]
*  But Mike Perry is not a guy that you can think you have. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6680.94s)]
*  He's just so tough. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6685.5s)]
*  He's gonna keep coming. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6686.98s)]
*  And if Luke stuck and moved, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6688.339999999999s)]
*  and maybe had a different strategy, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6690.5s)]
*  maybe he would've had a better time. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6691.759999999999s)]
*  But you let Mike Perry start mauling you, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6693.639999999999s)]
*  he's so dangerous, man. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6696.139999999999s)]
*  He's such a fucking killer. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6697.66s)]
*  And he doesn't feel pain. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6699.339999999999s)]
*  Or if he does, he doesn't let you know. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6700.82s)]
*  It's just, he's just uniquely built for that sport. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6702.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6706.299999999999s)]
*  I wanted to teach you about something [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6708.0599999999995s)]
*  that I'd learned on the show. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6709.179999999999s)]
*  So you've had a number of conversations [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6710.34s)]
*  about trans athletes in sport, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6712.18s)]
*  and about the dangers potentially of biological males [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6714.38s)]
*  moving over into women's leagues. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6718.42s)]
*  And it always kind of comes back to the same, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6720.46s)]
*  well, if we can get their hormones [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6723.42s)]
*  down to this particular kind of level, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6725.7s)]
*  basically can we reverse some of the structural changes? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6727.58s)]
*  And it kind of gets into this realm of hormonal fuckery, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6730.3s)]
*  which is fine, but I think that's kind of been talked [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6733.5s)]
*  to death. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6736.66s)]
*  There's something that I learned about on the show [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6737.5s)]
*  that I thought was even more important. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6738.54s)]
*  The male and female brain difference [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6741.18s)]
*  can be detected in utero, in embryos, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6745.3s)]
*  in fetuses that are six months old. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6750.3s)]
*  So this is a minus three months year old, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6753.38s)]
*  and they can already detect sexed brain differences. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6756.22s)]
*  By the age of 10, 93% accuracy of an MRI [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6760.06s)]
*  between a boy and a girl. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6764.900000000001s)]
*  That's exactly, or that's around about the same [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6767.3s)]
*  as your accuracy of detecting whether it's a man [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6770.54s)]
*  or a woman based on looking at their face. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6772.66s)]
*  That's the same degree of difference. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6775.0199999999995s)]
*  So one of the arguments that will be put forward [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6776.9s)]
*  is social roles theory. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6778.7s)]
*  So social roles theory is that boys behave like boys [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6780.62s)]
*  because they see boys behaving like boys, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6783.219999999999s)]
*  and girls do the same. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6784.98s)]
*  They're socially, they're socialized into doing this. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6786.46s)]
*  That doesn't seem to be true, because this is universal. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6791.0599999999995s)]
*  It's across the board. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6794.259999999999s)]
*  It's present before anybody's even been born, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6795.379999999999s)]
*  and it's present before androgens. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6799.18s)]
*  But the reason that this is, I think, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6800.740000000001s)]
*  important towards sport is that one of the key differences [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6802.62s)]
*  is in what's called visuospatial abilities. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6805.860000000001s)]
*  And males have a huge advantage in visuospatial abilities. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6808.860000000001s)]
*  This is preschoolers, age three and four, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6813.62s)]
*  they're throwing accuracy and they're throwing distance, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6816.9800000000005s)]
*  already begins to diverge from girls. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6820.1s)]
*  And by the age of 19, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6822.06s)]
*  there's essentially no crossover at all. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6822.9800000000005s)]
*  You could understand why this might be the case, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6825.58s)]
*  because, well, if you're a ancestral hunter, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6827.46s)]
*  you need to, as a man, be able to see, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6830.58s)]
*  this is an animal running this way, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6832.62s)]
*  I have this particular spear in my hand, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6834.26s)]
*  I'm going to throw it to intersect this. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6836.34s)]
*  So you go, okay, well, one of the problems of using that [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6839.14s)]
*  is you can't bifurcate a male's performance, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6841.22s)]
*  especially with something like throwing, visuospatial, [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6844.7s)]
*  from the physical structure that they have, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6847.42s)]
*  which is impacted by androgens. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6850.94s)]
*  So men have longer forearms, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6852.3s)]
*  their shoulders articulate in a different way. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6854.46s)]
*  They might have more trunk rotation, perhaps. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6856.74s)]
*  So they did a study to try and work this out. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6859.5s)]
*  Instead of having them throw things, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6862.98s)]
*  the lecturers at this university [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6865.58s)]
*  brought their undergrads in [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6867.26s)]
*  and used a tennis ball firing machine, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6868.38s)]
*  like you use for practicing returns in tennis, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6870.9s)]
*  as dodge ball. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6874.78s)]
*  And the guys in the class topped out the ceiling, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6876.219999999999s)]
*  they were very, very difficult to hit. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6879.78s)]
*  The same wasn't true for the girls. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6881.42s)]
*  The reason is that the male proclivity [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6883.58s)]
*  to be able to see things in space, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6887.5s)]
*  understand how they fit together, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6890.94s)]
*  understand the proprioception of where my body is [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6892.66s)]
*  and how I can interact with this is very, very different. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6894.86s)]
*  It's a sizable, statistically significant difference [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6898.62s)]
*  that you find between males and females. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6902.14s)]
*  Now females have their own advantages, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6903.98s)]
*  social cognition, which is otherwise known [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6905.54s)]
*  as emotional intelligence, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6908.0599999999995s)]
*  reading faces, lying detection, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6909.14s)]
*  what's called, I think it's local memorization [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6911.42s)]
*  or spatial memorization. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6914.38s)]
*  So you know those games where you've got a load of cards [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6915.86s)]
*  down on the table and you've got to match them, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6918.42s)]
*  girls would wipe the floor with guys. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6920.66s)]
*  So there are predispositions mentally [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6923.219999999999s)]
*  that men and women have. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6927.98s)]
*  And this is something, this is not, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6929.299999999999s)]
*  and this is the important thing, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6931.66s)]
*  this is not impacted by testosterone level. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6932.58s)]
*  So you as a biological male [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6935.179999999999s)]
*  can't take a ton of estrogen or hormone blockers [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6937.66s)]
*  and have your visual spatial ability [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6940.7s)]
*  be down-regulated to that of a woman. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6942.62s)]
*  So this to me explains an awful lot [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6945.14s)]
*  about why the WNBA is struggling [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6947.22s)]
*  because you are talking about [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6951.1s)]
*  a very different set of capacities. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6952.700000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, well, fortunately I guess, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6955.5s)]
*  the way that sports are done [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6957.860000000001s)]
*  is it needs to be visually compelling, right? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6958.900000000001s)]
*  You want to see cool things happening. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6960.900000000001s)]
*  You want to observe shit going on. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6962.62s)]
*  A lying detection test or someone turning over cards [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6965.58s)]
*  and matching them doesn't lend itself [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6968.1s)]
*  to being a spectator sport as much, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6969.700000000001s)]
*  which means that males have this predisposition, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6971.34s)]
*  which is more entertaining [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6974.54s)]
*  given the current rule sets of sport. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6976.0199999999995s)]
*  And this to me is a much more compelling unfairness [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6977.9s)]
*  when you're talking about [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6982.38s)]
*  male and female capabilities within sport. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6983.66s)]
*  This doesn't have anything to do with [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6986.66s)]
*  what time were they put on hormone blockers. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6987.78s)]
*  This doesn't have anything to do with [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6989.54s)]
*  what is the testosterone level at. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6991.38s)]
*  This is innate inbuilt predispositions. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6993.66s)]
*  But doesn't it have to be agreed upon [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6996.58s)]
*  by the people that are making these sort of decisions [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=6998.3s)]
*  because most people, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7000.14s)]
*  there's people that will resist that. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7002.58s)]
*  They might not think you're lying, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7004.700000000001s)]
*  but they might resist that. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7007.860000000001s)]
*  They might resist that and say it's not valid, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7009.14s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7011.38s)]
*  Statistically significant. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7012.22s)]
*  I mean, if it- [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7013.06s)]
*  Right, but you could see how [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7013.900000000001s)]
*  people would have an issue with that, right? [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7016.58s)]
*  Even though it's statistically significant, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7020.42s)]
*  people would go like, who did the study? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7022.14s)]
*  If you're trying to say that trans women are women, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7025.700000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of things that you could say [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7029.26s)]
*  that they have an advantage with physically. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7032.1s)]
*  Proving it mentally just based on that, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7036.5s)]
*  I agree, it seems an issue. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7039.42s)]
*  Well, you know how big of an issue? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7041.1s)]
*  It's an issue in pool. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7043.1s)]
*  Pool's not a strength game at all. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7045.3s)]
*  It's a finesse game. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7048.06s)]
*  It's a game of executing shots under pressure. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7049.820000000001s)]
*  It's a game of angles. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7055.400000000001s)]
*  And it's a game of geometry and feel. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7056.700000000001s)]
*  But very few women ever get to the level [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7058.94s)]
*  of an elite professional male. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7063.86s)]
*  It's like there's a small handful in history. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7065.5s)]
*  In history. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7068.139999999999s)]
*  And that's completely controlled for [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7068.98s)]
*  articulation of the shoulders, strength, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7071.339999999999s)]
*  maybe a tiny bit of strength on the break, I guess? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7073.139999999999s)]
*  Could be on the break. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7075.5s)]
*  But there's a lot of girls who break very well. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7076.5s)]
*  And the break today is more of a controlled break [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7078.299999999999s)]
*  because they're breaking on cloth that's a Simonis 860. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7080.78s)]
*  It's a very fast, clean cloth. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7084.339999999999s)]
*  Dude, your obsession with pool [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7086.62s)]
*  makes me laugh every time that I hear about it. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7088.46s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7090.22s)]
*  It's like this other wing of you that I never think about. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7091.66s)]
*  And then every time I walk in and I see that there's [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7095.78s)]
*  a pool hall basically in here, I'm like, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7098.02s)]
*  ah yeah, the fucking pool obsession. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7099.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'm obsessed with it. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7101.62s)]
*  But there's women that are really good. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7102.62s)]
*  They're better than me for sure. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7104.66s)]
*  But they never reach the level of a Shane Van Boney [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7105.92s)]
*  who's one of the best ever. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7109.54s)]
*  They just don't get to that place. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7111.44s)]
*  I just think it's an interesting addition to the discussion [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7113.12s)]
*  because you're always having the same conversation. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7116.98s)]
*  Well, what about if we get the hormone levels to here? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7119.7s)]
*  Well, actually we don't suggest that testosterone, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7121.339999999999s)]
*  but what about people that have got naturally high levels [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7123.259999999999s)]
*  of testosterone? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7124.86s)]
*  It never gets to innate, inbuilt, unchangeable differences [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7127.5s)]
*  about our capacities, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7132.459999999999s)]
*  about when it comes to the field of play. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7134.299999999999s)]
*  And if you were to take the top 100 female WNBA players [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7136.5s)]
*  and the top 100 male NBA players, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7143.98s)]
*  and you were to say, let's just shoot free throws. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7147.34s)]
*  Let's just see how many are made. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7149.5s)]
*  That should be a pretty even playing field. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7152.34s)]
*  And I bet that it would be, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7154.66s)]
*  the disparity will be very high. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7156.58s)]
*  Very high. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7158.2s)]
*  In the pool world, the reason why I was bringing this up, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7159.9s)]
*  recently a woman made it to the finals of a tournament [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7162.82s)]
*  with a transgender woman and just quit. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7166.28s)]
*  She said, I'm not gonna play you. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7169.12s)]
*  In pool? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7170.82s)]
*  Yeah, they got to a woman's tournament [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7171.66s)]
*  and this transgender woman, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7173.76s)]
*  by the way, with pool tournaments, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7176.58s)]
*  I guarantee you they're not checking estrogen level. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7178.02s)]
*  There's zero control. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7181.22s)]
*  All you have to do is say I'm a woman [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7182.780000000001s)]
*  and you can play. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7184.14s)]
*  I can say I'm a woman and I can play. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7184.96s)]
*  Put on a dress and I'll play. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7185.9800000000005s)]
*  Fuck you, I'm a woman. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7187.6s)]
*  And if you let it happen, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7188.660000000001s)]
*  you're gonna get crazy people that do this. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7189.9400000000005s)]
*  And this lady, she took a stand. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7191.9400000000005s)]
*  She's like, you're not a woman. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7193.740000000001s)]
*  I quit. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7194.820000000001s)]
*  You saw that- Check your hand. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7195.660000000001s)]
*  You saw that Canadian powerlifting coach [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7196.9800000000005s)]
*  that just entered a competition with like, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7198.780000000001s)]
*  just didn't do it. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7201.660000000001s)]
*  He was like, yeah. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7202.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm a woman now. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7203.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7204.14s)]
*  It's really bizarre that they're letting this happen. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7205.98s)]
*  It really is. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7209.179999999999s)]
*  It's so strange. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7210.339999999999s)]
*  It's like women's rights have gone out the window [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7211.379999999999s)]
*  in this sense over the name of virtue. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7214.419999999999s)]
*  The virtue that you're a good person [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7218.62s)]
*  and you say trans women are women. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7220.58s)]
*  Okay, in real life maybe, yeah, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7222.299999999999s)]
*  but not on sports. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7225.16s)]
*  You're a biological male. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7227.0199999999995s)]
*  It's the same thing as if you tell someone, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7228.419999999999s)]
*  hey, I don't do steroids now, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7231.0199999999995s)]

*  Well, that's exactly what you would say for a woman. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7245.36s)]
*  If you had a woman athlete [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7248.44s)]

*  guess what, fuck face? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7262.92s)]
*  You're taking testosterone. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7264.5s)]

*  you're having your whole life of producing testosterone, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7271.740000000001s)]
*  you have male tendon strength, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7274.200000000001s)]

*  to be protecting with Title IX. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7290.38s)]
*  That's the whole idea of developing regulations [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7292.3s)]
*  so that women have sports that they can play [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7295.9800000000005s)]
*  that are just with women. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7298.86s)]

*  play with fucking high school seniors. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7304.900000000001s)]
*  It's real simple. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7307.2s)]
*  You have someone play within the parameters [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7308.18s)]

*  that they're not lunatics. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7454.98s)]

*  that decided he was identified as a 15 year old girl. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7460.66s)]

*  You're leaving a very dangerous opening here. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7491.8s)]

*  and the women that are athletes that are suffering, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7495.88s)]
*  it's gonna ruin their chances at college. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7498.0s)]
*  You could change the direction of their life. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7499.84s)]
*  They might not get a scholarship they should get [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7501.360000000001s)]
*  because they had to compete against biological males. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7503.88s)]
*  The enhanced games. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7506.6s)]

*  The steroid Olympics. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7509.280000000001s)]
*  Peter Thiel just put a ton of money into that. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7510.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's gonna be interesting. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7512.12s)]
*  How long before the government cracks down on them? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7514.04s)]
*  Well, the problem is it seems like from what I read, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7516.04s)]
*  it seems like they supply the steroids. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7519.18s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7524.18s)]
*  That seems super illegal. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7525.3s)]
*  Are you a sporting body or are you my steroid dealer? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7527.14s)]
*  And then you have to think what kind of an influence [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7530.1s)]
*  does that have on young people? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7532.06s)]
*  One of the things about steroids being shunned and illegal, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7533.46s)]
*  even if it was irrational in some sense, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7536.740000000001s)]
*  like that if you have an adult male [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7540.14s)]
*  and this guy is 35 years old and he just decides, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7543.900000000001s)]
*  you know what, I wanna take steroids. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7547.5s)]
*  Why is that not okay? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7550.86s)]
*  But you can prescribe him a ton [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7553.66s)]
*  of different fucking things that can kill him. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7556.36s)]
*  You can prescribe him anti-anxiety medication. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7558.42s)]
*  You can prescribe him painkillers. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7561.38s)]
*  You can prescribe him ozempic [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7564.1s)]
*  because he wants to lose weight. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7566.06s)]
*  You can prescribe him all kinds of things [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7567.14s)]
*  that might have adverse health risks, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7568.86s)]
*  but you can't, nothing that makes you stronger. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7571.06s)]
*  Nothing, we have a limitation on that. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7574.3s)]
*  It's very odd. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7576.42s)]
*  And I can see how you would make it banned for sports, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7577.26s)]
*  but why is it banned for people? [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7580.3s)]
*  Like says who? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7581.9400000000005s)]
*  I just wanna get jacked. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7583.5s)]

*  Says one adult says another adult can't do this? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7587.1s)]
*  Do people vote on that? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7592.54s)]
*  Did medical experts vote on that? [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7593.68s)]
*  If they did, how'd they let fentanyl in? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7595.14s)]
*  I can't remember. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7597.42s)]
*  I feel like it wouldn't be surprising to me [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7598.26s)]
*  if the cascade was this ruins fairness in sports [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7600.84s)]

*  I feel like it was probably the trickle down that way [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7613.98s)]
*  from sports and elite sports and tested sports [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7617.42s)]

*  That stuff's supposed to be scary. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7637.02s)]
*  I've heard scary stories of people being on that stuff [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7638.62s)]
*  and losing their fucking mind. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7641.06s)]
*  Like literally becoming animals. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7642.58s)]
*  You get insomnia, you get this cough. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7643.42s)]
*  You put. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7644.66s)]
*  It's a trend cough. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7645.5s)]
*  Trend cough, yeah, you pin yourself [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7646.56s)]
*  and you get this trend cough supposedly. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7648.14s)]
*  Terrifying. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7649.94s)]
*  Going back to that basketball thing, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7651.18s)]
*  the most common name of basketball players in the NBA, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7653.22s)]
*  Christopher, I missed my calling. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7657.9800000000005s)]
*  Damn, that's the most? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7660.1s)]
*  Yes, so the reason for this, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7661.58s)]
*  and it's really interesting, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7663.5s)]
*  Seth used a ton of different AI programs [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7664.86s)]
*  to analyze all of this data. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7669.299999999999s)]
*  And he said he was able to do [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7670.74s)]
*  what would have taken him three years in 30 days. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7672.339999999999s)]
*  He wrote this book in 30 days. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7674.7s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7676.099999999999s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7676.94s)]
*  It's really, really good. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7677.759999999999s)]
*  Who Makes the NBA, I think it's called. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7678.599999999999s)]
*  And the reason that it's Christopher [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7679.86s)]
*  is that Christopher is the sort of name [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7683.639999999999s)]
*  that is given by middle-class parents to their child. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7685.82s)]
*  So it's really an indicator of social class. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7689.799999999999s)]
*  And there is this belief that in basketball, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7692.759999999999s)]
*  it's a meritocracy where the underclass, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7697.2s)]
*  hardworking athlete can clamber his way up. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7700.759999999999s)]
*  You know, this is LeBron. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7703.719999999999s)]
*  LeBron, single mother who was 16 years old, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7704.96s)]
*  makes it to the top. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7707.759999999999s)]
*  He's an outlier. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7709.12s)]
*  That's not that common. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7709.94s)]
*  The most common path is someone [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7711.0s)]
*  that comes from two-parent household [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7712.799999999999s)]
*  that's relatively well off [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7714.5199999999995s)]
*  and you know, like classic advantages that you get. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7715.759999999999s)]
*  Christopher is the sort of name that's given. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7718.7s)]
*  I think Michael is another one that's up there [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7721.16s)]
*  and he does this big word map thing [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7723.08s)]
*  where you can see the size of the names [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7724.639999999999s)]
*  and the bigger the name, the more likely it is. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7726.16s)]
*  One of the other things that no one really ever thinks about [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7728.36s)]
*  is hand span. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7730.44s)]
*  Hand span, one of the biggest determinants [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7732.32s)]
*  for success in the sport. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7734.24s)]
*  So Shaq has a 14-inch hand span from finger to hand [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7735.7s)]
*  because palming the ball, you know, if you're up there [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7742.16s)]
*  and you're able to palm the ball, that's a huge advantage. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7744.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's terrifying. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7748.5599999999995s)]
*  That's so big. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7749.96s)]
*  Just grab that ball. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7751.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, makes sense. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7752.72s)]
*  Makes sense, it'll give you an advantage. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7753.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7755.76s)]
*  It's fascinating when you break down data like that [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7757.68s)]
*  and you try to figure out what are the contributing factors. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7761.08s)]
*  I wonder if they've done that with martial arts. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7763.84s)]
*  What if someone's done that with fighters [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7766.3s)]
*  like height and reach and things like that? [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7767.64s)]
*  What would you be interested in? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7768.8s)]
*  Height and reach. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7770.14s)]
*  It's a big factor. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7771.76s)]
*  But it's also like, are you as durable? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7773.320000000001s)]
*  Like sometimes the stockier- [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7775.96s)]
*  Neck width, maybe something like that. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7777.24s)]
*  Yeah, neck width, the size of the chin. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7778.56s)]
*  I think it's jaw size. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7781.4800000000005s)]
*  Hand size would definitely be one. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7782.320000000001s)]
*  So I worked on the front door of nightclubs [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7783.88s)]
*  forever running our events. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7786.52s)]
*  And one of the really naughty things that door staff would do, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7788.56s)]
*  maybe they do this in America as well, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7791.68s)]
*  is they get like a lead cylinder [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7793.360000000001s)]
*  and in their leather gloves, they put it on the inside. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7796.92s)]
*  So the hand now weighs a pound and a half more than usual. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7800.52s)]
*  You hit someone and that's like a fucking hammer. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7805.200000000001s)]
*  So if that's the case, that rule is mass of hand equals damage. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7809.28s)]
*  So someone that has denser bones or more muscular hands [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7815.08s)]
*  or bigger hands, that's basically just more weight [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7818.24s)]
*  on the end of your arms that you're swinging at someone's face. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7821.2s)]
*  So yeah, I mean- [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7823.84s)]
*  Giant advantage. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7825.32s)]
*  I think that breaking down sports in this way, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7826.28s)]
*  that's why Moneyball was so cool. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7829.28s)]
*  People loved like, oh my God, this is so interesting. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7831.16s)]
*  I never really paid attention to that. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7834.36s)]
*  What is Moneyball? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7835.5199999999995s)]
*  So Moneyball was a assessment of the MLB [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7836.88s)]
*  done by a guy that was picked up by the Oakland A's. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7841.24s)]
*  And he was using very advanced mathematics to look at- [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7844.72s)]
*  You got something, Jeremy? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7851.4800000000005s)]
*  I was just going to say Billy Beans' name. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7852.320000000001s)]
*  I was trying to just- [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7853.16s)]
*  Yeah, Billy Beans. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7854.0s)]
*  And he looked at undervalued players [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7855.24s)]
*  and what contributes to winning a game. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7859.68s)]
*  And there were players that would bat in a weird way [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7863.52s)]
*  that would throw a pitch in a weird way. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7865.88s)]
*  But their numbers were fantastic. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7867.88s)]
*  And he was the first guy that really, really assessed [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7869.92s)]
*  the numbers of baseball in this matter. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7872.12s)]
*  Now it's very, very common. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7874.08s)]
*  Baseball is largely a game of maths. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7875.0s)]
*  They know exactly where hitters like to swing. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7877.56s)]
*  They move the field around based on all of the statistics [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7879.84s)]
*  that they've seen, all of the analyses that it's been done. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7882.76s)]
*  But yeah, the movie Moneyball with Brad Pitt is outstanding. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7885.4800000000005s)]
*  If you've never seen it, you absolutely should watch it. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7890.16s)]
*  It's so much fun. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7892.28s)]
*  But yeah, I think this assessment, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7893.6s)]
*  I don't think it removes the magic of sport. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7897.200000000001s)]
*  I don't think it gets rid of the magic of sport to- [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7899.76s)]
*  It just makes people nerd out harder. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7901.76s)]
*  Deconstruct, yeah, and it allows us to obsess. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7903.68s)]
*  It still doesn't make it easy to do. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7905.76s)]
*  So when someone does hit a fucking home run, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7907.4800000000005s)]
*  it's still amazing. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7909.6s)]
*  Yeah, but- [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7910.72s)]
*  This is a good scene from the movie. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7912.120000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to play the whole thing, [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7913.280000000001s)]
*  but just what's going on here is he's explaining to them [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7914.120000000001s)]
*  the idea of what he was just talking about, the Moneyball. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7916.56s)]
*  But there's a bunch of old scouts, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7918.200000000001s)]
*  these guys have been around forever. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7919.360000000001s)]
*  And they're just like, what are you talking about? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7921.84s)]
*  We can't do it that way. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7923.04s)]
*  So he just figures it out numerically. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7926.6s)]
*  And spoiler alert is it works. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7928.6s)]
*  They won the World Series like the next year [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7930.0s)]
*  or something like that. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7931.48s)]
*  And it's based on a true story? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7932.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7934.0s)]
*  And so you had yourself an autistic kid. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7934.84s)]
*  That's exactly what you meant. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7939.12s)]
*  That's basically what it was. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7940.36s)]

*  There's an advantage in that. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7946.48s)]
*  I just heard the guy, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7947.68s)]
*  the chiefs that just won the Super Bowl, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7949.0s)]
*  they have a guy like that that's worked with the coach [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7950.24s)]
*  the entire time. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7952.2s)]
*  They call him, shit, I forget what they call him. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7953.04s)]
*  He has a name, he's like the analytics guy. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7955.72s)]
*  They're like, no one knows what his job is. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7957.16s)]
*  Mr. Numbers or something. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7958.639999999999s)]
*  We just listen to him and we trust whatever he says. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7959.48s)]
*  Fuck, that's cool. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7960.92s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7962.04s)]
*  Dude, let's talk about this special counsel report thing. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7964.0s)]
*  Oh yes, we were gonna do that before we peed. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7968.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7970.4s)]
*  Yeah, special counsel report on Biden. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7971.24s)]
*  Yeah, so these Afghanistan documents, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7973.0s)]
*  these top secret Afghanistan documents [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7976.44s)]
*  that were supposedly held in his garage, as you'd say, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7978.32s)]
*  there's photos of how it was. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7982.68s)]
*  It was just an open box in the middle of the garage. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7984.0s)]
*  Wasn't it in his corvette or something? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7987.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7989.36s)]
*  The photos that I've seen are just an open box [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7990.2s)]
*  with files in, like you just have lying around here [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7992.4800000000005s)]
*  that need to be cleaned away. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7995.28s)]
*  I think he had one of those boxes [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7996.4800000000005s)]
*  in the back seat of his corvette. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=7998.08s)]
*  Well. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8000.04s)]
*  Or in the trunk of his corvette. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8002.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's his corvette. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8003.72s)]
*  That's a corvette that doesn't even have a back seat. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8005.4800000000005s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8007.4800000000005s)]
*  So he's got an, that's a fucking dope corvette. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8008.8s)]
*  That's like my year. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8011.12s)]
*  I love that year. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8013.04s)]
*  That's pretty nice. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8014.04s)]
*  So the classified docs were found in his garage [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8014.88s)]
*  where his corvette was. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8018.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8019.48s)]
*  So there's the box right there. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8020.32s)]
*  That's it? [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8021.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8022.68s)]
*  And what's in those things? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8023.5199999999995s)]
*  Classified Afghanistan documents. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8025.88s)]
*  I think it was from earlier. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8028.0s)]
*  Oh my God, you can read them. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8029.76s)]
*  Garage box after repackaging, January 3rd, 2023. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8032.36s)]
*  So did he forget he had them? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8036.76s)]
*  So that's the argument. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8038.64s)]
*  And the thing that most people are jumping on [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8040.2s)]
*  to do with this report isn't that. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8043.2s)]
*  It's the assessment that, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8045.84s)]
*  I think it was her that's the dude that did it. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8047.679999999999s)]
*  It was the assessment of his mental state. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8050.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8054.0s)]
*  Basically, yeah. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8054.84s)]
*  Mr. Her suggested that Mr. Biden's memory was failing [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8057.12s)]
*  and questioned some of his actions, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8059.679999999999s)]
*  even though the special counsel had found no basis [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8061.12s)]
*  to prosecute the president. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8063.16s)]
*  The issue that he says basically in the report is, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8064.679999999999s)]
*  if you're trying to prosecute this guy, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8068.8s)]
*  Mr. Biden would likely present himself to the jury [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8071.64s)]
*  as he did during our interview with him, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8074.4800000000005s)]
*  which is as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8076.4400000000005s)]
*  with a poor memory. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8080.84s)]
*  That's literally what it says in the report. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8081.92s)]
*  Well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8085.6s)]
*  So basically you can't prosecute this guy [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8087.84s)]
*  because he's not compas mentis, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8090.64s)]
*  but you can let him run [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8093.64s)]
*  for the president of the United States in November. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8094.76s)]
*  So that's the world that we've managed to get into. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8097.48s)]
*  But don't you think that that's a ruse? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8100.799999999999s)]
*  Which would be? [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8103.639999999999s)]
*  That him running for president? [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8104.48s)]
*  You don't think he's gonna run? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8105.4s)]
*  No. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8106.48s)]
*  No, I think they're gonna get rid of him. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8107.96s)]
*  I think they're gonna move him out. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8110.36s)]
*  They're gonna force him to step down. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8111.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8113.16s)]
*  If I had to guess, and it's just speculation, [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8115.04s)]
*  I'd say they're setting up Gavin Newsom for it. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8118.12s)]
*  That's what I say. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8121.32s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8122.44s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8123.28s)]
*  I think the more and more comes out [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8124.32s)]
*  about this stuff, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8128.0s)]
*  and more and more comes out about the Burisma thing [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8128.92s)]
*  and the Penn State thing, [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8131.8s)]
*  where the Chinese donated money to Penn State [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8134.12s)]
*  and then he got a million dollar a year gig [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8136.04s)]
*  where he didn't even have to show up. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8138.84s)]
*  That's old school. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8141.32s)]
*  That's like mafia stuff. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8142.639999999999s)]
*  Was it a million dollars a year? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8143.76s)]
*  How much was it that he got from Penn State? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8145.08s)]
*  And he was telling people, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8148.0s)]
*  he's a professor at Penn State. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8148.84s)]
*  Like he told them. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8150.599999999999s)]
*  They didn't even want that. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8151.44s)]
*  Oh, they were a rap professor. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8152.28s)]
*  He didn't teach one class. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8153.12s)]
*  Look, some of it is part of its fun. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8154.16s)]
*  If he wasn't the president, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8156.08s)]
*  it would be really fun. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8157.12s)]
*  Because he's like, oh, he's making stuff up. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8158.28s)]
*  Calls people the wrong name. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8160.36s)]
*  Talks about someone that's dead. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8161.68s)]
*  You know, it's constant. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8163.76s)]
*  It was Penn, not Penn State. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8165.4800000000005s)]
*  Penn State, excuse me, Penn. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8166.72s)]
*  Was paid one million dollars a year to teach, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8169.2s)]
*  but never taught a single class. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8171.64s)]
*  Yeah, University of Pennsylvania, that's what it is. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8173.4800000000005s)]
*  That is a, that's a mob job. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8175.8s)]
*  I had a friend of mine who had one of those jobs. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8179.56s)]
*  He didn't have to really go to the Javits Center. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8181.8s)]
*  Like an honorary thing. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8184.92s)]
*  He was a mob guy. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8186.52s)]
*  He got a gig. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8187.36s)]
*  Yeah, he got a gig. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8188.84s)]
*  And there was like, if you had made a union negotiation [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8189.76s)]
*  back in the day, like we're talking back in the day day, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8192.56s)]
*  they would throw in a bunch of no work jobs. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8195.44s)]
*  So no work jobs were part of the thing. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8198.8s)]
*  It's just a little sweetener on top. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8200.56s)]
*  Yeah, so if you're a mob guy [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8201.64s)]
*  and you're connected to some construction company, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8203.8s)]
*  they would find companies that they would buy into [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8206.76s)]
*  and own pieces of so that they could [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8209.48s)]
*  kind of funnel their money out. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8211.32s)]
*  They could say, I'm in the construction business, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8212.8s)]
*  or I'm in the sanitation business. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8214.960000000001s)]
*  They always had something that they were attached to, [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8215.880000000001s)]
*  but they had no show jobs. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8218.6s)]
*  You got real money, you know, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8221.08s)]

*  They every now and then they make up talk. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8300.68s)]

*  like this guy is really out of it. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8315.2s)]
*  Let's pretend it's not Biden. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8317.880000000001s)]
*  Some other guy that has to go and speak in front of people. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8319.04s)]
*  He's really old and like, okay. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8320.960000000001s)]
*  You know, he could die. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8324.76s)]

*  But what I would say is like, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8327.12s)]
*  let's start banging him up with testosterone. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8328.68s)]
*  Give him like a good dose. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8330.76s)]
*  Like ramp him up slowly. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8332.44s)]
*  We wanna get him up to like 30 year old levels. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8334.0s)]
*  And then some kind of amphetamine. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8336.68s)]
*  And then a big nootropic stack, like a heavy stack. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8338.72s)]
*  Theanine, you know, acetylcholine. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8342.52s)]
*  Alpha GPC, yeah. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8344.92s)]

*  Let's stack shit. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8346.84s)]
*  And I want like multiple modalities. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8348.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8356.880000000001s)]
*  We've got everything going in there. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8357.72s)]
*  And then we're just like gonna break things down [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8358.56s)]
*  on cue cards. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8359.76s)]
*  I mean, we can do this. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8361.44s)]
*  And that's what they've done. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8362.28s)]
*  They've definitely done the cue cards part. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8363.1s)]
*  Like there's photos of his cue cards. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8364.04s)]
*  Like stand there, say brief for Mark. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8366.24s)]
*  Like it's all capital letters. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8368.08s)]
*  You see those? [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8369.640000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8370.48s)]
*  He holds onto them and then they take pictures of it [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8371.32s)]
*  and they zoom in on the picture and they go, [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8372.68s)]
*  look what it says. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8374.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8374.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8377.04s)]
*  It's like you shouldn't have, like this is his card. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8377.880000000001s)]
*  The secret. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8380.28s)]
*  Presidential cue cards. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8382.08s)]
*  Oh, he has cue cards for staff too, if that makes sense. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8383.56s)]
*  But there was a cue card that he had [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8386.24s)]
*  that they were reading while he was on stage [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8387.720000000001s)]
*  where he was giving some sort of a presidential address. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8389.9s)]
*  It was like. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8392.82s)]
*  You enter the Roosevelt room and say hello to participants. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8393.66s)]
*  You take your seat. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8396.699999999999s)]
*  You give brief comments. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8398.38s)]
*  All caps with you. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8400.5s)]

*  That's amazing. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8403.34s)]
*  I feel so bad for him. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8404.26s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8405.1s)]
*  Well, he just can't keep a thought in his head [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8405.92s)]
*  when he starts talking about things. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8408.58s)]
*  He forgets what he's talking about all the time. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8409.9s)]
*  He goes, well, whatever. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8411.539999999999s)]
*  He just says, well, whatever. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8413.46s)]
*  It just drifts off. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8414.619999999999s)]
*  Someone, so he did this after the report came out. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8415.619999999999s)]
*  He did this emergency press conference, [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8418.46s)]
*  which wasn't, I don't think, a particularly good idea. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8420.98s)]
*  How did it go? [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8423.5s)]
*  I would say suboptimally. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8425.66s)]
*  Someone said. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8429.619999999999s)]
*  Did he fail to impress? [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8430.46s)]
*  Someone asked him, how good is your memory? [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8432.14s)]
*  And he said, my memory is so bad, I let you speak. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8435.9s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8440.939999999999s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8443.019999999999s)]

*  Sorry, what? [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8445.5s)]
*  My memory is so good, I let you speak. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8447.06s)]
*  What? [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8448.9s)]
*  There's no way that I can repurpose that quote [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8450.18s)]
*  for it to make sense. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8452.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, the new president of El Salvador [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8454.3s)]
*  just won with an 85% vote. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8457.2s)]
*  85%. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8462.26s)]
*  So El Salvador went from having the highest murder rate [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8463.68s)]
*  in the world to now the highest incarceration rate [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8468.14s)]
*  in the world. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8472.18s)]
*  This guy is locking up everyone. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8473.46s)]
*  They have a brand new 40,000 person prison [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8477.14s)]
*  that's the size of seven football stadiums. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8481.42s)]
*  Jamie, have a look at this football stadium thing. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8484.98s)]
*  It is wild what they've done. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8488.26s)]
*  He's cleaned up the streets. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8492.34s)]
*  He's gone super aggressive. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8493.82s)]
*  There's some dangers of what he's done, [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8495.82s)]
*  which is they're being very indiscriminate [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8497.8s)]

*  and thrown into the prison as well. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8509.1s)]
*  You know, if they break down the door [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8510.820000000002s)]
*  and come in this room and you're a bad guy [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8513.18s)]

*  Good evening, Mr. President. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8547.26s)]
*  It's a source of pride for President Nayib Bukele [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8548.82s)]
*  that almost two years ago declared a war on crime. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8551.74s)]

*  it opened its doors in 2023 [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8570.58s)]
*  after the government declared a state of emergency. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8572.94s)]
*  The move limiting civil rights. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8576.22s)]

*  Wow. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8582.22s)]
*  The director says the detainees have to sleep on hard surfaces [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8583.06s)]

*  that could be used to hide objects. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8593.5s)]
*  Their diet consists of simple meals that repeat every day. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8595.7s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8611.42s)]
*  This guy just put the hammer down. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8613.380000000001s)]
*  That was, you know, with Duncan Trussall [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8615.18s)]
*  when we were in LA when the George Ford riots hit. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8617.42s)]
*  One of the first things he says, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8620.62s)]
*  dude, we're gonna have a right wing [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8621.9s)]
*  authoritarian president now. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8623.74s)]
*  That's gonna be the next person. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8626.460000000001s)]
*  Like the next, like when this all collapses, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8628.18s)]
*  the only response to that is people go hard, right? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8630.86s)]
*  They go hard, right? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8634.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8636.34s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8637.5s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8640.22s)]
*  I think it's MS-13 is one of the big gangs. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8643.18s)]
*  I can't remember what the other one's called. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8646.740000000002s)]
*  These are like, if you wanted to, oh my God, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8647.980000000001s)]
*  stop this at its tracks, [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8650.78s)]
*  you kind of, you're not gonna cure those guys. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8654.060000000001s)]
*  There's like two bathrooms in each stall or each cell also. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8656.460000000001s)]
*  And how many people in each cell? [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8659.300000000001s)]
*  A hundred people, two bath, two, two stalls. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8660.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8662.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8664.62s)]
*  If you gotta go, you gotta go. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8665.460000000001s)]
*  But I guess, if you wanna really clean it up, [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8667.900000000001s)]
*  it's not gonna be pretty. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8671.380000000001s)]
*  If you wanna really clean up [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8673.300000000001s)]
*  a very dangerous gang-infested place, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8674.58s)]
*  it's not gonna be pretty. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8676.74s)]
*  You saw Batman. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8677.66s)]
*  That's what he did, right? [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8678.7s)]
*  Recodes like a hundred, five hundred people. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8679.86s)]
*  The insight around during a time of upheaval [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8686.38s)]
*  and uncertainty, looking for a more dominant leader [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8691.06s)]
*  and a more authoritarian leader, [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8694.14s)]
*  that has roots in evolution as well. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8695.74s)]
*  So this is something that Will Storr talks about, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8697.86s)]
*  which is there's multiple routes to status. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8699.74s)]
*  There's fewer routes to leadership. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8702.78s)]
*  So there tends to be two, one being dominance [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8704.98s)]
*  and the other being prestige. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8707.82s)]
*  So dominance is the more authoritarian. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8709.38s)]
*  You will do this because there are negative outcomes. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8711.86s)]
*  If you don't do this and it's more overbearing, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8713.94s)]
*  prestige is earning reputation through being positive some. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8716.22s)]
*  During times of war and strife, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8721.74s)]
*  tribes would look for a more dominant leader [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8725.42s)]
*  because you have threat from the outside. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8728.78s)]
*  So you're going to have someone [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8732.02s)]
*  that's going to be aggressive. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8733.060000000001s)]
*  They're going to lean in. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8733.98s)]
*  They're gonna try and fix this problem. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8734.82s)]
*  Of course, that's going to be who you choose. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8736.34s)]
*  Problem is, if you have someone who is a dominant leader [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8738.460000000001s)]
*  for times of war, when it becomes a time of peace, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8741.58s)]
*  that dominant leader isn't just going to step aside. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8744.380000000001s)]
*  They're dominant. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8746.380000000001s)]
*  They're gonna hold onto this power. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8747.34s)]
*  They've usually managed to embed themselves. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8748.86s)]
*  They've got sycophants. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8750.62s)]
*  They've got a distribution network of people [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8751.54s)]
*  that can help to enforce their rule. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8754.54s)]
*  That's the problem that you have. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8757.220000000001s)]
*  But this has absolutely has its roots evolutionarily. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8759.02s)]
*  What a bizarre way to run anything, [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8762.74s)]
*  to have the guy who runs it be very vulnerable [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8766.66s)]
*  and only have a four-year term. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8770.980000000001s)]
*  And then you can only do two of those four-year terms [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8773.820000000002s)]
*  and then people are constantly trying to figure out a way [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8776.58s)]
*  to manipulate the reality of the world [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8779.300000000001s)]
*  to get their guy past you, including high-level gaslighting. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8781.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, we've seen some wild gaslighting. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8786.140000000001s)]
*  Serious fuckery. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8788.18s)]
*  Past couple of weeks talking about the economy, [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8789.42s)]
*  there's so much gaslighting. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8792.5s)]
*  Well, one of them was Gavin Newsom [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8795.58s)]
*  talking about how great Biden was [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8797.5s)]
*  and what the Democrats record [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8799.14s)]
*  that this has been one of the greatest presidents [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8801.38s)]
*  he's ever full stop. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8803.22s)]
*  It's like hot gas in your face. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8804.46s)]
*  It's burning your lungs. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8808.14s)]
*  It's just gaslighting. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8809.46s)]
*  It's gaslighting. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8812.179999999998s)]
*  You can't have a great economy [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8814.22s)]
*  if you're spending hundreds of billions of dollars [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8816.099999999999s)]
*  financing wars overseas. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8818.26s)]
*  It's not even possible. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8819.62s)]
*  You're gonna have inflation. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8820.98s)]
*  How'd you get all that money? [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8822.18s)]

*  that you passed in the middle of the night? [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8826.74s)]
*  Like, where's all that going? [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8828.02s)]
*  Who's paying it back? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8829.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of money. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8831.22s)]
*  I often think about the guys [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=8833.22s)]

*  based on one misspoken thing about some new social campaign [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9122.94s)]
*  or whatever it might be, [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9128.9s)]
*  didn't seem to extend the same kind of leeway to Bud Light. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9130.300000000001s)]
*  Now, I don't know. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9134.220000000001s)]
*  I don't know, weird, right? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9135.18s)]
*  I don't know how deep that ran. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9136.220000000001s)]
*  There's someone that says it was a marketing intern. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9138.1s)]
*  There was another that says it went right to the top. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9140.74s)]
*  And this shows that Bud Light were the lib cucks [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9142.66s)]
*  that we've always known that they were. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9146.86s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9149.06s)]
*  But if it wasn't infused into the company, [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9150.14s)]
*  what you're doing is taking a very isolated incident [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9153.300000000001s)]
*  and using that as the canary in the coal mine to say, [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9155.62s)]
*  see, they're part of the deep state. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9159.86s)]
*  They're taking over, they're doing the whatever. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9162.380000000001s)]
*  Well, sort of, it was not one thing. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9165.380000000001s)]
*  It was two things that combined together. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9167.380000000001s)]
*  So the one thing was the Dylan Mulvaney picture [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9170.060000000001s)]
*  on the beer can that drove people nuts. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9174.1s)]
*  But then there was the video of the woman [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9176.02s)]
*  who was in charge, who was explaining [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9178.300000000001s)]
*  that they had to rework the image of the brand [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9181.1s)]
*  and that it was a fratty, sort of like bro heavy, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9184.300000000001s)]
*  I forget the words she used, but it was a juvenile. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9189.5s)]
*  She was trying to literally, [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9192.86s)]
*  you're talking about your entire customer base. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9195.699999999999s)]
*  So she's deciding that the customer base [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9198.98s)]
*  should not be trans or the customer base should, [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9200.5s)]
*  I mean, literally. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9202.94s)]
*  I mean, she's literally deciding [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9203.86s)]
*  she's going to make the customer base gay. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9205.1s)]
*  It's gonna be friendly to the LBGT community. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9206.98s)]
*  It's gonna be sponsoring floats on Pride Parade. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9209.06s)]
*  And that's what they did. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9212.22s)]
*  Under her guidance, she was like, I'm gonna fix this. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9213.94s)]
*  We're gonna make it just like I believe the world is, [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9217.22s)]
*  coming from universities that are hyper liberal [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9219.98s)]
*  into a community where you're in a corporation [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9223.26s)]
*  that's also subject to all those DEI restrictions. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9226.460000000001s)]
*  And you think this is like the way of the world today. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9230.78s)]
*  And then you do that one thing [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9232.94s)]
*  and then they catch you on video saying all those things [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9234.82s)]
*  about the customers and then the coup de grace, [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9237.94s)]
*  Kid Rock shoots your beer. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9240.98s)]
*  When Kid Rock shoots your beer, that's a wrap. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9242.5s)]
*  Fucking game over until you get Shane Gillis. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9246.62s)]
*  Yeah, Shane Gillis, and then you sponsor the UFC. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9249.66s)]
*  It'll turn back around now. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9252.939999999999s)]
*  It can turn back around. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9254.859999999999s)]
*  Shane Gillis on stage with Zach Bryan? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9256.259999999998s)]
*  Oh shit, that's amazing. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9258.619999999999s)]
*  When was this? [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9260.46s)]
*  At the Super Bowl, they had a big party in Vegas. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9261.3s)]
*  Did he sing? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9263.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's the revival. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9263.939999999999s)]
*  Is he singing All Night Revival? [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9265.46s)]
*  Oh, that's incredible. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9267.339999999998s)]
*  ["All Night Revival"] [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9268.46s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9274.46s)]
*  Put Johnny on the vinyl. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9278.699999999999s)]
*  The whole crowd sings along to that. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9282.98s)]
*  I went to see Zach when he was out here and they did that. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9283.82s)]
*  He tried to get me to sing. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9286.3s)]
*  I'm like, fuck you. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9287.14s)]
*  I'm not going out there. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9289.179999999998s)]
*  I don't want any attention. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9290.019999999999s)]
*  I just want to enjoy. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9291.82s)]
*  Punch someone in the face. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9292.66s)]
*  Yeah, I want to enjoy the show. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9293.5s)]
*  But it was a fucking amazing show, man. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9294.859999999999s)]
*  He's so talented. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9296.66s)]
*  Where was that at? [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9298.46s)]
*  That was out here. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9299.5s)]
*  It was like the Two-Step Festival. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9300.42s)]
*  Where was that, Georgetown? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9303.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9304.34s)]
*  Yeah, not far from here. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9305.179999999998s)]
*  I learned from Schultz this interesting thing [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9307.3s)]
*  that I called Schultz's razor, [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9310.34s)]
*  which is it's not coordination, it's cowardice. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9312.58s)]
*  From the outside, things look like a coordinated attack. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9315.74s)]
*  From the inside, it looks like people [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9319.7s)]
*  not trying to lose their jobs. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9321.34s)]
*  So I think a lot of the presumption is that [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9323.380000000001s)]
*  there is some grand plan, some grand, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9326.14s)]
*  maybe it's a conspiracy or maybe it's just coordination. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9329.66s)]
*  What it is from the inside is this guy [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9333.78s)]
*  has just bought a new house that his wife wanted [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9335.98s)]
*  and his kids go to private school [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9338.14s)]
*  and he needs to keep this job, man. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9339.54s)]
*  And the thing that is currently being pushed at the moment [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9341.58s)]
*  is, okay, we need to go along with this new campaign. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9344.46s)]
*  Sure, let's just do this thing. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9347.94s)]
*  That to me is a much more, I hope that it's true. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9349.82s)]
*  The reason I hope it's true is it's a much more [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9353.78s)]
*  reassuring way for the world to be, [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9355.34s)]
*  a lot of these incidents. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9358.22s)]
*  Because what it shows is that people [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9359.62s)]
*  are just responding to incentives. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9360.74s)]
*  And if you can change the incentives, [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9362.7s)]
*  if you can change the social structure of this stuff, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9364.22s)]
*  you can quite easily change behavior. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9366.66s)]
*  If it's coordination as opposed to cowardice, [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9368.58s)]
*  that's much more difficult. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9371.42s)]
*  If everyone's actually bought into this [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9372.34s)]
*  and they're part of some deep state conspiracy [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9374.14s)]
*  and it's all Psyopie and all of this stuff, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9375.9s)]
*  that you go, oh, this is completely out of my control. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9378.42s)]
*  And that's much more scary. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9383.42s)]
*  But I think on balance, based on the stuff that I see, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9385.1s)]
*  I think that Andrew's right. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9389.22s)]
*  I think that it is more likely to be cowardice [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9390.46s)]
*  than coordination. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9392.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's definitely both elements. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9394.539999999999s)]
*  I think specifically with some issues, [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9397.220000000001s)]
*  there's coordination online. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9399.98s)]
*  And one of the ways they do that is through bots. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9403.220000000001s)]
*  They do that through social media campaigns [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9405.62s)]
*  that are like fake accounts or hired accounts. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9408.02s)]
*  There's that too. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9411.220000000001s)]
*  That does shift the narrative in a certain direction. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9412.220000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot of people that are terrified [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9415.380000000001s)]
*  that they're gonna get fired. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9417.380000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that are terrified [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9418.58s)]
*  they're gonna get labeled or ostracized [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9420.06s)]
*  or kicked out of the social community so much so [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9422.06s)]
*  they're willing to go along with really ridiculous stuff [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9424.58s)]
*  because they think that's where the tide of progress is now. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9427.779999999999s)]
*  This is where the world is. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9429.74s)]
*  And you're seeing both things happen. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9431.66s)]
*  You're seeing cowardice and you're also seeing- [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9434.98s)]
*  Coordination. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9436.74s)]
*  It's kind of naive to think that if you were a world power [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9437.58s)]
*  that is doing everything you can [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9442.18s)]
*  to sort of balance things in your favor, [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9444.74s)]
*  including launching spy satellites, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9446.859999999999s)]
*  establishing a space force, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9450.539999999999s)]
*  ramping up your nuclear capabilities, [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9452.66s)]

*  in my brain for some time. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9561.14s)]
*  And Bill McBidden finally articulated here [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9562.54s)]
*  better than I ever could. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9565.220000000001s)]
*  It's worth a read from start to finish. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9567.34s)]
*  Opinion, age matters, [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9569.62s)]
*  which is why Biden's age is his superpower. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9571.34s)]
*  Come on. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9574.34s)]
*  That actually sounds like a family guy sketch. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9575.18s)]
*  100%. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9576.98s)]
*  Well, definitely a South Park sketch. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9577.86s)]
*  It's crazy to say, but if you're that guy [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9580.14s)]
*  and you're signaling to the tribe [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9583.46s)]
*  and you wanted everybody, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9585.5s)]
*  a rational person who is a left progressive person [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9587.26s)]
*  would say, we have to figure this out. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9592.78s)]
*  This is bad. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9595.539999999999s)]
*  This is bad. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9597.18s)]
*  You can't just pretend it's good. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9598.14s)]
*  The whole other side sees how bad it is. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9599.859999999999s)]
*  The world sees how bad it is. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9602.099999999999s)]
*  People in quiet say how bad it is. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9603.14s)]
*  Most people in hush and they're alone having dinner. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9605.019999999999s)]

*  Trump's gonna win with this guy. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9608.98s)]
*  I don't think no matter who wins in November, [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9611.06s)]
*  I don't think that either side is going to accept the outcome. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9613.859999999999s)]
*  No way, not anymore. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9616.46s)]
*  I think we saw one, two elections ago, [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9617.859999999999s)]
*  the final accepted. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9623.22s)]
*  And even that wasn't, right? [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9625.099999999999s)]
*  That was no, there's Russia collusion [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9626.300000000001s)]
*  and all the rest of it. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9627.460000000001s)]
*  And then how much are we gonna see of organized violence? [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9628.300000000001s)]
*  How much are we gonna see of organized protesters? [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9631.34s)]
*  Organized protesters are a real thing. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9634.18s)]
*  Funded protesters are a real thing. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9635.86s)]
*  Did that stuff turn out to be real [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9638.42s)]
*  about the piles of bricks? [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9639.86s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9641.14s)]
*  The piles of bricks? [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9641.98s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9642.800000000001s)]
*  During the George Floyd riots. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9643.86s)]
*  Yeah, during the George Floyd riots, [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9645.78s)]
*  and some of them they attributed to different things. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9647.86s)]
*  Some of them they said, [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9650.1s)]
*  it was just a construction site that was nearby. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9650.94s)]
*  It was just coincidence. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9652.74s)]
*  And some of that I'm sure is true. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9653.62s)]
*  But the people that I talked to that said that, [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9655.34s)]
*  no, stacks of bricks would just show up on their block. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9657.42s)]
*  Like what? [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9660.5s)]
*  The net result of all of this, [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9662.42s)]
*  I think is people just feeling very uncertain [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9664.48s)]
*  about the future. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9667.82s)]
*  I don't think that anyone's really convinced [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9668.74s)]
*  of any one narrative at the moment, [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9670.619999999999s)]
*  but everybody is just uncertain and anxious. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9672.259999999998s)]
*  There's some really interesting surveys showing [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9675.92s)]
*  that the number of Americans that say, [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9677.779999999999s)]
*  I do not fully feel in control of my life [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9679.82s)]
*  just continues to go up. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9683.82s)]
*  There's very much a externalized sense of agency. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9686.14s)]
*  I don't happen to the world, the world happens to me. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9689.46s)]
*  I'm skeptical about a lot of these things. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9693.26s)]
*  It's basically a soup for ambient anxiety. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9694.939999999999s)]
*  You're just causing people to be uncertain about stuff. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9698.38s)]
*  If you were trying to make people just feel more [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9705.099999999999s)]
*  and more and more shitty, [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9708.779999999999s)]
*  all that they're doing is spending time inside [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9710.099999999999s)]
*  on their phones, they're watching porn, [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9711.96s)]
*  they don't have as many friends. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9713.38s)]
*  The number of men in 1990 that had one or more close friends [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9714.66s)]
*  was, sorry, that had zero close friends was 3%. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9720.539999999999s)]
*  In 2020, it was 15%. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9723.7s)]
*  So it five X'd from 1990 to 2020. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9725.74s)]
*  So people are more isolated than ever before. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9729.119999999999s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me that people feel despondent [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9732.34s)]
*  or nihilistic or fatalistic or uncertain or, it's not good. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9735.5s)]
*  And then they're being manipulated, correct, on top of that. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9739.26s)]
*  So you're already vulnerable, you're already scared. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9742.26s)]
*  When you have more of an isolation from community, [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9745.18s)]
*  you're more likely to get sucked into subgroups. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9748.14s)]
*  You're more likely to get sucked into echo chambers [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9750.94s)]
*  because finally you have some people [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9753.38s)]
*  that are connecting with you. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9754.7s)]
*  You don't have any connection. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9755.54s)]
*  It's part of this little social dance you're doing. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9756.66s)]
*  You remember that we were talking about [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9759.38s)]
*  how you work out whether someone is telling the truth or not. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9762.58s)]
*  This interesting set of questions [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9765.82s)]
*  that I think people can ask themselves, [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9767.94s)]
*  which is, when was the last time [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9769.7s)]
*  that this person I am friends with [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9771.9s)]
*  or whose content I consume on the internet, [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9774.14s)]
*  when was the last time that their opinion surprised me? [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9776.48s)]
*  When was the last time that they gave a take [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9779.699999999999s)]
*  and I was like, huh, I might not agree with it, [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9781.82s)]
*  but that's not what I would have predicted [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9784.6s)]
*  had I have known them. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9786.82s)]
*  Something occurs and their response is different. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9788.1s)]
*  When was the last time that they publicly admitted [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9790.619999999999s)]
*  that they were wrong about something? [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9793.26s)]
*  Also really good, difficult to fake signal of authenticity. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9795.66s)]
*  When was the last time that they brought someone on [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9802.66s)]
*  or had a conversation with something [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9806.74s)]
*  that they don't agree with [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9808.619999999999s)]
*  or someone that they don't agree with [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9809.64s)]
*  for a reason other than just mocking them, [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9811.38s)]
*  but to genuinely understand what it is that they're doing? [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9813.699999999999s)]
*  And then the fourth question is, [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9816.9s)]
*  do they bind their group together [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9819.539999999999s)]
*  over the mutual hatred of an out group [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9821.9s)]
*  or the mutual love of an in group? [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9823.779999999999s)]
*  Is it because of othering or is it because of using? [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9825.38s)]
*  And I think othering is always, that's the scapegoating. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9827.9s)]
*  It's not about them, they're coming for us. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9830.7s)]
*  It's this sort of anxiety fueled thing. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9832.220000000001s)]
*  But if you know one of someone's opinions and from it, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9835.02s)]
*  you can accurately predict everything else that they believe. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9837.04s)]
*  They're not a serious thinker. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9839.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9840.900000000001s)]
*  That is a hallmark of bad independent political journalism. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9841.900000000001s)]
*  It's like ripe with othering. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9849.42s)]
*  It's ripe with casting the blame on the other side. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9853.02s)]
*  It's ripe with not looking internally. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9856.44s)]
*  There's very little introspection thought, [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9859.019999999999s)]
*  maybe I'm wrong. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9861.619999999999s)]
*  It's always coming from a position of confidence [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9862.859999999999s)]
*  that these other people are pieces of shit. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9865.38s)]
*  And we're gonna lay out some out of context examples [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9867.5s)]
*  with no context into why they think they think this [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9871.019999999999s)]
*  and what could steel man that [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9874.259999999998s)]
*  and how can we look at it from their perspective [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9875.98s)]
*  and what's wrong about it? [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9878.42s)]
*  No, everything is always highlighting what's wrong, [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9879.5s)]
*  highlighting the cruelty, gaslighting. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9882.9s)]
*  And they're doing it because they're a part [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9885.98s)]
*  of an ideology, they're a part of a political group, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9888.98s)]
*  they're a part of this little gang [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9890.380000000001s)]
*  and they want the love of the gang. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9891.62s)]
*  There's people that fancy themselves as like hitmen [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9894.66s)]
*  for the gang. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9896.7s)]
*  They're gonna go out there and there's a lot of that [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9898.02s)]
*  during the Black Lives Matters riots in, [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9899.5s)]
*  was it Portland or wherever it was? [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9906.18s)]
*  Or was it literally like crazy violent people [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9908.14s)]
*  that are just wild Antifa dudes that got lumped [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9911.82s)]
*  into these serious conversations about what's ethical [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9915.6s)]
*  and what's not ethical in terms of like, [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9919.04s)]
*  what should be done about police brutality [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9921.04s)]
*  and just psychos got involved in it with guns. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9923.08s)]
*  There's this one guy who ended up getting killed, [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9926.56s)]
*  he killed some guy, but he just killed someone [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9928.56s)]
*  who was on the other side, [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9930.800000000001s)]
*  just decided I'm gonna go kill somebody. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9931.84s)]
*  And you can have that. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9933.76s)]
*  And if you just have that thing that happened in Seattle [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9935.76s)]
*  where they had that whole section of the city [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9939.2s)]
*  that was closed down. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9941.84s)]
*  Oh, Chaz Chop? [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9943.12s)]
*  Police just gave it up, just gave it up. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9945.24s)]
*  You guys have this. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9947.32s)]
*  They took over the police station, took over buildings [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9948.44s)]
*  and they ran it for quite a while [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9951.24s)]
*  with all sorts of chaos going on. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9954.0s)]
*  I think they starved. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9955.6s)]
*  After a while they ran out of like sanitation [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9956.44s)]
*  and water and food and they tried to grow a vegetable patch. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9958.24s)]
*  And then they had the mayor on television saying [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9961.68s)]
*  that maybe it was a summer of love. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9963.88s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9966.08s)]
*  But all of these things just highlight [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9968.24s)]
*  how uncertain people genuinely feel today [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9970.68s)]
*  because we know those things took place [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9975.08s)]
*  just in really recent time. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9976.72s)]
*  And that was just the tip of the iceberg. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9977.92s)]
*  It was just a minor thing in terms of, [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9979.12s)]
*  I mean, it was a major thing in terms of the world, [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9982.8s)]
*  the impact of coronavirus, [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9984.56s)]
*  but it wasn't like airborne Ebola. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9986.4s)]
*  It wasn't like something's gonna kill everybody. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9990.52s)]
*  Like what would break down that? [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9992.32s)]
*  We broke down for a disease that killed [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9994.56s)]
*  a very small fraction of people. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9997.16s)]
*  And those people, almost all of them had [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=9999.36s)]
*  four plus comorbidities, almost all of them. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10001.6s)]
*  It was like in the high 90%. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10003.76s)]
*  Wasn't it? [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10006.36s)]
*  It was like 94% or something like that [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10007.2s)]
*  of people that died from COVID had four plus comorbidities. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10008.72s)]
*  Jesus, I didn't know that. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10012.6s)]
*  It's something nutty like that. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10014.04s)]
*  And it was mostly people that are obese, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10015.32s)]
*  diabetic, unhealthy. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10016.72s)]
*  So it was a big predisposition. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10020.52s)]
*  Yeah, and imagine everything went that fucking haywire [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10021.92s)]
*  for something like that. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10025.16s)]
*  It was wild, dude. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10026.0s)]
*  I mean, to have lived through that, [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10026.84s)]
*  it feels like a fever dream. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10029.2s)]
*  Fever dream. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10030.92s)]
*  And I think about that, that really happened. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10031.76s)]
*  It's gonna be weird. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10034.960000000001s)]
*  We're gonna be talking to our grandkids [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10037.04s)]
*  and they're gonna be like, granddad. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10039.12s)]
*  CDC studies have over 75% of COVID-19 deaths [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10041.72s)]
*  in vaccinated people were amongst those [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10045.32s)]
*  with at least four comorbidities. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10048.08s)]
*  That's vaccinated people. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10050.16s)]
*  And this is from 2022. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10051.68s)]
*  What I had read was people that got COVID before the vaccine. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10053.76s)]
*  And they were talking about, they were trying to figure out [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10059.0s)]
*  who's dying and why. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10060.76s)]
*  And one of them, a big one was ventilated people. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10061.92s)]
*  Apparently that was a big mistake that they made. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10064.28s)]
*  That was something that they learned when they went to, [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10066.64s)]
*  I think Elon Musk talked about this when he went to China. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10069.92s)]
*  Like, what was the biggest mistake [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10072.2s)]
*  that they made during the pandemic? [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10073.28s)]
*  They put people on ventilators. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10074.52s)]
*  Apparently that fucks you up. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10076.44s)]
*  And some high number of people, [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10077.880000000001s)]
*  like 80% or something like that, [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10079.960000000001s)]
*  people who got put on ventilators died. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10081.6s)]
*  As opposed to most of the people that get it. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10084.0s)]
*  It's not that high. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10085.6s)]
*  Especially amongst healthy people. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10088.48s)]
*  Definitely not amongst children. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10089.88s)]
*  It's very low amongst children. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10092.08s)]
*  So when they did that, it was just like, what are you doing? [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10093.76s)]
*  You're just putting people on ventilators? [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10096.64s)]
*  And they didn't know. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10098.68s)]
*  They thought they had to do it. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10099.88s)]
*  And then the vaccine comes along. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10101.519999999999s)]
*  And when you find out that 75% of the people [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10105.32s)]
*  who died from COVID have four comorbidities, [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10107.16s)]
*  well, that's the problem. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10110.24s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10112.039999999999s)]
*  Comorbidities mean you're dying. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10112.88s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10115.72s)]
*  But think about how much society collapsed for that thing. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10117.04s)]
*  Not good. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10120.880000000001s)]
*  Obviously COVID is not good. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10121.720000000001s)]
*  Obviously a tragedy. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10122.800000000001s)]
*  Definitely sympathetic to anybody who lost someone. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10124.160000000002s)]
*  But also that was, [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10126.800000000001s)]
*  in terms of what could happen to the world, [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10129.76s)]
*  a fairly small event [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10132.480000000001s)]
*  in terms of what could happen, like a war, [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10136.320000000002s)]
*  like a nuclear war with Russia. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10139.04s)]
*  Or like an asteroid. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10140.84s)]
*  Even the severity of a different pathogen. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10141.68s)]
*  Yes, severity of a different pathogen. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10143.800000000001s)]
*  Solar flares take out the power grid. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10146.240000000002s)]
*  So this feeling of anxiety, like, [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10149.0s)]
*  oh my God, this is not that stable. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10150.640000000001s)]
*  That's a valid feeling. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10152.0s)]
*  It's a valid feeling. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10153.240000000002s)]
*  Because it went so haywire just for this one thing [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10154.320000000002s)]
*  that most people wind up getting. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10157.28s)]
*  I think it pulled the veil off of a lot of people's eyes [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10158.560000000001s)]
*  that we are in control. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10162.76s)]
*  That we have mastered mother nature. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10164.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10166.28s)]
*  Yes. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10167.12s)]
*  It's been so long since there's been a full scale [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10167.960000000001s)]
*  kinetic war between two countries [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10170.400000000001s)]

*  And I think there's this sense, we've kind of outgrown that. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10178.52s)]
*  We're beyond that. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10181.6s)]
*  The 1940s, that was the last dying gasp [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10182.52s)]
*  of this sort of brutal, tribal, primitive version [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10185.84s)]
*  of humanity. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10190.0s)]
*  We're beyond that. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10190.84s)]
*  We've ascended. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10191.68s)]
*  Look, we can control the weather in Dubai. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10192.52s)]
*  They seed the clouds. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10194.36s)]
*  We can communicate to each other instantly [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10195.960000000001s)]
*  across the internet. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10197.72s)]
*  We can have video calls. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10198.68s)]
*  We've conquered many of the diseases [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10199.880000000001s)]
*  that were going to stop us previously. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10202.28s)]
*  Look at how sophisticated we are. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10204.519999999999s)]
*  We have also overcome our nature. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10205.92s)]
*  No. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10208.48s)]
*  No, we haven't. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10209.56s)]
*  And look what happens. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10210.4s)]
*  Our grandkids will speak to us and go, [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10211.96s)]
*  like granddad, what was it like during 2020? [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10213.96s)]
*  Tell us, tell us, what was it like? [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10216.84s)]
*  And you have to say, fucking mental. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10218.359999999999s)]
*  Absolutely fucking mental. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10222.279999999999s)]
*  Fucking mental. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10223.72s)]
*  And I lived through it. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10224.56s)]
*  We all lived through it. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10225.96s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10228.039999999999s)]
*  And this is the thing with this ambient anxiety [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10229.199999999999s)]
*  that people have. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10233.04s)]
*  I think it causes them not only to be uncertain [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10236.44s)]
*  outwardly toward the world, [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10239.720000000001s)]
*  but it's uncertain inward as well. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10240.84s)]
*  So my friend did a mushroom trip [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10244.320000000002s)]
*  and this question came to him, which I fucking love. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10245.84s)]
*  He said, does the world love you for who you are [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10248.92s)]
*  or for what you do? [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10252.240000000002s)]
*  Does the world love you for who you are [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10257.04s)]
*  or for what you do? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10260.640000000001s)]
*  Isn't it a more profound question [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10262.44s)]
*  that you're assuming the world loves you? [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10264.08s)]
*  Like why are you assuming the world loves you? [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10267.08s)]
*  Well, does the world hate you [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10268.4s)]
*  for who you are or for what you do? [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10270.0s)]
*  But it's an interesting question. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10271.16s)]
*  Like it phrased it in a weird way. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10272.32s)]
*  It's almost like a trick question. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10274.76s)]
*  It's almost like if I ask you, [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10276.56s)]
*  is your mother know you're gay? [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10277.8s)]
*  That's, dude, let me teach you about this. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10280.0s)]
*  So that's called a Milgram question. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10281.48s)]
*  There's a name for this. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10283.76s)]
*  I learned about it. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10284.68s)]
*  It's called a Milgram question [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10285.52s)]
*  after the Milgram experiments where they shocked people. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10286.44s)]
*  So a Milgram question is where any truthful response [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10289.56s)]
*  is so socially cancerous [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10293.519999999999s)]
*  that it's impossible to give a real response. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10296.4s)]
*  It forces you to comply. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10298.6s)]
*  The ultimate Milgram question would be, [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10300.32s)]
*  when did you stop beating your wife? [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10302.24s)]
*  You're like, [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10306.08s)]
*  another one would be what makes a woman attractive? [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10309.48s)]
*  Because the socially acceptable answer to that [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10313.32s)]
*  is one that is untruthful. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10317.32s)]
*  And the problem with this is- [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10319.0s)]
*  What is the socially acceptable answer to that? [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10319.88s)]
*  It would be to do with, it's about grace and poise. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10321.64s)]
*  Anything that isn't big titties. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10325.04s)]
*  If you say big titties, you failed. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10329.56s)]
*  You can't say big titties. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10333.36s)]
*  You can't say a nice ass. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10334.64s)]
*  Well, you can't if you're single. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10335.48s)]
*  You can't if you are worried about acquiring a mate. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10336.68s)]
*  You can't if you are of a social dynamic [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10340.16s)]
*  that needs to have your job [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10342.72s)]
*  and you have a human resources center that's very stringent. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10344.76s)]
*  They're very strict about what they allow their people to, [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10348.28s)]
*  it might affect your possibility of getting a promotion. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10351.72s)]
*  It might affect your standing amongst the women [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10355.16s)]
*  in the office. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10357.28s)]
*  They don't like when you tell the truth, Chris. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10359.039999999999s)]
*  You work with women. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10361.56s)]
*  You can't say, I think women with big asses [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10362.4s)]
*  and big tits are hot as fuck. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10364.039999999999s)]
*  You can't say that. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10365.8s)]
*  You can't say that. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10366.64s)]
*  Even though they know that it's true. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10367.48s)]
*  You can't be a good person. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10369.119999999999s)]
*  You can't be a good person and even admit that. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10370.32s)]
*  That's what I'm attracted to. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10372.119999999999s)]
*  Which is odd. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10374.68s)]
*  When punishment for what people say becomes widespread, [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10376.12s)]
*  people will stop saying what they think [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10382.04s)]
*  and instead say whatever is needed to thrive. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10385.28s)]
*  And this is why limits on speech [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10388.44s)]
*  become limits on sincerity. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10391.52s)]
*  Because I'm not going to change your opinion. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10393.240000000002s)]
*  You really think that by telling me [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10395.720000000001s)]
*  that I can't say a thing, [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10397.720000000001s)]
*  that I'm not going to think the thing, [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10399.28s)]
*  I'm just not gonna say the thing [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10401.68s)]
*  and think the thing in private. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10402.960000000001s)]
*  So limits on speech become limits on sincerity. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10405.16s)]
*  And this is the issue with the Milgram question. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10408.64s)]
*  It's the issue with this circular purity spiral [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10410.92s)]
*  of the firing squads online. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10413.039999999999s)]
*  We were talking about it before, [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10415.16s)]
*  this sort of toxic compassion thing. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10416.24s)]
*  This prioritization of short-term emotional comfort [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10418.32s)]
*  of everybody, especially dispossessed groups, [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10421.68s)]
*  over everything. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10424.84s)]
*  Truth, long-term flourishing, everything. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10426.48s)]
*  So perfect example of this would be [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10429.32s)]
*  body weight has no bearing on health or lifespan outcomes. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10431.96s)]
*  Because you don't want to make people who are overweight [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10435.96s)]
*  feel uncomfortable. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10438.48s)]
*  Even if your message of you're healthy as you are, [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10439.839999999998s)]
*  you're living your true self. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10444.039999999999s)]
*  Even if that message causes those very people [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10445.8s)]
*  to actually die sooner, [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10449.0s)]
*  the short-term emotional comfort prioritization [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10451.519999999999s)]
*  sweeps everything to one side. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10454.8s)]
*  It sweeps rationality, it sweeps long-term outcomes, [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10456.24s)]
*  all of that stuff. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10458.519999999999s)]
*  Another one would be there is no advantage or benefit [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10459.6s)]
*  to children growing up in a two-parent household. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10463.16s)]
*  Even if that causes teachers and parents [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10467.720000000001s)]
*  to misunderstand why their kids [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10470.800000000001s)]
*  that may come from broken homes [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10472.92s)]
*  behave in the way that they do, [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10474.44s)]
*  you don't want to do something or say something [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10477.16s)]
*  that disparages hardworking single mothers. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10479.04s)]
*  So instead, you do the toxic compassion thing, [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10482.08s)]
*  which is the prioritization of short-term emotional comfort [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10484.32s)]
*  over long-term flourishing. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10487.36s)]
*  And you see this everywhere. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10488.880000000001s)]
*  This performative empathy, toxic compassion thing, [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10491.68s)]
*  the reason I think it's so prevalent online is [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10495.36s)]
*  it's perfectly geared to be mimetically driven. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10497.880000000001s)]
*  All that's happening. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10502.56s)]
*  If you have some harsh truth tweet, [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10503.76s)]
*  some people are gonna push it [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10508.64s)]
*  and it may catch fire if it's a real truth, [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10510.2s)]
*  but a lot of the people that don't wanna hear that, [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10512.72s)]
*  they're gonna say that you're being judgemental, [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10515.8s)]
*  you're being misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10518.48s)]
*  whatever it is. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10520.4s)]
*  But if you say something which is comforting, [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10522.08s)]
*  we need to push back against these white men, [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10524.8s)]
*  everyone can get behind that because it seems empathetic. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10528.08s)]
*  It's one of the problems that anyone who isn't a [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10531.92s)]
*  hardcore, card-carrying liberal [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10535.16s)]
*  has on the internet at the moment, [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10536.56s)]
*  which is if you're not prepared to, [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10538.039999999999s)]
*  if you're going to tell people things [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10541.32s)]
*  that they don't want to hear, [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10542.44s)]
*  you're gonna come across like a bit of a dick [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10543.6s)]
*  for quite a lot of the things that you talk about. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10546.28s)]
*  And that's not particularly good. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10548.560000000001s)]
*  But yeah, this uncertainty, this like, [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10550.6s)]
*  do people love you for who you are or for what you do, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10554.16s)]
*  I think is a really interesting question to ask ourselves [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10556.320000000002s)]
*  because it's that success and happiness thing again. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10559.0s)]
*  Are you trying to achieve happiness through success? [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10563.640000000001s)]
*  Are you trying to make the world love you, [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10566.400000000001s)]
*  to force it by promising your value, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10569.08s)]
*  by promising your validation, by saying, [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10571.560000000001s)]
*  look, I must do this. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10573.2s)]
*  But the interesting thing, [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10574.6s)]
*  this was like the second half of his mushroom trip, [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10575.48s)]
*  was he asked himself, [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10577.84s)]
*  do I love me for who I am or for what I do? [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10581.16s)]
*  So I'm asking the world to love me for who I am [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10586.16s)]
*  because if the world loves me contingent on what I do, [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10589.92s)]
*  then it feels more fragile. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10592.92s)]
*  It feels like it can be taken away from me. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10594.24s)]
*  If I stopped doing what I do, my love would also cease. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10596.52s)]
*  Well, that's a real problem with guys that are in the closet, [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10600.92s)]
*  especially guys in the closet in show business. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10605.68s)]
*  How so? [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10608.0s)]
*  Because they think the world loves them, [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10608.84s)]
*  but the world loves them for a thing [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10611.04s)]
*  that they're not really. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10613.72s)]
*  They're hiding their true self and they're terrified [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10615.64s)]
*  the world will withdraw its love if they tell the truth. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10618.12s)]
*  If they change. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10622.4s)]
*  Yeah, if they come out, [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10623.24s)]
*  they come out and come out of the closet and say, [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10624.28s)]
*  hey, I've been gay the whole time. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10626.04s)]
*  If you're an actor, it's a death sentence [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10627.44s)]
*  because you cannot play straight male roles anymore. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10631.439999999999s)]
*  When was the last time a guy came out of the closet [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10633.72s)]
*  because it was a leading man in a major blockbuster movie? [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10636.599999999999s)]
*  It's never happened. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10639.84s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10641.56s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10642.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's the one area where homophobia [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10643.56s)]
*  is sort of guaranteed. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10645.72s)]
*  Leading men playing straight men in movies. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10647.88s)]
*  You do not wanna see it. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10651.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to see it. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10652.56s)]
*  Does it happen? [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10654.96s)]
*  That's broken my brain. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10655.8s)]
*  No, that's really interesting. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10657.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's the one guy, the Doogie Howser guy. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10658.84s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10661.04s)]
*  Neil Patrick Harris. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10662.64s)]
*  Neil Patrick Harris. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10663.48s)]
*  He played in a sitcom, [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10664.32s)]
*  but it was like a cartoon version of a straight man. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10665.64s)]
*  Nobody believed it. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10669.44s)]
*  Kevin Spacey? [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10670.28s)]
*  Kevin Spacey was in the closet. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10672.44s)]
*  He was in the closet for a long time. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10675.16s)]
*  I mean, he came out of the closet when he got accused. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10677.64s)]
*  Remember? [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10679.4s)]
*  That's really when he came out of the closet. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10680.24s)]
*  Everybody kinda knew he was gay. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10681.880000000001s)]
*  People that work with him certainly knew he was gay, [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10683.68s)]
*  but I think publicly it wasn't something [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10685.8s)]
*  that he acknowledged. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10687.92s)]
*  But it's a thing where, and he's an older man too. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10689.68s)]
*  It's a different sort of thing. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10692.64s)]
*  But if you're a young, handsome movie star, [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10694.92s)]
*  Daniel Craig type character, [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10698.08s)]
*  people find out you're gay. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10699.72s)]
*  No one wants you making out with that girl anymore. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10701.0s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10703.32s)]
*  You know? [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10705.16s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10706.08s)]
*  It's interesting because it's that, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10707.04s)]
*  so I would imagine that if you're one of those people, [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10708.960000000001s)]
*  and I know a couple of guys that are in the closet, [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10711.960000000001s)]
*  and I've encouraged one of them as a friend of mine [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10714.4s)]
*  to try to come out. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10716.56s)]
*  Not a good friend. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10718.44s)]
*  He lives back in LA. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10719.84s)]
*  But he wanted to, then he would not, [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10721.56s)]

*  I go, well, if you ever do, [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10724.36s)]
*  people still love you, man. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10725.960000000001s)]
*  I swear to God, it's all in your head. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10726.88s)]
*  It'll be a huge weight relieved off you [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10730.960000000001s)]
*  when you realize how much people just love you. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10733.04s)]
*  They don't care. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10734.52s)]
*  No one really cares, especially in the comedy world. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10735.36s)]
*  God, the comedy world's so open-minded. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10737.28s)]
*  It's one thing. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10740.28s)]
*  Are you funny? [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10741.36s)]
*  Everything else is just nonsense. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10742.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter where you come from, [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10743.8s)]
*  what part of the world. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10745.52s)]
*  Are you good? [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10746.48s)]
*  Are you funny? [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10748.56s)]
*  If you make people laugh, then you win. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10749.4s)]
*  And can you hang? [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10750.24s)]
*  Are you cool to hang out with, [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10751.64s)]
*  or are you just like a psycho [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10752.64s)]
*  that only wants to be the only one that's funny, [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10753.679999999998s)]
*  and you hate everybody else who's funny? [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10755.64s)]
*  There's just a few of those guys out there, too. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10757.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's one of the interesting challenges, [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10758.92s)]
*  I think, that no one really ever gets to see [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10761.279999999999s)]
*  about the gamesmanship that goes on behind the scenes. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10763.599999999999s)]
*  No one knows about how easy Alan Richson [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10766.119999999999s)]
*  from the new Reacher movie, or Guy Ritchie, [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10769.92s)]
*  or someone else, no one knows about [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10772.359999999999s)]
*  how easy they are to work with. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10774.88s)]
*  But you know, there'll be guys that have been on your show, [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10776.72s)]
*  or been on my show, or whatever. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10780.359999999999s)]
*  I actually quite enjoyed the episode, [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10782.24s)]
*  but I find them very difficult to deal with. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10783.88s)]
*  They're really difficult to deal with outside of that. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10785.92s)]
*  Just, they're at a disadvantage [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10788.64s)]
*  if they're not very personable, [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10790.439999999999s)]
*  if they're not really, if they don't respond [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10792.039999999999s)]
*  in a timely manner, whatever. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10795.199999999999s)]
*  They don't understand the dynamics [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10796.88s)]
*  or imbalance between a famous person [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10799.0s)]
*  and a person trying to talk to the famous person. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10800.72s)]
*  Absolutely, all of these things. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10802.519999999999s)]
*  And you're like, well, that puts you at a disadvantage. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10804.4s)]
*  But that's not anything that's ever gonna be front of house. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10807.56s)]
*  And you saw this with a number [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10810.279999999999s)]
*  of the late night show hosts recently [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10812.64s)]
*  that kind of the tide came back in, [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10814.519999999999s)]
*  and who was swimming naked, [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10818.68s)]
*  or swimming with a whip in their hand, [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10820.439999999999s)]
*  or being mean to the people that they worked with. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10821.92s)]
*  That kind of got shown, [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10824.599999999999s)]
*  and this again, it's that toxic compassion thing. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10826.4s)]
*  And this comes full circle to what we were talking about. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10828.56s)]
*  You were saying a lot of people assume [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10831.16s)]
*  kind of the worst of intentions. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10834.08s)]
*  Here's a little morsel of something, [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10836.240000000002s)]
*  and oh, that's them being a really bad person. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10837.480000000001s)]
*  I think that that's because deep down, [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10841.92s)]
*  a lot of the people doing the performative empathy, [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10844.640000000001s)]
*  toxic compassion thing, know that they're projecting a lie. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10846.560000000001s)]
*  They know that they aren't being truthful. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10850.720000000001s)]
*  That if someone did open the cupboard [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10854.0s)]
*  and have a look inside, [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10855.800000000001s)]
*  that it's full of disgusting, scary lies, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10856.76s)]
*  and fakery, and persona, and all this stuff. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10859.800000000001s)]
*  So they assume that theory of mind [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10862.800000000001s)]
*  for everybody else as well. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10864.52s)]
*  They can't imagine a world in which [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10866.76s)]
*  this slight slip up by somebody [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10868.84s)]
*  couldn't be indicative of their entire personality, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10871.64s)]
*  because they themselves know that this super cutesy, [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10874.64s)]
*  sweetsy, toxic compassion performative empathy front [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10877.64s)]
*  is just that. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10881.52s)]
*  That if you poked it hard enough, [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10882.76s)]
*  there would be a hole, [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10884.48s)]
*  and you'd find out that it was hollow inside. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10885.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think obviously all of that [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10888.48s)]
*  is accentuated by social media. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10892.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, when I really extrapolate, [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10894.359999999999s)]
*  when I really look forward, [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10896.8s)]
*  I think the way out of this is mind reading. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10897.88s)]
*  This is what I'm really concerned with. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10900.92s)]
*  I'm really concerned with the way out of this [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10903.119999999999s)]
*  being some sort of new level of integration [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10906.16s)]
*  that we're all gonna enjoy because of technology. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10909.8s)]
*  Mirror link type stuff? [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10911.56s)]
*  Yeah, and that would be really a solution [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10913.599999999999s)]
*  to all that ails us in terms of, [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10916.08s)]
*  it would be like SnapMap times a billion. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10918.359999999999s)]
*  It would be crazy. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10920.96s)]
*  Everybody would know everything about everybody's thoughts. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10921.92s)]
*  But then it would be that thing like, [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10924.359999999999s)]
*  hey, what do you got to hide? [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10925.599999999999s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot of dummies [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10927.16s)]
*  that are gonna go along with that. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10928.359999999999s)]
*  But you're gonna find out how fucking insane [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10929.56s)]
*  a lot of people are too, [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10931.24s)]
*  if you can actually look into their mind [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10932.16s)]
*  and see the wiring. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10933.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I bet that the people who are out front, [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10934.56s)]
*  the most empathetic, kind, loving, caring people, [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10938.359999999999s)]
*  they are going to be, [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10942.359999999999s)]
*  they would be first on my list for, [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10943.56s)]
*  get inside that guy's mind. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10946.08s)]
*  Have a look at what he's doing, [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10948.08s)]
*  because I think that he's probably a piece of shit. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10949.08s)]
*  He might be. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10951.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, anyone that's working that hard to be like, [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10952.08s)]
*  look at how nice I am. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10953.96s)]
*  Look at how completely unfettered snow, [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10956.119999999999s)]
*  completely untouched, all of this stuff. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10958.68s)]
*  It's always like the male feminists [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10961.8s)]
*  or some of the biggest creeps. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10963.24s)]
*  Sneaky fucker. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10964.08s)]
*  Fucking hell. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10965.24s)]
*  Have you been observing, [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10966.08s)]
*  or have you been seeing this skew of young boys to the right [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10967.08s)]
*  and young girls to the left [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10970.36s)]
*  in terms of their political perspective? [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10971.88s)]
*  Dude, I think that will be the story of 2024. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10974.88s)]
*  I think that's the story. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10979.64s)]
*  This huge breaking of young Gen Z males, teenage boys, [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10982.12s)]
*  mostly to the right, [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10989.0s)]
*  and of girls really sharply to the left. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10990.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know what's gonna change that? [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10993.12s)]
*  An actual hot war. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10994.720000000001s)]
*  Everybody will go right over, right back over. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10996.480000000001s)]
*  You think? [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=10999.36s)]
*  Yeah, when the ladies need, [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11000.2s)]
*  they need men to take care of them, [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11001.04s)]
*  and that the men that have joined their side [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11002.36s)]
*  are all cowards and they're gonna cry. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11004.44s)]
*  Yeah, they'll go to the other side quick. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11006.36s)]
*  There's a lot of news stories at the moment [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11009.44s)]
*  about left-leaning girls struggling to find a guy [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11011.72s)]
*  that they're attracted to. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11015.56s)]
*  None of the guys I'm dating want to hold the door open [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11018.24s)]
*  for me, and none of them really wanna pay for dinner. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11020.32s)]
*  That's called a conservative. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11023.119999999999s)]
*  That's called someone who's right-wing. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ECkzB2efA&t=11024.72s)]
