# Joe Rogan Experience #1506 - James Nestor
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5o9b2RVC2E)
*  All right, we're rolling.
*  First of all, I really enjoyed your book.
*  It was really excellent.
*  I got deep into it.
*  I listened to the audiobook and it's in your voice, so this would be weird sitting in.
*  It's always weird when you meet somebody for the first time and you've heard their book
*  and you hear them talking for long periods of time and then they're right there.
*  But I really enjoyed it, man.
*  I guess I can change the tone of my voice then.
*  No, don't do that.
*  You're used to it.
*  Okay.
*  Keep it steady.
*  Keep it the way it is.
*  Keep it real.
*  What made you want to write this?
*  Where did this come from?
*  There's actually two things.
*  About 10 years ago, 11 years ago, I had this really weird experience.
*  I was in San Francisco with a lot of breathwork yoga stuff going on there and I kept getting
*  pneumonia.
*  I surf a lot at Ocean Beach and I thought that that was the reason.
*  So I kept getting bronchitis, pneumonia year after year.
*  It just kept happening.
*  So a doctor friend of mine suggested a breathing class might help.
*  I didn't know much about this, but went down, signed up, and was sitting in the corner
*  of this studio, cold room, legs crossed, breathing in this rhythmic pattern, nothing crazy, just
*  and then really slow.
*  And I sweated through my t-shirt, through my socks, my hair was sopping wet, sweat all
*  over my face.
*  So I went back to her and I said, what happened?
*  You're a doctor.
*  You should know this.
*  And she said, oh, you must have had a fever or the room must have been too hot.
*  So she had no idea.
*  But I didn't know what to do with that story.
*  So I just kind of filed it away, forgot about it for a number of years until I met some
*  free divers.
*  These are people who have, through the power of will, enabled themselves to hold their
*  breath for six, seven, eight minutes at a time and dive to depths far below what any
*  scientists thought possible.
*  So I thought, wow, there's something in breathing here that I don't know about and I figured
*  other people might not know about as well.
*  That's really interesting.
*  I've known a bunch of free divers and I've known a bunch of Jiu-Jitsu people that got
*  really into yoga, primarily because of Hicks and Gracie.
*  Hicks and Gracie, do you know who he is?
*  Yeah, probably the most famous of the classic Jiu-Jitsu people.
*  He's known as being the very best.
*  He was one of the original real pioneers of Jiu-Jitsu in America as well.
*  And there's this documentary on him called Choke.
*  Have you seen it?
*  I have not, no.
*  It's really fascinating, this documentary.
*  He's doing all this crazy stomach breath stuff, the yogi stuff, because he's really into yoga
*  as well for flexibility and balance and all those different things.
*  He was probably the first guy to introduce yoga to Jiu-Jitsu as well.
*  But him and his son, who's also a world champion in Jiu-Jitsu, just stressed constantly that
*  it's all about the breath and that breathing is everything.
*  But it's everything for Jiu-Jitsu, it's everything for martial arts, it's everything for your mindset.
*  You're going to find that in the foundation of so many different sports.
*  I think a lot of that has been forgotten.
*  I know that coaches in the 50s used to have their runners take a big mouthful of water,
*  run around the track, and then they'd have to spit out that same amount of water into
*  a cup to force them to breathe through their nose, to force them to move their diaphragms
*  up and down a little more, because breathing is so essential to their recovery, their endurance,
*  and their performance.
*  One of the things I find interesting about your book was the experiment with plugging
*  up the nose for a month.
*  What did you guys do it for a month?
*  Is that what it was?
*  Ten days.
*  Ten days.
*  And that ten day, my nose was broken most of my life.
*  I had a useless nose until I was 40, and then I got an operation to have my deviated septum
*  corrected and the turbinates shaved down.
*  It changed my life.
*  It really did.
*  I didn't realize, the term mouth breather is a really interesting term, because it's
*  a term for a moron, but I felt like a moron after I got my nose fixed.
*  I was like, why didn't I do this before?
*  I was robbing myself of oxygen.
*  Yeah, and there's so much science supporting how injurious it is to constantly be breathing
*  through your mouth.
*  There's no debate about that, but what people don't realize is about 25 to 50% of the population
*  habitually breathes through their mouths.
*  They don't realize the neurological problems that this causes, the respiratory problems
*  this causes, problems with snoring, sleep apnea, even metabolic disorders.
*  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
*  So I had been talking to the chief of rhinology research at Stanford.
*  We'd done many interviews over a series of months.
*  He's a big nose guy.
*  So he said, this is the most amazing organ.
*  No one's talking about it.
*  At the NIH, there's no school for studying the nose and its effects, and he thought that
*  that was criminal.
*  So he had warned me how bad mouth breathing was, but no one knew how quickly that damage
*  came on.
*  So we knew that after years, it can change the structure of your face.
*  It's so common in kids that it has a term called adenoid face.
*  If you see these kids with very long faces, because they've been mouth breathing so long
*  that their faces have actually, the musculature and the skeletature have changed.
*  It changes your skeleton.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It creates a longer face.
*  That also makes these people much more apt to snoring and sleep apnea.
*  But no one knew if a month of mouth breathing would be bad, a year, how soon those issues
*  came on.
*  So I asked him, I said, well, why don't you test it?
*  You're one of the best universities in the world.
*  You have the means to do this.
*  And he thought, in his words, it would be unethical, because he knew how damaging that
*  it could be for people.
*  And so I volunteered.
*  I said, well, why don't you test it on me?
*  I'll get somebody else to do it.
*  They had no money for this.
*  So we had to pay for this study just to experience what that was like.
*  And the point wasn't to do some jackass stunt.
*  It was to lull ourselves into a position my body certainly knew.
*  I think I was mouth breathing through much of my youth.
*  And that 25% to 50% of the population knows, and to actually measure what happens.
*  Now do you think there was some bacterial growth that was inside your nose as well from this?
*  Do you think that some of that could be attributed to just the act of plugging the nose?
*  Because you physically plugged it.
*  It's not like you chose to breathe out of your mouth.
*  You actually like see you closed up the opening.
*  Yeah, that's that's right.
*  And it could.
*  No one knows for sure.
*  Because the less you use your nose, the less you're going to be able to use your nose,
*  just like any other muscle.
*  So when people start habitually breathing through their mouths, their noses are going
*  to start to close up.
*  And we know this from the Doctor of Speech Language Pathology at Stanford.
*  She measured people who had laryngectomy holes drilled in their throats so they could breathe.
*  She found between two months and two years, their noses were completely blocked.
*  Zero air coming in.
*  So the more you use it, the more you're going to be able to use it.
*  So the less you use it, the more apt you will you will be to have problems.
*  What is the process?
*  Well, why does the nose close up?
*  It would seem that it's a hole.
*  Like why would that hole close?
*  It's not in use.
*  Those turbinates, all those tissues just just start closing up.
*  And so using your nose actually makes the opening wider?
*  Absolutely.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  My nose got physically wider after my operation.
*  It's really strange.
*  Like I was, I look back on the photos from when I was 40 on my actual physical, and I
*  attributed it to the fact that they put these big foam things and these plastic spacers
*  in there because the doctor that had did the operation, he's, I forget the period of time
*  afterwards, I had to have these things stuffed into my nose and this plastic that was sort
*  of sutured in place to hold it into position.
*  And I attributed that to why my nose got wider.
*  But I noticed it like within a year or two afterwards, like my fucking nose is wider.
*  Like it's different.
*  Like if I look at older pictures of myself, my nose is more narrow and now it's more flared
*  out and I felt like it was because of that.
*  But now that you're saying this, now I'm thinking maybe it's just from breathing out
*  of it.
*  Well, surgical interventions are going to open that airway.
*  There's no doubt about that.
*  But we know the more that you breathe through your nose, the more that it's going to open
*  up.
*  And you can see this with people who are habitual mouth breathers who are also joggers who have
*  just been breathing through their mouths for decades.
*  They start breathing through their nose.
*  At the beginning, it's really, really hard.
*  They say, I can't do this.
*  This is awful.
*  Then weeks go by, months go by, and their noses open up.
*  And allows them to breathe through the nose.
*  The benefits of that, they're innumerable.
*  So many benefits of nasal breathing.
*  Not only oxygen, but it helps defend your body, humidifies air, conditions air, on and
*  on and on.
*  And this is something I just don't think a lot of people realize.
*  And from the researchers I've been talking to, they were a bit frustrated too, seeing
*  so many chronic conditions tied to mouth breathing and how so many of those could either be improved
*  upon or sometimes outright cured by switching the pathway in which you breathe.
*  So does breathing through your nose make your actual nostril opening wider?
*  I don't know that.
*  And I haven't seen any papers on that.
*  So it's, but my nostril holes and everything is probably just from the surgical intervention
*  and stuffing it with plastic and stretching it out.
*  I would assume so.
*  Now Wim Hof, who you reference in the book, he doesn't give a fuck about nose breathing
*  or mouth breathing.
*  He just goes, just breathe motherfucker, breathe.
*  That's what he says.
*  Oh yeah, I practiced his mode of breathing all the time.
*  I'm used to having his little voice in my head.
*  Why doesn't he care about breathing from the nose or the mouth?
*  He just wants you to breathe.
*  Because if we're breathing 25,000 times a day, if you're taking 500 of those breaths
*  through your mouth, it's not going to really make any impact on you.
*  I'm talking about habitual mouth breathing.
*  No, I understand.
*  I'm just talking about through breathing exercises.
*  So what he's done is he wants to make this easy and accessible for people.
*  So many people can't breathe through their noses.
*  So they go, they can't get that breath in those 30 huge breaths you need to take, right?
*  They take too long to do it.
*  So he says it doesn't matter.
*  Don't pay attention.
*  You need to get that breath in.
*  You need to expand your lungs.
*  And for the rest of the time, you know, the benefits of nasal breathing, that habitual
*  breathing is so important to health.
*  It seems so strange to me reading your book that I'm just learning this in terms of like,
*  I mean, I've been doing athletics my whole life.
*  How do I not know that breathing through the nose is more beneficial?
*  How do coaches not know this?
*  This is something I just got running up against over and over again.
*  And when I first started writing this book, my friends who are journalists and authors,
*  they said, you're writing a book about breathing?
*  Why would you write a book about breathing?
*  It's like walking.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a good new book about walking.
*  Is there?
*  Really?
*  So, so they were ripping on me quite, quite a bit until they heard some of the details
*  of it.
*  And the stuff is like, has been right in front of us the whole time.
*  And it's so obvious that no one's really paying attention to it.
*  And the scientific foundation, all the research is there.
*  And that's what makes these, these researchers, these scientists so frustrated is they, we
*  have 50 years of rock solid science here, showing the problems with mouth breathing,
*  showing the problems with snoring and sleep apnea.
*  No one's really been paying attention.
*  We're treating all these separate problems that are associated with these core issues.
*  And we're not looking at the core issue.
*  And I think that breathing has to be considered along with diet and exercise as a pillar of
*  health because even if you eat keto, vegan, paleo, whatever, even if you exercise all
*  the time, if you're not breathing right, you're never really going to be healthy.
*  We know that to be the truth.
*  So air comes through your mouth.
*  Air comes through your nose.
*  What is the difference between the air coming through your nose?
*  Okay.
*  So your nose, if you were to take your fist, you've got a really big fist.
*  So someone with a slightly smaller fist and to take that fist and imagine just pushing
*  it inside of your head, that's about the volume of your nose and all the sinus cavities.
*  So they even stretch up above your eyes.
*  The volume of your fist, that's crazy.
*  It's about a billiard ball.
*  So a little, it depends on what size fist you have, right?
*  So all, and they call it the nasal concha because it looks exactly like a seashell.
*  If you were to split a seashell in half and look at it, that's what's happening in your
*  nose and all of this stuff evolved this way for a reason.
*  So that air that comes in through the nose is slowed down, it's filtered, it's humidified
*  and it's conditioned.
*  So by the time it gets to your lungs, your lungs can absorb that oxygen so much easier.
*  The nose is really the first line of defense.
*  Another amazing thing with a nose is it produces something called nitric oxide, which is this
*  wonderful molecule that is a vasodilator that plays an essential role in oxygen delivery
*  and also helps battle off viruses, bacteria and other pathogens.
*  So this is all happening in the nose and slowing down that air and all of these other functions
*  allow us to gain about 20% more oxygen breathing through the nose than breathing through the mouth.
*  So you can breathe less and get more by breathing through the nose.
*  Wow.
*  So breathing through the mouth, even though you're filling your lungs up, even though
*  you're taking a big deep breath, you're filling your lungs up, you're not getting as much oxygen.
*  That's right because you can over breathe.
*  When people at a gym or when people are jogging, you see them really going to get the maximum
*  amount of oxygen in.
*  That's not what is happening to your body.
*  So you are offloading the CO2.
*  By offloading too much CO2, you're causing constriction in your circulation.
*  So right now, if we were to breathe 30 huge breaths, you'll feel some tingling in your
*  head, you'll feel some, maybe your fingertips will get cool, your toes will get too cool.
*  That's not from an increase of oxygen.
*  It's the opposite that's happening.
*  That's from a decrease of circulation.
*  So your body wants to be in balance.
*  You want to have the right amount of CO2 and oxygen for optimum delivery.
*  And that's what the nose helps you to do.
*  That was one of the craziest things about the book where you're talking about yogis
*  that were able to vary the temperature between each hand.
*  No, on the same hand.
*  Oh, on the same hand.
*  The same hand.
*  One area was gray, the other was red.
*  Oh, in the same.
*  In the same, not even this and this.
*  On the same hand.
*  And you know, when I came across this, people are saying, this is impossible.
*  Who did this study?
*  Some guy in Taos in his garage.
*  No, it was at the Menager Clinic, which was the world's, at least in the US, the largest
*  psychiatric research facility at the time.
*  And a Navy physicist did these tests.
*  It was reported in the New York Times.
*  Have they been replicated?
*  They haven't found someone who had the powers of Swami Rama.
*  I think Wim's about as close as we've gotten to that guy.
*  So this is something that is like, you know, like Michael Jordan didn't start out good
*  at basketball, right?
*  He learned, he practiced, he got better.
*  And this, you could say the same thing, perhaps, about breathing?
*  For sure.
*  And just look at freedivers, right?
*  I was at this, my first foray into that world was at the World Freediving Championship in
*  Greece.
*  And you see these people, some of them are short, some of them are tall, some of them
*  are large, small.
*  I mean, from all walks of life, every imaginable country, something like 30 countries, had
*  representatives there.
*  And these people weren't born with these enormous lungs, right?
*  They did this by the power of will, by breathing and expanding their lung capacity.
*  And so once I saw them, all of these people able to do this, once they explained to me,
*  they said, you know, the benefits of breathing go beyond just diving deep.
*  It can allow us to heal our bodies of problems.
*  It can allow us super endurance.
*  It can allow us to do all these things that we've been told are medically impossible.
*  And I heard this, I didn't believe them, but I spent several years in the field talking
*  to people at Stanford, Harvard, you know, the best, the leaders in the field and finding
*  this research and what they told me was absolutely true.
*  The idea that there's a guy like this Swami Rama, is that how you say his name?
*  That he can do that.
*  It's very appealing to me and very interesting to me because even though breathing has been
*  around for a long time, you know, everybody knows that there's different styles of breathing
*  and holotropic breathing is pretty popular.
*  I always think even though people know the benefits of many things, very few people go
*  all the way with stuff.
*  Like, you know, if you just talk to an average person, can someone run 250 miles?
*  Most people say no, but I know people that have done it.
*  So it is possible, but you have to find someone who go all the way and do it for a long time,
*  a long time.
*  So this Swami Rama guy, there has to be someone else like that out there.
*  Yeah, and they're probably not on Facebook, right?
*  No, they're probably in an ashram somewhere.
*  Absolutely.
*  So this was a guy who grew up in the Himalayas, who by the age of four was studying yoga.
*  He was meditating, he was breathing.
*  So he lived his entire life in that world learning these tricks.
*  And he got so good at it that he was able on command to make his heart beat 300 times
*  a minute, 300 times a minute.
*  So it was so fast, they were looking at the EKG readout and they said he stopped his heart.
*  Then they looked at it a little closer and said, no, actually, it's beating 300 times
*  a minute.
*  And then he would just snap out of it.
*  So these stories sound so impossible.
*  They sounded impossible to me, but it's all documented.
*  So I just don't know in the modern world, do we have the capacity?
*  Is there someone out there who's willing to stay off their phone, stay off Netflix and
*  focus on one thing for 30 years?
*  I'm not sure.
*  Maybe, hopefully, but who knows?
*  That was what was so interesting listening to the book.
*  I was like, God, I want to know what's possible, but I don't want to do it.
*  Let other people do it.
*  I don't have that kind of time, man, but I believe there's something to it because my
*  own personal benefits that I've gotten from breathing exercises is one of the reasons why
*  that's what led me to your book.
*  And especially in the sauna.
*  Over the last year, I got a sauna in my house and I've gotten really into, I have a sauna
*  here as well, but I got really into doing these daily sessions of 180 degrees for 25
*  to 30 minutes.
*  As you can imagine, the last 10 minutes are really uncomfortable.
*  When it's 15 minutes in and you know you got 10 more minutes to go, it's not fun.
*  But when I breathe, when I concentrate on these breathing exercises, and I have a bunch
*  of different ones that I do, and one of them that I do is I concentrate on taking shallow
*  breaths and holding my breath for as long as I can.
*  And there's this panicked moment where you feel like you have to breathe, but you really
*  don't.
*  You really don't.
*  You just got to get over that panic moment.
*  And then there's like a weird calm that comes over and you could last much, much longer
*  than you can.
*  And then when I do breathe in, I just concentrate on doing it slowly.
*  Don't let myself panic.
*  And like time just flies by.
*  It's crazy.
*  Time flies by and because I'm thinking about the breathing, I'm barely paying attention
*  that I'm profusely sweating and my body's not freaking out as much.
*  So I do these little weird tricks that I play on myself inside the sauna.
*  And in concentrating on breathing and long deep breaths through my nose and holding it
*  and then long exhales through my nose, when I'm doing that, it makes everything easier.
*  It's weird.
*  It makes your body, for whatever reason, more accepting of the extreme heat.
*  Well that's what I love about breathing is it allows us these levers in the systems that
*  we can't otherwise control.
*  So the autonomic nervous system is supposed to be beyond our control.
*  It's called autonomic, automatic.
*  Can't control it.
*  We can through breathing.
*  You may not be able to control your liver function or your stomach or your heart, but
*  when you breathe a certain way, you can influence all those functions and you can start taking
*  control of these other elements of your body as whim is showing with not only the nervous
*  system but with immune function.
*  So all of this was supposed to be impossible until he showed up and said, you know, why
*  don't you test me?
*  Instead of just talking, we have measurements.
*  We have equipment to test this stuff.
*  If we can measure it, we can study it.
*  If we can study it, we can prove if it's right or wrong.
*  And that's what I find is so interesting and accessible about breathing as well.
*  Even if someone has a pulse ox or you have a heart rate variability monitor, you can
*  breathe in certain ways and instantly see what it does to your body.
*  So people who say that this is a placebo effect don't understand that this is a biological
*  function that you're taking control of.
*  And if you can elicit such a strong response in a couple of minutes, imagine what you can
*  do in a couple of days or a couple of weeks or a couple of months.
*  And we're starting to see that with Wim and some of his minions and other people who have
*  been breathing as a way to heal themselves of chronic conditions.
*  Yeah, Wim is a really interesting sort of he's a great spokesperson for it because he
*  drinks Heineken and eats spaghetti like he's a weirdo.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And he swears a lot and he's fun and he's silly.
*  What I like about him is the fact that he doesn't seem like this mystical person that
*  you can't relate to.
*  He's very relatable.
*  Yeah, and I think that that's where breathing really needs to move from this new ageing
*  us into more pragmatic and practical area.
*  And he is Wim is like the everyman, right?
*  And he's gone and discovered these things.
*  And now he's showing people how to use them.
*  And he's very clear that he did not invent these methods.
*  These methods have been around for at least a thousand years, especially tummo.
*  And there's documentation that goes back a thousand years, 1200 years of people doing
*  this to heat themselves up.
*  They're like, I don't have a jacket.
*  I don't have anything else to wear.
*  I'm freezing.
*  How do I keep my core temperature warm in these freezing temperatures?
*  Can you explain tummo to people?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  So so tummo is a breathing practice that is used to build heat in the body, build inner
*  heat.
*  And it was the first documentation was from this guy Naropa, who about 11, 1100 years
*  ago went off on a spiritual pilgrimage, ended up in the Himalayas, needed to heat himself
*  and use this practice.
*  And it stayed in the monasteries for for hundreds of years until this Belgian French opera singer
*  anarchist around the 1900s.
*  That's a mouthful.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I was going to include a few more because she did a whole bunch of she's in a free love
*  of feminism.
*  I mean, you name it.
*  She ran the gamut.
*  So but she went on a spiritual pilgrimage for 14 years in the Himalayas when she was
*  in her 40s.
*  This is in the 1900s, which is just like unheard of.
*  Wow.
*  And she discovered this this thing.
*  She said she was able to use this to not eat or drink anything at elevations of above 18,000
*  feet and walk for about 19 hours at a time.
*  There are no fact checkers there to prove it.
*  And nobody believed her until Herbert Benson at Harvard had heard enough of these stories
*  in the 1980s that he went out and tested these monks and found out that they could do exactly
*  what they had been told that they were supposed to do, you know, for thousands of years.
*  And what is the technique of tummo?
*  The technique is it's very similar to Wim Hof's version of tummo.
*  The monks do it in a slightly different way.
*  They slow down their nervous system.
*  And Benson found that they were able to slow their metabolism by 60 percent.
*  So it's lower than anything that has ever been measured before.
*  So they just do that and focus on a fire within the body and breathe out.
*  Sometimes they breathe a little more.
*  You can see videotapes of this for people who don't believe this stuff.
*  You can see videotapes of this guy in a cold room, no shirt on, sweating.
*  They put a wet sheet on him and he dries the sheet within about a half an hour because
*  he's so hot.
*  And he's only doing this through breathing.
*  And when you're making this noise, what is the technique?
*  Like you're breathing, is this like an 80-20 thing where you fully fill the lungs out and
*  let 80 percent or let 20 percent out and then breathe in again and let 20 percent out,
*  like that kind of thing?
*  That version is much more complicated, the type that the Bon Tummo monks use.
*  So Wim's method does the exact same thing, but he's stimulating the nervous system.
*  So his is 30 huge breaths, breath hold as long as you can, one big breath in, 15 second
*  hold and then out.
*  And what are these monks doing?
*  They're doing a slower version of it.
*  So I have not practiced that version of Tummo.
*  Why not?
*  Because it's really complicated.
*  And to do it right, you need to get the master there.
*  And I tried to contact these guys and they did not want me there reporting on what they
*  were doing.
*  What is, god, I would feel like if they knew the benefits of this, they would want the
*  world to know.
*  You would think so, but what would we do with it, right?
*  We find it, we commercialize it.
*  And so maybe they don't want the world to know, you know, maybe they want to keep a
*  few things in their back pocket.
*  So what do you know of what they're doing?
*  Why is it so complicated?
*  Because so much of this is a mental practice.
*  It's conjoined with...
*  So it's not just the breathing, there's some sort of a thought process that goes along with it.
*  Absolutely.
*  And to get that visualization and to be able to focus for that amount of time takes a lot
*  of time.
*  I think one of the reasons that WIM's process is so easy and accessible, you can think about
*  whatever you want while you're breathing that way.
*  You think about emails, think about what you're going to have for dinner.
*  And as long as you're breathing that way, it'll do what it does.
*  And their method requires you to think about very specific things?
*  So you're not just thinking about a fire inside of your belly, moving your belly in and out.
*  So you know this?
*  I don't know every single step.
*  No, I do not.
*  But what other steps could there be?
*  There's fast breathing, there's slow breathing, and there's a ton of mental focus.
*  So there's like 20 steps that you have to go through to really get this right.
*  Are we in danger of losing this?
*  It seems like you know about it, but you don't know how to do it.
*  I don't know.
*  I know the elements of it and what I've read online and who knows how true that stuff is.
*  There's a few guys teaching this, one's in Colorado and the others are in India.
*  Is he in Boulder?
*  He must be in Boulder.
*  He has to be.
*  Where else?
*  But you think about how many languages that we're losing, right?
*  Along with those languages, we're losing knowledge very, very quickly.
*  And this is happening every decade.
*  Especially if you consider what's happened to Tibet, to these civilizations that have
*  been there practicing this technology of breathing for thousands of years, a lot of it's just
*  disappearing.
*  Yeah, that's a shame.
*  Have you thought about going there and hanging out with those guys?
*  I'd love to.
*  Can't do that now.
*  Right, of course.
*  I spent some time, you know the book, I talk about two-moment, about half of one chapter,
*  and I wanted to cover it.
*  The hymn's been written about all over the place, people know his method, but I wanted
*  to look at the science from it and look at the history of it.
*  Because the how was one story, but to me it was more interesting to find why, what's happening
*  to the body, why does this happen, where does it come from?
*  So that's what I focused on.
*  So this gentleman that teaches in Colorado, where did he learn it from?
*  He must have learned it from the great sages, you know, in Dharamsala or Tibet.
*  Or maybe he's like one of those kung fu guys who just fakes it.
*  Or maybe he's just, yeah, a faker.
*  A faker.
*  Yeah, it could be.
*  He just made something up.
*  It could be.
*  I don't want to accuse him.
*  But in the martial arts world that happens a lot.
*  At least it used to happen a lot.
*  There's a lot of fakers that have, you know, the thing in martial arts world was always
*  chi.
*  And, you know, you talk about that in the book as well, about people having this power,
*  And it was 99.9% horseshit.
*  Meaning that most of the people that were talking about it were really teaching sort
*  of a fraudulent, made up version of martial arts.
*  And there's a bunch of Instagram pages that are dedicated to these people.
*  It's really to making fun of them.
*  Because it's so strange.
*  It's such a weird thing that these people do, where they have huge classfuls of people
*  and they pretend to have this death touch and they touch people.
*  And the people, they're essentially in a cult.
*  And so they spasm, they fall to the ground.
*  And it always made me laugh.
*  But there was a part of me that says, there's a thing in the body.
*  And this thing can be activated, whether you want to call it energy or spirit.
*  There's different mindsets and inspiration.
*  And through these different mindsets and inspiration, you can achieve some pretty spectacular results,
*  physical results.
*  And people that are in this mindset, they can perform better.
*  There's something about them in terms of martial arts.
*  There's something about that.
*  So I've always wondered, like if someone really pursued this, without all the nonsense, without
*  all the chicanery, if you really pursued this, what could be done?
*  I think the first thing you do is get these people in a lab.
*  If they're claiming to have these skills that are incredible, why not measure it?
*  I mean, it's not that hard to measure stuff.
*  And so if they deny having any lab work done or having it being measured, then I think
*  you have to be a little apprehensive.
*  And that's something that so much of this technology is cheap now to get.
*  So even if you were to show up with $2,000 worth of equipment, you could see if there
*  was some scientific basis to what these people are doing.
*  So from my understanding, I didn't go down the chi hole too deep, but a lot of these
*  people aren't showing up and offering, volunteering to have their skills tested.
*  And that's how science works.
*  You have to test it, right?
*  It has to be replicable.
*  Well, everybody wants to be Swami Rama, but nobody wants to do what Swami Rama did, right?
*  Yeah, who wants to sit in a cave?
*  Well, some people do sit in a cave for 30 years, right?
*  He would go away for years at a time in a dark cave and just sit there and breathe.
*  So in the modern age, I just don't know.
*  What a freak that guy must have been.
*  God, I would love to have talked to him.
*  Yeah, he had it all down.
*  Because there are people that can do that.
*  They're like the Unabomber of breathing.
*  They just move to the woods without the negativity.
*  But what was cool about him is he wasn't the only one who could do this.
*  So there were researchers in the 20s and in the 40s who went out with a bunch of equipment,
*  whatever equipment they could cobble together, and tested other yogis who were able to do
*  this exact same thing, right?
*  So Swami was part of this long lineage of people who had this knowledge.
*  Is it still there?
*  It could be.
*  But again, I don't think it's online.
*  I think you really have to get out in the weeds and earn these people's trust in order
*  to get that story.
*  What is the history of these people doing this?
*  What was their initial motivation?
*  Is there a written history of this?
*  The earliest evidence that we have for breathing practices dates back about 4,000 or 5,000
*  years from these little statuettes in the Indus Valley, which is in northern India.
*  So there was this huge, thriving civilization.
*  They had paved roads.
*  They had running water.
*  They were dealing with tin and copper.
*  And they had no, in this whole civilization, they still have not found any political or
*  governmental buildings.
*  They haven't found any religious iconography.
*  So these people in some ways could have been more advanced than we are now.
*  And they had all of these figures of these people in these yoga poses with their stomachs
*  out.
*  So that's how they date the earliest archaeological evidence of that.
*  And since then, then all of these practices were moved into the Rig Veda and all of the
*  earliest yoga texts.
*  And they were codified in the yoga sutras of Pantinjauli.
*  That's where a lot of the yoga methods come from.
*  And that's about 2,000 years old.
*  So the methods predate all that.
*  Oh, I'm sure they predate probably anything that has been in writing.
*  That's what's so curious to me, what makes me so curious.
*  If you really think about what life must have been like back then, when they were creating
*  this, you would think that people were hunting and gathering and it was probably a very hard
*  life.
*  Well, not in that civilization.
*  Right, but they got to a point where they had some sort of agriculture or some structures
*  and buildings.
*  But how did they get to the point where, because the rest of the world obviously didn't do
*  this.
*  So what made them come and practice in Germany or in Italy or in all these other civilizations?
*  What made these people focus on breath work so much?
*  Well, it could have been, but we just haven't found anything related to that yet.
*  So if you think about hunter-gatherers, we're imagining them as, man, they're just working
*  all day.
*  They're hunting all day.
*  They're gathering.
*  They weren't.
*  From what I know and from what I've seen of the science there, probably three or four
*  hours of work.
*  And then you have no other distractions to spend time and build these systems of breathing
*  and health, which is what started in ancient China, which is what started in India, which
*  is what started in ancient Greece.
*  Think about all the distractions we're dealing with today.
*  Constant interruptions.
*  If you've already done your work for the day, there's nothing else to do.
*  You're going to get more interested and you're going to have the time to do some empirical
*  studies to see what works and what doesn't.
*  It just seems to me that learning something like that, learning something like prolonged
*  breath work and the benefits of it, it seems like this is a really long-term practice that
*  doesn't show you immediate benefits.
*  Yes and no.
*  I think that you can take someone who has a serious problem, maybe someone who's already
*  very fit, it's going to take a while to really see those big benefits.
*  We see that with athletes with nasal breathing.
*  It takes them weeks or sometimes months to really see gains in performance.
*  But if you've got someone with a chronic condition like asthma or anxiety who are struggling
*  to breathe every single day and you teach them some basic breathing, some normal breathing
*  patterns, their lives can be absolutely transformed.
*  We've seen this in study after study.
*  So these people, their breathing has become so disrupted, their breathing in such an unhealthy
*  way that they don't know what proper breathing is.
*  And shifting that has a tremendous impact.
*  So for people like that, they can see the benefits in a couple of hours, maybe even
*  less than that.
*  Someone with high blood pressure right now, if they're sitting at home, they can take
*  their blood pressure and then breathe at a rate of about six seconds in, six seconds
*  out, take their blood pressure after that.
*  And there's a good chance the blood pressure is going to go down.
*  I've seen mine go down 10 or 15 points just by breathing because your body is operating
*  in its most efficient way that way.
*  And over how long a period of time would it take your blood pressure to drop that much?
*  After a few minutes, I've found it about three or four minutes of breathing this way.
*  And they've found there's devices that they sell now, which trains people to sit down,
*  take a seat and breathe in a certain pattern for 10 or 15 minutes.
*  And they've shown marked decreases in blood pressure by that.
*  You don't need this device to do this.
*  It helps.
*  It trains you.
*  All you need to do is focus on your breath.
*  We have the technology in our heads.
*  We have lungs.
*  We have a nose.
*  We can use that to really help optimize our health.
*  And what is the benefit for asthmatics?
*  The benefit for asthmatics is they traditionally, oftentimes mouth breathe, not all the time.
*  They very oftentimes are breathing too much.
*  So you see an asthmatic.
*  That's usually how they breathe because they are offloading all of the CO2.
*  By offloading that CO2, they are causing constriction.
*  And they're so paranoid that they're going to have an asthma attack that every time they
*  feel it coming on, they go, guess what happens when you start breathing more and more?
*  You're causing more constriction.
*  So they teach them to take control of their breath to relax at those times.
*  So that's what hyperventilating is?
*  Yes.
*  There's a study done about 10 years ago.
*  It was one of the best studies I came across where they took 120 asthmatics and the technology
*  they used to treat them was breathing.
*  They would have them bring around this capnometer which would gauge their CO2.
*  Every time their CO2 started getting low, which meant they were breathing too much,
*  they would have them slow down and slow down their breathing.
*  Within a month, they had a significant effect on asthma attacks and also respiratory health.
*  Their airways got larger.
*  So just by breathing.
*  And this is a well-known study.
*  It's available for anyone to look up.
*  So do you know what causes asthma?
*  Is it just a genetic?
*  It's an allergic reaction.
*  It's an inflammatory reaction.
*  So there's different types of asthma.
*  There's allergic asthma.
*  There's exercise-induced asthma, which is caused by breathing too much.
*  And a lot of people think, oh, I was born with asthma.
*  I'm stuck with asthma.
*  That could be true for a lot of people who don't want to take some additional measures
*  to help abate the symptoms of that asthma.
*  And I think we're just finding now a lot of really legit solid science showing that breathing
*  is implicated both in the onset of asthma, but it can also be used as a tool to help
*  attenuate the symptoms of it.
*  So if you're talking to someone with asthma, what would you, like my friend Hannibal, he
*  was here yesterday.
*  He was telling a story about freaking out on mushrooms and hyperventilating and how
*  to get his inhaler.
*  What would you tell someone like him who's an asthmatic?
*  I would first tell him, I'm not a breathing therapist.
*  I'm not a doctor.
*  And he should continue going to his doctor and taking his bronchodilator.
*  So I'm a journalist who went into this field with zero slant, with zero objective.
*  Then I would tell him after that disclaimer that I would seek a therapist who has experience
*  dealing with asthmatics and using breathing to help them.
*  Is that common?
*  They are out there and they're starting to grow.
*  Papworth Method was developed in England in the 1960s, really effective.
*  A system called Buteco breathing has shown there's a lot of quackery in Buteco.
*  So be careful who you're using.
*  A lot of people have taken up Buteco techniques and appointed themselves as breathing therapists
*  and they don't know the basis of how exactly it works.
*  What is Buteco?
*  Buteco is a system of allowing you to help you to breathe less and to breathe slowly.
*  And it's been pretty extensively studied with asthma in particular.
*  It's good for hypertension as well.
*  So I would find a therapist who has a knowledge of this.
*  Patrick McEwen has been doing this for 20 years.
*  He's rock solid.
*  He's done the science and he cured his own allergies, severe asthma and allergies.
*  And he said, why the hell isn't anyone else doing this?
*  And so he stopped when he was a business major and stopped.
*  And he's written like four books on this stuff.
*  So it's...
*  What's his name again?
*  Patrick McEwen.
*  Patrick McEwen.
*  Yeah, Irish dude.
*  And breathing less.
*  See, that sounds very counterintuitive to people.
*  When you say breathing less, they're like, what are you talking about?
*  You're supposed to breathe a lot, right?
*  More you breathe, the more air you get, right?
*  Yeah, this is such a contrarian concept.
*  It took me months to really figure out what was going on here.
*  So most of us breathe too much, just like most of the population is eating too much.
*  When we're taking in that much air, we're just breathing it back out.
*  So 75% of the oxygen we take in, we breathe back out.
*  So if we're breathing, if we're just sitting here now and I'm doing this, I'm not gaining
*  any oxygen.
*  I'm actually making it harder for my body to offload oxygen into the tissues, muscles
*  and organs.
*  Is that because it takes time for your body to take the oxygen in through the breath and
*  disperse it through the body?
*  Yeah, it's two things.
*  So it's the CO2.
*  When I'm breathing like this, I'm offloading too much CO2.
*  And without that CO2, I'm not getting that vasodilation.
*  I'm not getting that circulation, which is why just doing that, a little lightness in
*  my head, you know, my fingers get a little tingly.
*  Just doing that?
*  Just from that.
*  Try, keep going.
*  So as you're doing that, you're going to feel a little dizzy.
*  You'll probably feel some circulation problems in your hands and fingers.
*  You could do this for two hours and you'll really see what I'm saying.
*  So the point by breathing less and deeply is to optimize each of those breaths as much
*  as you can to give your body more time to extract that oxygen.
*  And you want to do that through the nose because that pressure of breathing in helps the lungs
*  in that gas exchange.
*  So if you know someone that has a deviated septum, you would instantly recommend them
*  get that fixed.
*  This is what I have.
*  So 75% of the population has a deviated septum that is clearly visible to the naked eye.
*  So I've had my nose broken two or three times.
*  So I'm as when they took a CAT scan of my head, I'm as more messed up as anyone.
*  Nayak said you are the perfect candidate for surgery, but I tried to see what I could do
*  outside of surgery.
*  I know people who have been absent, just like you, have had their health transformed by
*  it.
*  So that's important.
*  But there are also people who don't necessarily need it and should start by practicing some
*  breathing methods.
*  So you didn't get surgery?
*  I did not, no.
*  Interesting.
*  And I changed my airways and I changed how my nose worked over the course of a year.
*  We took CAT scans before and after just by breathing.
*  You know how people get cauliflower ear?
*  Do you know that from calcified blood gets trapped inside the tissues?
*  My nose was filled like that.
*  So I really did need surgery.
*  My nose had probably been broken.
*  I broke my nose the first time when I was five falling down a flight of stairs and then
*  a lifetime of combat sports.
*  I don't know how many times I broke it.
*  It easily could be more than a dozen.
*  And that's why you are a perfect candidate for this and it changed your life.
*  Yeah, but it was surgery.
*  Yeah, no, but that's what I'm talking about.
*  Surgical interventions are absolutely necessary for a large part of the population.
*  I had one quarter of one nostril that was open.
*  My right nostril is useless, like totally closed up.
*  I mean, when I would try to breathe, it would be like, nothing would go through.
*  That's bad news.
*  Yeah, I'd go to yoga class.
*  They'd go breathe through your nose.
*  My nose is useless.
*  And if you listen, like if someone hears me from like the fear factor days and you listen
*  to my voice, it's a different voice.
*  It's a more nasally voice.
*  It's because my nose is stuffed all the time.
*  I had to breathe out of my mouth.
*  Yep.
*  But for someone like you, now you know the benefits of nasal breathing, right?
*  And just the cardio benefits alone was crazy.
*  It's like I gained 10% cardio instantly.
*  Yeah, and I've heard this numerous times by so many people.
*  So what you're doing when you're breathing through the nose is you're slowing down that
*  breath.
*  You're taking in less breath, but you're using more of it.
*  So by breathing less, you're going to be able to lower your heart rate.
*  And we know this.
*  If anyone has a pulse oximeter at home, you would think that breathing six breaths a minute,
*  which is about a third of what's considered normal, you think there's no way I'm getting
*  enough oxygen.
*  Right.
*  That's impossible.
*  Put on a pulse ox and watch what happens.
*  And what I've found is your oxygen is either going to stay the same or sometimes go up.
*  We even got on stationary bikes on the Stanford experiment, and we were trying to see if we
*  could breathe six breaths a minute while going as hard as we could and watching what happened
*  to our oxygen.
*  And our oxygen did not go down.
*  Once we got to about three or four breaths per minute, it started going down.
*  As long as you have these huge breaths, right?
*  This huge circle, you're...
*  And you can work out that way.
*  And they found Dr. John Duyard did a bunch of studies of this in the 90s and found for
*  cyclists who were normally breathing 47 times a minute, they were able to breathe it 14
*  times a minute by nasal breathing.
*  So their endurance increased, their performance increased, and their recovery increased.
*  The instinct when you're exhausted is to...
*  So what you're saying is you have to fight that instinct and breathe through your nose
*  and you will recover just as well.
*  I'm saying you need to slowly acclimate your body to this.
*  That need to breathe is not dictated by oxygen.
*  And this is another thing that's really hard to get your head around.
*  It's dictated by carbon dioxide.
*  So if you were to hold your breath right now and you feel that need to breathe, that's
*  dictated by rising levels of CO2, not by oxygen.
*  That was another really fascinating aspect of your book.
*  The importance of carbon dioxide.
*  I had always thought of carbon dioxide as a waste product.
*  When you were talking about that, one researcher that was saying that carbon dioxide is probably
*  more important than oxygen for life, I was like, what is this?
*  That guy's from Yale too.
*  Yandel Henderson.
*  Check out his work.
*  It's rock solid.
*  But that's so counterintuitive, right?
*  To what a normal person believes to be true.
*  Yeah, and I wouldn't pick between oxygen and CO2.
*  You're going to lose either way.
*  But CO2 is not just a waste product.
*  No, you need a balance of these two things.
*  No one's focused on oxygen, which is why you see at an airport in Singapore an oxygen bar.
*  You see a linebacker on the side of the field huffing pure oxygen.
*  That oxygen for a healthy body is not doing anything.
*  You're exhaling it back out.
*  So when you go to a high altitude place and they give you oxygen, that's nonsense?
*  No, that's completely different.
*  High altitude, there's less oxygen.
*  You absolutely need it.
*  At sea level, for health, right now you probably have 97% O2 blood sats, right?
*  I probably do too.
*  If you think about that, huffing pure oxygen, it might bump you up one or two percent, but
*  that oxygen has nowhere to go if you don't have CO2 to offload it.
*  Those bars kind of disappeared, didn't they?
*  They used to have those in Vegas.
*  You put tubes up your nose and sit there like an idiot.
*  I remember doing that, trying to convince myself it was doing something.
*  The low lights are doing, the air conditioning is doing something.
*  The chaise lounge that you're sitting on is doing something.
*  Relaxing you.
*  Yeah, it's relaxing you.
*  But I was completely stumped by this.
*  I'm not talking about people with emphysema or at altitude.
*  I'm talking about healthy people at sea level or around sea level.
*  I kept asking pulmonologists, my father-in-law is a pulmonologist, so I asked him all of
*  these questions and he's just like, it's the biggest placebo effect in the world.
*  So I'm sorry if people are out there, oxygen bar owners, hearing me say this.
*  I don't know if they're there anymore.
*  When was the last time you saw an oxygen bar?
*  It's been a while, but who knows, maybe they're going to become a better stick.
*  Someone's investing money right now as we speak, listening to this podcast about the
*  sign on the dotted line.
*  What?
*  Wait a minute, that shit's not real?
*  Hold on.
*  I did see in a gift store though, a bottle of oxygen.
*  Like literally, you screw the cap off.
*  What?
*  Like a bottle where you screw the cap off?
*  A bottle of oxygen.
*  That's like a pet rock, right?
*  Those people are assholes.
*  I'd love to say they're laughing all the way to the bank.
*  I'm not sure about that.
*  I don't think they're making that much money, but whatever money they're making, they're
*  stealing.
*  Why don't we have this, why isn't it not generally acknowledged that carbon dioxide is very beneficial
*  to life?
*  I think CO2 has gotten this really bad rap.
*  We talk about CO2 increasing in the atmosphere, acidification of the ocean, global warming,
*  it's the stuff that comes off a rotting fruit.
*  But we're not looking, a pulmonologist is going to know the importance of a balance
*  of CO2.
*  People in that field absolutely know it.
*  So they've written, they've said, thank you for getting this out in the open because people
*  don't realize it.
*  You can go outside right now, see people jogging, gotta get more O2 in.
*  The fact is, not only is that not doing anything for them, it's actually making their breathing
*  worse and making it harder for them to offload oxygen, which is just something I don't think
*  a lot of people realize, like slower, deeper breaths can be so much more efficient, can
*  allow you to go further for longer.
*  That's really what you want.
*  So for athletes that are accustomed to having these really hard workouts, say like they're
*  doing interval training and they're sprinting and things along those lines, CrossFit-style
*  workouts and they're used to going, what they should do is train themselves to slowly take
*  in air from their nose.
*  And how would you recommend someone doing that?
*  There's some great therapists who can show you all the wonders of doing this.
*  And by practicing these breathing techniques, you're going to increase, they've shown that
*  you can increase red blood cells.
*  So it's just like altitude training and you can increase your VO2 max as well.
*  So I don't know what sort of exercise each person is doing and so you can't give a blanket
*  prescription to everyone.
*  So someone would have to be there and be, what's your heart rate?
*  Let's say running.
*  What if someone does like hill sprints or something along those lines?
*  What I've found is nasal breathing is the way to go.
*  You can see what Sania Richard Ross, who for 10 years was the top sprinter in the world,
*  obligatory nose breathing the whole time.
*  And to me, the pictures just say everything.
*  She's in these races, the people right next to her look like they're dying.
*  She has the most placid look on her face, mouth is shut, kicking everyone's butt across
*  the finish line.
*  So there's tons of research, there's tons of therapists that can work with people individually
*  because you just don't know how old is the person, what's their maximum heart rate, where
*  they're going.
*  But we do know that nasal breathing is a more efficient way of breathing and you're going
*  to be able to go further and perform better once that becomes a habit.
*  What's fascinating to me is the sport that I commentate on, mixed martial arts.
*  There's a giant issue with broken noses.
*  A large percentage of the fighters have deviated septums, smashed in noses, they're clogged
*  up and you see them breathing out of their mouth, particularly when they're tired.
*  You see like when a fighter has their nose broken and you see blood trickling out of
*  the nose, one of the first signs you see is they breathe out of their mouth.
*  And that seems like, well, obviously it's terrible to get punched in the nose, right?
*  You have this delicate instrument and you're using it as a target.
*  But for someone who does get punched in the nose for a living, what can they do if they
*  have this other than not do it?
*  I think do what you did, right?
*  So if you're talking about these extreme cases.
*  If I was fighting, I don't know if I would get it fixed.
*  Well, I guess I probably would anyway now that I know.
*  But a lot of guys don't because they think they're just going to get it broken again.
*  Well for those extreme cases, they're going to need surgical intervention.
*  If you can't breathe through your nose, you have to find a way.
*  So NIAC, the guy at Stanford told me, if your toilet is clogged, what are you going to do?
*  You're going to find a way of cleaning it out and getting that flowing again.
*  And when it clogs again, just fix it again.
*  That's one way of doing it.
*  Or you could make a permanent fix to it, right?
*  So that is always functioning.
*  If someone's used to getting punched in the nose every month and their nose is getting
*  broken again, that's going to be really hard to nasal breathe.
*  So I think that either they need to stop getting punched in the nose or they have to make some
*  other lifestyle choices.
*  If they want to continue doing that, they're going to have a hard time nasal breathing.
*  That just seems like simple physics.
*  But it's so crazy because it is one of the more difficult things to do athletically.
*  And athletically, it seems from your work and the work that you're citing that would
*  be of extreme benefit to learn how to breathe through your nose, but yet most of them can't.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is, I asked Patrick McEwen this, and he's like, when you're competing, you
*  do what you can to compete.
*  You do what you can to win, which is why if you see Michael Jordan, right before he dunks
*  on someone, he goes, takes this huge breath of air.
*  That one breath of air is not going to affect his endurance or his performance, right?
*  It's about habitual nasal breathing and breathing while you're training.
*  If someone has a bloody nose or something is stuffed up there, you have to breathe somehow,
*  right?
*  You're going to breathe through your mouth, especially for boxers.
*  It is interesting though, you look at any other animal in the wild, look at a horse
*  running, like at a full on sprint, it's never breathing.
*  Look at a cheetah, like hunting down some prey.
*  It's never breathing out of its mouth.
*  Horses are, when they start breathing out of their mouth, they're in deep trouble.
*  Right, and dogs just do it to cool themselves off.
*  Thermal regulation, that's right.
*  The carbon dioxide thing is a real trip.
*  When you're saying that this need to take a deep breath is really because your body
*  recognizes the level of carbon dioxide is very high.
*  What happens when you become accustomed to holding your breath?
*  Are there physiological changes that are taking place?
*  This is what Dr. Justin Feinstein is working on right now at the Laureate Institute of
*  Brain Research.
*  He has found that asthmatics and people with anxiety have this extremely low threshold
*  for CO2.
*  They need to keep breathing.
*  They're so paranoid that they're not going to be able to breathe that they've become
*  accustomed to.
*  And whenever that CO2 increases, they freak out.
*  So he has found by slowly acclimating them to have more of a, to be able to take more
*  CO2 and become more comfortable with it, that's how they can change their breathing.
*  That's how they can change their habits, which is exactly what those asthma techniques do.
*  Right?
*  You need to teach these people to breathe less and to breathe slowly, to slowly acclimate
*  themselves.
*  Like someone with asthma or panic, don't go and start holding your breath as long as you
*  can.
*  That's a bad idea.
*  Like let the body adjust.
*  Slowly.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was recently around someone having a panic attack and what she was saying is, I
*  can't breathe.
*  I'm having a hard time breathing.
*  Obviously she was breathing and she was talking, but she was like, I can't breathe.
*  What would you say to a person who's doing that?
*  Just try to get them to calm down, slowly breathe?
*  Like what would you, what would you say?
*  I would quote Dr. Alicia Moret at Southern Methodist University who said, the idea that
*  people should be breathing more when they have panic is exactly the opposite of what
*  they should be doing.
*  So they should be, what is happening is their CO2 levels are getting so low.
*  What they need to do is breathe more slowly or hold their breath.
*  Can you increase your tolerance for CO2 like this?
*  Is that like a physical thing or is it a mental thing?
*  Absolutely.
*  It's a physical thing.
*  There are chemoreceptors right around here, right?
*  And these are the things that gauge levels of CO2.
*  So if you think about a free diver, what allows them to hold their breath for four, five,
*  six, seven, eight minutes?
*  They've gotten this threshold of CO2 that's very high compared to me or you or anyone
*  else.
*  You think about someone who's able to summit Everest without oxygen, right?
*  They've got this threshold of CO2.
*  So much of fitness, not all of it, but a lot of it is dictated by the level of CO2 that
*  you can withstand, at least with surfing or with free diving or with alpine climbing.
*  So these receptors, you train them or they get stronger?
*  Is it like an endurance thing?
*  Like your cardiovascular endurance increases, your resting heart rate decreases?
*  Does that happen with these carbon dioxide receptors?
*  You can train them.
*  Yeah, you can acclimate them to accept a higher threshold of CO2 so that you become comfortable
*  with it.
*  So one of the hard things about training to free dive is those breath holds at the beginning.
*  You do these static breath holds, not in water, never in water, but on land.
*  You see how long you can hold your breath and they're miserable.
*  People maybe hold their breath maximum two minutes, but once you get used to it, you
*  can go four minutes or five minutes.
*  What is happening when you're getting used to it?
*  You are allowing those signals, those chemoreceptors are going off and sending messages to your
*  amygdala, which is the area in the brain that dictates fear.
*  And you're ignoring them or you're just accustomed to it?
*  You're getting accustomed to it.
*  You are becoming more comfortable with it.
*  When I've heard of freedivers diving seven minutes and holding their breath for that
*  time and they're doing it underwater, and then I try to hold my breath, I'm like, what's
*  wrong with me?
*  Do I have a weak mind?
*  Why am I giving in?
*  What is that thing?
*  So what he's doing, he's found that he's been trying to train people in mindfulness and
*  trying to train these people in breathing practices, but it's really hard because he
*  can't be with them 24 hours a day.
*  So what he's now experimenting with, and he's got an NIH grant to do this, is instead of
*  having them practice these mini breath holds throughout the day, he's having them come
*  a huge inhale of CO2 because his hypothesis is that that can help reset the tolerance
*  of those chemoreceptors.
*  Fascinating.
*  It's a little shortcut.
*  Yeah, it's a little because it's the modern age.
*  No one wants to actually put in the work, right?
*  No one wants to be Swami Rama.
*  I think a lot of people want to be Swami Rama, just no one wants the 30 years in a cave.
*  And what is his results of these people taking in the burst of CO2?
*  It is too soon to say he's going to be publishing everything next year or the year after that.
*  He's in the middle of it right now, but the premise of it makes perfect sense to me.
*  And this is why it describes and explains why so many of these slow breathing-less practices
*  are so effective for anxiety, why they're so effective for asthma as well.
*  Now are there specific coaches that work with people that have anxiety and use these anxiety
*  breath coaches?
*  Yeah, Dr. Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg, a psychiatrist in New York, I believe he's
*  at Columbia, they've developed this whole program and most of it revolves, it's so simple
*  that people think, oh, there's no way this can work for me until they try it.
*  So they bring in patients, have them start with this six seconds in, six seconds out.
*  That's it.
*  You'd be surprised how few people actually have breathed that way in the past year or
*  five years or ten years.
*  They've found that this method of breathing was effective for 9-11 survivors who had this
*  awful condition called ground glass lungs.
*  They had a bunch of gunk in there.
*  There was no therapy to get rid of it, but this breathing pattern was able to do what
*  no other therapy could do just by breathing.
*  What happened to the people that had this ground glass stuff?
*  Their lungs were filled with garbage and they were constantly exhaling this gunk, right?
*  And so by breathing slowly and by helping the lungs to open up and helping with that
*  gas exchange with CO2 and O2, they were able to help them recover so much more effectively.
*  And they've written books on this stuff, so they're a great place to start.
*  If you want the how, they're legit too.
*  They're leaders in their field.
*  And so this breathing in and breathing out cleared their lungs or just made them feel
*  better?
*  It had a significant benefit in clearing their lungs.
*  And it makes them feel better.
*  And that's the thing.
*  There's no side effects to doing this stuff.
*  If at the end of it you're like, I still have asthma, I still have anxiety.
*  It's not going to hurt you.
*  The minimum is you're going to feel better.
*  That's not too bad, considering all the other side effects to so many other therapies.
*  It's obviously, yeah, it's not a drug.
*  What do you do?
*  What do I do for breathing?
*  Yeah.
*  People think that since I spent so many years writing a book about breathing, I'm going
*  to be the best breather in the world.
*  I'm not.
*  I've got a long, long way to go.
*  My job as a journalist was to go out and report on this stuff and then as objectively as I
*  could.
*  And along the way, I met people who had absolutely transformed their lives.
*  So you can't help getting a little emotionally caught up in this practice and in these stories.
*  And I learned a few tricks along the way.
*  I noticed what a poor breather I was.
*  I used to, at night, sleep with my mouth open for decades.
*  I thought this was normal to go to sleep with 22 ounces of water by the bed, wake up every
*  few hours, dunk some water.
*  It's completely not normal at all.
*  So you recommend sleeping with, like, do you use mouth tape?
*  Absolutely, yeah.
*  You tape your mouth up every night?
*  Yeah.
*  I thought this sounded pretty sketchy until I heard about it from the, you know, Doctor
*  of Speech Language Therapy at Stanford until I heard about it from Dr. Mark Berheni.
*  So what they found, and Berheni's been using this stuff for decades, this is not a fat
*  piece of duct tape.
*  Don't go on YouTube and see what people, nine pieces of tape down.
*  No, you need a piece of tape that has a really light and easy adhesive about the size of
*  a stamp.
*  You put it in the middle of your lips.
*  You do that even with your beard mustache?
*  Absolutely.
*  It's on your lips.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So it just keeps your lips closed.
*  So many people are like, how dare you write about this?
*  I'm offended.
*  Meanwhile, a quarter of the population is sleep apnea.
*  Half the population is snow.
*  I have sleep apnea.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm offended I use a mouthpiece.
*  I use a mouthpiece that presses my tongue down to keep my airway open.
*  As long as you have that airway open, that is key, especially at night because sleep
*  apnea has so many chronic problems associated with that downstream from hypertension, metabolic
*  issues.
*  But do you think I would still have sleep apnea if I used this tape and closed my mouth?
*  There's only one way to find out.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not here to prescribe anything.
*  But this tape is free.
*  You can do it.
*  I'm sure you have some sensors to monitor your sleep.
*  Do you have a pulse ox?
*  No.
*  I just go to sleep with this mouthpiece on.
*  I'm fine.
*  That would be a good thing to test it.
*  It seems like a lot of work.
*  But let me ask you this.
*  My sleep apnea occurs because I have a fat tongue and a thick neck.
*  A lot of wrestlers get this.
*  That's basically probably where I got it from Jiu Jitsu.
*  But I can breathe out of my nose.
*  Do you think that sleep apnea would still occur if I breathe out of my nose?
*  Primarily?
*  Or only?
*  It can because sleep apnea is caused by your tongue falling back.
*  So my tongue could fall back against that hole anyway.
*  It's less apt to with nasal breathing because nasal breathing is going to tone your airways
*  more.
*  I know from the Stanford experiment that I went from opening my mouth the whole time,
*  so 10 days I could not breathe through my nose.
*  Within two days I was snoring.
*  Had not been snoring.
*  Within about four days I was snoring.
*  Half the night I got sleep apnea.
*  The other subject in the study had the exact same thing happen to him, even worse than
*  me.
*  The day we took that stuff out and we taped our mouths and were nasal breathing, snoring
*  went away.
*  Sleep apnea went away.
*  My blood pressure dropped about 10 to 15 points.
*  So it's something that people can test as well.
*  You can test the quality of your sleep and it's not asking too much.
*  Once I learned that this did not require a fat piece of tape, that the point wasn't to
*  hermetically seal your mouth shut, which sounds a little scary to a lot of people and it should
*  be, it's just to train the jaw shut at night so you don't go.
*  I saw there's a device, not a device, like a neoprene strap that goes under your chin
*  and wraps around your head and keeps your jaw shut.
*  Is that dumb?
*  There's all kinds of stuff.
*  I'm not going to say it's, I haven't tried it.
*  I don't know.
*  I think maybe some people get some benefit from it and that's great.
*  I do know that tape is almost free and I've seen some incredible results myself, subjectively,
*  but they're also doing some studies.
*  If you look at Burheni's work that he's done for the past few decades, it's a quick and
*  easy fix that can work for a lot of people.
*  This is something that you use every night?
*  I use it every night.
*  When I don't, guess what happens?
*  Yeah, mouth cups open and you start snoring.
*  I wish that I didn't have to.
*  I would figure at this time that it would become habit, but I'm not one of those people
*  who have that really strong jaw that stays shut.
*  My mouth just opens and the difference in quality of sleep from doing this has been
*  profound.
*  I'm glad you brought that up because that was something else I wanted to talk to you
*  about.
*  You were talking about the changes in human diet and eating soft foods and how it affects
*  the way the jaw develops and the size of the jaw and that there's a way to improve
*  that, which I found fascinating.
*  Yeah, and this was something when you set out to write a book about breathing, the last
*  thing you think you're going to be doing is handing around a bunch of ancient skulls
*  and looking at teeth, but that's where this journey led me.
*  I had heard from some biological anthropologist that our faces have changed and that our mouths
*  have gotten too small and that was one of the reasons so many of us were breathing so
*  poorly and so I thought, well, this sounds interesting.
*  These people are legit.
*  I want to check it out.
*  And if you take an ancient skull, anything older than 500 years old, 5,000 years old,
*  50,000 years old, you're going to see by and large about 99% chance these skulls are going
*  to have perfectly straight teeth.
*  They never had their wisdom teeth removed.
*  They never had braces, any orthodontia, anything.
*  They had straight teeth because they had these very wide and large mouths and these powerful
*  jaws.
*  If you start getting into the modern era of industrialized food, mouths start shrinking.
*  So why do we have crooked teeth?
*  Not from genetics.
*  It's because our mouths have grown so small that the teeth have nowhere to go.
*  So they grow crooked.
*  And what else happens when you have a mouth that's too small for its teeth?
*  You have a smaller airway.
*  This is one of the reasons why so many people have snoring, sleep apnea, and other respiratory
*  problems.
*  This sounded so bizarre because it's nothing I'd ever learned in school.
*  But all anyone needs to do is look up some ancient skulls if you're online and check
*  out their teeth and check out how they have these huge jaws, these big, flat, wide faces,
*  powerful faces.
*  And they all had this.
*  And then you go into the wild, 5,400 different mammals and check out and see how many have
*  crooked teeth.
*  The answer is zero.
*  So some bulldogs do because they've been bred to have this flat face just like humans.
*  But animals in the wild have straight teeth.
*  And we did too.
*  As a species, we have straight teeth.
*  But because of industrialization, specifically because of food, our mouths have grown too
*  small.
*  You would never believe that.
*  If someone told me that, other than reading your book and kind of understanding where
*  you're coming from, I would think this is nonsense.
*  It's genetics.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like why people have small hands or people have big feet or whatever.
*  Well, it's become a heritable trait.
*  So what's happened now is they've found the researchers who've done this, Robert Corcini
*  worked on this stuff for 30 years, his 250 scientific papers on it.
*  They found within the first generation of switching to industrialized foods, about 50%
*  of the population is going to have malocclusion, which means a crooked jaw, crooked teeth.
*  After that, about 60 to 70%, next generation.
*  After that, about 80%.
*  After that, look around.
*  That's us now, about 90%.
*  Jesus.
*  So if, sorry.
*  No.
*  I was going to bump you out a little more.
*  So Dr. Kevin Boyd is now doing studies where he's looking at fetuses in the womb and is
*  seeing their mouth size is too small and they have this backward slant to their faces, just
*  like I have, just like so many people in the population have.
*  If you were to measure a skull and you were to draw one line from its ear to its nose
*  and another line perpendicular to that, almost every single ancient skull would be above
*  that line.
*  Very powerful jaw.
*  Now 90% of modern skulls are below it.
*  So they are behind it.
*  So and this is happening now, it is becoming a heritable trait.
*  So kids are messed up to begin with, which is why so many kids are, have sleep apnea
*  and snore now, which is so injurious to their health.
*  And this came about because they weren't chewing tougher food, they didn't need the muscles.
*  And what can be done to sort of reverse that or mitigate that?
*  In adulthood it's harder and for kids it's much easier because their muscles and their
*  bones are much more malleable.
*  But that's exactly what they found is once you introduce, we used to chew for about four
*  hours a day.
*  That's just how it was from the dawn of time to about 500 years ago.
*  But as wheat started getting processed into white flour, as rice became, we started taking
*  the germ and the bran away from rice, so it's just the polished seed, as things began to
*  get canned and bottled.
*  If you think about even what's considered healthy food right now, smoothies, avocado,
*  oatmeal, all this stuff is soft.
*  Mush.
*  Power bars.
*  Right.
*  In adulthood, you can make some changes and that's what I tried to do in my own face as
*  an experiment.
*  For kids, what they're finding is these problems need to be diagnosed very early and they need
*  to be treated.
*  And what they do is they widen the mouth to the way that they were supposed to be 500
*  years ago.
*  So we're changing our bodies by force of will to the way that nature had made them before
*  we messed them up.
*  There was a doctor that you were talking about that developed some sort of a retainer that
*  actually changed the volume of your jaw as an adult and changed the volume of your mouth.
*  That's right.
*  So I had crooked teeth growing up.
*  I had braces.
*  I had extractions.
*  I had gear.
*  And me and everyone I knew had the same thing.
*  It was never if you were going to get it.
*  It's just when are you going to get your braces?
*  So the point of all those things was to straighten teeth, but they're not looking at airway health.
*  So what happens just as a principle, you've got a mouth that's too small for its face,
*  the teeth are growing and crooked.
*  You extract teeth from that, get some head gear and go.
*  You're creating at least there's a significant argument by many people in the field that
*  say you're making a small mouth smaller.
*  And one leader in the field, Dr. Michael Gelb, has said 50% of people who have orthodontics
*  are going to have more breathing problems because of it.
*  Orthodontics meaning braces as well?
*  Braces are craning in.
*  So it's a combination of braces and especially head gear and some of that stuff is being
*  phased out.
*  Braces are still you're forcing teeth into a smaller space to make them straight.
*  So there's this, the very first orthodontics weren't craning teeth in to make them straight.
*  They would expand the mouth because even back then, 120 years ago, they knew our mouths
*  were growing too small.
*  They knew that.
*  So the first devices, I thought this was fascinating.
*  They were using this for kids who had cleft palates and all of these other problems where
*  they were having problems chewing and breathing.
*  So they would expand their mouths with this device that went to the roof of your mouth
*  and it had a little dowel screw and you slowly opened it up to expand the mouth.
*  What does it feel like?
*  It doesn't feel great.
*  So this is where I think a lot of orthodontics is heading because it allows you to have straighter
*  teeth but it also opens your airway.
*  How long do you keep it in your mouth like braces all day long?
*  No, no.
*  The one that I used was called a homeoblock and this guy had been using it for 30 years
*  and I used it at night.
*  So you put it on the palate, upper palate and you slowly, you have this little screw thing,
*  this little handle that every couple weeks you open it a little more, just slowly.
*  There it is.
*  Jamie's got a picture of it.
*  All right.
*  So if you feel...
*  So you used one of those?
*  Yeah, I did.
*  It's not as gnarly as that.
*  This looks intense.
*  But if you feel your head right now, you feel these sutures, right?
*  These cracks in your head, you have one of those on your upper palate.
*  So that can open, okay?
*  That's what it's made to do.
*  It can open and you can widen your mouth in adulthood and I showed this through CAT scans
*  and by that you can open your airway and you can breathe better.
*  And how long did you wear it for?
*  I wore it for one year.
*  One year to the week I took the other CAT scan.
*  And you gained how much volume in your mouth?
*  I gained about five pennies worth of bone in my face, which is crazy.
*  Five pennies.
*  So stack them up.
*  Yeah.
*  Five pennies.
*  Yeah, so...
*  That's a lot of bone, man.
*  So we've been told that we can't grow bone past 30, right?
*  It's just entropy.
*  We're only going to be losing.
*  We can stop it from disappearing.
*  We can do some things to help prevent that loss, but we can't build it.
*  But we can.
*  We can build it in the center of our face, in the maxilla.
*  So you can really change the structure of your face from doing...
*  You can widen your face?
*  You can add more bone.
*  You can model more bone inside of your face.
*  Do you look better?
*  While you're...
*  Can't you tell?
*  You're a good looking man.
*  But I mean, do you think you look better?
*  I will not say better.
*  I won't use those.
*  Different?
*  Worse, worse.
*  People be forewarned.
*  Don't build bone in your...
*  No.
*  I did notice after about six weeks of wearing this thing, people were like, dude, what happened?
*  What are you doing?
*  They could see a shift?
*  Absolutely.
*  And it's very apparent.
*  And you can see a bunch of case studies on this, and you can see it for yourself.
*  And the neat thing is it's not subjective.
*  It's not, well, I think I look different.
*  There's CAT scans, and there's metrics to it.
*  So it also opened my airways.
*  It allowed me to expand.
*  I don't know how much.
*  It's probably maybe 15%, 20%, but it was mostly the toning of the airway.
*  Why did you stop using it after a year?
*  I'm still using it.
*  You are?
*  So for the book, for the research, I said, I'm going to do this for one year, and I'm
*  going to wear it every night.
*  I'm really going to be dedicated.
*  Even after having a few beers, I was like, the last thing I want to do is put this thing
*  in my mouth and go to sleep.
*  But I did it because I was curious, because I had heard these stories.
*  I'd seen the case studies.
*  I'd see the data, but I wanted to see what would happen in my own body.
*  And I tell you, on a subjective level, I breathe more easily now than I could ever remember
*  breathing.
*  I haven't had pneumonia, bronchitis, any of those problems.
*  But there's a bunch of factors, though, too, right?
*  There's the nose breathing.
*  There's the breath work.
*  So it's a combination of all these things.
*  Yeah, but nose breathing wouldn't help you build more bone in your face.
*  So a lot of that was due to this device not only spread open, that suture in the upper
*  palate, but also stimulated chewing stress.
*  So on one side, there was this little bump.
*  So every time you closed your mouth, you got some chewing stress, which would stimulate
*  stem cells, which would go into those sutures and build more bone.
*  The difference is, when you clench your jaws right now, just like you're boxing, you're
*  clenching your jaws, that does not stimulate that good, beneficial chewing stress, okay?
*  Because our bodies identify that as sympathetic stress.
*  So cortisol levels go up, right?
*  That means growth isn't going to happen.
*  But if you think about eating a big piece of steak or a carrot, you're not chewing on
*  both sides of your molars.
*  You're chewing on one side or the other.
*  So when you stimulate the stress on one side or the other, next time you're chewing on
*  something, think about that.
*  That's why you salivate and you become more relaxed, and that's when that growth can happen.
*  So chewing on one side or the other stimulates stem cells that don't get stimulated if you're
*  just biting down on a mouthpiece.
*  Because of cortisol and osteoplasts, yeah.
*  Now how often do you have this thing in your mouth now?
*  I took a break after a year to see what life was like on the other side of that.
*  How was it?
*  Was it nice?
*  But I got curious.
*  I talked to the guy who gave me this device, Dr. Ted Belfort, and he's used this thing
*  for 30 years.
*  And his case studies are pretty fascinating.
*  And I talked to him.
*  He's like, oh, we should do another CAT scan, see what happened.
*  I didn't quite admit to him that I had stopped using it.
*  So I felt a little guilty.
*  And now for the past about month and a half, I've been back on the train to see what happened.
*  So we're going to take another one just for kicks.
*  I'm not going to write about it.
*  The book's already done.
*  But I'm curious to see what will happen if you keep wearing this, if you can really keep
*  improving.
*  If you're the Swami Rama of orthodontics, if you could hold that bad boy in your mouth
*  for a few years, I mean, that'd be really fascinating if you change your face and all
*  of a sudden you have like this big Clark Kent Superman type jaw.
*  Can you let me shack up here for a couple years?
*  I'm just going to focus on this all day.
*  Just stay in the sauna too.
*  Do what you got to do.
*  So where would one get one of these things?
*  There's many different devices.
*  So the one I use was the homeoblock.
*  Ted Belfort can set you up with that.
*  Would you have to go to a doctor to get measured?
*  Yeah, you have to go to a dentist or an orthodontist would set you up with this.
*  But there's many different ones that do the same thing.
*  What a lot of people do instead of having this thing in your mouth for a year, they
*  go in and the sounds gnarly.
*  Certainly it's not as gnarly as it sounds, but they go in and drill in this thing and
*  open it up that way.
*  But people who have done this and they're using this especially for kids and they're
*  using this for teenagers, repeatedly their allergies go away.
*  They can breathe better.
*  They look totally different because they're expanding because growth is centered around
*  this right here.
*  So where are they drilling in?
*  The upper palate.
*  They're drilling to the upper palate and they put a device in there?
*  So it's permanent so you can't get it out.
*  Until they take it out.
*  But it's much quicker.
*  This expansion happened quickly over the course of a couple of months.
*  So you keep it in your mouth for a couple of months.
*  And your teeth start widening out and then they fix it.
*  So Mariana Evans is an expert at this.
*  Dr. William Hang who's right around here, he's been doing this for 30 years.
*  Very respected and he knows this stuff better than anyone.
*  And what do they do for your lower jaw?
*  Nothing.
*  It's all about this upper palate.
*  What if you have crooked teeth on your lower jaw?
*  They could use braces or something.
*  But it's all about the upper palate.
*  And there are some devices you'd have to ask Hang.
*  They've got all the gizmos to do.
*  The reason, I thought this was so interesting that this was how orthodontists, this is how
*  teeth were straightened, right?
*  A hundred years ago.
*  And then by the 40s they found a way of making dentistry more of a production line where
*  one size fits all.
*  We're getting yank teeth, braces on, done, done, done.
*  But this expansion takes a lot of expertise and a lot of focus.
*  But what I'm seeing now within that industry, there's this huge moment of change where they've
*  So many people have realized that some of these processes might have caused breathing
*  problems.
*  And so they're reassessing how they've been doing things.
*  And one orthodontist told me, he's like, we're going to look back in 10 years and be horrified
*  by what we've done to our breathing.
*  It's so interesting to me that breathing and breath work and knowing how to breathe properly
*  It's not common knowledge, but it's so critical to health and it's free.
*  We're not talking about something that requires devices or a long learning curve or just some
*  of these benefits.
*  So many of them, and especially the most simple ones, right?
*  Anyone can breathe in six seconds in, six seconds out.
*  If you want to really go up to the next stage and figure out what breathing can really do
*  for you on a bigger and more powerful level, you can do TUMO, you can do Wim Hof, you can
*  do Holotropic, you can do CREAS, you can do Pranayamas.
*  They're all doing the same thing.
*  And Holotropic, I haven't done it, but it makes you trip, right?
*  It's an interesting experience.
*  What was it like for you?
*  I know a lot of people have found profound benefits from this.
*  They used it in a hospital.
*  Eleven thousand people were put through this thing and they showed it was more effective
*  than any other therapy.
*  Me personally, the science is much more thin in Holotropic breathwork.
*  And what I had been told by the instructors kind of threw me off where they're like, they
*  sit you in a room and they blast music and for three hours you breathe as hard as you
*  can.
*  And they told me that you're going to be able to enter into this space because so much oxygen
*  is getting into your body.
*  The opposite is happening.
*  You're inhibiting blood flow to your brain.
*  And so your brain is processing that as a threat.
*  And sometimes you inhibit so much blood flow that perhaps your brain is interpreting this
*  as though you are dying, which is why so many people have this reaction where they said,
*  I am reborn after Holotropic.
*  And that's awesome.
*  I don't want to take that away from anyone.
*  But what I've seen is that there's been a ton of subjective anecdotal studies, not a
*  ton, a few of them, but the actual science behind it, no one's gone into an fMRI and
*  looked at what's really happening.
*  And that's something I really want to do and hopefully I'm going to be doing in the next
*  few months just for curiosity.
*  That makes sense if people are having psychedelic experiences because many psychedelic experiences
*  are tied to near-death experiences.
*  A lot of people that have near-death experiences, they report these moments that mimic what
*  a lot of people have experienced on psychedelics.
*  So what they're doing through this Holotropic breathing, they're not harming themselves,
*  right?
*  Or do we not know?
*  Not that I know of.
*  The doctor who put 11,000 people in said nobody had any problems.
*  There were no side effects.
*  So I've heard that some people can freak out.
*  I heard that there's possible bowel issues involved and some real meltdowns.
*  In the class that I took, I wasn't sure how much was psychosomatic and how much was actually
*  because of the breathing.
*  I had a pretty strange experience where a guy turned into a wolf for a while.
*  Whoa.
*  A wolf?
*  Like a real wolf?
*  Went humping around the room.
*  Oh, so a guy, not to you.
*  I wish if it were a real wolf, that would have been incredible.
*  But he thought he was a wolf.
*  He inhabited the body of a wolf.
*  Maybe he was just an asshole.
*  That's possible too and just acted out.
*  Or maybe he really became a wolf.
*  We will never know, which is why this stuff should be studied.
*  There's a lot of talk that breathing this way will trigger endogenous DMT, and that's
*  the reason people trip out so hard.
*  I tried to do a study in which I would breathe this way and they would take blood before
*  and after, but the scientists that I was talking to said it would be such a small amount they
*  wouldn't be able to detect it.
*  There's a lot of gray area, which to me is not a bad thing.
*  It's great.
*  There's still mysteries to breath.
*  There's mysteries to the human body.
*  If people are finding great benefit from this and there's no side effect, then that's great.
*  I just found it was a little thinner than the other techniques like Wim Hof method or
*  like Priya.
*  This guy that had this experience and he turned into a wolf, did you talk to him before?
*  Awesome guy.
*  Super solid dude.
*  He was a lawyer working in San Francisco and left and went to live off the grid in a cabin
*  in Mendocino, which is completely legit and admirable.
*  He was a groovy dude and afterwards really warm, welcoming guy.
*  I don't want to take away any process that he went through.
*  He said it was very cleansing for himself and I think that that's great.
*  You're a very nice guy.
*  I wish I was there.
*  Who am I to rip on it, right?
*  I understand.
*  I understand.
*  Yeah, I'm just saying you're a very nice guy with your disclaimer.
*  I'd like to talk to him.
*  You know where we can find him.
*  He's out in the tundra right now.
*  You got to go hunt him down.
*  Is he?
*  No, I have no idea.
*  Maybe he's got a caribou in his mouth.
*  So this guy ran around.
*  Did he have clothes on when he did this?
*  Yeah, he was scratching his crotch a little bit and growling and it got interesting.
*  Everyone saw it.
*  And again, he was going through his process.
*  That was cool.
*  But the whole time I was watching him breathing and he wasn't really breathing any differently
*  than me.
*  What you have to do is you have half the class are the sitters for the people who are breathing
*  and you watch over these people in case they have problems.
*  So I was a sitter during this process.
*  I was not breathing.
*  I was looking at his respiration.
*  Really didn't look any different.
*  So I'm wondering how much of this is the set and setting of this.
*  You're in Mendocino.
*  You're in the hot springs.
*  There's really loud music, fake lutes.
*  What kind of music is this?
*  You know, that's something I wish they could have worked on a little bit.
*  Death metal?
*  I wish.
*  But it was a lot of like fake keyboard lutes and cymbals, the fake tinny cymbal crashes.
*  The Mac Am Hall.
*  That's the kind of music they're playing?
*  That would seem like, you know, when you talk about set and setting, that would seem to
*  be like a terrible set and setting.
*  Well, a lot of people enjoyed that music and good for them.
*  It would be interesting to mix it up with three hours of death metal and just see where
*  that would take you.
*  Or Zeppelin.
*  Something good.
*  Zeppelin, that would be fine.
*  So when you did it, so you were a sitter, but then you also did it, right?
*  And when you did it, what did you experience?
*  Well, it definitely affects you because you're breathing in a certain way.
*  It's going to affect your physiology.
*  So I got really cold.
*  I got really hot.
*  I got really spacey.
*  I felt like I was kind of dreaming for a while.
*  Three hours is a long time to breathe as hard as you possibly can.
*  But the shifts in temperature and in circulation, because the body is trying to compensate,
*  right?
*  So the more you're breathing, your pH is going to be going down.
*  So you're becoming more alkaline.
*  So your body doesn't like that.
*  It really wants the pH because all the cellular functions happen at a certain pH, some point
*  four.
*  To me, it was fascinating to feel my body fighting against this and constantly trying
*  to balance itself throughout the whole thing.
*  But it's definitely spacey.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  When you say spacey, what do you mean?
*  You are extremely lightheaded.
*  You feel very high.
*  I was talking to Ben Greenfield about it, and he said it was the most profound spiritual
*  experience he's ever had just by breathing.
*  And a lot of people say the same thing.
*  Those subjective experiences are cool, but I think it would be a lot more interesting
*  to find out what happens to everybody, not just one person when they do this, and to
*  look at the brain and to look at the body and really analyze that to see if there's
*  some physiological reaction.
*  We know what's happening with blood flow to the brain.
*  We know what happens to the brain when it's denied blood flow to certain areas.
*  But how does that affect us psychologically afterwards?
*  How does that affect us physically?
*  I think these are good questions, and it'll be interesting to find out.
*  How long did it take you to feel like you recovered from that experience?
*  Pretty quickly.
*  I went outside afterwards and drank a beer in my car and just sort of re-centered.
*  But it was mostly just the feeling of extreme lightheadedness, dreaminess, and then everything
*  just sort of boils back down, and you're back in Mendocino at the hot tubs.
*  When they sell you on this, when they have a class for holotropic breathing, what are
*  they saying it's going to do?
*  They can't claim any medical benefits because the FDA would come after them, but they say
*  it is a spiritual journey, and for many people it is.
*  I think that's a wonderful thing that they're getting benefit from this.
*  They use this fuzzy language like that because they can't say it's going to help with your
*  asthma.
*  But what's interesting is there are other methods like CREA, Sudarshan CREA, 60 independent
*  studies, and it's so similar to holotropic.
*  The difference is you don't breathe super hard for three hours.
*  You breathe extremely intensely for about five minutes, then slow it down.
*  But let me ask you about holotropic breathing first before CREA.
*  So holotropic breathing, what is the actual technique?
*  How do you do it?
*  You breathe as hard and as fast as you are able to breathe.
*  So you're not taking big deep breaths?
*  Whatever you want to do.
*  Whatever you want to do.
*  It's hard.
*  So you can go like, you can do that.
*  And you're breathing through the nose, through the mouth.
*  Whatever you want to do.
*  They say through the mouth is going to allow you to get more air in.
*  Is that real?
*  This was, yeah, yeah, you'll get more air in.
*  Larger volume.
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
*  And this was created in the 70s by Stanislav Grof, who was a psychiatrist, who was one
*  of the first test subjects of LSD.
*  And he started using LSD at Johns Hopkins and in other universities and found it had
*  this profound effect for people with schizophrenia and other serious problems.
*  It got banned in what, 68?
*  And so he wanted to find a way to allow people to have these experiences without the drug.
*  And so he developed this specifically to mimic the effects of LSD.
*  And he's written 12 books on this stuff.
*  Some of the science, mostly the psychology of what's happening with it.
*  I wish that there was some more hard science to it.
*  There's not yet, but hopefully that's forthcoming.
*  And that number, three hours, is that consistent?
*  It's interesting.
*  When I did this, and this was several years ago, it was three hours.
*  So you had to go three hours.
*  Now they're doing, I guess that was too hard for a lot of people.
*  They're doing these hour sessions, which is news to me.
*  Again, everybody wants to be Swami Rama.
*  Nobody wants to live in a cave for 30 years.
*  Three hours is America, man.
*  That's too much time, bro.
*  But if you're going to go into that zone, I think you want the full pie, not just the
*  peas.
*  Yeah, I would imagine.
*  But I guess it's pretty hard for people to do that for that long.
*  I've had some friends who've done the holotropic breathing, one of the reasons why I asked you
*  These friends are pretty hardcore psychedelic experimenters, and they found it very profound.
*  They said that they could achieve states that are very similar to psychedelic experiences.
*  You hear that all the time.
*  But you didn't find that?
*  I found it very lightly.
*  I did not go into the spectral universe.
*  And you have done that before?
*  Have you had psychedelic experiences before?
*  I went to college, but I did not dabble too deeply.
*  All these disclaimers.
*  My mom's.
*  Oh, I understand.
*  Okay.
*  You can wink.
*  Okay, I got it.
*  Now CREA, what is the difference in CREA?
*  So CREA is a breathing technique that is very similar to holotropic breathwork.
*  But the difference is it's much more controlled.
*  So you're having these bursts of heavy breathing, but then you have these bursts of very slow
*  breathing.
*  And this was developed in the 80s, and they started opening up to studies.
*  And just as I had mentioned, there's been 60 independent studies showing how effective
*  this stuff is that have been done at Harvard, that have been done at legitimate institutions,
*  some autoimmune diseases, for anxiety, for depression, for other issues.
*  And what I think is interesting is, so you've got Wim Hof's breathing, which is very effective
*  for some autoimmune issues, for some asthma, for anxiety.
*  You've got CREA, which is doing the same thing.
*  So what I found on the book is people have been coming at this stuff from different directions,
*  but they're coming to the same conclusions about these breathing methods.
*  And these very hard and heavy breathing methods, people think, why do I want to stress myself
*  out?
*  So I'm stressed out enough with work, with my kids, whatever.
*  When I breathe, I want to chill out.
*  But that's exactly what these very powerful breathing methods do, is they focus that stress
*  in the one 20-minute time period so that the rest of the time you can actually go to sleep,
*  so you can actually be rested and relaxed.
*  And that's what Wim Hof's version of TUMO does, and that's what CREA does at all.
*  Also it stimulates that sympathetic stress.
*  You're completely really going for it.
*  You turn it on specifically so you can turn it off.
*  So what is the rhythm in terms of like hard breathing versus slow breathing?
*  What is?
*  In CREA, it is a lot of slow breathing at the beginning.
*  And then there's a medium breathing phase.
*  When you say slow breathing, how much time are the breaths?
*  I have not counted.
*  I've been following an instructor, but it's usually, I'm thinking of because this guy,
*  Ravi Shankar is the one who dictates this thing.
*  So it's only, he's the only guy who does it, and it comes so he sends out these cassette
*  tapes.
*  It's so quaint, or CDs.
*  People play these.
*  So the slower ones are about...
*  So two, three seconds?
*  Yeah, about that.
*  And then after that are medium.
*  And then you go for it as hard and as fast as you can.
*  Is there any literature on how they arrived at that specific rhythm?
*  He had been studying.
*  He's another guy who spent his lifetime in meditation and in yoga and went on his spiritual
*  enlightenment quest and came out of it with, this is a breathing technique that I want
*  to help share with people.
*  All of that sounds really fuzzy, right?
*  Until you start studying it, until you start doing studies to see how people have benefited
*  from this.
*  And that's what I think is so important.
*  No matter how granola it sounds, if you can measure it, you can study it.
*  If you can study it, you can find whether or not it works.
*  And it certainly has worked for so many people.
*  And these studies, what have they shown in terms of the benefits?
*  What was the duration that the people were doing it for?
*  So even after a few weeks of doing this, this isn't the only...
*  So there's four different tangents of this breathing, and they say that you can only
*  really learn it in one of their schools.
*  So there's this very soft breathing where you put your hands like this, then you put
*  your hands like this underneath your armpits, then you put your hands like this, and you
*  breathe in to a count of four.
*  What is the purpose of the...
*  I think it's to open up the lungs.
*  To create flexibility.
*  So it starts with that.
*  There's the obligatory ohms, which everyone's doing nowadays.
*  And then there's that really intense, that cleansing breath at the end, which to me is
*  by far the most potent.
*  So there's almost like a warm up.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So you're getting the...
*  And what's the duration of their practice?
*  The slower breathing where you have your hands on your hips will probably go on for about...
*  Again, I haven't timed this because I've been in a class, but probably seven minutes, seven
*  or eight minutes.
*  Ohms, you do three ohms, that's a couple minutes.
*  But that long cleansing breath is about 40 minutes long.
*  So the whole thing you've done in an hour.
*  Yeah.
*  And how many times have you done this?
*  I've probably done it hundreds of times.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  And do you get the same sort of trippy feeling that you got with holotropic breathing?
*  The body is different every day.
*  So it depends where your mind is, depends on where your body is.
*  But every single time, I feel very different at the end.
*  I feel much better, clear headed.
*  I'm able to sleep a lot better.
*  So I've done this in the class dozens and dozens of times.
*  They had a YouTube video of this practice that I...
*  Now it's offline.
*  So I downloaded that and I'm able to follow along with that.
*  So what are you doing currently?
*  We kind of barely touched on it, but what is your daily routine?
*  Do you have a daily routine?
*  My daily routine for the last couple of months has been awful because I've just been on book
*  tour, virtual book tour.
*  And when you notice something when you talk for four or five hours a day, what am I doing
*  breathing through my mouth over and over?
*  I think that's one of the reasons it's exhausting, mentally exhausting, physically exhausting.
*  But one thing I try to do is I set up a little timer.
*  There's a zillion different apps you can do to focus on those six seconds in, six seconds
*  out breaths.
*  Because I noticed the first thing that I do in the morning, I sit down on my computer,
*  look at 40 different emails, I stop breathing.
*  And I know this because I put on a pulse ox and watch my O2 just go straight down.
*  They say that up to 80% of office workers have this.
*  It's called email apnea and they've studied it.
*  Some researchers at the NIH.
*  Email apnea.
*  Yeah.
*  If you think about it, next time you sit down at a computer, you've got your Twitter on,
*  you've got your phone open, you just lose focus on your body.
*  You lose focus on your posture.
*  So you're sitting like this, which makes it really hard to take a deep breath.
*  And then you lose focus on how healthily you're breathing.
*  And so I've found that if I focus on that right from the get-go, I can sort of set myself
*  up for some good habits.
*  I also try to incorporate when I'm working out, I always nasal breathe and I try to breathe
*  less and increase my tolerance for CO2.
*  But I do Wim Hof's Tummo, I do CREA, I do some Pranayama's.
*  I try to do those a few times a week in total.
*  And they're offered for free.
*  There's a free one.
*  I can do on Monday nights at nine.
*  This guy isn't selling anything.
*  He's a type 1 diabetic, had anxiety, had high blood pressure, had depression, and he was
*  able to abate so many of the symptoms of those things.
*  How do you access this free breathing?
*  Chuck McGee is the one who does it.
*  It's in the back of my book, the URL.
*  You can look up his name also online, Chuck McGee, Wim Hof instructor.
*  And what's so cool, you have no idea this guy's even a breathing thing.
*  He doesn't advertise anything.
*  He does this because breathing has fundamentally changed his life in a measured way.
*  So he no longer is on blood pressure medicine.
*  He's taking 80% less insulin.
*  His anxiety is abated.
*  His depression is abated.
*  And these are things that have been, for the Wim Hof guys, there's thousands of these people
*  reporting this, drops in CRP of 40-fold within two weeks of doing this.
*  So it's fascinating stuff.
*  So he leads a live stream, is that what it is?
*  It's nightly?
*  No, it's a Monday night, 9 p.m. PT.
*  But what's cool is he will then send you a recording of this so you can practice it whenever
*  you want.
*  An audio recording that you can get on your phone or is it a physical?
*  No, no, he'll send you, you can get it on your phone, download it and listen to it whenever
*  you want, which is what I've done.
*  I have about four of his different sessions here.
*  So whenever I was traveling, when people were doing that, especially if I was traveling
*  spending a lot of times in hotels, I would do this to really reset myself and help go
*  to sleep more easily.
*  And you said his name was Chuck McGee, is that it?
*  And so it was like chuckmcgee.com or something like that?
*  His website is something Viking Breathworks.
*  It's a hard URL.
*  Viking?
*  Yes.
*  Why Viking?
*  Have to ask him.
*  Because they did a lot of crazy shit, right?
*  They were free divers.
*  They were free divers.
*  There was a lot of like weird chanting and stuff.
*  Iced Viking.
*  Oh, Iced Viking.
*  Iced Viking, tie into the Wim Hof cold exposure thing.
*  And he's dealing a lot, not just with people who are healthy, you want to go up that next
*  rung of human potential, but with people who have chronic pain, who have chronic diseases.
*  And that's an area I think that we're just starting to learn about how effective this
*  stuff is and how we can better treat these people instead of giving them tranquilizers,
*  help to treat the core problem and do that through breathing properly.
*  Well, listen, man, I really enjoyed your book and I really enjoyed talking to you.
*  I think the information is so valuable.
*  It's so interesting.
*  And I know from my own personal experience that there's a great benefit to really learning
*  how to breathe correctly and concentrating on breathing.
*  And I'm going to start working out now through my nose.
*  I'm going to try that now.
*  Do my kickboxing.
*  I'm going to clench my mouth down, just completely breathe through my nose and I'll let you know.
*  So the book, it's called Breath.
*  You can basically get it everywhere.
*  And again, I got the audio recording and I really enjoyed it.
*  Do you have an Instagram, Facebook, all that jazz?
*  Yeah, my website, Mr. James Nestor.
*  I knew that these claims are going to sound impossible to people, so there's more than
*  500 scientific references there with x-rays, with videos, with pictures.

*  I'm trying to get better.
*  Good for you.
*  Thank you for everything, man.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Thank you very much for having me.
*  Goodbye, everybody.
*  Breathe, bitch.
