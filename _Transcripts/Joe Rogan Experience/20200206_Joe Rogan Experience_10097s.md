# Joe Rogan Experience #1424 - Tom Papa
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ihph3nrgt0)
*  Tommy Papa! Joey! What's going on buddy? Looking at that tarantula hawk? Yeah. What size is that sucker? I know. I've found one of those in my tub once.
*  That's straight from Maynard's farm. Maynard from Tool. Uh huh. Yeah, he sent me that. Oh wow. He found that fucking thing.
*  Yeah, he was explaining it to me and then he sent me one. Cause he's uh, that's how he rolls. That's how he rolls. They're the coolest.
*  You brought bread. You know I'm on this all meat diet. I know. You said I'd bring bread to fuck with me. But you have a family. You have a family.
*  I'll deviate a little bit. I'll deviate. You might want to take a look at it later. I deviated over this weekend. You did? Yeah. I went to Disneyland and I had ice cream and then Friday night or Saturday night.
*  Saturday night I had pasta. I had all kinds. I had Girl Scout cookies. I had a bunch of Girl Scout cookies. And dude, I'm telling you Sunday my back was hurting. Really? Monday my back was hurting.
*  Everything was like my knee was hurting. All this like inflammation. It's crazy. Eagy, puffy. Yeah. One day back, two days. Cause today's Tuesday. So I ate corn on a warm Monday and Tuesday. Everything's normal yet. Really? No more aches and pains.
*  So you were full on meat for a whole month. How many meals a day? Two usually. Two. Yeah. Usually a small meal around noon after a workout and then dinner.
*  All right. And no eggs? No. Yeah, I would eat eggs. Eggs and fish. Eggs, fish, meat. Meat. Just no carbohydrates. No vegetables at all. No fruits. No bread of course. No. I had an olive. No. Two olives. And two pieces of chili mango the entire month. Two glorious olives. But the pieces of chili mango I legitimately felt guilty. I love chili mango. I've never had chili mango. Oh my god. Really? No. It's one of the greatest creations. What is it? Like a chili pepper mango? No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No. It's like a chili pepper mango. No
*  dried mangoes but with chili powder all around. It's Mexican. Big hit in Mexican community. Dried? Yeah. It's so good dude. So good. Because it's got the sweetness from the dried mangoes. Yeah. But then it's got the spiciness from the chili powder. Oh. That's right up my alley. It's so good. I ate two pieces. I was only going to eat one. I was like, fuck it. Let me have another one. And I ate that second one. I'm like, oh no. What have I done? Why did you decide to do it in the first place? The diet? Yeah.
*  Well because January is World Carnivore Month and I know quite a few people that have done it that have had some serious results. And serious results with autoimmune issues too. I have vitiligo which is an autoimmune disease. It causes you to have these patches where you don't have pigment.
*  Oh really?
*  And this month I had the best results that I've ever had with vitiligo. Spots filling in.
*  It's transient. It comes and goes?
*  It comes and goes depending upon how well I'm taking care of myself, treatments and stuff like that. But this month I've had all these spots fill in at a pretty rapid rate.
*  Really?
*  People with eczema have had spectacular results with it.
*  Now what if you were to suggest to someone who wouldn't eat just meat, what percentage meat do you think you would?
*  I think the problem is not plants as much as the problem really is refined sugar, carbohydrates and bullshit. That's what I think. I think that's the problem.
*  Does cheese count in that?
*  You can eat cheese.
*  You can eat cheese?
*  You can eat cheese. It's an animal product.
*  I think for most people the real problem is junk. Candy, sugar, pasta, glorious bread.
*  Even that bread?
*  That bread is probably better because it has less gluten because you make sourdough bread.
*  It's just flour, water, salt and yeast.
*  It's healthier for you. But I think bread in general, just the idea of bread is a human created product.
*  True.
*  You got all that concentrated carbohydrates in a very weird form. It's like glue. Look at what it is when you're making the dough.
*  Total glue.
*  That eventually becomes glue in your stomach.
*  I've actually thought that before. Did they put together cities with this stuff when they were starting out?
*  Because it dries for a day. It's hard to get off the counter.
*  Right. Well, you remember when you were a kid you'd make paste?
*  Yeah.
*  Basically flour and water and you'd make a paste.
*  I just posted videos on how to bake the bread because everyone's constantly asking for it.
*  So I put a new series on YouTube called Getting Baked with Tom.
*  It was just me in my kitchen showing you how to make bread. I realized when I was making it, this is a long process.
*  I have four videos getting through one loaf of bread over multiple days.
*  Are you still doing the TV show? You were doing a TV show for a while.
*  Yeah, I'm not.
*  That was called Baked on the Food Network.
*  How'd that go?
*  It went great. People really liked it, but we're not making any more. I don't know why.
*  So then I was like, well, why do I need the Food Network? I could just keep making it and put it on YouTube.
*  It's so much better to put it on YouTube because people can access it anytime they want.
*  Right.
*  This archaic system of waiting for Tuesday night at 8 o'clock for a show.
*  Yeah, that's what suddenly occurred to me. Like, wait, I've got cameras.
*  There you look at you.
*  I've got friends.
*  Look at you.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you varied your process at all since you first started doing this? Have you added anything?
*  Yeah. Well, you get better at it. It's a skill. It's a thing.
*  Sure.
*  You start to, it sounds corny, but you become one with it.
*  I know the weights of things just by holding it, and I know the timing of things, and I know the temperature,
*  what that's going to do. And it just, it's very immersive. So yeah, I started, I started branching out.
*  And then I also started making bagels and pretzels and stuff like that.
*  Bagels. No, don't you have to boil bagels?
*  You do.
*  Yeah.
*  So I just take a like a Dutch oven just with water in it and boil it up and baking soda and let that kind of bubble up.
*  But you use a different kind of flour for the bagels?
*  No, same flour.
*  Really? Sourdough flour?
*  Yeah.
*  Sourdough bagels?
*  Yeah, that's the key. Like I have so many bad bagels in LA. And, you know, people always talk, oh, it's the water. It's this and that.
*  And, you know, I met this, Vito's Pizza is a guy from Jersey here in LA that makes great pizza.
*  And I'm like, so what is it, the water with the dough? He's like, it's just, you know, it's just knowing what you're doing.
*  He says, and I keep running into these bad bagels and I realized the flavor that was coming out of the bagels I'm making is because of the sourdough starter.
*  It has this different flavor. It's a deeper flavor. It's not just to use that as the yeast. It's to actually make it taste better.
*  Is it true that the water is different on the East Coast and that is it a more mineral rich water?
*  That's what everybody says.
*  Wouldn't that just be pretty easy to add those elements to water from the West Coast?
*  You would think, and some people say that they like import the water.
*  Maybe that's why people are less flavorful over here.
*  They're not filled with all that.
*  You know, I mean, flavorful like Joey Diaz, like mad flavor. Yeah.
*  That he's got flavor. Yeah.
*  He's got like a charisma. Yeah.
*  The thing that you don't you don't get a lot of that out here.
*  No, you don't. Yeah, it's different. It's different. It's a chill.
*  Well, even the people that do have flavor out here, it's like they take their flavor goes up to seven. Right.
*  You come from Jersey and you got rusty pipes, you got rats swimming in it.
*  All generations of stuff in there. Yeah, that's going to add to it for sure.
*  Yeah, there's something. The water does taste different though.
*  It does. Yeah.
*  Like my manager, Jeff, he loves New York City tap water.
*  He's always like knowing the virtues of New York City tap water.
*  I'm like, bro, you're crazy. I'm not drinking that.
*  Yes. Any day now, a hundred people could die from that shit.
*  Everybody's so proud about it, though. And I am too.
*  And we go back with my family like around Christmas.
*  We were just there and I'm like, you just drink from the tap.
*  My kids took a sip of it and she's like, it tastes like carrots.
*  And she was right. She was really right.
*  It tastes like carrots. It's hilarious.
*  That kind of like iron, carrot-y.
*  Yeah, there's stuff in there you're not supposed to drink probably.
*  No, a lot of stuff.
*  Or maybe you are supposed to drink it, right?
*  Well, yeah, maybe. Like minerals.
*  Less anemic maybe.
*  Well, minerals taste bad, but they're good for you, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like hard water. When you get hard water, isn't that minerals?
*  That's minerals. Right.
*  Right. And it's great to shower in soft water.
*  And the soap just never comes off.
*  That's true.
*  After hours of sitting.
*  Why is that?
*  I don't know, but in my parents' townhouse, you take a shower.
*  You're going to have soap on you the rest of the day.
*  So do they have a filtration system? Is that what it is?
*  I don't know. Yeah, I guess so.
*  It must be.
*  Right. It must be something that takes the minerals out.
*  So when you get like that residue on your shower head, that white residue, that's hard water.
*  That's sperm.
*  Huh?
*  Fun fact.
*  Oh no.
*  Oh, I am so busted.
*  That's one thing I've done maybe like three times my whole life is jerk off in the shower.
*  Three times?
*  Yeah, it's like never been my thing.
*  I think I've probably done it just to say, why is there some place I've never jerked off?
*  I can't go through the world with a place that hasn't been violated.
*  I've never jerked off in the tub, I'll tell you that.
*  Never. It's just too hot in there. It's just too confusing and frustrating.
*  Well, you've got to let the water down a little.
*  Then you're just like, then you're being a weirdo.
*  That's like those guys who lay in bed to masturbate, they bring a box of tissues and a towel and a-
*  Set up like they're going on a date.
*  You're a pervert. What's wrong with you?
*  Right, exactly.
*  Jerking off is supposed to be a maintenance thing.
*  Like you just need it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like let me just take care of this so I'm not obsessed.
*  Right. Let me get a cup of coffee, let me do that. Get to the goddamn office.
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ.
*  People that don't masturbate at all, that's got to occupy too much real estate in your head.
*  There's no doubt about it, right?
*  Well, I don't know. You could argue that the people that do it all the time, it's a lot of real estate.
*  Well, it becomes, I think porn in particular is a real issue for people. It does become an obsession.
*  Yes, indeed. I remember a buddy of mine was like really into it in the early internet.
*  And he started looking at the world through a porn lens. It was every girl was to be approached like somebody in a-
*  Yeah, it messed with his head.
*  Oh, that's not good.
*  Anything you watch for that amount of time is going to affect you.
*  I've often thought that about violence because I've seen so many people get beat up.
*  Like I'm so comfortable with people getting beat up.
*  Right.
*  Like fights. Like if I see a fight somewhere, like a fight breaks out, my heart rate doesn't jack up.
*  It doesn't go, oh my God, this is crazy. I can't believe they're fighting.
*  It's like, look at that bad technique, dropping his hands. Look at this dude. Oh my God, his left leg's off the ground.
*  There's no what he's doing.
*  This is out in the world. Like it's just seeing two guys go at it.
*  I'm like, look at this terrible technique.
*  And I'm running to the car.
*  I see everything coming a mile away. It's crazy.
*  I see society becoming unhinged.
*  Yeah.
*  Get me out of here.
*  It becomes normal, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  And then violence becomes normalized.
*  Like, you know, I've been reading a lot about Native American cultures lately.
*  I've gone through like five books on the Wild West over the last few months.
*  And one of the more disturbing and shocking things is the torture.
*  Is Native Americans would torture their victims.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, particularly the Comanches.
*  Those were the badasses, right?
*  They were the badasses.
*  Yeah.
*  And the reason, until they developed a multiple shot revolver,
*  that carried a chamber that had more than one bullet,
*  they were running shit because everybody else had muskets.
*  And they could shoot multiple arrows.
*  You know, they could, they would, there's a, have you ever heard of,
*  there's a guy named Lars Andersen, do you know who he is?
*  Yeah, I've heard of him.
*  He's a famous, YouTube famous archery expert.
*  And he, going through old texts and old artistic depictions,
*  realized that the idea of a back quiver where you would reach back to grab an arrow
*  and then put it on the string and then pull it back and shoot the arrow is not accurate.
*  That what they actually would do is put the arrows in between their fingers.
*  And they developed a technique where they would draw and pull and draw and pull and draw and pull.
*  Just release one at a time.
*  Yes. And they would go from finger to finger.
*  So they literally could shoot an arrow a second.
*  Wow.
*  And so this guy, he actually shows how he can do it.
*  Not just in theory, see how they're all, they're holding, in some of the depictions,
*  you see that they're holding multiple arrows in their hands instead of in a quiver.
*  And so he figured out how to do it where he can shoot multiple arrows in a second.
*  And see if you can get to him.
*  So like, see, he's doing that. That's him pulling arrows out.
*  And this is what the Comanche did?
*  Yes. And the Comanches were able to do that.
*  And when they were able to do that, they were able to shoot the American settlers
*  and the U.S. Army soldiers multiple times before they could get off another bullet
*  because they had a pack of chamber.
*  See how he's shooting all those arrows?
*  Because he keeps all the arrows in his fingers.
*  So he tucks them in his finger and then he just grabs it with the other hand, draws it back.
*  So they were actually winning the war for a while.
*  Exactly. For hundreds of years.
*  Hundreds of years.
*  For hundreds of years.
*  And it was so crazy what they would do is the U.S. government would give people allotments of land
*  saying, hey, Oklahoma is a beautiful place. Why don't you guys move there?
*  And you can get a thousand acres of land.
*  Like, whoa, golly, I'm going to take my family and move to Oklahoma.
*  And what they were basically using them was cannon fodder for the Comanches.
*  So they would send these people in. They would just get slaughtered.
*  Why would they?
*  Yeah, because they wanted to try to figure out how to settle this land.
*  Right.
*  And they wanted these people to kind of fight the battles with the Comanches.
*  And then the soldiers eventually would move in and then they'd set up forts.
*  So they were just put out as bait?
*  Yes. It's horrific. Whether it's conscious or unconscious or whether it's semi-aware or maybe these people could fix it.
*  But they definitely did get slaughtered.
*  What part of the country were the Comanche?
*  Oklahoma, Texas, a lot of sections of the West. They ran things.
*  Thousands?
*  Yeah, they were incredibly nomadic. They rode horses. They were fantastic with horses.
*  They had the most horses. That's one of the reasons why they were the most powerful tribe.
*  And all they ate was meat. They would eat buffalo mostly and occasionally berries and stuff like that.
*  But mostly their diet consisted of buffalo.
*  So they would follow the buffalo and then kill all the other Native Americans they encountered.
*  Oh, really?
*  Kill all the settlers they encountered. Oh, they were ruthless.
*  Geez.
*  Yeah.
*  The torture. The torture is insane. Cutting people's arms and legs off and throwing them on a fire while they're still alive.
*  Shit like that.
*  Geez. So they enjoyed it.
*  Yeah. I mean, this book that I read, Empire of the Summer Moon, is all about the Comanches.
*  This guy SG Gwyn was in here and he kind of explained how he found out about it when he moved to Texas.
*  And he moved to Texas and started delving into the history of the Comanches and the war that the Texas Rangers.
*  The Texas Rangers, the original Texas Rangers were created to combat the Comanches.
*  They were these super badass soldiers that dressed like Indians.
*  And they realized they had to learn how to fight on horses because the Comanches actually shot arrows on horses.
*  Whereas the original U.S. soldiers would get off the horse to shoot a shot.
*  And it just was ineffective.
*  Right.
*  The Comanches would run up on them and fill them up with arrows.
*  Kill them up with arrows.
*  It was crazy.
*  They would kidnap all these white settlers and take their babies and kill their babies.
*  Take their children, incorporate their children into the tribes, rape the women, torture and kill the men.
*  Wow. But they were nomadic.
*  So they didn't settle, create little towns.
*  No, only tents.
*  They were just always moving around.
*  Only tents. And they followed the buffalo.
*  Wow. So just like seasons, they would stay in an area for a little bit.
*  They would just follow the buffalo, wherever the buffalo were. That's where they would go.
*  Geez.
*  Yeah. But the thing about it is, it's to me so strange that cultures can become comfortable with extreme violence.
*  Like very comfortable.
*  Yeah. Right. Well, anything that you're just exposed to all the time.
*  You know, we're a pretty violent society, right? We see a lot of violent images all the time.
*  We see it. But in terms of like day-to-day violence, compared to just a couple of hundred years ago, it's a pretty radical drop off.
*  Yeah. You'd have to choose to digest it now.
*  Yeah. You'd have to choose. But a lot of people do choose.
*  Yeah. But also you can put yourself in a little bubble and feel like it doesn't really exist.
*  Or you can get into a murder bubble, just like some people get into a porn bubble.
*  Right.
*  You can just get into like watching people get slaughtered all day long.
*  Yeah. Right. Exactly.
*  There's plenty of videos.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I'm going to watch other things.
*  Yeah. Bread.
*  Like my Netflix special.
*  Oh, that's that. Comes out tonight, right? At midnight? Is that what it is?
*  Last midnight.
*  Oh, last night. So it's out right now.
*  It's out. It's out.
*  Oh my Jesus.
*  It's done. It's out.
*  Are you happy with it?
*  I am happy with it.
*  How many years did you work on it?
*  Two and a half.
*  That's a good number.
*  Yeah. Close to three.
*  Yeah. That's a good number.
*  Yeah.
*  That seems like to polish and act, get it tight, tour with it a little bit, and then almost get to the point where you're done with it.
*  Yeah. Almost sick of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Where some things started. That's how I can tell when jokes start to peel off.
*  Because you're not done with them.
*  You're too enthusiastic.
*  Yeah. And then out of the ones, do you ever have when you get close to taping, all of a sudden something new pops in and makes the lineup last minute?
*  Oh, yeah. Of course.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, of course. Yeah.
*  Other stuff you've been working on and really trying to perfect it for a couple of years, and then all of a sudden something shows up like the last week. That's a killer.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's just you're in that space.
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, I shot it in Newark.
*  Newark?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Why Newark?
*  Because I'm a Jersey guy.
*  I was born in Newark.
*  Yeah. And I just feel like I just have a real affection for all those great New Jersey cities that have been just destroyed by corruption. Pasek, Paterson, Trenton, Newark. All these great places that were so thriving.
*  Was that what destroyed them?
*  Yeah.
*  Corruption?
*  Yeah.
*  Political corruption. There's a ton of money in New Jersey. There's a ton of money. People are getting taxed like crazy.
*  And then these politicians multiple times going to jail for abusing the system and getting busted and bribery and just awful.
*  Really. And it just became real violent places and people started moving out. And I really think it's going to come back. They're just too great. It's like Asbury Park at the Jersey Shore.
*  I used to drive through there and it was just bombed out with these great big Victorian homes right on the beach. It's like, how's this place not just kicking ass? And the only way that it overworks, the gay community comes in and says, well, this is nice and we're going to fix it.
*  Is it the gay community that built it up?
*  Yeah. They saved...
*  Asbury Park.
*  Asbury Park. Absolutely.
*  That's awesome.
*  So I think it's going to come back. So I just wanted to, in a little way, just shine a little light on Newark.
*  So Asbury Park is basically a gay neighborhood now?
*  I don't know if it's a gay neighborhood, but it's a good healthy gay population.
*  And so they buy these Victorians that are on the beach and are they valuable now?
*  Yeah. Yeah. The real estate's really come up there.
*  Only makes sense, right? There's only so much beach front property.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, look at Malibu. It's preposterous. I've looked at houses in Malibu that are on the beach.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Yeah. Like, it doesn't make sense money.
*  Millions and millions of dollars for a house that looks like it cost 150,000 bucks.
*  I know. Exactly. Yeah. In North Carolina probably would.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  And should. Yeah.
*  No, it's crazy. But it's limited. There's not that much beach, especially in that area.
*  You know, the Jersey Shore, the whole coast. It's like Manhattan. It's the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  But I do feel like there's... I mean, you look back and you read all these books from like Philip Roth and stuff.
*  And I think that's the most interesting thing about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a really interesting thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like this performing arts theater there.
*  It's beautiful.
*  Great space.
*  It's this little downtown.
*  It's where the Devils are playing and the Nets before they moved.
*  And it's like this one square block.
*  I mean, you get on a train, you're in Manhattan in 10 minutes.
*  Right.
*  So it was this great theater.
*  I did two shows there.
*  I had performed there before.
*  Is Northland your comeback?
*  I've got a lot of fans in Jersey.
*  Yeah.
*  Slowly, you know, parts of it, you know, it's tough, you know, two steps forward and two
*  steps back.
*  I've done some UFC fights there.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, right.
*  Because you couldn't do New York.
*  Yes.
*  For a long time.
*  Right.
*  So we used to do it in Newark.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there's beautiful downtown area, really great, beautiful Whole Foods and Nike.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Beautiful.
*  And Newark.
*  Yeah.
*  Beautiful.
*  And then, you know, you get to the outer, you go a couple more blocks.
*  It's a different story.
*  When I first moved to New York, I stayed with my grandfather in Newark.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  My grandfather bought a house in Newark in like the early, I guess it was probably the
*  40s.
*  He bought a house there and stayed there till he died.
*  Oh, really?
*  North 9th Street.
*  And it was originally an Italian neighborhood.
*  And then it slowly became a bunch of different kinds of neighborhoods.
*  They did a thing called blockbusting.
*  You know what that is?
*  What's that?
*  No.
*  Where real estate agents would come in and say, hey, black people are moving into this
*  neighborhood.
*  You got to sell now or your real estate value is going to drop.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  I like black people.
*  Get out of here.
*  He stayed there forever.
*  Why would I move?
*  He wouldn't move, man.
*  But the neighborhood changed from an all Italian neighborhood to a black neighborhood.
*  And then and then it eventually became a bunch of different immigrants.
*  And then when I stayed there in this was probably 8891, 9192.
*  That's when I lived there.
*  It was bad, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Next door neighbor got his house broken into by the cops.
*  They battering rammed his front door because he was selling crack.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  The crack epidemic.
*  My grandfather knew that kid from the time he was little.
*  Oh, terrible.
*  You know, he's watching this kid grow up to become a drug dealer.
*  God.
*  He had like a nice Audi and he kept parked in the driveway.
*  Right.
*  Behind a gate.
*  Yeah.
*  He was spending all that crack money.
*  Crack money.
*  My sister runs this nonprofit.
*  I think I've talked to you about it called City Green out of Clifton.
*  They create all of these city gardens and take over farmlands like in Passaic and Patterson.
*  And it just really you bring these young kids in.
*  She has like these learning gardens and these school programs where these kids from Patterson
*  and Passaic come in.
*  And they're just like these young little kids that don't understand like where vegetables
*  come from.
*  Their parents, their families are blown apart and they're just like they're as thirsty
*  as the vegetables.
*  They just want love and learning and want to be useful.
*  And they just it's so inspiring to see.
*  And if you can get kids at that age, like four, five, six, seven, if you can get them
*  there, that's going to change everything.
*  If you can come in and help these kids out and give them a lifeline, that seems like
*  where most of the change can happen.
*  Yeah.
*  If you can catch them when they're young, give them a positive direction to go into.
*  It's one of the things that I talked about a bunch of times in the podcast, like we
*  spend so much money overseas to try to replace dictators and get rid of fucked up governments.
*  We spend so little time going into inner cities and trying to give young kids chance.
*  I know.
*  Give them opportunities, create community centers, do something where you give them
*  an alternative to drugs and crime and gangs and all the shit that plagues those areas.
*  That's where I really believe.
*  And I've talked to other people that are really into philanthropy, and they all seem
*  to think that that's the way to do it.
*  Get them when they're young.
*  Get them when they're young.
*  But what the program is, is difficult and you got to try and get the parents involved
*  with it and all that.
*  But if you can do that, there's, I mean, they're so inspiring when you see these kids then
*  move up to high school and they're just, you know, I grew up with kids that were, you know,
*  And so lazy in comparison to these kids.
*  They just suck everything in and want to do well and they're inspiring.
*  These kids will just kick ass, do whatever they have to do to learn, do whatever they
*  have to do to get into college.
*  They're just really like some of the best people you could possibly make.
*  Because they're thankful that they had that opportunity and they understand that they
*  could have gone a bad way.
*  Right.
*  Like a lot of people that they grew up with.
*  Yeah.
*  And they see in their neighborhoods, you know, there's, there's a, there's trouble.
*  This is not, this isn't, this isn't guaranteed that things are going to go right for me.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  It's amazing that there hasn't been more time and effort invested by the government to try
*  to clean up these terrible neighborhoods.
*  It's just not immediately profitable.
*  And I guess every politician has four years in office.
*  Yeah, it's really, I know it's like, I did a, I did a fundraiser in Newark.
*  This is where I got the idea to do the special there.
*  I did a fundraiser.
*  It wasn't a fundraiser.
*  It was like a awards dinner kind of thing for this prominent lawyer.
*  And all these politicians were there.
*  And they all seem like, you know, people with good intentions and whatever.
*  And then you walk out into, into the city and on the way to the airport, it's like,
*  man, this is some of these areas.
*  It's like, how this is, those people were nice, but it takes, it will take thousands
*  of those people to really all work on that problem.
*  Like, I don't know how you do it.
*  And you know, when I travel around touring, and I'm sure you see it too, in every city,
*  all of a sudden there's these tent cities just popping up of homeless people that wasn't
*  around when I started touring.
*  Like in the middle of New Orleans, in the middle of every city, San Francisco, the upper
*  Midwest, you know, there's just all of a sudden these camps of homeless people that did not
*  exist before.
*  No, Los Angeles is staggering.
*  I mean, there's basically a small city inside the city.
*  Yeah.
*  There's right now they're bordering on 70,000 people.
*  70,000.
*  70,000 people live on the streets in Los Angeles.
*  Just in LA.
*  Just in LA.
*  And because LA never really gets cold, it only rains 10 times a year, it's really not
*  that hard.
*  If you have a tent, you can live outside.
*  Yeah, and they do.
*  They do.
*  Full on tents and they string them all together.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And they create little villages.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the underpasses, like all throughout LA now, are filled with tents.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's incredible.
*  It's fucking weird.
*  How much of it is, I have no idea, but how much of it is mental illness and how much
*  of it is just economic?
*  I'm sure it's all the above.
*  It's a bunch of different factors.
*  You think it's mostly if you have your instinct?
*  Well mental illness for sure was what started out the wave of homeless people during the
*  because they changed the criteria for people being able to be confined to a mental health
*  institute.
*  They released a bunch of people.
*  They changed what constituted you being mentally ill.
*  Whereas before there were asylums, people could get help and counseling and maybe even
*  get out.
*  But now they just kick those people out, or then they just kick those people out.
*  And I remember it.
*  Because how old are you?
*  I'm 50.
*  I'm a little older than you.
*  I'm 52.
*  So when I was...
*  I'm really 52.
*  When I was, I guess I was like in high school or right after high school when Reagan was
*  in office, all that shit was going down and people were freaking out because all of a
*  sudden there was homeless people wandering around the street that didn't exist before
*  and people were really angry.
*  They were like, these are mentally ill people.
*  Now they're just wandering.
*  And you know, I lived in Boston.
*  It was fucking really cold to see people wandering around Boston.
*  There's definitely always a large portion of people that truly, truly need help.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  It's not just that they're lazy or don't just go get a job.
*  There's major issues and there needs to be some kind of a safety net to help these people.
*  And you could just see it.
*  I mean, it's so weird to be...
*  It's popping up in LA in areas that it never was before.
*  Yeah.
*  And even what is lazy, right?
*  How many people that are that lazy that they're homeless?
*  How many people are mentally ill?
*  There's got to be a lot of them.
*  A lot.
*  A lot.
*  Mental illness is a weird thing, right?
*  Because it's got such a stigma attached to it.
*  But I think...
*  What is wellness, right?
*  What's mental wellness?
*  Maintaining a beautiful state of mind, a peaceful, relaxed, calm, thankful, filled with gratitude,
*  loved, happy.
*  That's healthy, right?
*  Everyone experiences some mental illness, just like everyone experiences some physical
*  illness.
*  But it's a matter of whether or not it becomes chronic and prolonged and what it does to
*  you and the people around you.
*  And some people have it way worse, just like some people have way worse physical health,
*  right?
*  Some people have way worse mental health and some people it deteriorates.
*  And sometimes you could be on the right track and some stuff happens to you and within six
*  months you're in trouble.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's a tricky situation to kind of maintain.
*  We're a lot more fragile than we like to pretend we are.
*  It's one of the beautiful things about being a comic is that we have a real community.
*  We have a really beautiful, supportive community of like-minded weirdos.
*  It's really true.
*  It really is true.
*  I know.
*  Is there a place that other people get to go to that we get to go to like the store
*  where everybody's hugging everybody, everybody sees everybody?
*  I know.
*  So friendly.
*  I was thinking about that.
*  I was leaving and everybody, every time you leave a club, whether it's the store or the
*  cellar in New York, everyone's always asking, are you going to be here tomorrow?
*  You going to be around?
*  Where are you going?
*  Are you going to be?
*  Like everyone cares about, they want to see you again and they want to know if you're
*  coming back.
*  And I was like, that's such a wonderful thing.
*  This isn't an office.
*  This isn't people that are being made to see you every day.
*  But if you're leaving the store and we say good night, it's like, are you going to be
*  here tomorrow?
*  Are you coming back to the playhouse?
*  Yeah.
*  People are looking forward to it.
*  We're real lucky in that regard because I don't think musicians have a spot like that
*  where they get to go to.
*  They feel isolated if they're not with their band or their family.
*  They're isolated.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's interesting because LA, it's the store's revival, I think, has given it a sense
*  of place because coming from New York, I felt when I was out here like, oh, comedians just
*  roll into the Laugh Factory and then they get in their car and they're gone.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no hangout.
*  Yeah, there's nothing there.
*  And the Improv had it for a while and then they messed with the bar and they moved it
*  to the other side.
*  And it ruined it.
*  That was such a great place.
*  They ruined it.
*  I know.
*  And it hasn't got its mojo back.
*  How do you get a mojo back?
*  I don't know.
*  Have you ever seen that photo of the Improv where it's Jay Leno, he's got a pipe.
*  Yeah.
*  He has his tweed jacket.
*  And he's hanging out in the bar and everyone's in the bar.
*  The bar's packed with people.
*  Packed, I know.
*  And it's this weird sort of photograph of capturing time.
*  Yeah.
*  And that was what it was like when I first started coming here.
*  There was basically two schools.
*  There was the Improv school and then there was the Comedy Store school.
*  Right.
*  And then there was the Laugh Factory, just like the stepchild.
*  Right.
*  It was weird.
*  Yeah, it's always a little weird.
*  Because Jamie used to work at the Comedy Store.
*  He was a dishwasher there and he left to start his own comedy club.
*  Yeah.
*  You would, you know, the industry people would go to the Improv.
*  It was all like the people that were angling to get on sitcoms and the people that were
*  squeaky clean.
*  And then the deranged weirdos were all hanging around at the store.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's comfortable there for them.
*  But the new wave, the new revival of the store is very different.
*  Totally different.
*  Very different.
*  But it still has that shadows of that.
*  There's some derangement.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's still some derangement there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's in the walls.
*  It's baked in the carpets.
*  You can't.
*  You would never be able to build a place like that.
*  It would have to already exist.
*  Because if you try to build a place in 2020, you said, all right, we're going to build
*  a new Comedy Store.
*  We're going to put it over here in Silver Lake and we're going to, this is this and
*  that and that.
*  And we're going to make it like the Comedy Store.
*  It would feel like a hotel bar.
*  Yeah.
*  It would go there and see no hotel bar.
*  Yeah.
*  Why am I here?
*  Why is it echoey?
*  What's wrong here?
*  It seems odd.
*  There's no soul.
*  Places have a soul and that place has a lot of soul, a lot of dark souls, a lot of mixed
*  up souls.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a weird point of contention with scientists and with people that are open to more weird
*  ideas that things have a feel to them, that things even have a memory to them.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I believe that a hundred percent.
*  I do too.
*  You know, if you talk to a brilliant scientist, they would dismiss that instantaneously.
*  They think they're all brilliant, but they're not open to everything.
*  They're acting all smart with their little test scores and their lab coats, but walk
*  into an old hotel in Italy and tell me that you don't feel something there, that history.
*  I'm not saying it's all ghosts coming up and giving you belly rubs.
*  Why do they think they have that dismissive need to be a reductionist, to reduce everything
*  down to its core components and dismiss any soul?
*  It gives you control, right?
*  It gives you an idea that this crazy madness is somehow manageable.
*  I do it too in my life.
*  I organize my desk and I get my thing and I get my schedule and okay, everything's okay.
*  This isn't chaos.
*  No, we're not all going to be...
*  This isn't completely out of my control.
*  I'm controlling this, at least my pen's over there and my book's over here.
*  I would think that that's what it is and if you can't justify it with facts and numbers,
*  then it doesn't exist.
*  Well, I don't know because certain places always seem to have a personality and there's
*  more going on.
*  Just because we haven't figured it out yet doesn't mean that that stuff doesn't exist.
*  No, I agree.
*  Even this room, even this place, you moved here, right?
*  The old place was the thing, but this feels different now than when you first showed up.
*  It's got stuff.
*  There's some memories, there's some things have happened.
*  It feels comfortable here.
*  Well, we got this desk too.
*  This is the same desk from the beginning.
*  This desk is soaked in with people's palm sweat and weirdness and good feelings and
*  weird feelings.
*  Yeah, and it wouldn't have come from something that wasn't wood.
*  Yeah, no, I agree.
*  This is also reclaimed farmhouse wood.
*  This is all from some Russian farm.
*  This is all reclaimed oak.
*  All this shit is like 100 years old.
*  Wow, from where?
*  Russia.
*  We decided to get this wood.
*  One of the things when I was building this, I said, can we get wood that's old?
*  So we figured out that there was ways that you could get really old oak.
*  So Eric, the guy who made all this, got this really old Russian oak and cut it all down
*  and trimmed it.
*  Everything's all, it's like got cracks in it and it's expanded.
*  It has personality.
*  It's alive.
*  Yeah, it's alive.
*  If it's not alive, I mean, it's organic.
*  That's probably the best way to describe it.
*  No, it has a difference.
*  And then if you want to go further and talk about the ghosts that show up, there's definitely
*  ghosts too.
*  I'll show you the picture of my ghost.
*  You have a picture of a ghost?
*  Didn't I show you that?
*  Did I ever show you that, Jamie?
*  I don't think so.
*  No?
*  You have a ghost?
*  I have a ghost.
*  Where?
*  Your house?
*  I apologize if I'm repeating myself.
*  I don't know if you are.
*  I don't remember the story.
*  I got one of those Nest cameras.
*  Oh, the Nest cameras captured a ghost?
*  Yeah, and I was at the Comedy Works in Denver.
*  The ghost comes with you to Denver?
*  He opens for me.
*  You want an opener that you can trust.
*  And I got an alert on my email the first time.
*  If it senses movement, it alerts you.
*  And I open it up and there's my dog, Bella, just in the thing.
*  I'm like, this is so cool.
*  I'm just like, I'm in Denver and I'm looking at my office.
*  And I thought, wouldn't that be a cool beginning of a horror movie if you get an alert on your
*  phone and back at home there's a guy just staring in the camera.
*  That's a good premise for a movie.
*  So then as I'm saying that to my opening act, who wasn't a ghost, I get another alert and
*  then this comes up.
*  Oh yeah, you can see it up there.
*  Okay.
*  Why do you have a picture of Chris D'Alea on your wall?
*  He's obsessed with Chris D'Alea.
*  We just found out.
*  That's D'Alea.
*  Chris, keep away from Tom.
*  Something you might not know.
*  I love D'Alea, but that's George Carlin.
*  That's a man with a wrench.
*  Yeah, or a man in a trench coat with an Uzi.
*  This is 10 o'clock at night.
*  The only people home are my wife and my daughter.
*  This is on the second floor.
*  There is no shadow coming in the thing.
*  It's a ghost.
*  That's a legit ghost.
*  You don't think that's a person?
*  That's not a person.
*  For sure.
*  That's the only one in the house.
*  Hmm.
*  And you think that's a gun in his hand?
*  Could be a clipboard.
*  Maybe he's just a really annoying surveyor from the dead.
*  I just took a few moments of your time to fill out this report.
*  Did you have video of it?
*  Was it moving or something?
*  No, but I have a video of another thing in the same office that I could show you.
*  This is weird.
*  Yeah.
*  It looks way different in this picture when it's small than it does when it's large.
*  When it's large, it looks more like a person.
*  Can you make it even bigger, Jamie?
*  Can you make his image larger?
*  I have a ghost in my house.
*  And then we hear things.
*  Yeah, see, it does seem...
*  It seems like the light is behind him, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like the outside right edge of it is sort of highlighted.
*  Like there's a light behind him.
*  It doesn't look like a gun, though.
*  It is weird.
*  I mean, it could be a gun.
*  And then I got this video.
*  Could be a Sawzall.
*  He's looking for bread.
*  He's got a big serrated...
*  Big bread knife.
*  Electric serrated chef's knife.
*  I'm gonna chop up some bread, bro.
*  So have you ever had an experience that you could say you think is probably a ghost that
*  caused that?
*  Everybody in the house has had a little something.
*  Is your house old?
*  It's not old, but like poltergeist.
*  Right, it was over an Indian burial ground.
*  You never know.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  You never know.
*  What?
*  Look at this video in the same office from the nest.
*  You got a video?
*  Let me see what's going on.
*  What am I looking at here?
*  Did the thing move?
*  No.
*  Can you press play again?
*  Okay.
*  Same camera.
*  What's that?
*  It's a bug, bro.
*  It's a bug?
*  100%.
*  How do you know that's a bug?
*  Because it's a bug.
*  It's moving in front of the camera.
*  It flies around.
*  It's doing loop-de-loops.
*  Dude, that's a bug.
*  It's probably a moth.
*  Oh my god, you're a little fruitcake.
*  You're a crazy person.
*  That is not...
*  That's no bug!
*  You're a crazy person.
*  Look how it's sailing.
*  Is that what they call...
*  Is a fruitcake...
*  Fruitcake is not...
*  That's a gay person.
*  That's a gay person.
*  But you can call someone a fruitcake if they're nuts too, right?
*  Isn't it?
*  Yeah, nuttier than a fruitcake.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Look how that...
*  That's no bug.
*  Look at that.
*  That is 100% a bug.
*  You're out of your mind.
*  That's a bug.
*  Do you want to see...
*  I would bet everything.
*  Drop it to me real quick.
*  All right, I'll let you drop it to you.
*  I would be all in that that's a bug.
*  All right.
*  That's not a ghost.
*  It's Tinkerbell.
*  That's what it is.
*  Your house is invaded by fairies.
*  But that ghost...
*  I believe in ghosts.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  And then my wife...
*  Yeah, we've all had little things go on in the house.
*  Like what kind of little things?
*  My wife thought someone was standing right behind her.
*  She's doing the laundry.
*  She thought it was my daughter.
*  Was it you?
*  And turned and there's...
*  Nope, there was...
*  Oh, that's a bug.
*  It's a fucking bug, right?
*  Thank you, Jamie.
*  Jamie!
*  Let's watch this.
*  Let's watch this so everyone at home can laugh at how fucking crazy Tom Papa is.
*  Here we go.
*  Well, if you first...
*  Let's watch the bug.
*  Oh, look.
*  A fucking bug.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  A flat paper.
*  Just shut your mouth.
*  A piece of paper.
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...

*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...

*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...

*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  I'm going to go ahead and...
*  See how it looks all long like that?
*  And Roswell Rods, there was this guy that me and Eddie Bravo back in the smoke too much
*  weed every day days, we were convinced that there were these things that were moving too
*  fast for the human eye to see, and there's gelatinous jellyfish-like creatures that are
*  shaped like a tube.
*  That's how they look.
*  See how they look?
*  See those things?
*  Yeah.
*  I get the idea.
*  You'd seen it?
*  Well, I'd seen a video.
*  See that one, that black and white one where it showed right above your cursor, Jamie,
*  to the right, right there.
*  Click on that one.
*  That sort of iconic image of the Roswell Rod had me convinced, like, oh my God, there's
*  these things in the sky, and the only way you could capture them was with video cameras.
*  So they'd set these video cameras up, and they would get these things on video, and
*  this guy made this documentary.
*  I think a couple of documentaries.
*  I think if you go to roswellrods.com, it's got a whole website dedicated to it.
*  It is nothing but a video artifact.
*  There's a show called, one of those monster shows, one of those History Channel shows
*  or Discovery Channel shows, and they solved the mystery.
*  They set up two cameras in front of this fireplace, or in front of this campfire.
*  One of them, was it a campfire?
*  No.
*  I think it was actually a lantern, whatever it was.
*  They set up these two cameras.
*  One of them was standard resolution, and the other one was HD.
*  So one of them captured multiple frames per second, like many, many, many frames per second,
*  very high resolution.
*  And in that one, you clearly see bugs.
*  Clearly.
*  You see a bug.
*  You see a bug.
*  A very easily defined bug.
*  In the other one, that's low resolution and doesn't capture as many frames per second,
*  all those images are stretched out, and it looks like tubes.
*  In the exact same place, at the exact same time, with two cameras right next to each
*  other, you get two very different images.
*  One of them is all stretched out from the low resolution camera, like your security
*  camera.
*  The other one is high resolution.
*  You can see it's clearly a bug.
*  I guarantee you, one million percent, that is a fucking bug.
*  Alright, I'll buy that one.
*  See if you can find that.
*  I'm convinced.
*  But, that other one.
*  You're a ghost lover, bro.
*  I am a ghost lover.
*  I love all of it.
*  I love being in a spooky old house, a nice old church, theaters.
*  The Comedy Store belly room scares me sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  I've taken people up there and I go, just stand here and tell me if you don't feel weird.
*  In the belly room?
*  There's something about the belly room.
*  When you go above those stairs, it's just like there's something about that room, especially
*  when there's no show going on.
*  It just feels like your body's telling you, get the fuck out of here.
*  Right?
*  Let's get out of here.
*  So what is that?
*  You're a bitch.
*  You're in the stairs, not me.
*  I'm a bitch.
*  Me, I'm a bitch.
*  I'm talking to myself.
*  The back one, off the main room, the dressing area, whenever you're back there by yourself,
*  that's a weird feeling.
*  That's a sketchy spot.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a really weird feeling.
*  Isn't that where Kinnison said he saw like a, didn't he see like a quarter move in the
*  air or something?
*  He ate a pound of cocaine that night.
*  That guy snorted so much coke, who the fuck knows what he saw?
*  Yeah, he's not a good scientist.
*  No.
*  Well, Carla Boe, who was Kinnison's sidekick, had a great story about getting kicked out
*  of the comic store.
*  And he told it on stage one night that he got kicked out, not of the comic store, excuse
*  me, kicked out of his home.
*  Got in a fight with his wife.
*  You know, get out.
*  Fuck you.
*  You know, I'm going to the goddamn comic store.
*  So he went to the comic store to, because I think he was working security at the store,
*  so he had keys.
*  So he said, I'm going to sleep on this stage.
*  I'm going to make it one day.
*  I want to be a big famous comedian.
*  I'm going to, this is my fucking stage.
*  I want to sleep here.
*  So he slept there in the dark, main room, in the dark.
*  And he hears something in the background.
*  And he hears like a door click, click.
*  He like picks his head up, pitch black, can't see shit.
*  Hello.
*  It's Carl.
*  Hey, I got kicked out of my house.
*  I'm sleeping here.
*  If anybody's here wondering.
*  And then he hears chairs moving, clink, clink, clink, clink.
*  And he's like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Hello.
*  And then something grabs him by the ankle and pulls him off the stage into the crowd,
*  into where the seats are, crashing into the chairs.
*  And then boom, the door shuts and boom, another door shuts and it's gone.
*  And he's laying on the ground in the middle of the main room with a bunch of knocked over
*  chairs, something had grabbed his ankle and pulled him off the stage.
*  Or he did a lot of coke with Kinnison.
*  He was right.
*  He was another one.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's a great story.
*  That is a great story.
*  He told it on stage one night at the store.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  Yeah, that's a good question.
*  I've never asked the audience if they feel weird in there.
*  I don't think they do.
*  They're drunk.
*  They're drunk and they're watching a show.
*  They're having a good time.
*  Yeah, they're having fun.
*  They're there for fun.
*  The basement feels weird.
*  You had such a funny, I saw you like a week ago working stuff out on the main stage.
*  That whole thing about back of the hand.
*  Oh yeah, don't talk about it.
*  I won't.
*  I won't.
*  I know.
*  Working that.
*  So that whole area was so funny.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the most rewarding feeling ever when you have a chunk and it's just like becomes
*  something over time.
*  Yeah.
*  Ugh.
*  You know, because in the beginning it's like a miracle.
*  It's like a plant.
*  I know.
*  Right?
*  In the beginning it's like a couple of leaves and a stick and it's like, I hope this fucking
*  becomes a tree.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Now it's like a tree.
*  Yeah.
*  Now it's got branches and you can hang from it.
*  Yeah.
*  And like branches it goes off in these different places.
*  So fun.
*  It was fun to watch.
*  I can't imagine not doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's the most fun thing to do.
*  I know.
*  You get addicted to it too when you don't do it.
*  You start feeling like a weirdo.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Once you've done it a bunch, you know, that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  You start getting like weird.
*  You're going on vacation for a week and you're like, what do I do?
*  I go to dinners now?
*  Walk around Thailand.
*  Do you guys have comedy out here?
*  No comedy at all?
*  Yeah.
*  Weird.
*  You brought a bag to Jamie too.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I gave Jamie.
*  I know.
*  Jamie's going to come back tomorrow with a little belly.
*  It's a beauty.
*  It is a beauty.
*  Little bread belly.
*  He doesn't have a toaster.
*  You don't have a toaster.
*  I threw my old one away.
*  I was planning on getting a new one.
*  I just never did.
*  He's a bachelor.
*  Well, good thing is you can get them anywhere.
*  It's not like they're hard to find.
*  I don't need a lot of toast either, so it's not a big deal.
*  Well, do they have them at Best Buy?
*  There's a Best Buy from a mile away.
*  Amazon will probably have it at your house before you get home.
*  Right?
*  They deliver.
*  They have their own trucks now.
*  I know.
*  They've made me so snotty.
*  I'm like, it won't be here today.
*  You know what's interesting?
*  It's like we have this attitude about business, right?
*  It's nice when someone works hard and creates a business and becomes successful, but it's
*  not when they become too successful.
*  It's not when they are the business.
*  Then we think, that's a monopoly.
*  We've got to break that up.
*  I hear a lot of people saying that they should break up Amazon.
*  Yeah, they're too big.
*  It's too good.
*  So you want to end up, so you want to wait five days for a book?
*  But the idea is you want other people to be able to open up bookstores.
*  Yep.
*  Hell no.
*  I know.
*  I'm not an economic, clearly, I don't even know.
*  It's like, I am not a rocket scientist.
*  I'm clearly not an economics expert.
*  I know.
*  But it's, yeah.
*  I see the arguments, but I also see a little bit of hater in those arguments.
*  Thanks for writing that quote for my book, by the way.
*  My pleasure, my friend.
*  That was really great.
*  When is your book out?
*  They can preorder it now, but it comes out in May.
*  And you can preorder it where?
*  Amazon.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  But then it'll be in bookstores.
*  We're talking about Amazon, and your book is coming out on Amazon.
*  That is nuts.
*  That's like a ghost.
*  It's like they know.
*  Hey, back to the comedy store thing.
*  Wasn't there a story that someone came in, a waitress came in, and all the chairs were
*  stacked in a pile?
*  Yeah, but I never talked to that waitress, did you?
*  No.
*  I don't even know if it was a waitress.
*  I've talked to people that have had weird experiences.
*  Yeah.
*  But you never know, man.
*  People are tired.
*  I know.
*  There's a lot of people that have had a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  There's a lot of fun.
*  a little bit weird.
*  It feels a little weird.
*  Yeah.
*  I was weird when I did Argus' show down there.
*  I was like, he might be haunted.
*  Argus has got some good fucking material, man.
*  Argus is a hustler.
*  He's always writing.
*  It's no joke.
*  No joke at all.
*  I saw him kill the other night in the main room on a Saturday night.
*  I was like, he is fucking good, man.
*  With jokes written like that day, that week.
*  Yes.
*  I know.
*  Really current event jokes, but tight, good, serious jokes.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  He's doing really good, solid jokes.
*  He's no joke.
*  I follow him a lot.
*  I end up going on after him a lot there, and I'm just always amazed.
*  Yeah.
*  Not just from the headlines, kind of this, like a late night show this kind of worked.
*  Isn't that funny?
*  Like funny.
*  They're good jokes.
*  No, like funny.
*  And he's a guy that never threw in the towel.
*  That's the thing about Argus.
*  He writes all the time for periodicals.
*  He writes jokes for newspapers.
*  Like that and he runs I think something crazy like at least ten miles a day what yeah
*  In Hollywood he's out there and that the streets are his gym. He gets out there
*  Yeah, we were hanging around the store one night and Argus pulled in with fucking sweatpants on all sweaty and shit
*  Huh? I go. What are you doing? Well, just get back from a run
*  He was out there running. I was like, whoa
*  Yeah, he's a he's the real deal
*  I mean, he's been at the store forever from the 70s from the seven mean he's to date Mitzi
*  He did you didn't know that no
*  Yeah, he was Mitzi's boyfriend. There he is. That's Argus Hamilton
*  Young Argus your son
*  In a time machine, yeah, I mean he's been swinging at the store forever. Look at him
*  I was in eighth grade. Oh my god. I was in ninth grade
*  I was in high school. That was my first year of high school
*  He was already on the fucking tonight show. I probably saw him on the tonight show
*  You know, that's one of the things that inspired me to do stand-up is watching Richard Jenny on the tonight show Jenny. Yeah
*  Watching watching comics do stand-up on the tonight show was like one of my favorite things
*  Yeah, when I want to stand up but come on I'd be in my I had a TV in my bedroom like a 12 inch TV
*  Yeah, and you know, we had rabbit ears get whatever was on regular network
*  Yeah, yeah people don't even know what that is anymore. It's so crazy folks
*  There's a signal that's in the sky and you can pick up the TV if you put tin foil on the end of it
*  You'll get even better. It's even better reception
*  You had a fuck with the antenna remember like you could stand there
*  I would stand there sometimes and hold it in a certain way and you know when it was really great when it snowed
*  Right when it snowed out you got great service
*  Ionization or something something happens with cell phones too, you know, yeah when it snows out better cell phone reception
*  Yeah, just something going on with I still use one from time to time because in LA depending on where you are
*  There are a lot of free 4k HD stations that are going over
*  Wherever you are through the air and then we've watching sporting events because that's the clearest
*  It would be because we better than what you're getting streamed online when a helicopter would go over your house
*  The signal would break up
*  Yeah, the way yeah, yeah, how did it affect your toaster
*  So the helicopter though would fuck with the air and it would mess up the signal it's all waves, right? Yeah
*  Weird I remember my we had this tiny little TV room in at my grandparents house and the men would sit in there
*  On this tiny little couch and I'd have to hold the antenna
*  So they could watch the game so I used to have a wrench to change the channel because the thing broke off
*  Remember those little piece of plastic you have to click click click to change the channels and the thing broke off
*  So I'd get in there with a wrench and have to pop pop. That's how you change the channel
*  Yeah, I used to keep a wrench on top of the TV. Yeah, remember we're finding the finding the UHF channels. Yes
*  Oh, like this is crazy
*  Oh
*  My god, just crazy uncle Floyd was the guy in New Jersey
*  Yeah, most people don't know who he is. I worked with him. You did I did stand up with him
*  Yeah, he's still out there. I think now is he really yeah my cousin
*  I think saw him in some place in Wayne, New Jersey or something. Dude. I did a Bob Gonzo gig with uncle Floyd
*  on the shore in Jersey me and
*  The other is look at him very nice guy bowtie plaid jacket me and Otto and George. Oh
*  Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Yeah, and look he's a handsome man. I fucking bombed
*  You did went on after him eight shit after for uncle Floyd. Yeah, they didn't want to see me at all
*  Would he they're into him would he do songs or would he would just do stand up? I don't remember
*  I don't remember
*  I believe he brought puppets and he had a show on UHF that just ran forever
*  Forever in New Jersey. Yeah, uncle Floyd show Monday through Friday 630 p.m
*  And he just kept cable television network of New Jersey. It's like public access. Look at him Wow
*  Yeah, it was like public access. Yeah, do you remember public access?
*  You used to be able to do your own show you could go down the public access station
*  Yeah, I did it. There was a guy named Larry Rappucci
*  me and I
*  Think Todd Parker were the ones we did like when we were both all three of us were open micers
*  We did a show on cable access TV in Boston. We went it was your own show
*  Well, we just did a show. I think we did one episode and I was wearing a dress. I
*  Forget it was like a game show like like a dating show type of deal. It's we created it ourselves
*  It was I'm sure it was terrible. Yeah, but you were doing it, but I was wearing great
*  Yeah, and then so one of my friends said did I see you on TV wearing a dress I was like probably
*  All these maniacs that's the only people who would do it. Oh, yeah, right
*  And there was that the porn one in New York. There was a porn one
*  Kind of porny. She was famous. She was like legendary in in New York. Oh, I know who you're talking about
*  Right. Well Howard Stern had a cable access show didn't he? No, he had close he had W. Oh
*  That's right, which is like Channel 9 and that's right. He had a weird gig weird like small show back when Howard Stern was
*  He was still huge, but he wasn't huge like he became yeah, but he was he was popular
*  Yeah, he was big at the time. He was big but I'm trying to come I think it was before private parts
*  It was a fart man during that whole year before then even Jackie the joke man
*  This is the girl the porn girl. Yeah
*  That's right, yeah, and she would do it wasn't like, you know, you couldn't go complete porn
*  But look she'd have yeah, she would say so now making fun of it
*  Oh, that's an SNL sketch right on a robin bird
*  But she would have like a lot of drag queens on and also the pornographic robin bird sued time Warner
*  Okay, and she had a cool voice and she was just she was just a mainstay. Well, do you remember when there was a
*  Radio talk radio channel in LA like Tom Lycus was on and
*  There was two girls that would talk about sex all the time. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I forget they have one of them
*  I think was in Playboy, right and they had
*  Tim Conway
*  Jr.
*  Conway and Steckler, uh-huh. Remember?
*  Yeah, man, they had there was a channel an all talk radio channel and this was in the 90s
*  I remember because I would listen to it when I was on the way to news radio
*  I would listen to the radio when I was on the way to do the set right to the set. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's like in the morning hour. Yeah in the afternoon. I was coming home. Oh
*  That's where you guys were sunset sunset and gaur. Yeah, I think we're at CBS
*  Radford
*  Originally maybe for a little bit
*  Right. I did hardball at CBS Radford and then sunset and gaur
*  Right and we're looking at all those other shows like real shows like yeah shows on friends
*  Everybody has envy. It's funny always you're on a network show. I'm thinking if I only I could be over there and this day
*  It's one of my fondest memories, but there was a time. I remember we were all sitting around the set and
*  we
*  We kept getting moved. We got moved no less than nine times over the course of five years nine time
*  Yeah, we just kept getting we see the thing is with shows back then in particular
*  Yeah, it all is about who owns the show. Mm-hmm
*  Okay, if NBC owns the show and you know, then you're golden
*  They're gonna put you in the great spot and hook you up on their network
*  Yeah, they're gonna put you like right after friends or right after Seinfeld. Yes, the sweet. Yeah, that was a Thursday night was the sweet spot
*  Yeah, they used to call the hammock spot right between friends and Seinfeld
*  Well, yeah, yeah some people would call it that and it was
*  we're all sitting around the set and
*  one of the guys
*  From the you know, but someone brought in the ratings. Yeah, fuck and then everyone's complaining and this now
*  Everyone was so down and I was like hey last time I checked we're on fucking TV
*  Like I know I know we're like number 80th
*  Yeah
*  My friend Lou Morton he was one of the writers who come in every day with a shirt
*  With Sharpie the number that we were on and one day he came in and said 88. I was like really like
*  Fuck news radio. Oh my god. We didn't do well until we got canceled
*  News radio did great in reruns. That's a chance to see how funny it was. Oh, that's so weird. Yeah. Yeah, it's so weird
*  It's weird how many times that happens to mm-hmm like Arrested Development and yeah, well a lot of those shows
*  It's all about where it is. Yeah, I know I know it's all about where they put it. Yeah
*  so wait, so the it was on that all talk radio was that the guy who would
*  Was his name who would he would do all the voices he would do all the characters. No, he was on
*  Phil Henry Phil Henry Phil Henry would Phil Henry he would and he still does it if you never heard Phil Henry
*  He's a goddamn genius. Yeah, Phil Henry would answer the phone and then he would be the caller
*  So he would call up with these
*  Ridiculous he would say ridiculous shit. Yeah, well you like how can this guy be real if people get so angry
*  Yeah, and then other people would call in like that man is so ignorant and then he and he said no, ma'am
*  You're ignorant. I am standing here in front of the Journal of American Medicine
*  Just go on these and most people were in on the gag
*  Yeah, I wouldn't even say most people maybe like 60% of the people on the gag. Yeah, great
*  I was so good being parked in front of my house like listening to it like
*  It was amazing yeah, yeah, I think he is I think you're right. What does he do these days?
*  Does he have a radio show? He's probably working. He's probably working with Uncle Floyd
*  The Phil Henry show is it on the radio?
*  The YouTube's official HQ for sat through
*  Today's show spot iTunes. I feel about when I hear about okay. That's good
*  So when I hear people are still doing radio radio, I'm like
*  Do you have any other options is there other way can you get out I'm on Sirius XM right now that's different
*  That's different. Oh, you mean like to rest. I mean to rest
*  Yeah, like radio like over the over the air radio. Yeah, I know but you know what there is something like I've been
*  I was in a couple towns
*  Columbus, Ohio
*  Denver even where they have a strong
*  Terrestrial radio thing. Mm-hmm station that's popular Austin does Austin still does lean Bob
*  It's such a cool thing and we've kind of lost something like mmm
*  Cuz they're talking about the show that's coming to our town
*  It creates a sense of community that you don't have in other things right and it's live
*  Yeah, it's happening over the air tools coming in this weekend. We're gonna do we'll be there
*  Censored that's a real issue. Yeah
*  I mean look one thing that we all owe Howard Stern a huge debt of gratitude
*  Is that he was sued by the FCC? Yeah, I mean he legit
*  Yeah, yeah, he was sued. He lost a shitload of money. The the media company was a company that
*  Had his show
*  Whatever the company was. Yeah, they were fined
*  Hundreds of thousands of dollars right for him like for almost nothing. This was during the Bush administration
*  They were going after him. Do you remember that? Yeah, I remember it dude. They went after him
*  They went after him hard to the point where it was scary
*  Yeah, we're like you would you would hear about it. You know, like what?
*  Yeah, what and and you would hear about the things that he got fine
*  See if you can find the things that Howard Stern got five things you got fine. Yeah, let's pull that up
*  Oh, really? Listen, man
*  Whatever anybody wants to say about Howard Stern that motherfucker opened the door for all of us all of us for me 100%
*  Yeah
*  Okay, let me see. The first thing is the fart man stunt. Well, he got fined for that on television
*  That was on television. He showed his ass
*  Okay, it's not really surprised that he exposed his butt cheeks and a $10,000 gold spandex superhero costume blah blah blah
*  Where's it say you're fine too? Where's it say you got fine for that?
*  I
*  Guess this is up. I don't it said is almost outrageous offenses. I got
*  He was he was answer my my joke I saw yeah
*  Well, there was a lot of stuff that he said, you know that you would look at it today
*  Like in terms of like a podcast you'd say listen even this only right not radius. So here's the things that he got fine for
*  Let's make that look at the fucking numbers man, August 12th 1993
*  $500,000
*  Infinity broadcast network all right and find
*  $600,000 and
*  $500,000 $600,000 December 18th 1992 and then August 12th 1993
*  $500,000 so within a year a
*  Six months time even look 90 to 2004
*  Look at that in one in one year's time six months time. They get fired one million
*  One hundred thousand dollars she's fucking insane man. Well, I wonder what the offenses were
*  It's fucking language mostly language. I'm sure it's language or subject matter potty humor, you know
*  Fuck man crazy. I mean we think about this today in terms of like what we get away with on podcasts
*  Oh god. Oh my god total freedom for total freedom, and I think a lot of that was open that door was open because of Howard
*  Stern was it say that it says playing the piano with his penis
*  She recorded that Chris okay, let me read this
*  Wjk
*  JFK FM in Washington DC became the third infinity station to air the Howard Stern show in
*  1988
*  two months later and
*  stall mail of New Jersey mistakenly tuned her radio
*  To
*  Hear Stern talk about having naked women in for an upcoming show
*  She recorded the fucking snitch
*  She recorded the Christmas party broadcast in December 16th that featured a man playing the piano with his penis
*  a choir singing about gay sex to the tune of white Christmas and women being hypnotized to achieve orgasm
*  Under the referral of her senator this fucking crazy lady called a senator and congressman
*  Stumble fire filed a complaint with
*  Transcripts and a tape of the program the FCC reviewed the evidence and asked infinity in October
*  1989 for an explanation as the material in quotes may have violated federal law by including in
*  Decent programming during daytime hours and that funny like at nighttime. It's okay to get naughty. Yeah
*  Carmesan
*  argued that the term
*  Patently offensive in its new ruling was vague and the sexual references cited were no more offensive than daytime television
*  Shows Geraldo and Donahue which used similar terms without repercussions sure his response was later rejected
*  FCC yeah, so they started finding them back then in 88
*  I would imagine that for terrestrial radio a lot of that still holds right?
*  You could get away with a lot more now yeah and because of him
*  Because of Howard Stern because of all the I mean look and he was under the gun man
*  He's stuck to his guns. Yeah, he kept doing the same program
*  I mean, it's it's a vastly different program now, but and people criticize him because of that, but look he's a different person
*  Yeah, you shouldn't have to do that old show. He's he should do whatever he wants right?
*  That's who he is now right exactly you know, but I work for
*  NPR do this live from here, which was Prairie Home Companion, and I do this thing on that show and
*  there's they have comedians on once in a while, and they have musicians and
*  They are really strict when when a comic is about to go out there
*  He's told 20 times what he can and can't say hmm
*  It's like really really really strict, and if you violate it if you say the wrong thing
*  They get a fine for every station that it airs on throughout the network. Oh Jesus. Yeah, so they have a hundred stations
*  There's a hundred fine. Yes exactly
*  That is it's still it's still really serious, and that's censorship six o'clock in the evening
*  In the East Coast it's so ridiculous. It's you know look I
*  Get it if you have a program, and it's a rated PG program
*  And you know this is the way you want it because it's for kids and families and stuff like that
*  But for the government to step in it's ridiculous. Yeah, it really is ridiculous and the fact that this was
*  You know that people had to endure this for so long right?
*  I mean like before Howard Stern people have to realize there was no one there was no one like that there was right Don I amus
*  Who is kind of controversial in some ways yeah, he was and then Stern who is just a totally different
*  Animal yeah, yeah, he opened the door for podcasts for sure yeah all these outrageous people doing podcasts
*  He made the roadmap right yeah hundred percent
*  Well show the other was that here's you can come over to this side of the street
*  No one's gonna mess with you well
*  And when they opened up the door like what you're on Syria satellite radio Syria satellite radio is also
*  Responsible for podcasts because they showed that you could do things uncensored right they were the first
*  Place yeah first real outlet serious XM like both of them together, but XM
*  And you know then they merged right so if you're subscribing to it that means that you're willing to participate you're paying for it
*  You know it's not like public
*  Terrestrial radio where if you just get in your car and it pops on right so if you were listening to opi and Anthony if you
*  Were listening to Howard Stern like you could hear
*  Wild shit right and then
*  Podcasts sort of came out of that right and like this podcast is directly because of opi and Anthony 100%
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, because they set it up the way their show was and you've done it. Yeah, it's a hang
*  Yeah, you would go in there and everybody would hang out real loose very loose guys would come in hey Tom pop is here
*  What's up, Tom? What are you doing? I'm playing Caroline's and this now making bread
*  Yeah, and everybody would have a good time and right no there was no structure to it
*  Yeah, where Stern had much more structure
*  Yeah, a lot more bits, and we're gonna go into this now and yeah that kind of thing and he was actually a classic radio
*  Yeah, he was a you know he worked the board and shit. You know yeah, he was moving the dials and stuff writers
*  Yeah, I had people working for him. It was it was he was more structured opi and Anthony was more of a hang right?
*  Yeah, and then Anthony started doing live from the compound
*  He had this house right in Long Island
*  With a fucking machine gun posing in front of a green screen singing karaoke, and I remember thinking god damn
*  I wish I did that in my house
*  Like I want like that setup right he had a studio set up at his house
*  Yeah, I need one of those
*  Just anytime you want to just go live and start talking about things right and it would stream on and you know the internet was not
*  That good back then yeah, right yeah all this happened like starting
*  Yeah, I think he was doing like 2006 or so while he was still on the show
*  Yeah, yeah, and they were giving him a hard time about it, right?
*  They were telling him you can't do that and he was like but it only gets more people to listen to the radio show, right?
*  It's not gonna take anything away from the radio show yeah, which I definitely agree with they got fired right when they
*  With that church thing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah with the st. Patrick's Cathedral Martin was just here. Yeah. Yeah, he was yeah
*  Yeah, that's great. He's the last guest. Oh, yeah, I love him. He's the best. He's the best
*  He's so quick. He's a maniac. He's so funny. He's Larry. Oh god
*  He's yeah
*  They got fired
*  And then he realized how quickly everything can go away because he was like fuck I was out of money
*  And I think they were fired for like two years. Yeah, they couldn't be in the air in two years
*  That's right, and so then
*  Then they went to Sirius, right?
*  They got hired by Sirius
*  And then you know and they had that thing where they would do both at the same time right they started with serious
*  But they were back on terrestrial and remember they would do the walk
*  I did it with them you do the walk walk we would do we would broadcast with wireless microphones walking through New York City
*  Yeah, yeah, it was like a block and a half away, so you'd get out
*  It would strap you up with these wireless mics yeah, and then we were walking down the street talking it was
*  Great I felt I really felt fortunate to be a part of that like yeah, I was a part of history
*  I know it felt like there was it was like
*  It was that's where the action was for comedians to it. They had such a home for comics a hundred percent
*  Yeah, and anybody and you look forward to like there was never a time where I didn't want to do it
*  You know they were like I don't want to get up in the morning and do this it was like fuck yeah
*  Patrice would be in there
*  When my shows were sold out I still made it in there
*  I'm going in there man. It's fun. Yeah, I felt like it was a clubhouse like you felt like a part
*  And you also could be yourself. Yeah, you know it's like right you unabashedly be yourself
*  You know Norton's in there talking about tranny's and you know and his experiences with ladies of the night
*  No, it's crazy shit, and Patrice was ragging on everybody. Yeah, Louie would be there
*  There's us yeah, I mean little Jimmy. Yeah, that's back in the day
*  Look at Tom Segura, that's right. Look at Tom. That's fat Tom fat owl Tom
*  Tom was heavy then boy whoo, and that was when we were
*  2005 I was said that you're talking about the silver leg break in this oh, okay, so those
*  Yeah, that wasn't that's not the XM studio
*  Wasn't isn't it?
*  It seems like it is it's serious. Yeah, it has the wall the glass wall
*  All serious was yeah, but that I felt I feel real real fortunate
*  Yeah, part of that it was cool. Yeah, it's a good time and Anthony when he would
*  Latch into something was as funny as any of the comedians. Oh, he was genius. He still is he's still hilarious
*  Yeah, I haven't heard his new thing very often. Well. It's all the subscription
*  You know he's decided to go to a complete subscription model so that no one could ever fuck with him anymore and pull him off
*  Of things and he has a loyal fan base. It's compound media
*  He actually has a whole bunch of different shows that people can get from compound media
*  So you get a subscription and then you get his show and a bunch of other shows, right?
*  he would just get that glint in his eye when they got on to a subject and you just
*  It was like a like a dog with a little toy and just knew he had something
*  There's a real there's a real benefit in what he does in that
*  The only people that are going to that are people that want to see his show and hear his show so he can say the most
*  Outrageous shit and he's never gonna get fired. Yeah, cuz if people subscribe or they unsubscribe it's probably you know a wash
*  You know, right, right, you know, I'm sure he gained subscribers
*  Maybe he'll gain subscribers because we're talking about it
*  But but it was that interesting thing where they it was the combination of those guys 100%
*  You know what I mean? Like they yeah over the years had that rhythm
*  Mm-hmm and you know and Opie would lob it in and then just to see it all break up at the end was really sad
*  Fuck yeah, it's uh, they should come back. Yeah. I mean I don't think Anthony wants to yeah
*  I don't think you would ever want to again. No, it got pretty
*  They got yeah, they got they don't like each other anymore. Yeah, and it's too bad
*  I mean in Anthony on his show they would shit on Opie. No, they would
*  Got bad. Yeah
*  And then Opie got fired he was doing Opie's Opie and Jim was he doing
*  Yeah, Opie radio Opie radio and then he got fired for filming someone in the bathroom
*  So I was taking a shit and he filmed him. Yep
*  Radio pranks gone awry. Yeah
*  Shame people when they're shitting but if you came like if I was taking a shit you open the door you hate you
*  Motherfucker I would never think you're gonna lose your job for that. We would be laughing
*  Yeah, exactly. So it's like comes from an innocent place. Yeah comes from a place that we would all do something like that
*  sophomoric
*  Yeah, you know it depends on who it is
*  Yeah
*  Like if you had a guy working for you and you were the boss and you're shy and you filmed him shitting then it would be
*  Totally. Yeah, then it's like hey, you don't do that
*  No, there's in your inner circle of what you know
*  It's gonna be allowed but it was like me and I opened up the door when Jimmy was taking a shit and I filmed him
*  You know, he was screaming and laughing at me and it would be fun
*  Right, it wouldn't you know, we're equals. Yeah hands girls just spilling out of the
*  Drop ceiling
*  Hey Joe
*  Little lizard man in there, but there's there was a thing that you could get on that show where it was just
*  It was so wild and loose. We had this do you remember stalker Patty?
*  Yes, it was stalker Patty. We I had these pot breath strips
*  And if you took one of these breast trips, it would literally put you in another dimension
*  They were so goddamn strong. I gave Sakura one on a plane and when it landed he goes
*  I almost I almost asked to be taken off the plane. I go you serious goes. Yeah, I was I was like I was I can't do this
*  No, I go come on man. Really?
*  Took it to he goes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I goes I wasn't ready for that
*  I was ready for that
*  He goes before the plane took off it had already kicked in and I was on the runway and I was saying I gotta get
*  Off this plane. I gotta get off this plane. I can't do this
*  I got to get off this plane. The worst feeling in the world. We were flying to Florida
*  So anyway stalker Patty was there and we gave her a regular
*  Listerine breast strip and told her that it was a
*  Pot breast trip and she and so she started having these psychosomatic hallucinations
*  Started believing she was hallucinating. Oh, Larry Ari stood in front of her with his balls out of his pants
*  He pulled his balls out of his pants and zipped up everything else
*  So it just be a sack just sack out said they were in our was like, do you are you hallucinating you see and she's like
*  Oh my god. Oh my god. It's like what what's going on? What's happening? And she started seeing things that weren't there
*  So ridiculous, that's hilarious. But again, no fine stalker Patty
*  And not getting fine. That's it stalker Patty trips out. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  What year is that?
*  You had hair so it was probably
*  2009 eight. Yeah
*  My head 2011 or 12th, but he's you know, or she
*  Was a regular on the show and she was like a legitimate crazy person
*  Yeah, and they would have her on and yeah, you know, they would have all kinds of wacky that's from the stern model to
*  Back and all that stuff. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he opened up the door for all that stuff
*  Yeah, I mean they always had these wacky radio characters and it kind of kept that ball rolling
*  Yeah, it's such a weird thing because they were like, you know, they're obviously there's a segment of the audience is laughing at them
*  But they're so grateful to be part of the show. Yeah, you know and they they they
*  It gives their life a little bit of a meaning the weird thing is it's not that long ago man
*  Well, you know, we're talking about 15 years ago. The world was a completely different place now completely
*  I know there was nothing there was nothing like podcasts
*  But what's amazing like we started the conversation talking about the public access stuff with Uncle Floyd
*  Like yeah, there's always been that thing for funny odd people to try and get out there and do their thing
*  You know what I mean? It's kind of it's endless. It never stops like it's it's inspiring
*  There's like this force to just be silly and go out there and try and communicate with other silly people and that all this
*  Media is changing but that thing everyone's still uncle Floyd. Well Robin Byrd there's now
*  Um, I was having a conversation with my manager today and she was telling me there's now
*  900,000 podcasts what there are
*  900,000 ranked podcasts out there that are regular podcasts that are being done
*  There's only 300 million plus people in this country, right? Right, whatever it is 320 million. Yeah, so there's
*  900 so there's almost like one in three people have a podcast. Oh my almost
*  January brings flurry of releases pushing podcast tally past
*  900,000 how many of those are my responsible for inspiring? I need to know cuz I tell everybody to do a podcast like how many yeah
*  I would I will claim
*  200,000 yeah, I think now it's probably like a hundred thousand but even that nuts. That's amazing
*  It's a lot of fucking people out there making podcasts. It's like, you know, it's the same as Twitter
*  It's I'm right. Everybody has a voice. You could just have a voice
*  You can just create a mic get a mic and you have one. Yes, right
*  And here's the thing like if you're good it'll grow yeah, I mean it's really that simple, right?
*  If anybody wants advice on podcast, the one thing I say is be consistent, right? Just grind you have to grind
*  You grind put them out all the time
*  That way people know they can count on them right as soon as you disappear for a while you lose people
*  Yeah, as soon as you take time off you lose people
*  so that happened on mine we my buddy was like off for a couple weeks and it was and
*  And you feel it yeah, you lose your momentum
*  Yeah, and then you lose the people that are addicted to it and then they find something else they go to this one or that one
*  They're just you see the number nine hundred thousand so many people. Yeah
*  Crazy, that is crazy just out there talking about everything
*  It's a different world and you can use that world in a beneficial way
*  Like people get things out of it like in this podcast. I've had so many interviews with
*  Inspirational people and now people like David Goggins and cam Haynes and all these folks that have
*  Really inspired people to change their life Jordan Peterson
*  Yeah, I mean so many people and have inspired people to take chances and change their lives. Don't you feel like we're in this?
*  cultural moment where
*  people are
*  Actively trying to go further like we're always doing that right? We're always progressing. Yes, we're always doing that
*  But it seems like there is a there's a bump right now. Yes, there's an acceleration
*  Yeah happening where people are really not only thirsty for it
*  But also participating in it for sure you can only think it's gonna it's gonna leap us further a lot a lot quicker
*  Well, it's definitely
*  It's definitely opening up conversations that people wouldn't have normally had and it's it's one of the reasons why it's so valuable
*  Right now is because this is a weird time for humans communicating because so many people are communicating electronically
*  Yeah, so many people are sending text messages and emails and not not talking to each other for long periods of time face to face
*  Yeah, like you and I've been friends for years. Yeah, our biggest conversations. We have are on this podcast for sure
*  I mean we have dinner together and stuff like that, but yeah sitting in a podcast studio. You're locked in right?
*  Staring at each other across the desk is very unusual way to talk
*  Yeah, and you're also freed up to ask each other things that you normally don't ask and we have Jamie to make sure
*  They're not talking shit. That's a little weird. It's a little weird that they hit he's leering over there
*  He's shopping for toasters right now. He's the world champion Googler people from Google want him to come in and teach them how to
*  I'm not joking man. Oh, really people have asked him to come in like how are you? What are you doing?
*  Like people watch the show. What the fuck is he doing? How's he doing it like that? Jamie's the goat. Yeah
*  Getting it done. He's the greatest one-handed Googler in the history of the universe
*  Like you probably are one of the best one-handed typers ever because you always have to type with one hand
*  Yeah, you've probably developed a new skill in a mindset when I'm here
*  That's what's crazy it's like you anticipate
*  What we're thinking and then you pull up the thing before I go. Can you pull up? Oh, there it is
*  Yeah
*  Here's a problem with ghosts those ghost shows
*  Well, yes, those ghost shows are bullshit a hundred percent
*  One of those guys got in trouble recently because he made a ghost book and he like plagiarized a bunch of shit
*  Like like blatant like copy and paste. Yeah. Yeah, geez. Yep
*  It's just theater ghosts are some of my favorite theaters when you go
*  Right when you go perform in these theaters and you talk to the people I always asked it was you have a ghost
*  Yeah, there was a little boy. I was in where was I?
*  Oshkosh
*  Oshkosh and
*  There was an old theater and the guy who runs the theater said, you know, we've had this
*  Legendary they keep talking about there's like three ghosts and the thing and they're having a cocktail party upstairs in this like cocktail lounge off
*  the balcony and his son this guy's son ran into the balcony and
*  He's talking with people because I gotta go get him and he goes in there and the kids leaning over the balcony
*  Talking to the stage having a conversation with someone. He's like, yeah. No
*  No, that oh, this is my dad
*  What he wants us to go down there?
*  Who wants us to go that guy? He wants us to go down there. There's no one down there
*  The thought about that with little kids is that little kids have not dulled all of their senses with the pressures of the world
*  and all the other information that we carry around in our heads and all of our
*  Ideas of what's real and what's not real and that little kids are open. Yeah, and then they could see things
*  Flea from the red hot chili peppers was talking about that with his son that his son is like I think it was flea
*  Yeah, the Sun is like tuned into spirits in a way
*  That he was looking at it was like maybe it's that these kids are not like maybe we all have that in us
*  But it's blunted right by pressures and life and the lack of sleep and responsibilities and relationships and yeah work and fear
*  Yeah and everything right and and also like we define how the world is right?
*  We get it in our head that this these are the parameters for the world
*  Yeah, this is how the world works and that's it and go to work and fucking button up your fucking sleeves
*  My belief yes, yeah, I believe system is gonna carry me through yeah, yeah, this is what it is. It's a fact. It is
*  You know, that's why it's good to smoke it up once in a while. Oh, yeah, kick the doors open
*  That's one of my favorite things about pot
*  Yeah, is it it makes you aware of how weird things actually really truly are?
*  Yeah, when you don't weird things are when you don't do it for a long time and then do it
*  Yeah, which is like my schedule
*  You take it makes you look at everything you all your structure that you've
*  Formed over the last whatever amount of time and you're like you see it from another just from another perspective
*  It just makes you look at it and be like, oh, well, that's kind of unnecessary. That's kind of yeah you do she
*  That's that's on
*  Easily opens those doors to just woof. Hey when when you're saying you're reading all those books about the Native Americans
*  Yeah, did they talk about their?
*  Spiritual stuff. Yeah, they're there. Well, certainly they had a lot of spiritual stuff, but there's a lot of peyote rituals
*  they're really into peyote and they actually particularly was important at the end of the
*  Native Americans free range when they got they all got
*  You know conquered and moved into reservations then the peyote rituals became increasingly important for them
*  Oh really? Yeah, why then cuz they're fucking filled with despair, right?
*  Dude the stories of the reservations are one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever read anywhere about anything like yeah
*  massive amounts of people dying from starvation and disease and
*  You know, it's horrible man people losing like most of their kids
*  Most of their family members and you know the the amount of people that are left
*  You know like Native American reservations. I don't know how many people live on them
*  But I don't think there's any growth or population boom. It's not like there's a bunch of you know
*  I mean like the native cities are growing inside these reservations and they're becoming more and more
*  Yeah, affluent. It's not happening. They're destroyed the fucking alcoholism too and it talked about that in
*  Black elk life of an American visionary is most recent one that I'm reading
*  They're talking about just the alcoholism and that all they were converting all these
*  Native Americans to Catholicism, right and how they just hated being Native American
*  They felt so terrible about it because it was just that their identity was just so disparaged by
*  You know just being conquered and moved into reservations and extreme poverty and they would see these other people and they'd be like
*  These people look happy and healthy and you know, and then they're forcing this religion on them
*  Yeah, the the most heartbreaking when you'd see those old photos where they were putting them in
*  In traditional dress like making them all of a sudden wear suits and ties and shoes
*  Yeah, it was like so sad
*  It's fucked up man. It's it's one. I mean, I always knew it was fucked up
*  But the genocide of the Native American people is one of the most overlooked parts of our history
*  We kind of like brush it aside like we're aware of it, but we don't discuss it all the time
*  Yeah, like, you know, they killed like 90% of them with disease
*  Intentionally no just no just exposure to Europeans. Oh really? Yeah, like some small tribes
*  90% of them were wiped out because of smallpox and all sorts of other diseases. Oh jeez dead no defense for it
*  Yeah, just these people show up. Yeah stuff. Yeah
*  It's awful. How do you
*  How do you I?
*  Have a daughter that's going to going to school. She's gonna college college. Yeah
*  And so she's learning all about the world like all the darkness of the world
*  Yeah, you know, you mean all you have to do is read history and not just you know our history
*  Globally, it's just that it's a nasty nasty tale
*  Yeah
*  and I feel though that I it's I want to like prep her before she goes even deeper when she goes away to the schools and
*  Starts learning about it even even more intensely you could tell like I don't want her to lose hope
*  You know what? I mean, right like there's it's a very very dark upsetting thing to learn about
*  But you have to kind of realize we're at least muddling through it. Mm-hmm. We're trying we're we are progressing we are
*  Conscious of that history, right? So don't lose hope, you know what I mean?
*  Like I'm afraid to send her out there without that armor in a way. Yeah
*  Don't lose. Hope is huge right fine. You find good people. They're out there find nice people. They're out there especially
*  You know, I think people were very scared today. Mm-hmm, and I think this is a
*  pivotal time
*  With with human beings so much change, right so much change culturally and there's so much change
*  You know just in the world
*  Well, you're shifting and it's also tearing down like all the institutions that carried us for a certain amount of time, right?
*  Those things are no longer really
*  Important in this in the world like churches have fallen off and sure sense of community just the town squares
*  Sure, you know, we're isolated and so it's it's all of the shift
*  Yeah
*  And that's whenever there's that shift and change in anything even in your own life when you have to move all of a sudden your
*  World is a little rocky and shaken. It's like it feels like the planet is about to move
*  It's like we're all packing our boxes
*  It doesn't feel like there's any official structures anymore that are valid like news. Where do you get your news?
*  Yeah, who's more full of shit CNN or Fox like it's like where's the news coming from right?
*  There's no one place where you can say like these guys aren't biased. Yeah, this is not you know
*  This is the one guy that is telling it straight. Yeah, there's no place like that, right?
*  So, how do you know what's really going on in the world? Yeah, it's about and and also no one's watching
*  Those goddamn news shows are dropping off late night television dropping off everything's dropping off. Yeah, it's watching
*  No, right attention that shit anymore, right?
*  so all these structures that used to be there are primary places to go for entertainment and being informed and
*  One of the weirdest things is people rely on folks like me. Yeah, like hey don't do that, right?
*  I'm not the place to go. You want to hear some talking shit. Yeah, you can come to me
*  You want to be informed listen
*  I'll guide you in the right direction
*  Tell you where where I go or I'll tell you who to listen to but don't listen to me
*  All right, I've way too much on my plate and I'm not really paying that much attention
*  Yeah, you had that light shone on you last week, right? Yeah, that was adorable, you know, it's always fun
*  it's not funny, but we
*  Always talk about you know at some point that they're going to do it at some point. They're going to say evil stuff
*  Everyone gets their turn. Oh for sure to be tried to be knocked down. Yeah, right
*  well
*  That's what cancel culture is all about right and it's this thing you look into just
*  Only look at the worst aspects if someone exaggerate those magnify them and ignore everything else, right?
*  The thing about it though is it's really difficult for people to swallow now because they know what that is
*  You know most people who listen to the show. Yeah, I mean there's been
*  1500 plus episodes they know the fuck it actually is well that was what was cool about all of the
*  Comments in defense of you in the show is like it was like this person had never heard the show
*  Like you couldn't you couldn't you can't listen to this show without understanding the openness in the diverse
*  The
*  The acceptance of diverse points of view that and so also comedy like you can't take comedy
*  And take it out of quote out of context and put it in quotes take a section of a bit
*  Yeah, and use it as evidence of homophobia or transphobia or anything else, you know
*  And it's it's disingenuous and they don't realize that by doing that. They're just
*  Making people distrust them more. That's all they're doing. You're not gonna convince someone that hey
*  You know this show that you love that you listen to this guy all the time. Yeah, actually evil
*  He's actually plotting against gay people and trans people and yes everybody else that's protected and sacred in this world
*  Yeah, you know, yeah, no, it is amazing though
*  But it's like the comedy and comedians have kind of filled the void of a lack of grown-ups around
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like yours like it used to be Walter Cronkite or with that evening news and that's where you got it
*  And then you saw Johnny Carson or whatever doing the funny stuff, right?
*  To be mocked. Yeah
*  Do yes
*  Everything needs to be mocked. Yeah, it's one of the great things about comics is we mock each other. We're always busting balls
*  We're always asked talking shit to each other
*  It's the best it's fun. Right exactly and we actually enjoy it. Yeah, you know, I think it'll all turn around
*  It'll all come back around. I think what we're experiencing right now is just a shifting of our focus
*  Yeah
*  As a culture and these things that used to be important like sitting around the radio listening to the evening news
*  Yeah, shit is non-existent anymore. Nope. Nobody sits around the radio
*  Trying to find out what's happening in the world like the whole the whole family like listening
*  Yeah bet when they were doing that they couldn't have imagined anything different. Yeah, but you do I do
*  I do crave and my wife craves a connection
*  It's it's like what are you listening to or what are you watching? Yeah, what are you listening to when you're going out?
*  I'm listening to this American life. Well, I'm listening to Jordan Peterson. All right, so I guess we're not gonna have something to talk about tonight
*  Yeah, but we should both listen to this one so you can come back and talk about it and have you know
*  We're both thinking about the same things. It's kind of a cool that can be sense of community. Yeah, you know
*  Do you guys have a show that you both watch?
*  We've been watching Schitt's Creek lately. What's Schitt's Creek Schitt's Creek is hilarious
*  No, I never heard of it. It got picked up by Netflix. It's over
*  It's or it's I think they've shot the last or they're shooting the last but Eugene Levy
*  Levy, okay him and his son Dan created this show about a rich family who?
*  And loses their fortune and ends up in this small town. Oh, I think I have heard of this
*  it's so we talked about that there and O'Hara is on it and and
*  There's two other actresses that are just killer they're just such defined characters, it's very small show
*  It all takes place in this little shitty town Schitt's Creek and they're there
*  They're like these affluent arrogant kids and parents and is so it just hits the jokes are just
*  fast and
*  Cutting. No, it's such a good. Oh, it really is good. All right
*  It's the first thing that I've we've watched in a long time
*  I haven't we haven't been watching anything for so used to be on pop TV. Yeah Netflix bought it. Yeah, exactly
*  All right. Yeah, Schitt's Creek and that's father and son
*  Created it together and they're just so damn funny Wow. Look at those eyebrows. Look at the matching eyebrows
*  Catherine O'Hara is just on point. She's so damn funny. Oh, all right, man. Good. It's good
*  I know kind of short, you know, they're easy to digest
*  I was into mrs. Maisel, but the last season I started off kind of clunky. I haven't gotten back to it
*  Yeah, I know I feel like I should watch I watched the first two seasons. I really enjoyed it, but
*  It's it's hard, you know, it's it's one of those things where it's it's so close to home because it's stand up
*  Yeah, and then how's the Lenny Bruce? He's very good. He's good. Yeah, he's very good. It's very believable. Yeah
*  Yeah, I was just talking to Kevin Pollock. He's yeah. Yeah. No, he's the dad. Yeah, he's great. He's really great
*  I listened to a Lenny Bruce thing recently
*  What's it called it's on YouTube it's a it's a
*  it's a the it was an album that someone put out about Lenny Bruce the killing of Lenny Bruce and
*  It all it talks all about it's some new stuff that I'd never heard like his young daughter talking at the time and
*  Talking about the court case
*  Similar to the you know, Howard Stern thing like the case just that devoured him. Yeah that in the heroine
*  Which is also, you know suspect of were they trying to get rid of this guy kind of a thing, right?
*  But it was a very interesting little documentary audio documentary about the fall of Lenny Bruce
*  And you talk about just you know, you're it's such it's almost cliche how legendary that story is
*  But just to be reminded of how completely alone he was
*  Just using just having people show up in a comedy club not even a club just a nightclub
*  Because there were no comedy clubs that he was that brave to keep going to keep speaking while the whole
*  Government was coming to squash him like a bug. They were arresting him that the the bravery of that is
*  astounding
*  Astounding and like Howard Stern he opened up the door to all of us
*  I mean that guy lately that guy opened up the door to all stand up and this is created the art form essentially
*  Because it wasn't yeah wasn't the same
*  When he left it was different. It was different before him. It was jokes, right?
*  It was jokes. Right exactly and he it became cultural commentary right from talking about religion talking about the government sex
*  Yeah, love all of it loss. Here is an interesting thing that I was I was like, so what happened when he died?
*  Like so he dies and I believe 67 or 69 and I was like, so what was the next thing?
*  Like if they were really clamping down on him
*  It was only four years later that Carlin's case for the seven dirty words came up
*  Hmm. It was that close Wow that in my head. I always thought that was a much different era
*  Yeah, that Carlin was much later than but it was only four years later that they were still
*  attacking so he kind of
*  You know picked up the the fight in a way. Hmm
*  Is that remarkable it is remarkable, yeah, Carlin was arrested several times as well, right he was pulled off stage
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, just for speaking and again, what is that 40 years ago? Not that long ago? No, I know
*  Amazing like if they could see what was going on any night in any club
*  Anywhere. Yeah, they would be
*  If you could bring Lenny Bruce to the Comedy Store on a Friday night, he'd be like, holy shit
*  What the hell? I gotta up up my game
*  You can't get arrested at all anymore. Yeah, I mean watch Brian Holtzman. Yeah
*  You can say so much. Yeah, you say anything. We're the cops. Yeah, but he
*  But it is pretty cool. You can get it on YouTube. Listen to the kill. Okay, cool. Yeah
*  I've listened to a bunch of his old stuff. It's weird. It's weird how comedy is
*  It has a lifespan. It really does. It doesn't work. It doesn't culturally things are so different that
*  The taboos have been broken to the point where it's what he's saying is it's normal. It's like a museum piece
*  You listen to that album
*  Carnegie Hall Lenny Bruce Carnegie. Yes. Yeah, I've heard that
*  Yeah, and it's cool like to hear the way he talks and the stuff in the
*  His style and all that but as comedy that make you laugh. It just doesn't work. It doesn't work
*  No, it's just a different
*  Bits that are still valid. He had one bit that he did about gay people
*  He's like it's illegal to be gay
*  So what do they do they take you and they arrest you and they put you in jail with a bunch of men
*  One have sex with you
*  It's
*  Valid yeah
*  Illegal to be gay anymore, but yeah, no, there's crazy is that yeah gay sex was in many places not legal then right?
*  Which is fucking insane mind-blowing mind-blowing insane in our lifetime in our lifetime. Yeah, weird. Yeah, so strange
*  So the guy who plays him in miss Maisel is very good. Very good. Yeah, very believable. Yeah
*  Dustin Hoffman's the best Lenny Bruce though. Yeah
*  Yeah, he's fucking amazing. Yeah, and I think that's the best version of an actor portraying a stand-up comedian, right?
*  What about Tom Hanks and punchline?
*  What about
*  Sally Fields crushed him
*  I
*  Mean I guess Tom could have the locker seemed he seemed a little bit like a comic he did he seemed like an 80s comic
*  Yeah, he pulled it off. They go when it wasn't her type guy. Yeah, it wasn't him. That was the problem with that movie
*  It was the stuff around it. Yeah the locker room. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Go up and do their thing Oh the locker room magic had to get changed to do comedy
*  What why we need a locker room magic of the store just put in a locker room
*  Hey guys, we have a locker room for you now like what so great
*  Why are we taking off our clothes putting on my show clothes? Do you have cameras here? What are you doing? Yeah, this is my outfit
*  yeah, the
*  this scenes of like the the actual clubs themselves were interesting because I
*  Saw punchline when I was an open mic or I think punchline came out in 89
*  Sounds a bit earlier
*  Think 88 87 it had to be around 88. Is that it 87?
*  October 88. Okay. So that was right when I started because I started august of 88
*  So it was right right after I started right and I remember thinking wow
*  I was like it was so romantic to just to be involved in this thing
*  I'd only been doing it for a couple months at that point in time
*  So I just just signing up on sunday nights for open mic night and getting my feet wet
*  But I remember watching that movie
*  They just I loved everything about stand-up then i'm so excited about comedy
*  Yeah, you know that there's a movie about comedy now. Ooh, so and were you disappointed or were you into it at the time?
*  I didn't think it was very funny. Right? I didn't laugh, right?
*  There was there was no moments in that movie where I was like ha ha ha
*  Yeah, but I always remembered the part that excited me was when they were in the diner in the middle of the day
*  Like she came comes to tom to get jokes and stuff and I was just like how cool is that you they
*  They're not in an office
*  It's the middle of the day and they're just at a diner that seems so exciting freedom. Yeah
*  Just show up and go to the movies with your friends. I still love that. Yeah, I still love it
*  Families and responsibilities. I'd love to call one of my buddies up. Hey, what are you doing man?
*  Do I go to the movies? Fuck? Yeah, let's go to the movies. Yeah, whatever you want to do
*  Hanging out with your buddies at like two in the afternoon at the movie theater
*  Nobody else is in there the best laughing. I the very first day that I I quit my day job
*  I was in new york and I finally was a full-time comedian and I walked up to central park with my buddy
*  And it was packed on a tuesday just packed with people and I remember being so disappointed like
*  What are you?
*  This is all it should only be comedians right now. Where do you?
*  How do all you people have off from work?
*  I'm like, oh other people can figure it out too to get a day off
*  Well when you're in la and it's like two in the afternoon you're on the road and it's fucking jammed up with people like
*  Where are you people going? Yeah, why isn't everybody at work right now? You should all be in the office you fucks
*  What's wrong with you?
*  That is like one of the more attractive aspects of comedy to people is that freedom but that's also that freedom
*  That was one of the reasons why so many comics are so irresponsible and lazy
*  Is because they have that freedom. Yeah that they don't actually sit down and work
*  Yeah, like how many of us have actually like you've written a book norton's written a couple books
*  How many comics have actually written books? Yeah, it's fucking that is the real test of whether or not you have discipline, right?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, write a book
*  Yeah, no to sitting there every day and do it but how long did your book take? I this is my second book
*  That's right. And they take they take uh,
*  I don't know. I guess like all in probably two years. Do you enjoy the process? I love it. Enjoy the completion of it
*  What do you enjoy more? Uh the process of it really? Yeah, I love
*  There's something about the routine when I can get locked into
*  the routine
*  Of this is how I it's almost like it creates a
*  The routine creates a space for your creativity in a way
*  So if I get up at seven and roll in there with my coffee and sit at the desk
*  And open it up and go to work and know that this is happening now
*  Good or bad. Yeah that routine that that
*  It's giving it's like going to church. It's like this is the time when this happens
*  Right. This is the time when the writing is going to happen and it could be a week of horrible days
*  But then all of a sudden a couple great days happen
*  Yeah, I just love that discipline of it and then just going to work on it and and then playing with the words and
*  then revising it revising it revising it and
*  I
*  I love it. I that part of it really surprised me
*  that this is a
*  A very comfortable cool place to be
*  And I could spend years here
*  Mm-hmm
*  That's great. That's a great thing to be really into doing because it's so productive. Yeah
*  Do you write stand up? Do you write stand up like that as well?
*  Do you sit down and write stand up in front of your computer?
*  Um, yeah, not from a whole cloth like not from out of the blue
*  If I can double up my cliches it's um, but like mostly i'll rewrite
*  I will rewrite stuff like if if I try something out on stage tonight
*  and then
*  Uh have an idea listen to it or just remember it and then i'll kind of noodle around with it and see if I can
*  Go further with it actually writing. Mm. Yeah, so where do you come up with your premises?
*  Are they just just random observations throughout the day thought random thoughts while you're driving? Yeah
*  Yeah, something somebody says some ridiculous thing that you saw somebody do. Yeah
*  Uh, that's you know on your mind stuff
*  That's kind of on your mind
*  And then like if i'll get like we're talking about the tree like all of a sudden you're getting that joke that I was watching
*  The other night start getting that thing down
*  And then your mind almost starts to think about it all
*  In its downtime, you know what I mean? And then all of a sudden you start
*  To to pop it up, but I I have lost so much thinking I was going to be able to remember it
*  That I just started writing more. Mm. I just started putting it down. I just started writing and and it's been a real savior because
*  There'd be whole things like they were valuable that I just let go because
*  I just didn't remember got into the routine of performing it
*  But if I could have it down, I was able to keep track of it and go further with it
*  Yeah, I think that's gigantic. I I use a a couple different programs, but one of them is called scrivener
*  Right. You told me about that
*  But I really like about that as I set up my premises on the left side
*  So all my premises and then when I click on them, it shows me the the whole bit
*  Yeah, and I just started doing that over the last like three four years
*  Yeah, like really writing out all the bits and then having them categorized
*  And yeah, it's apparently there's a way to set up microsoft word like scrivener
*  Which would be way easier because microsoft word is my preferred way to write because they're saved also on an app on my phone
*  Right. So when I write bits on microsoft word
*  Write it and then i'll just go to my phone right pull up my microsoft word
*  So you're in the club just take your phone out. You can see everything you've been writing. That's huge
*  It's huge. It's huge pages does that too. Well also on my iphone the notes application
*  So i'll copy and paste shit into notes. Yeah
*  Now it's I I really feel like and I think that's what
*  writing the books did
*  was it made me realize the
*  Uh the real value in getting it down it could always get better like yeah
*  I would get it. I would get it really good to a point
*  But then realizing like this stuff even though it's killing
*  Could even be better. Yeah, always it always right and the and and the moves the changes that happen
*  At that stage are so small
*  That to me is like the the the writing that yeah, that's the smallness of it. Yeah, those little pauses
*  The little beats this little extra one extra word. Yeah, right boom just a change in the word
*  Yeah, well I have that feeling too when I watch someone someone will say something just one word. I'm like
*  There's something about one thing that shifts it yeah. Oh man, you know who's really making me laugh yesterday in the car
*  It was uh cat williams. Oh, he's hilarious. God
*  So crazy, he doesn't get spoken of enough because he's so crazy. I think but man that he just you know
*  people just hit you right and
*  He was just going off about
*  Uh the election and trump running and all of this kind of stuff and I don't care what side you're on
*  This was he would just destroy you. Yeah, he was just the way he talks and when you talk about the words
*  That's why I popped into my head
*  He pulls words out that I would never think of using and he just says them in that in his style
*  God, is he a naturally funny?
*  God, yeah, I don't know if it's natural but he's definitely funny and you know when oh man
*  When he was more active when he was really touring a lot like during the pimp chronicle days
*  He's one of the best in the world. Oh my god one of the best in the world
*  He was a monster going stage of destroy all that michael jackson stuff. Oh my god. That stuff was so good
*  And dangerous at the time. I know people hadn't come to grips with this idea that michael jackson was a pedophile
*  He did not care especially not in the black community and he was out there just fucking swinging for the fences
*  It's so good. Oh my god. Oh, he really makes me laugh. He's a straight-up killer, but yeah, I think
*  For most folks the pressure of the that high level celebrity is overwhelming
*  It just it just fucks with you. Yeah, it just fucks with you
*  Yeah, it could wear you down and break you down like it did with chris tucker
*  It did it did with martin lawrence. It did you know, it does a lot of these great comics
*  Yeah, a lot of guys. It's a weird thing. It's fucking very weird
*  There's the pressure of that many people coming to see you that many people relying on you that many people like
*  Waiting for you to fail that many people hating on you. Yeah, you know and and then he clearly there was some substances involved with him
*  Sure, you know like he had some shows where he would just go on stage and start yelling at someone in the front row
*  And then leave yeah, right exactly did that. I think it was in oakland just went on stage and someone heckled him
*  He's like fuck you bitch and it's like going going crazy. This one guy doing this tonight
*  And then he got off stage and this fucking you know, there's 5 000 people there to see him like what you can't just leave
*  Uh
*  Do you feel that pressure the bigger that
*  I guess yeah, I do but I also feel extra love like it's happy. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice man
*  That's good. I but i'm also aware that other people have fallen into these holes
*  You know and i've benefited from the fact that these people have kind of carved this path and showed me where the holes are
*  you know and also
*  I
*  Like i'm definitely crazy, right? Sure. I definitely have some
*  mental health issues, but i'm also
*  I'm very thoughtful in meaning that I think a lot about things and I spend a lot of time alone just
*  Trying to look at things like an outside observer, right?
*  Trying to look at things like how would I if I was me but not me look at me and what would I say to me?
*  Like how how would I how would I tell myself to gain the proper perspective?
*  How would I evaluate my situation correctly? How would I how would I proceed? What would I do?
*  What would I say man? I wish I had done this. Why don't I do that now, right? You know that kind of shit
*  That's good. That's
*  so much of it of figuring
*  stuff out as being conscious of it, right being aware that i've got a
*  Problem going on or I have to right if you're that means you're thinking about it
*  Yeah, the thoughtfulness with everything with your diet with with your family if as long as you're constantly thinking about it, right? You'll
*  You're giving yourself a chance to yeah, you can correct your path. Yeah, right, right
*  You can correct your mistakes and correct your path and there's no way you're not going to make mistakes
*  Especially if you're putting out as much content as I do. Yeah, there's no way and it's doing as many shows as I do
*  There's it's I've accepted that and i've also accepted that
*  These moments of adversity I always come out on the other end a better person a better comic better better everything
*  Yeah, better human and the cool thing is too that
*  the you'd have to
*  you'd have to almost you'd have to change exactly who you are for for
*  It all to turn because it's not that a network is going to tell you that you did something wrong and take the wrong stance or
*  Misinterpret you it's really your audience
*  It's that relationship with them and they know what you're about, you know what I mean?
*  Like that's the beautiful thing about not having a job job, right?
*  Like you could say something that you even didn't mean and as long as your
*  Fans who know and love you give you a pass then it's okay. Then it's going to be okay
*  And i've definitely done that i've definitely said some shit I shouldn't have said
*  Yeah, but when you said that you wouldn't eat my bread. That was really weird right now
*  I got it. You brought a knife. You set it up. I didn't that was jamie's doing this is one of our sponsors is a
*  This is a kamikoto knife. This is a beautiful japanese knife. Look at that bitch. Wow. Oh my god, basically a sword
*  Is it heavy? No, I mean it's really well made
*  These are dope dope kitchen knives
*  It's not serrated. Do you have good kitchen? I figured I could cut bread though. Yeah cut the shit out
*  Do you have a good knife set at home? Um, i've got good random knives. Oh, well i'm gonna hook you up
*  Yeah, because yeah, i've got they sent me a couple of these. Oh, look at that. That is a good knife
*  True
*  Look at that bread. Look at that. Come on. It's bread. Come on
*  Fuck this carnivore diet
*  Let's get in there, baby
*  This is tom papa bread. Come on son. I want to start I want to try eating meat for jamie and I were talking before this
*  We're like, yeah
*  Could you do it? I don't yeah, I think I could
*  Is it is it hard to do? Oh, thank you. It's not hard
*  Pardon our chewing. Do you get bored?
*  You're okay with it
*  Come on when this come out of the oven
*  um
*  Four hours ago. Oh my god
*  That's so damn delicious. Let me get a piece of that peel
*  How big you want like this like half that's okay, that is good stuff jamie's
*  It's rolling over here looking at this
*  I always forget to bring butter
*  Uh, he did one time but yeah, but this is fucking fantastic without butter. Come on
*  There's something to be said for pleasure, right?
*  Yeah a lot just like a balance
*  between having
*  Too much indulgence and pleasure and no discipline and having too much discipline and no pleasure, right?
*  Exactly. But like you said you felt so sick after going to disney
*  Yeah, but I ate ice cream
*  Uh, I'd um, i bet your kids are happy when you go off the leash. Oh, yeah, they love it, right?
*  Well, they just love disney. Yeah
*  The new star wars ride is off the chart. Is it it's so crazy. What's it like?
*  Well, it's 20 minutes long
*  What? Mm-hmm. That's awesome, dude
*  That's amazing because most of the time they rip you off with like a three-minute ride, dude
*  This is 20 minutes long from the moment you get there
*  And the scale of it is insane. There's there's one time when you get off of this thing
*  And you know you get transported into this area where all these storm troopers are
*  And the air it's a hall. It's enormous and there's like a hundred storm troopers standing there and behind them is space
*  There's this huge
*  You know 4k screens that show space and you really feel like you are on a starship in space
*  That's filled with storm troopers. It's fucking bananas. Wow, that's amazing. So you're flying on a you're flying on a uh,
*  Well, you get in you move in you go for a flight like this is see all those wheels marks on the ground
*  Yeah, there's no tracks
*  Everything is run by computers. The whole thing is run by computers, right?
*  Bro, it's amazing
*  I mean it's it's just the most intricate and advanced ride disneyland has ever done by far
*  20 minutes every step of the way you're like, I can't even believe that they did this
*  It's I mean, it's it's 100 next level. Wow
*  That's like look at the look at the fucking detail of this place
*  You go into this and it just it seems like you are in a real spaceship. This probably doesn't even
*  Do it justice. Oh, no, it doesn't
*  Why are you that my jaw was dropped the entire time? I was like, wow
*  And is it more than just the ride? Is it like a whole section? Well, it's a bunch of different interactive experiences
*  There's people there's actors right that are there, you know, like the like they're storm trooper folks and rebellion
*  Whatever the bad people. Yeah, they've they talked to all the people they're walking around
*  They ask you like are you here to fuck or you were able to mess with little kids and
*  Oh, really?
*  That's awesome. Yeah, you remember the resistance. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen the new movie
*  Not so good
*  The movies have become disneyfied. Yeah, you know and that I don't say that in a good way
*  There because disney makes some awesome shit, but they're yeah, it's just
*  Commercial like feeling wow, it's just fake
*  Right. No heart. It's just full again. Yeah, right. It seems like it's gone through a corporate diversity filter
*  when they're making sure that everyone we have let's have women run this and women generals and this and that and
*  Yeah, they're hitting all the right, right. It's by formula
*  But the the movie feels like it's formulaic too. I haven't seen the very latest one, but the ones before that
*  It's like they don't feel
*  They don't feel special. Yeah, like I mean, I know this is not the best example, but
*  Tarantino movies still feel like Tarantino movies that motherfucker still know how knows how to make a real movie
*  Like you get out of his movie and you're like, whoa. Well, it feels like it's made by him
*  Right. It doesn't feel like it's made by a company
*  It's it would be impossible to make once upon a time in hollywood with with a corporate structure, right?
*  With if we're without him. Yeah, right. It would be impossible. Yeah, did you hear his expect?
*  Accepted speech for the best screenplay. He's like usually you you could thank other people at this point
*  But I wrote this by myself. So
*  Well, that's why it's so good, oh i've got a good movie for you. Yeah. Yeah, uh, this was um,
*  I was uh
*  Talking with my buddy steven soderbergh who digests not only as a name drop
*  Did you just drop a name? I did but to give credibility to this to this selection
*  uh
*  His movie of the year was give me liberty
*  This small independent film made in milwaukee with a lot of like regular people it follows this one guy
*  Young guy whose job it is to drive. Um people with disabilities around in a van
*  Through milwaukee, you know like through like a public service and it follows him through one whole day
*  It's so good. Wow. It's such a good film
*  You really got to see it. It's the the performances are crazy good. You don't know who's an actor and who's not
*  It's just so well done
*  It really makes you feel like it's the total opposite of what you're talking about like that big committee kind of a corporate thing
*  To see something like this like you could just feel
*  The filmmakers hearts and souls pouring into the movie those movies that are really big
*  You also have to think of how much money's invested in them, right? Oh huge and if they go bad
*  It's a giant financials like and go bad means like not make a billion dollars
*  Yeah, well or lose money like dr. Doolittle, right? Right? Yeah, I think that that movie's probably gonna lose money
*  Oh really well just real dangerous coming from a guy like robert downey jr
*  Who's amazing? Yeah, who's so incredible in the avengers and that movie made fucking kajillions of dollars
*  Yeah, all those movies are amazing and then he goes and does this kids movie and it really doesn't do well
*  Like those are dangerous
*  Those movies are like oh jesus we're on thin ice. Yeah back to the shore
*  Right, you know dangerous for who for the actor? Yeah for the for the production company for everybody
*  Yeah
*  What if they come to you know the production company a year later and say hey
*  We have a new idea for a movie in the product or in the theater or the studio and the studio is like hey
*  Fuck you. We lost a hundred million dollars on you. You fuck right see all the issues with cats
*  Oh, that was probably the biggest financial disaster here, right?
*  They pulled it back to like redo it and they're gonna re-release it
*  So many people are making fun of it. They're gonna do it again. They like yeah, they left
*  Visual effects team only apparently like nine months and they like left watches on people that didn't cover their hands up
*  All sorts of bad stuff. I saw it with my kids
*  We what my daughter's like we have to see good though like fun to watch as a disaster
*  No, okay, because in the beginning like we thought my daughter's like we have to see the worst movie of the decade
*  How do we not go see that?
*  And we were the only ones in the theater it was really brutal and at first how bad is it it's bad, but it's so bad
*  Is it good? No, it's so bad. It's not good bad. Wow. Yeah, it's just bad
*  It's so bad. It's not good bad
*  No, like in the beginning you have a laugh and it's like, all right
*  I can see why this is gonna suck and then by the end of two hours you're like
*  No, i've just been hitting the head with a shovel. It's that bad. Yeah, it's really bad
*  Wow and you're seeing all these people that have been in other things who are just not talking about it, you know like jane
*  judy dench and
*  Well, it's it's bad. There was some other movie that came out recently that someone was saying was as bad as the room
*  Oh really movie the room see if you can find that movie as bad as the room
*  Yeah, there was a whole article about it saying that this this movie is so bad
*  That it's good that you need to I didn't even finish typing it and it kept and it fell autocompleted. What is it?
*  Well, it says now he's showing off his skills. No, it said that it
*  Finished up says the room is the worst movie ever. Yeah, hollywood or something
*  A movie as bad as the room what shocked the one that shocked me that everyone was said was so bad was
*  Will farrell and john c reilly
*  In that and the new one right the was it sure it's a canadian movie so bad. It rivals the room
*  Yeah, what is that? It's called ryan's babe
*  I don't know never heard of it. Is that a reef's article? Yeah, it's from four days ago
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah that people are telling me you have to see that's from 2000. It was that movie
*  Yeah, it's not a new movie, but someone just discovered
*  Trailer online, but I figure you put will farrell and john c reilly
*  Doing anything and i'm i'm in right and people really rebelled against it that girl's hot though
*  This looks pretty good in her underwear running around for some reason
*  Perfect
*  Oh, this is terrible. Yeah, it's pretty good. This looks really bad. There's some rough edits in there
*  So how are they gonna redo cats?
*  Like I don't know they're gonna read it. I think they already did
*  I think they re-edited it and then but if they re-edit it
*  Everyone's gonna know that sucked so bad. They had a re-edited. I've never heard of that ever never
*  A movie gets released and they're like you fucks. Okay, we'll fix it. We'll be back
*  A week
*  How much money is cats lost?
*  Oh
*  It almost happened that sonic movie. They just didn't put it out
*  They were they like put out a trailer and the internet freaked out and they're like, oh, okay
*  We'll we'll redo it. Yeah, they spent a bunch of money redoing it sonic the hedgehog. Yeah coming out now
*  It actually looks a little bit better. Yeah, they gave him like better teeth or something dude. It's hard man
*  Making a movie has got to be the most brutal thing ever
*  So guys in here that have poured their heart and soul into a movie for years
*  Like motherless brooklyn. I know movie. I know that in here. Was it good?
*  I don't know and I love him and I love the subject matter. He loved that movie
*  He really did and he put such heart and soul into the soundtrack. Yeah, and I haven't seen it. Yeah, it's such a you know, sometimes
*  Jesus christ cats headed for a hundred million dollar box office loss
*  Oh, what the fucking shit? Oh my god. Oh my god
*  I just keep thinking about them all like being at craft services and backstage like this is pretty great, huh?
*  Have you seen that celery sticks rebel wilson is committed to losing weight?
*  She's lost a ton of weight and people are mad at her. Are they really? Yeah, they're mad at her because they like her being big
*  They like her being big because she's big and i'm big and everyone's big and it's okay to be big and I heard
*  It's healthy to be big and so like people are criticizing her for losing weight
*  Oh, come on criticizing adelle as well. Oh really?
*  Yeah
*  They said adelle they they're angry that adelle lost weight because they love the fact that she was this huge musical superstar and she was obese
*  And so she wanted to take care of her health trying to be healthy a little longer and then you're you're turning on us
*  Well, she became a role model for certain people I guess
*  and they
*  Be a role model for you to get healthy. We can all get healthy. Yeah, come on away from tom's bread
*  You'd only meet just don't eat it all the time you just don't eat this all the time
*  Well, I didn't gain any weight this weekend. Yeah, I didn't gain any weight. I ate all that shit and then uh, I fasted
*  Sunday night until uh monday. I went to yoga monday morning didn't eat
*  Um till right before my first podcast and uh, I didn't gain any weight at all. It's great. Yeah, but you it's
*  Moderation it's it's eating like shit over but what was interesting was the pains back pain
*  Knee pain, what is that? It's inflammation
*  It's inflammation
*  Your body does not want to have to process all that stuff and they think that may be the root for many people of a lot
*  of causes of pain and discomfort is just inflammation
*  Heavy diet right sugar, right sugar is the big one
*  So if you get all that out of your system your body can what go to work on the stuff
*  It has to go to work on yeah
*  You get all that shit out of your system and your body doesn't experience inflammation from your food, right?
*  And if you're eating food that like, you know grass-fed beef, you know, or in my case elk, you know
*  Or yeah, I mean i'm sure vegetables are not bad for you. I just did it to try to find
*  What so I just did it to try to find out what it's like to only eat meat, right?
*  When you have no carbohydrates one of the things that's most amazing is that there's no crashing
*  You would eat and you don't feel any different after you ate other than the fact that you don't feel hungry
*  Right like you don't crash right? There's no ups and downs and peaks and valleys. My energy levels were amazing
*  Really?
*  How quickly energy how quickly two weeks in two weeks two weeks and I noticed I felt amazing really and I was shedding weight
*  I was shedding a lot of weight. I think it was like seven pounds down two weeks in jeez now i'm
*  12 pounds down 12 ish somewhat of that. I was 193 this morning
*  I was weighing about 205 before I started this diet really. Yeah, man. Oh, man. I feel a lot better
*  Like a lot better really. Yeah. Yeah. So what would you what would you recommend?
*  Would you recommend people just do that or do you think you?
*  I think for people who have an autoimmune disorder there are I do believe there are certain people that have an adverse reaction to
*  Some plants some foods that's what an elimination diet is all about
*  It's like trying to find out what are the things that bother you?
*  Yeah, but for me, it's like what I did is I just took a lot of multivitamins
*  I took a bunch of different vitamins and nutrients supplements on top of this carnivore diet
*  So i'm only eating meat, but then i'm taking all the essential vitamins and amino acids and i'm also taking fish oil
*  So i'm i'm covering all my nutritional bases
*  Bases, right, but i'm not doing it with food. I'm not doing it with plants
*  I'm only eating grass-fed meat and then i'm or or uh elk and then on top of that
*  I'm i'm taking in fat from like bacon like bacon
*  I needed fat because elk in particular is very lean if i'm only eating elk if I eat grass-fed beef i'm fine
*  But with things like elk you really do need some extra sources if you don't have fat would you start to feel bad?
*  Yeah, your body doesn't like it. Yeah, your body does not want a low fat diet with low carbohydrates
*  It's there's a thing called rabbit starvation. Have you ever heard of that? Yeah
*  People got that in antarctica
*  I think it was in harika in the cold cold climates where they were uh shooting rabbits and eating rabbits and they were literally starving to death
*  Even though they were eating all these rabbits because rabbits have no fat on them. So they're only eating this lean
*  Protein right but with no fat at all and you start feeling like shit
*  different explorers have found that too that yeah, you know when they
*  You know
*  We're living in places and trying to eat only the the foods that they could harvest off the the land
*  They're eating animals like they had to take in fat if you don't take in fat, you feel really bad
*  Yeah, yeah
*  So a little bit so if you could balance it, so would you say?
*  Maybe 80 percent this is what I would say try it
*  Try a carnivore diet try it straight out right and I think you'd be amazed at how good you feel now
*  Here's the thing. Is that a honeymoon thing?
*  like what is it like if you extend that to 90 days or uh, you know 365 days is that
*  You're gonna feel like shit eventually right is it gonna start breaking your body down right? I don't know
*  I only have experience in 30 days
*  But in my experience in 30 days, it was enormously beneficial. You did say something in your post about a
*  explosive
*  Diarrhea it needs to have a new name
*  Diarrhea is not strong enough for what I was experiencing for real
*  Yeah, it was like someone was tapping into uh, like an oil like an oil well, geez, I have pictures
*  So why was that happening?
*  Um, well, I talked to dr. Shawn baker. He wrote a book on the carnivore diet. He's a physician
*  That's a carnivore diet advocate. He's been eating this way for two years two years
*  Yep
*  And he seems to think that it has to do with the colon adjusting to the fact your body doesn't have any dietary fiber
*  So you're not taking in any rice or bread or anything that's going to absorb the water
*  So your body's like what do I do with all this liquid? It's going out the asshole
*  How long did that last
*  Around two weeks two weeks two weeks of rocket fuel coming out of your booty hole. Ah, geez, but if you get through it
*  You get through and tom cigar is going through right now. He is yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, he he sent me a text the other day saying this diarrhea is astounding
*  No, oh astonishing
*  Oh, it's not coffee. Is it because you guys both drink coffee? I'm just asking just a general question
*  I mean, um, so you guys both can take a lot bro. It could be all kinds of liquids
*  Whatever kinds of liquids are coming out of your butt. It's not normal
*  I was really getting excited about trying this but here's the thing at the end of that it all goes away
*  Right at the end of two weeks my body adjusted and now it's not a problem at all really. Yeah, not a problem at all now
*  So what's breakfast?
*  steak
*  Or eggs sometimes like this morning. It was a steak
*  Yesterday morning, I ate six eggs, right? Yeah, just just whiff those down lunch. I don't eat lunch
*  Don't eat usually two meals a day, right? And then the second meal is usually steak
*  No steak either elk or or a beef steak
*  I think i've asked you this before but when whenever I think about these diet things
*  I always picture my family looking at me while they're eating pasta or
*  Eating like do you feel like an outlier at dinner with your family or no, they knew what I was doing
*  Yeah, they'd made fun of me and shit, right?
*  Oh, what are you eating steak? You eat steak again? Right. My kids are hilarious. Yeah, that's what I always
*  My kids mock me too
*  That's good. That's healthy. Yeah. Yeah
*  Um, you know, they didn't mind. Yeah, no nobody bothered my wife didn't care. Everyone knew I was doing it
*  Right. It was okay. Right. Yeah
*  Your wife's not like come on have ice cream with us. No
*  No, boy, that'd be a problem if she was yeah, you know if it looks so good like ice cream looks good. Yeah. Yeah
*  No, um, it was uh
*  It was an eye-opener, but here's the thing. Yeah. Sorry. Here's the thing about that that kind of stuff
*  You kind of have to commit right like if you just say i'm gonna try to eat healthier. It's too loosely defined
*  I know I know I was doing the intermittent fasting
*  and lost good amount of weight and then it just kind of like plateaued and I feel like
*  I'd like to be you know, like 10 pounds lighter and it's
*  I'm working out i'm doing all that stuff, but I feel like it needs something to shock my system to go to it
*  Nothing will shock your system like this carnivore diet. Yeah, including your butthole
*  But you will lose a lot of weight. I lost I mean I lost a legitimate 12 pounds of fat
*  Just fat my face got thinner. Yeah, like when I was washing my face
*  I would feel actually feels a little fatter now because I went through disneyland
*  There's some disney chunks disney
*  I ate a lot of dessert and you just had bread. I actually not really any fatter
*  But yeah, but joking around maybe i'm a little swollen. No, you look you look leaner. Well, I was real
*  I I was you know, I was getting fat. I was developing a gut like we did this weigh-in thing and so many people mocked me
*  I was getting a gut though. My my stomach was like hanging out
*  Also when we came in here to uh do that I had my it was december 23rd
*  And my family was in town and we had eaten like pigs that day, right?
*  I was I was bloated considerably bloated with food as well because it was nighttime
*  We had a nighttime podcast. It was like 10 o'clock or something like that, right? Pretty pretty late podcast
*  Yeah, well we all took our clothes off and got on the scale
*  Um, so I knew I was probably gonna do the carnivore diet anywhere, but that was like, yeah, let's just do it
*  Let's just do it. Let's go set it in my head. Let's just do it
*  Yeah, so knowing that for the month of january that was all that I was gonna eat. Yeah, that's that really helps
*  If you're gonna try to stick to something to have like a real solid schedule like so October's
*  Yeah, another perfect example for me lent. Yeah when we do sober october, we have one month
*  No booze no pot. No nothing. Yeah, there's something good about that
*  Yeah, you have that month because it takes it out all that kind of mushy brain stuff of oh, but maybe i'll just just now
*  We're celebrating. Yeah, we need a certain amount of rigidity occasionally. Yeah, that's how you get shit done
*  Yeah, and uh, I mean even if you are like writing if you said i'm going to write every day for the month of february
*  Yeah, you know every day. Yeah, there's something to that. It's the routine. Yeah, so something really beneficial
*  I'm gonna write for one half an hour every day if you do that. Yeah, you get things done
*  It's really true
*  If you just decide i'm gonna go on a carnivore diet for the next 30 days starting right now
*  Yeah, and just count down on your calendar 30 days from now. You'll fucking lose weight and you'll feel amazing
*  Yeah, I just don't know if it's a way to eat all the time. No, that's the thing
*  It's like it seems like an extreme thing that I would not be willing to maintain. Well, you're the bread master
*  Well, that's the thing you're the sultan of sourdough. That's why I want balance. I'm always searching for the right balance
*  I think a great move is six days on one day off
*  That's what I think six days on a rigid diet one day where you you look forward
*  To eating bread and pasta and drinking whatever you want and you know
*  Having ice cream and one day that was the question. He just reminded me of the question
*  No booze during that I drank booze. You did. Yes
*  Still lost all that weight, but I don't drink a lot. I drink like a glass of wine with dinner
*  Maybe two glasses. Yeah. Yeah, that's all I was shot sometimes before I go on stage. I shot a whiskey, right?
*  Yeah, so it's not a lot, right? You know if it's more than two drinks a night. It's unusual
*  You're cool with whiskey and then going on stage. Whoa, I like it you do
*  You don't feel like it's like you're just used to it. I would feel uh, whenever I drink before I go on stage
*  I just feel like a little off. Mm. I feel on you do. Yeah, I like it
*  Even when I film I do a shot right before I film. Oh, yeah
*  Really?
*  one shot
*  Really that's interesting good good shot of buffalo trace whiskey. Yeah on the old pipe
*  And you're good to go. Come on, son
*  That's wild liquid whiskey is wild liquid. It is wild. It's wild liquid, right? You want to get wild. That's wild liquid
*  Yeah, wild fuel. I don't know if I want to be wild
*  But we have different styles too, you know, yeah
*  Yeah, and it also helps me deviate when i'm riding on stage if i'm fucking around on stage
*  It helps me deviate like i'll go off a little tangent a little more courageous
*  Yeah, maybe or a little a little more reckless. Yeah better work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  And what about weed though in that same situation same thing. I like weed for that too. Yeah, that doesn't make you more timid on stage
*  No, no makes me more it makes me nicer
*  Right, but I don't think it makes me more timid. Right weed makes me nicer
*  Yeah, that's one of the things I like about weed like I need more things that make me nice to make you nicer
*  Yeah, it helps me when you look at yourself. You think that it's you could be
*  Mean sometimes not necessarily mean but I am naturally aggressive, right? Yeah, right
*  And that makes you a little bit more
*  Yeah, let's calm this fucking ride down
*  Let's realize like we only have some certain amount of time left
*  Yeah, when I get high, I want to call my friends and tell them I love them, right?
*  That's what I want to do. I know you know, I want to I want to be I want to hug people
*  Just want to be around them. Yeah, I want to be nicer. I know it is good. But I have yeah, I don't know
*  I haven't performed. I haven't performed high and how about tonight? What do you do? When you up?
*  Um, i'm not up tonight, you know, i'll be up on thursday thursday. Yeah, what are you doing tonight?
*  Yeah, chillaxing my wife. It's kind of uncomfortable because my wife
*  Has people over because my special airs tonight. Oh to watch your special you have to sit with them
*  No, they're gonna do it and i'm gonna I don't know sit out sit in the yard and put a cigar
*  I don't know what i don't be there for I can't
*  I can't why is she doing that at your house? She's so excited. Oh, that's nice. It is it's nice
*  They're all excited. They all want to do it, but I can't watch it
*  You know
*  Yeah, i'll be in the other room listening to if they're really laughing or not judging their laughs. That's terrible
*  Is that hard? It's a bad feeling man. You don't want that in your life
*  Yeah, but I do feel especially now like that that's all done and i'm moving into new territory that
*  The weed kind of isn't
*  Can play a good role. Yes for sure
*  How much material do you have set aside for this for you new?
*  Stand-up i've only got about 20
*  That's good though. When did you film?
*  October. Oh, so you gave yourself some time. That's nice. Yeah, november december january four solid months. That's good
*  Yeah, so i've got like this new direction a new like area of stuff, but it's you know, it shrinks the more you do it
*  Yeah
*  um
*  And the special was going to come out a little later. So I thought I had more time but then they moved it up
*  Isn't that exciting though when you're scared
*  Yo when you're on stage and yeah material you're scared you gotta write new premises and
*  Yeah, I was thinking about the other day that it you always feel like a young comic because you're always putting yourself back in a vulnerable position
*  Yeah, doesn't matter how experienced anyone is. Yeah, you go out there and i'm gonna do all this new
*  You're a child again. You have no weapons, which is great. It makes you youthful. It makes you like, okay
*  We're still like a kid and it's like no i've been doing this for 20 years
*  Yeah, there's a it's a great aspect of stand-up comedy when you do a lot of specials because it keeps you humble
*  Yeah, it really does. Yeah, and it keeps you appreciative of the art form. You never get complacent
*  Well, that's the coolest thing about this era of comedy
*  And I think that's how netflix has changed the game by having so many people put out so much content
*  It's making every that's seen by a lot of people. It's making everybody
*  Get on their game and write more. Yeah, the era of
*  Getting a headliner set and just rolling for 20 years is gone
*  Right, so it's actually taking the whole art form and pushed it further. It's great. Yeah
*  It really is. Yes. This is such a good moment
*  It's such a good mo and so many different voices coming in
*  Yeah, so from so many different places just not only in the culture but from around the world
*  Have you seen ronnie chang? Yes fucking hilarious great so different. Yeah
*  On stage with a suit real angry and shit. Yeah fucking great. I want to talk to him. He's cool guy
*  I gotta get him in here. Yeah, you know, yeah, I know I gotta get him in here. All right. I enjoyed his act
*  Yeah, I enjoyed it. He's a good guy too. And it was like I didn't he didn't remind me of anybody, right?
*  Delivery punchlines premises all of it seemed like yeah
*  Now that's recognizable and relatable but unique right exactly. Yeah, no, he's I mean, that's what's so cool
*  This is like the whole globe has opened up. It's like all these voices from all those different stuff
*  It's fucking great time to be alive. It really is it is it is and this art form, you know
*  I've been thinking about this a lot and I really think i'm gonna do something about this
*  I want to document how everybody does it
*  Because I think this is the only art form that is a global
*  Worldwide art form that's enjoyed by everybody. Yeah, that's not really documented. Yeah, right like
*  Musicians it's documented how they write songs. It's documented how you learn to play music
*  You can go to school for it. You know, you can
*  You could take classes online
*  When you're a comic man, you gotta kind of figure it out on your own
*  Yeah, and I I think we would all benefit from some sort of documentation and
*  Particularly for the people coming up the girls and guys coming up that are learning how to do stand-up now would benefit
*  Tremendously from like a guy like you breaking down how you do it how you started what's different now, right?
*  So i'm thinking about doing a series
*  Oh, yeah
*  And i'm probably gonna put it on youtube like like a podcast and do it like a podcast but call it
*  Like the comedy creation series. Ah, i'd love to be yeah. Yeah, I want to get want to get everybody like as many people as I can
*  Like tell me how you started how old when when did you start? Yeah, what year?
*  Yeah, was your first club and just break down how you do it? Yeah, that's a great thing because it's so varied
*  Yes, you know from doing the show with fortune
*  Uh, we saw the fortune femster. Yeah, she's a great fortune. She's hilarious. Yeah, her special is up right now
*  Is it on what sweet and salty? Uh netflix netflix as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she's so great
*  And uh, we're interviewing all these comedians. We had uh, jesus treo came in
*  I love him love him and he's such a unique story
*  So different. Yeah, you know his parents coming from mexico. He's got to care for them
*  He goes down to mexico where there's like this new scene coming up of spanish-speaking
*  Comedians, I mean that story you put that one and then you talk to
*  You know ryan hamilton two totally different planets. Yep, all in the same form. Yep. It would be great to watch
*  Fuck yeah, it would be amazing. That would be really good. The world needs to know how these fucking people do these things. Yeah, it's like
*  There's if if you don't know anybody
*  That can sit down and talk to you about how they do it. Yeah, it takes too long to figure it out. Oh completely
*  Completely like if you're in pittsburgh
*  I don't know what kind of scene pittsburgh has right? I'm sure it's got some kind of a scene
*  But how many people really yeah, you know, I mean and it couldn't you really how many really good ones are still there?
*  Yeah, that you can really learn from how do you how do you find out? Yeah, you know, no, I know that's a good thing
*  I mean when seinfeld put out the
*  Documentary like people still listen to watch comedian like young comics. Oh, yeah, because there's very few roadmaps out there. There's very few
*  Glimpses into how someone is doing it and how they're working
*  You know, there's been other stuff where people will show themselves on stage and they're just backstage, you know drinking or just going about
*  Their day like a road dock kind of a thing. Mm-hmm, but very few about process
*  Yeah, very few. Yeah process and you know, how much you've adjusted. Yeah, what do you do differently now?
*  What do you think about your old stuff? What would you do differently start over again? Yeah. Yeah, it's good stuff
*  Yeah, it's uh, we do it's a weird art form and that it really it doesn't have a class you can take
*  Nope. Well, they have classes
*  You know what those classes are good for getting you on stage they're good for that
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean very few classes are taught by legit comics, right?
*  Right, maybe there's some of them out there that I'm not aware of. Yeah, every class that I've ever seen has been taught by scrubs, right?
*  You know, they're probably gonna give you bad advice. Rick chrome does one in in New York. Remember Rick chrome from the seller
*  No, I don't he's great. He's like he's been around a long time and that's very valuable
*  He's like a real, you know a real thoughtful
*  Practitioner of it all you know what I mean?
*  And I've seen him just glimpses of him like when he'd be teaching downstairs at the cellar and it was like, okay
*  This is legit, but then you see some names of other people who are out there
*  Doing it and you're like, oh man
*  I would imagine it's good for you to to teach
*  Cuz like you can kind of like think about the art form or that would be really interesting
*  I don't know if I could teach it could you could you look I don't know take some young you'd have to be really careful
*  Yes, you don't want to mold someone into your style. That would be the front. That'd be the temptation. Yeah
*  Just tell them fuck you
*  Yeah, but yeah other things when you learn how to teach it's better like I got way better at
*  Taekwondo when I was learning how to teach
*  Those teaching through most of my competition days
*  Yeah, and it's one of the reasons why I think I got so good because I was breaking down the technique
*  Constantly I wasn't just doing it. I was breaking it down for beginners and showing so I made sure that my you know
*  My technique is very good. It's like
*  in my martial arts
*  You know career
*  One of the things that I'm known for is I do everything I do it correctly, right?
*  It's very crisp my technique is like I always I've prided myself I is that a word yeah, I did sounds weird
*  Yeah, I would pride myself on having excellent technique wasn't just that it was powerful. It looked sharp. It was correct
*  Yeah, yeah, just is the same way to guys get way better at jujitsu
*  I've never taught jujitsu, but guys get way better when they start teaching it right
*  Another cool part of it this era is that can meet people are staying comedians. Yeah longer
*  Yeah, right where people would
*  Do comedy they get blown out to a TV show or something because economically just to stay a comedian
*  Wasn't really feasible, but now you can actually make a living and it's actually a more valued thing in the culture
*  Like this is the first wave of guys staying in it. Yeah for their whole career and not wanting to get out
*  Yeah, there's they're not looking at it as an escape a way to get out of it
*  Someone was just asking about that like what was the last person that you know that had a special
*  Around the year 2000 that's out of the game now, right? I completely quit comedy
*  right
*  Who completely quits comedy? Yeah, not anymore. It's just too easy, you know, just think about those
*  You know afternoon diner trips and going to the movies and you're like
*  All that goes away if I got a job job. Yeah
*  Yeah, and the only way you would do it is if you're not making enough money
*  So then you would have to get a job job, right? Right? Yeah. Yeah, but no, I mean, you know even Eddie Murphy
*  He's seeing what's what it's become. Yeah, he's got to be regretting it at some point of like why did I leave?
*  Why did I stop doing it? Maybe?
*  But I mean he made him a lot of fucking great movies and he also grew real but he grew as a human being, you know
*  100 look no regrets. He's still you could still see just when he was just hosting. Yeah, it just pops out of him
*  It's just such a he's a volcano. Yeah comedy
*  If he had kept cracking at it all this time though. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? Even like a little bit
*  Would have been it would have been good for me
*  It would have been good for me to watch
*  It would be but would have been but it will be great to see what he does now because he's kind of committed to it
*  Committed to us. I think he signed a deal with Netflix for two specials for two. I believe so
*  I believe that's what I read see if that's correct one-handed type or genius
*  The thing they gave him a
*  Ton of money I could only imagine Oh the might I haven't seen it heard
*  It's awesome. So good. Is it so good got a huge response from people how he's not nominated is a is, you know
*  I know their nomination
*  Still he really should have been Ricky Gervais should host every award show from now to the end
*  Just a little those twats. No, we're on to you
*  Climate change is real fuck off get out of here with your golden man statue sit down taking a jet everywhere
*  Fuck off. He was so good. He was what I mean one of the best performances I saw this year for sure
*  Don't like yeah, I need to see it. I haven't you do he's brilliant. He's brilliant and it's comedy
*  It's so good. Jamie says just one one special one special. Yeah
*  Okay, I'm they're gonna give him a shit ton of loot and I hope he hope he works it out
*  Could be a movie or else because they did dolomite. So
*  Yeah, it's gonna be work, you know unless he hires a bunch of writers to craft the bits and then that won't be right
*  Anyway, you know, you really need the work you need you need to be on those stages. Yeah Ellen
*  Did it how was it? It was good. Was it good? I don't hear anything about it didn't look like she was
*  Had taken off for decades. It certainly didn't well, she does her show all the time
*  So she does do that monologue she does but you know stand up stand up, you know
*  And it don't think the monologues like stand up light though. Mm-hmm. Yeah, like Jay Leno
*  Yeah, right, right always doing those monologues, but then he would do stand up on Sunday nights and they do corporate gigs
*  Yeah. Yeah, right exactly, but he wasn't banging out in the clubs every day like us. No, he's still going now though
*  I talked to Bill Maher had him in here. Yeah, and he was repulsed by the idea of going to the clubs
*  Oh, why would I do that? Like literally? Oh, you don't want to go to the clubs. You know, I know way
*  I'm done. I escaped. I'm out. Yeah, I'm like, but it's the greatest way like it's you hang out with comics
*  Yeah
*  He just it just seems like low rent
*  I don't know man me sometimes people have their own audience and that's all they want right?
*  They don't want to they don't want to go like a show at the store. Yeah tonight
*  I'll go up at the store and there'll be 14 other people on the lineup, right?
*  And there's people there to see every one of those people. Yeah, right. So they're not they're just there to see you
*  They're gonna see comedy. That's what's great. Yeah, they might not be into you at all
*  Yeah, it's like going to the gym. No one wants to really go to the gym
*  It's hard at the gym, but then you start to love at the gym
*  It seems like you know, I talked to burr about this and he's in agreement. He believes that you have to do it
*  He's like that's the only way the only way you got to go to the you got to go to the clubs
*  I'm like, I think so too. Yeah, he goes nobody else that doesn't go to the clubs really kills, right?
*  Yeah, you get through it. Yeah, you can do a monologue. You can recite a monologue
*  Yeah, but you're missing all of that high impact
*  Stuff in between and you also run the risk of being funny because people love you
*  The people that love you that come to see you that you're a crowd, right? You run that risk
*  Yeah, maybe you can pull through brian reagan may be a different he may might be an exception to that rule
*  Because I don't think he goes to clubs and he still murders he does but he's out there performing all the time
*  Non-stop non-stop and he treats, you know
*  He's in a in a good position where he's beloved where he can treat a set in front of three thousand people
*  He'll kill but also be able to work his stuff out within that set. Yeah, he'll work out new stuff. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, he's a unique guy, right because he's super popular with his crowd. Yeah, but he doesn't
*  He doesn't have a problem but being famous he can go anywhere. Yo, yeah. No, absolutely
*  Yeah, there's there's people outside of the comedy loving world that don't know who he is
*  No, which is astounding to all of us. Yeah, right
*  Yeah, but that's how fragmented the culture is like we were talking about if you're just watching one news or watching one kind
*  Of thing it's like where everyone's in their own little bubble, you know, there's
*  You know joe coy is selling out, you know the forum
*  Yeah, and my parents will have no idea who he is multiple shows. I think he did two shows at the forum
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? Like we're we're such a big massive
*  entertainment eating colossus
*  that
*  People can be huge and be invisible at the same time like sebastian
*  Yeah, sebastian sells out four shows at mass in square garden. Sometimes I have to explain who he is to people, right?
*  Like how do you not know? Isn't it weird? But meanwhile he can go places. Yeah, it's really a beautiful balance
*  Yeah, you can go to the mall. Nobody gives a fuck. Yeah
*  You know, yeah taylor swift can't do that
*  I was watching a documentary. I should say my kids were watching. I watched it last night with my daughter dude
*  This is a beginning of it when she walks on stage in the stadium and you see all the fucking people with their lighters on
*  Everything like wow, I guess it's not lighters the light from their cell phones from their phones or something
*  But yeah, I know the shot you're talking about. It's crazy. But what was so cool about it was
*  Watching her as a 13 year old learning to write songs. Yeah, she's just
*  She works she does she works that's got to be an incredibly bizarre place to be her existence
*  Her life, yeah her life because she's young I know how old is she now 29 in that documentary
*  So she's been hugely famous for how many years now?
*  16 I think is when she came on the stage
*  Yeah, 13 years and those are like very formative years. I know she seems like she handles it pretty well
*  I mean that's what from the documentary it was I was really impressed like
*  How good of a songwriter she was like watching her come up with stuff
*  She's obviously so practiced
*  And knows what she wants to do and just the way she was coming up with stuff as she was on the fly
*  Maybe that's the key
*  Yes, maybe the key is you have to like really be obsessed with your work and doing what you want to do 100
*  Like prince that 100 percent. Yeah, there's they are making the stuff. They're not put in things
*  They're not you know, they're they're actually have a craft that they can right go to work on like she's a writer all that noise
*  Totally, yeah a really good writer. Yeah, and all that noise, you know
*  She was obviously just even from the glimpse that they showed us in the documentary
*  Dealing with weight and the fame and the Kanye stuff and yeah weight
*  Yeah, she had you know, she would see pictures of herself and stop eating and what? Yeah, really is that in the documentary?
*  Yeah, yeah, I didn't I only watched it for like two minutes. Yeah, no, my kids were watching
*  I'm like, I gotta get out of here before I get infected. No, it was pretty good. I I liked it
*  I think I'm sure I was impressed by her. I really was that's a bummer though that she was thinking
*  She's always been so skinny
*  Well, everyone's got stuff they got to deal with but the thing that like you said like it's a weird place to be
*  but
*  That she can go and write songs and go and perform them that seems like that's
*  She's got something tangible right meaningful right that will get her through that
*  Right. It's not like a pop star where a corporation puts together your look and your songs and your thing
*  And you're this and you're that she's doing it all herself
*  Yeah, you're not just the guitarist someone else is writing the songs and doing all this stuff and you're just
*  Doing drugs and then shredding once in a while. You know what I mean?
*  It's important to have something that you do. Yeah, it can be something small and stupid
*  But it really gives you life meaning and if without it it's
*  It doesn't have to be this big
*  Performing stuff or stuff that gets you a lot of money right a little hobby a little craft a little something you can
*  Go to sleep thinking about yeah
*  It's it's a I don't know why but it's an important part about being a human being
*  Well, it gives you that's I think you nailed it. It gives you a meaning like you're you're working towards something
*  You're working at something. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Shuts the noise out as you're thinking about this thing that you're actually getting better at
*  Yeah, and then you get this satisfaction seeing the progress. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  And I mean she's you know as big as they get
*  But then she can crank out these songs and you can see like this calm come over and she's doing that part
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it was pretty cool to watch
*  It was pretty cool Taylor Swift fan. Yeah
*  There you go. I was definitely but watching my daughter who's pretty skeptical kid, you know at 17
*  and to watch her like admiration for her as a
*  As a a woman getting it done was that that part, you know
*  She definitely gained more points for that. That's cool. I wonder what happens with someone like that
*  Like where do they go as they get older?
*  What do they go as they I mean you're you're you're growing up and living your entire life in this superstar position
*  Very strange superstar position. Yeah
*  well, I
*  probably
*  You know the the white hotness of it probably fades to some degree
*  But if you're an artist like that, you would keep creating, you know, like bonnie rate was just at the grammys
*  Right, you know and she had their moments of being huge and then you just become like a working musician in a way
*  Yeah, you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah
*  Now that's a good way to do it, right? Yeah, sort of be appreciated by your fans
*  Keep going out there and just keep doing it and they take them along with you
*  And yeah, see if they stick around and you're 90 years old playing a nursing home, but there's still 20 people in the audience. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  It's pretty cool. It's a pretty good thing
*  Yeah, like look at willy nelson. Yeah still out there banging it out. Yeah
*  Amazing stop storing weed. He did stop smoking weed. No lung problems
*  Really? Yep. Now it's down to edibles. Uh, well, he's still getting high though
*  But he was fucking up his lungs, I guess which is hilarious because he's like 90
*  He must have been smoking a lot. I wonder if he smoked cigarettes as well. Did he smoke cigarettes as well?
*  Yeah about that, but I'd heard a story of him smoking like
*  Garbage cans full of weed in hawaii
*  Garbage just had them
*  Oh my god, who does it was that country music star that has that song? I'll never smoke weed with willy again
*  Oh really? Yeah
*  That fucking guy travis
*  God, what's his name?
*  Famous guy i'll never smoke
*  What's toby keith?
*  Right because he got so messed up. Yeah, it's like he's got a song i'll never smoke weed with willy again
*  Puts you in the grave son
*  It's just cranking it out and that was his thing was to be nicer
*  Yeah, he was he willy nelson has always talked about his mean streak and his whiskey streak and yeah
*  And the weed was the thing that really made him a kinder. Yeah person. That's what it does
*  Yeah, it's the best aspect of marijuana is it makes you more kind and more
*  It makes you think about community and friendship and just yeah forgiving people too, right? Exactly relaxing
*  Just letting go of all the bullshit. Yeah, that's what the world needs a lot more forgiveness
*  Especially 100 percent we could use we could all use just a little more understanding
*  Yeah, where are you gonna learn if you don't make mistakes exactly screw up and then you correct it and you become a better person
*  The lyrics of this song should be rewritten by somebody about joey dies
*  They're pretty good
*  I always heard that his herb was top shelf lord. I could not wait to find out for myself
*  Well, don't knock it till you tried it and i've i've tried it my friend. I'll never smoke weed with willy again
*  Now we learned a hard lesson in a small texas town
*  He fired up a fat boy and passed it around the last words I spoke before they tucked me in
*  May I discount bungee jump, but i'll never smoke weed with willy again
*  I may discount bungee jump
*  I'll never smoke weed with willy again. My party's all over before it begins
*  You can pour me some old whiskey river my friend, but i'll never smoke weed with willy again
*  Smoking weed with joey dies a little weird. It's the edibles that'll get you the edibles joey's edibles. Oh my god
*  Really? Yeah, he'll dose you
*  It takes he's take a 500 milligram edible and we'll take the wrapper off and put a 20 milligram edible label on it
*  Hey, what have you heard about micro dosing a lot? Yeah. Yeah acid or mushrooms acid a lot of people do it
*  I know. Yeah, it's becoming a thing right seems to help them sort of like
*  Stay focused and centered and calm and keep the chatter down negative self chatter all that kind of stuff
*  Is there anything bad to it? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I mean i've i've micro dosed a couple of times
*  Yeah, but i've never i've never done it on a regular basis
*  Like a lot of these people do but I know a lot of people are doing it with psilocybin and a lot of them do it
*  They take it like once every couple days. They don't even do it every day. They take it every few days
*  They find it remarkably beneficial ron white is into micro dosing. Oh, yeah psilocybin. Yeah
*  Loves it and it's not like you're really tripping. No, no you it's barely perceptible. Really? Yeah, barely perceptible
*  But it just gives you a nice feeling. You know, it's like there's something about it. That's nice
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then people feel like that that it just
*  Eliminates some of the anxiety and the shit that goes on to your head that can you could be battling with it calms those voices down
*  For different people. Yeah, I mean obviously for everyone
*  Everyone is a different reaction to that. Yeah, tom popple. We've got to wrap this bitch up. Where are we gonna go?
*  It's it's three o'clock. So we did it. We just did three hours
*  Come on, let's go for five
