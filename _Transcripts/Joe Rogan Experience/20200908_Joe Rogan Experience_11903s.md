# Joe Rogan Experience #1533 - Adam Curry
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTPQ9KR5j8k)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  If not for you, I would not be here.
*  Wait.
*  In both places.
*  Welcome to Texas, Joe.
*  Thank you, sir.
*  Thank you.
*  Welcome.
*  You bring tremendous, exciting and good energy to our city and to our state.
*  I appreciate that very much, but I'm here in a big reason, in a big way because of you.
*  So before we even get started, if you do not know, Adam was the very first podcaster ever.
*  He's the real if you if you want to have a patient zero of podcasting, it's you.
*  Yeah, I'd say that's arguably correct.
*  Yeah, I would say it's inarguably correct.
*  Yeah.
*  And then also you talked about how much you loved it here.
*  Yeah, and I've been here 11 years.
*  So without you, we would not be here for those two things.
*  Right.
*  Well, it's really because after I did your show, which I cannot the only thing better than going on the Joe Rogan show is being invited back on the Joe Rogan show.
*  It's I mean, you did.
*  It was incredible for me.
*  You renewed my credentials.
*  Well, listen, I think you're awesome.
*  I think you're one of the most interesting guys on the Internet.
*  No bullshit.
*  I really do.
*  Thank you.
*  The other thing that's very interesting is I told you when we were doing the show that time, we were kind of getting a little baked.
*  I'm like, this is when my Tourette's shows up and I have a mild form of Tourette's.
*  And so because I had said that, it was like I felt really comfortable just being who I am and not having to worry about I don't want to tick right now.
*  You know, Steve Mnuchin, our secretary of the Treasury, he also has Tourette's.
*  He also has a hot wife.
*  But bam.
*  Well, this is, of course, one of the superpowers you get when you have Tourette's.
*  You get a hot wife.
*  Yeah, baby.
*  That's what you get.
*  Ladies that wears those gloves that go all the way down to the elbow.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  The lady is like, oh, he's kind of weird, but I like that.
*  So you can see him testifying before Congress and you can see him like stretching his neck and shit.
*  But once it's out there, then it actually removes all the tension.
*  And even on the YouTube comments, you know, people are like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy, man?
*  It's like, you know, is he backing up his files every five seconds when he's batting his eyes?
*  What exactly is happening if someone like is there a physiological thing that they've identified?
*  Yes, it's like sparks happening in your brain and they're not really sure what it is.
*  It's Gilles de Tourette syndrome.
*  And there's all kinds of stuff they say can help.
*  And one of the things I say help certain herbs.
*  You know, you get fucking fishy.
*  There's a lot. Yeah, there's a lot of people say it's you know, it's trauma that the body is held on to.
*  That's very possible.
*  You know, that could be it.
*  But it started around when I was seven.
*  So it could also be, I think, possibly vaccine related.
*  I'm not I'm not saying that I'm anti vaccines, but I know I know what happened then because my parents took me to the doctor.
*  My dad, interestingly, also had Tourette's vaccines.
*  So it can be hereditary.
*  Isn't vaccines are one of those subjects where people tense up and you're either you're either all in or you're not.
*  Well, you're not allowed to just want safe vaccine.
*  You're not allowed to say I am 100 percent pro vaccine, but vaccines are in fact some sort of actionable chemical.
*  Right. I mean, what some liquid that you're putting into someone's body.
*  Sure. And it's going to have an effect.
*  And there's all kinds of stuff in there.
*  Things happen sometimes with people with regular things with aspirin, peanuts.
*  Yes. People's bodies react differently to all sorts of different things.
*  That doesn't mean that vaccines haven't saved fucking uncountless lives.
*  Of course, they're amazing.
*  The people that figured out vaccines are the most.
*  Well, I think you have vaccines in a combination of a lot of other things.
*  Sanitation. Sure.
*  That's why in New York City, the sanitation department still wears kind of uniforms because they were seen as like first line first responders.
*  When people were living in horseshit and trash, we just dumping it out their windows in New York.
*  These guys came in like the National Guard and they became this force.
*  Yeah, that's no doubt about it.
*  If you had to live in like ancient Rome and where the shit would just roll down the street.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Like, oh, yeah.
*  I mean, that's how a lot of people got sick in those places.
*  Right. And ancient cultures before they really figured out sanitation and sewage.
*  In general, sanitation.
*  That's giant to prevent diseases.
*  Vaccines are also I mean, how many people have been saved by vaccines?
*  The overall net gain.
*  I don't want to look at people like a chart, but if you did, you'd have to say, God, look at all the people that were saved.
*  Look at all the people that are healthy.
*  But you have to say, oh, but for some people, it fucked them up.
*  You know, I mean, there is a vaccine court, right?
*  Well, isn't it?
*  I've met Robert Kennedy Jr. in the past.
*  He's a big anti.
*  Well, not no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  He's he's pro safe vaccine, but he's very controversial.
*  Of course, of course, because he's challenging the conventional wisdom of vaccines.
*  And, you know, we have a lot of media influence to, you know, to kind of set us up on this path where I mean, when I was growing up, we didn't have vaccine for the mumps or the measles.
*  And I don't think we're best German measles.
*  And we got it and chickenpox.
*  And you got that.
*  And so the vaccine industry was able to prevent that and some form of herd immunity.
*  But, you know, the way we had these outbreaks and people are all freaking out and, you know, it just seems like it's an industry that wants to keep this type of safety for people.
*  And that's one view of what is good.
*  I mean, there's all kinds of views what people think about, you know, certain illnesses you should just get to build up your immunity.
*  Now, so it's hard for me to say.
*  I mean, it's not black and white.
*  It just and why should it be black and white?
*  Why should it be?
*  Yeah, that's the thing is like there's room for reasonable discussion without getting into fistfights and lighten each other's houses on fire.
*  You know, and this is another subject where I think that's the case.
*  I think there's there's room.
*  I think what's interesting is Jamie had to make first adjustment.
*  We got a whole new set up here.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Holy crap.
*  Matt Alvarez, the fucking king of the world who put this place together.
*  Let me just say this is so bad ass.
*  Thanks, buddy.
*  You sent me a picture and I was like, that looks like the interior of an Embraer jet.
*  I mean, this is this is crazy.
*  And then the lighting and then and I'm glad my buddy drew got hooked up.
*  Yeah.
*  Shout out to Drew Teague.
*  Put this fantastic put this together and just all of it is.
*  But shout out to young Jamie.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking VIP.
*  Yeah.
*  If not for him, we said whatever you do, we don't want headphones.
*  And he came through for us.
*  I really appreciate.
*  Yeah, we had a couple of sound issues, but it doesn't matter.
*  I'm the perfect guest for that.
*  You know, I just sat here.
*  You're the perfect guest for the first podcast.
*  I just sat here and smoked your weed.
*  You have to be the first guest.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, thank you.
*  It really is an honor.
*  And let me tell you, man, I am so happy for you and so proud of what you've done.
*  And, you know, to get to someone to put a fucking number on the value you've created with your show.
*  That's not too bad.
*  That's just going to freak me out.
*  No, not at all.
*  That's huge.
*  You get exactly what you deserve.
*  Let's just have a sip of whiskey and talk.
*  Right.
*  But what I want to say is you've made it.
*  You know, this is a big move.
*  You're not going to like a television network.
*  You know, this is not Hollywood picking you up.
*  Fuck.
*  This is something completely different.
*  It's another app.
*  It's like an app against another app.
*  This is cool.
*  You know, we see Netflix and Disney and Apple Plus and Amazon.
*  You know, so there's all these different.
*  I think that that creates markets and that place right now may be a high value,
*  but place a value on content and people are willing to pay for it.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm not against any of that.
*  I think that's very, very interesting and a very logical path.
*  And I'm glad that it's happening to you.
*  They have a vested interest in the show, which is what other platforms didn't necessarily have.
*  Like YouTube has always been great to us.
*  I don't have any complaints really about YouTube.
*  I think the real problem with YouTube is managing at scale.
*  I think they're dealing with some ungodly number of videos that are constantly flooding into it.
*  But they didn't really have an interest.
*  I mean, they knew that the show was popular, but it's not like they were we were working together.
*  You know, they just they just would take some of the ad revenue.
*  But there was no like real.
*  It was just a nice place where I could put it up.
*  They can make some money.
*  I can make some money.
*  But something like Spotify is a different situation where they're like, let's do this together.
*  We'll be together.
*  So you'll be exclusive to here and we want you to do well instead of having like a non-connected relationship.
*  Like a lot of people feel like with YouTube, which is again, I think it's because of managing its scale.
*  They can't have a one on one relationship with everybody.
*  It's not possible.
*  There's so many fucking people have YouTube channels.
*  Right. What is the number?
*  I don't know.
*  Jamie, how many people have YouTube channels?
*  It's got to be a crazy number.
*  Billions. Billions.
*  Why not?
*  Maybe billions.
*  Why not?
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the number one video source in the world.
*  Right.
*  In terms of like watching clips.
*  31 million YouTube channels out there.
*  As of 2019.
*  31 what?
*  31 million.
*  31 million.
*  31 million.
*  Interesting.
*  That's it.
*  Well, in our world, this is preposterous.
*  What is wrong with this shit?
*  It must be much more than that.
*  I tell you.
*  Why does not people use there was a period of time during the podcast when I was telling people to do a podcast.
*  And they would get mad at me.
*  They're like stop telling everyone to do a podcast.
*  Oh, because it was like dirty?
*  It was like I was.
*  I felt like the lowest rung on the showbiz ladder was VJ.
*  But no, I went and created one lower, which was podcaster.
*  No, that's not what I was saying.
*  That's what it was.
*  I was encouraging too many people to enter into it.
*  Oh, oh no.
*  People got people like, dude, stop telling everybody they should have a podcast.
*  Not everybody should have a fucking podcast.
*  Well, this is very important for me because I realize as the pod father who, you know, really helped create everything in this whole the mechanisms of it all, how it all fits together.
*  It was very we're losing something out of podcasting.
*  But what that does is actually creates this huge opportunity in a vacuum because there's if you don't mind me saying there's other Joe Rogan's waiting to be born.
*  They're out there.
*  They're alive right now.
*  So they are ready and they need to have the same type of support that you get inside Spotify.
*  And, you know, you'll see I heart radio and Stitcher.
*  They're going to announce deals and talk to me kind of.
*  They have all the exclusive and you have podcast one.
*  And so that's where radio is moving mainly by the music companies who have a kind of bad business model.
*  They have to pay for every time someone listens to a song, regardless of whether they could make money on it or not.
*  So moving to longer form content that doesn't cost more per minute that people consume is dynamite for them.
*  They already have people paying and there's ways to do that, which is great.
*  What I need to make sure we do is that we preserve podcasting as a platform for free speech.
*  It may not be easy for the next Joe Rogan who has a different values or how they speak to get into whatever is the norm inside different podcast apps.
*  You understand what I'm saying?
*  I do. I do understand what you're saying.
*  My thought about it every time I told someone to do it was that there's plenty of room.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  There's so many of us.
*  Infinite. Infinite room.
*  Yeah.
*  Infinite.
*  I think that's a process that people have about not wanting someone.
*  Look, if I have an interesting conversation with someone and they're a fascinating person, I'll probably say you should do a podcast.
*  If they're not doing one, I would suggest it.
*  Yeah.
*  People get.
*  That's how mine started.
*  But they didn't understand.
*  That's how all of us get into it.
*  If you enjoy fresh air, if you enjoy radio lab, if you enjoy no agenda, if you enjoy any podcast, wouldn't you want to encourage some new interesting person to try to get involved?
*  And maybe take it to a different place?
*  That's what happened with my friend Duncan.
*  Duncan Trussell from doing other people's podcasts and then doing his own.
*  His podcast is amazing.
*  You guys did like a 20 hour show.
*  We did a five hour and 20 minute show.
*  I had to spark up like 45 minutes into it.
*  I'm like, I got to get on their level now.
*  What the hell is going on with these guys?
*  It took me two hours just to sober up.
*  And then by then we were drinking.
*  Well, I'm kind of happy we had a little bit of Jamie downtime so we could get ready for the show.
*  Shout out to the VIP Jamie again for pulling this motherfucker together.
*  This ship was about to sink.
*  Tiffany Pentapp.
*  Yeah, this ship was about to sink, son.
*  Right.
*  But I'm enjoying Austin.
*  I love it.
*  It's great.
*  It's dope city.
*  I'm happy there's less people around.
*  I was going to say, do you know a lot of people here?
*  Yeah, yeah, I do.
*  Yeah, because I'm one of the owners of Onnit.
*  We're right down the street here.
*  So really good friends with Aubrey and Kyle Kingsbury is here.
*  And then my friend Todd White, who's a jujitsu friend of mine from back in L.A.
*  I know any of these people.
*  He's an artist.
*  That's so cool.
*  Todd White's a fantastic artist.
*  Really interesting.
*  Does like, I would call it like, what are those, what are those speakeasies?
*  Like speakeasy, 1920s-ish, cool, like interesting.
*  This is the art of White.
*  This is my friend Todd White.
*  He does, like click on that one that looks like, yeah, right there.
*  The one, yeah, it looks like people at a party.
*  He does that kind of shit.
*  Todd's been my friend.
*  Cool.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a brilliant, brilliant artist.
*  Like kind of cocktail loungy type.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's also a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu from my instructor, John Jacque Machado.
*  That's him?
*  That's my buddy Todd.
*  Nice.
*  And he's, he's an Austinite now too.
*  And he moved here from L.A.
*  So he was also an influence talking to him because he's just a really super cool dude.
*  What I like about you here, man, is that Austin's pretty liberal.
*  It's good to have, you know, we need male energy.
*  We need male energy coming back.
*  We need to meet in the middle and hug.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  All this light.
*  Of course.
*  The male-female model, by the way, I think, is there's a reason it should work.
*  You know, there's, it feels like yin and yang.
*  It should kind of go together.
*  Yeah, it takes a while to figure that out.
*  Not very easy.
*  Not very easy to, yeah, it took me a couple, a couple tries.
*  It takes decades.
*  I think around 50, I'm like, oh, yeah, I think I'm kind of figuring it out a little bit.
*  I understand women way more now because I actually have children that are girls.
*  So you see, like, the idea that a man and a woman is the same thing is like the idea that a cat and a dog,
*  if you said to your cat, if you threw a ball for your cat and you're like, go get it, motherfucker.
*  What are you doing?
*  Go get it.
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  The dog gets it.
*  Mm hmm.
*  We're so different.
*  And when you watch little girls grow up and what they want to do versus I have friends that have boys like,
*  oh my God, you go up to their house and it's fucking war.
*  It's chaos.
*  They're always hitting things.
*  The terrorists, total terrorists.
*  And obviously there's a spectrum.
*  There's girls that are into it.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  We have that in common.
*  I grew up with women, two sisters, my mom.
*  I have a daughter.
*  I have two stepdaughters.
*  Just always a lot of women.
*  I get along really well.
*  I can be great friends with women.
*  But real super male energy, which is what I enjoy about you, sorry.
*  No.
*  It's really, it's nice because I didn't have much of that growing up and you're so kind of open and nice about it.
*  But you also had jujitsu and all this fucking shit that I don't know anything about.
*  I'll teach you.
*  You want to learn?
*  We got gyms here.
*  I am also very lazy.
*  Well, maybe.
*  That helps.
*  Maybe.
*  Do you work out at all?
*  Spin class.
*  Do you really?
*  I do.
*  I do.
*  I do.
*  I do the spin class.
*  Looks like fun.
*  Oh, sitting in a dark room.
*  All music and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You're dancing on the bike.
*  Typically, a lot of cute girls.
*  That used to matter, but now I just want the workout.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah.
*  But I like someone yelling at me, do this, do that.
*  It's kind of rhythmic.
*  No one sees you.
*  No one gives a shit if you slow down, if you don't make it.
*  But at the end, you're like, I feel good.
*  I didn't hack up a lung.
*  I'm like, no, feel good.
*  I hate going there.
*  Isn't it a dangerous move to have all those people doing cardio in a small room?
*  I don't know.
*  Like, how many of them are farting?
*  I've never.
*  Really?
*  I'm very sensitive to this.
*  Nothing?
*  No.
*  But often, let me tell you, I will definitely go to the bathroom before I go to spin class.
*  Well, you're a courteous person, Adam Curry.
*  Yeah, but I have this fear.
*  I'm on the bike like, oh, fuck, what the hell?
*  Of course.
*  That would suck so bad.
*  The occasional fart in yoga class is one of the funniest things in yoga.
*  It's never happened.
*  Oh my God.
*  I've heard it.
*  That would be horrible.
*  I've heard it.
*  Actually, my friend Eddie Wong, when Eddie did for his television show, he farted.
*  I took him to yoga.
*  He wanted to do a bunch of things.
*  I took him to yoga.
*  He went and did a yoga class and he farted.
*  That's the pits.
*  I don't eat before I do yoga.
*  That's the pits, man.
*  Yeah, we had a good time, man.
*  So, but no, no, I think it's quite healthy, actually.
*  The ventilation is good.
*  Shout out to Agora Hot Yoga.
*  They can't even open up right now.
*  California won't let them open up yoga studios.
*  It's so ridiculous.
*  I go to ride indoor cycling and they limit it to, I think, 11 people or 13.
*  We need tests.
*  The White House apparently has some tests that they could find out in 20 minutes if you have it.
*  Yeah, it's coming in 15 minutes.
*  You just have to accept the microchip, Adam Curry.
*  Thank you for testing me.
*  Just take the microchip.
*  Well, obviously, at this point, everybody is basically thinking, come on, Dr. Bill Gates, just give me the fucking vaccine.
*  Shoot that microchip into me.
*  I'll take it.
*  And that is obviously advantageous for people.
*  But I think that's...
*  You've seen the meme about Microsoft.
*  Bill Gates owns Microsoft.
*  Microsoft can't stop viruses from Windows.
*  How the fuck are they going to stop them from human beings?
*  No, I know.
*  It's a good meme.
*  It's a good meme.
*  It's a solid point.
*  If you were a comic and you said that, that would kill whoever you are, the meme person that came up with that line.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that it's concerning all this vaccine, the mandatory mask, the disputes over.
*  But I think it's really a sideshow to something much fucking bigger.
*  What's the biggest thing?
*  Well...
*  I feel like I need a seat buckle.
*  Yeah, oh, definitely.
*  Definitely.
*  What is the one thing that we absolutely lost during the coronavirus?
*  The one thing that went away, it was right in front of our face.
*  We all saw it.
*  What the fuck?
*  We were actually told it had to go away or it was very dangerous.
*  What is that one thing?
*  Probably your freedom.
*  That's what I would say.
*  Just getting started.
*  Your ability to move around, go wherever you want.
*  No, an actual control mechanism of freedom.
*  Money went away.
*  Cash went away.
*  Coins went away.
*  Everyone went.
*  Digital money.
*  And we accepted it willingly.
*  Without any thought that someone might be juking the system?
*  Well, let me continue.
*  World Health Organization showed Chinese money being sprayed to clean it from coronavirus,
*  which of course we know is preposterous.
*  Chinese money being sprayed?
*  Yeah, like in Shanghai, they were spraying money in the...
*  There were memes as well.
*  There was lots of, like, money can be dirty.
*  Everyone went, I'm not even going to fucking argue with you about the fucking money.
*  I'm not going to touch it.
*  That's what everybody said.
*  You can't argue with me about something I have no knowledge whatsoever of?
*  I'm too baked for that.
*  There's no way we can argue.
*  How can we argue?
*  I have no facts.
*  Exactly.
*  I'm not interested in arguments.
*  I have no argument.
*  Here's another thing that people learn.
*  But there's more to this story.
*  Please go.
*  Okay, I think this is really important because it's happening right now.
*  It's really cool.
*  Okay.
*  So that went away.
*  And so everyone's kind of, you know, now we're using apps.
*  A lot of digital currency.
*  And these apps, it's all different networks and infrastructure.
*  You know, Venmo actually connects to another company that then logs into your bank account and accesses you.
*  There's all these different ways it's been kind of gerrymandered and rigged together.
*  So Venmo doesn't go right to your bank account?
*  They go through a middleware, plaid networks.
*  The Dark Lord?
*  Now they just got bought by Visa for like $5 billion.
*  It's fine.
*  It's just another part of make, because banks traditionally never talk to each other, do they?
*  We won't do whatever we can to maximize our profits.
*  We promise.
*  We'll be ethical.
*  You're going to love it when I get there, Joe Rogan.
*  We demand social justice while we're sucking green bills out of your veins.
*  So we're waiting for the stimulus checks, which is now being negotiated.
*  This is, you know, people need money.
*  That's stopped the, you know, it's being held up.
*  And we hear this.
*  It's about FBI building being built.
*  It's about giving states money.
*  It's about all these different things.
*  And then we also have this post office controversy.
*  So these are two things going on.
*  Shout out to the post office.
*  Well, the post office, it appears, is an important factor in a new digital dollar,
*  which is currently called Fednet.
*  And I think it's called Fednet.
*  So how are they involved?
*  How is it posted?
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Let's go back.
*  You know, you remember Jekyll Island.
*  You were talking to Duncan about Jekyll Island.
*  Yes.
*  Zero facts, by the way.
*  How about that?
*  You guys were pretty close.
*  If I had to pass a quiz on Jekyll Island, I'd get a 23.
*  You were pretty close.
*  So Jekyll Island is where the Federal Reserve was created in 1910.
*  In 1907, there was a crisis in America.
*  There was a financial crisis.
*  And then the bankers, JP Morgan and the actual guys, you know, the old, you know, we have Chase Bank now.
*  And that guy who started that bank and Warburg and a couple others, they said, this is fucked up.
*  This is fucked up.
*  We got to be able to control the interest rates so we can control the economy by boom and bust, basically, which we've been through all this time.
*  But when they created it, they had to make that the official way to manage America's money.
*  And a couple of years down the line, they got the Federal Reserve Act, which removed our money from the Treasury and gave it to the Federal Reserve.
*  And that's these bankers.
*  And this gave it the cool name to make it sound like it's a part of the government, but it's not.
*  So they create the money, they manage it, and the United States borrows it from them.
*  You've heard this before, I'm sure.
*  It makes sense.
*  You should definitely give them most of the money that we have.
*  There's no need.
*  It's going to. It's about to get a lot easier for them.
*  That's the beauty of it.
*  Poor people and hardworking folks.
*  So the Banking for All Act is what is on the table right now.
*  That's why I believe the stimulus is held up, because they want to give people the money into a digital wallet,
*  which everyone who has a Social Security number right now has a digital dollar wallet attached to that Social Security number.
*  And all you have to do is if you don't have a bank, you go to the post office, you show your Social Security number, your ID,
*  and you'll get a debit card, and that is basically your entire bank on that card.
*  And the government can put money on, which they will do.
*  Which they will do.
*  No, no, but it gets better, Joe.
*  It gets better.
*  You want me to blow your mind?
*  How fucking funny is that?
*  You want me to blow your mind?
*  Yeah, please.
*  Okay.
*  Please, please, please.
*  Because you're a fan of universal basic income.
*  I'm going to tell you how it's going to work.
*  This is coming.
*  So you should really, you want to hear this, because I think it's really happening.
*  I could be fucking wrong, but you know.
*  I'm just a VJ and a podcaster.
*  I understand.
*  I remember when you had crazy hair.
*  Oh, God.
*  You were so handsome, too.
*  There was a lot of work.
*  You're still handsome.
*  Thank you.
*  You're like older guy handsome.
*  There was a lot of fucking work.
*  You were beautiful.
*  Older.
*  Yeah, I'm like.
*  When you were young, you were beautiful.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Thank you.
*  Anyway, continue.
*  You say that to all the boys.
*  Only the pod father.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  I think you're the only guy I've called beautiful to his face.
*  So.
*  Did I call Rob Lowe beautiful?
*  If not, I apologize, Rob.
*  You're beautiful, too.
*  Who else?
*  You're beautiful, Joe Rogan.
*  Thank you.
*  You're beautiful.
*  So you remember the cost of like a Toyota truck in the 70s?
*  Like I was three.
*  So I'm sorry.
*  It's like five thousand dollars.
*  OK.
*  So now in 2020, it's fifty thousand dollars.
*  It's a fucking truck.
*  Well, those trucks are really valuable now.
*  Those toyota's from like the 1970s, the FJ 40s.
*  Those are amazing.
*  There's something about them that like makes you pretend you're Indiana Jones, like you're
*  a rugged individualist with their aluminum doors.
*  It's like a fucking it's a like a farming vehicle.
*  Like they're they.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They're real chunk.
*  They're real crude.
*  But you could buy it for five grand and now you have to have 50 grand.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course, back then, you know, you made ten thousand dollars a year.
*  You were doing OK.
*  Now you write 100 grand to really say I'm doing OK.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Why is it that if you look at like a Toyota FJ 40, why is it so attractive to us?
*  Why does it make me feel like I want to get a leather bound notebook and go to the woods
*  and write things?
*  You know, if I'm one of those dudes, I'm one of those dudes where our roads are.
*  You know, I mean, if I'm one of those dudes, where's like a fluffy flannel shirt?
*  I don't care about cars anymore.
*  I gave up.
*  FJ 40. Come on. Look at that thing.
*  That is a rugged individualist car.
*  That's a dude who reads a lot of books and doesn't need a lot of attention.
*  And how come he doesn't have a boy where no socks has no socks in his moccasins?
*  That guy's got boots on in case the fucking grounds on fire.
*  The guy who drives that car right there, that's a bad motherfucker
*  who knows how to tie good knots.
*  Yeah, that's what that guy is.
*  That's a guy who knows how to fucking drive those things off road.
*  He knows how to activate the lockers.
*  He's a guy who writes.
*  He's maybe could play guitar by the firelight, but he doesn't have a girlfriend.
*  Isn't it crazy?
*  Is this that guy?
*  He's got a fucking rifle.
*  There you go.
*  A scope.
*  Look for squirrels.
*  Every man has a little bit of that in him.
*  Yeah. For sure.
*  A little bit of poser.
*  That guy's a poser.
*  Look at that shit on his roof.
*  That ain't even dirty.
*  Funny.
*  That guy's probably a dancer.
*  It probably has nothing to do with shooting or driving trucks or hunting.
*  They just put that dude in a beautiful car and made him stand there and look stupid.
*  So when you get your twelve hundred dollar digital in your wallet.
*  Oh, government money, which is yes, it's called the stimulus. Right.
*  This is the digital dollar.
*  And you're going to get everyone's going to get this money.
*  You're just going to create a wrong thing.
*  Can the government shut down your account?
*  This is totally where it's headed.
*  Of course, of course, of course.
*  But what's interesting about it is, do you know that interest rates
*  have gone negative in most of the world, which is really upside down?
*  So because of the pandemic?
*  No, this is this already happened since 2008.
*  The whole financial system broke.
*  I mean, because they didn't embrace Jesus.
*  We're in Texas. Let's make friends.
*  Because they didn't embrace Jesus.
*  There's a lot of people.
*  And by the way, a lot also, you have a fucking high quality audience, man.
*  They started listening to you as well.
*  But let me tell you, and a lot of people who are Christian, you know,
*  and they definitely see this as end times and
*  and you know, it's like, is Jared Kushner maybe the Antichrist?
*  What if they're right?
*  What if they're right? He looks like Damien.
*  Could be. Could be. Remember the Omen?
*  I want a picture.
*  Jamie, right now, I need a picture of Jared Kushner next to Damien
*  from the Omen, particularly when someone's probably already done it.
*  Look at that. Look at that one with Trump, where Trump's out of focus
*  in the middle. Click of that. Satan.
*  Listen, Jared, I'm just joking.
*  I don't believe anything I just said. Who knows?
*  I'm just trying to be funny.
*  Oh, my God. Someone's already made a connection.
*  Jared, I'm sorry.
*  I'm sure you're a good guy.
*  Your wife's hot. Congratulations.
*  And you're very wealthy.
*  And I don't think you get a fair shake.
*  I don't think anybody in that fucking anybody connected to Trump gets a fair shake.
*  You know, we know one gets a fair shake no matter what happens
*  on both sides of the aisle.
*  We're at each other's throats.
*  And if I if I was a conspiracy theorist and I've been in the past,
*  I would say if somebody really wanted to destroy America
*  and then control it like a dictatorship, how would they go about doing it?
*  I got an idea. It sounds crazy.
*  But I want to release a virus.
*  OK, if I'm a conspiracy therapist,
*  I just analyze the situation.
*  Yes, I think
*  China has a big role in what's happening, as global globalism does in general.
*  It used to be only centered around climate change and Green New Deal.
*  And there and there's a lot of agendas running right now.
*  So the digital dollar, which I'll explain to you now.
*  Can I pause before this gets misconstrued, though?
*  Yeah, sure. I don't believe what I just said.
*  Here's another possibility that I also don't believe.
*  OK, I don't believe either one of them.
*  Another one is maybe there was some sort of a virus
*  that they were examining and doing tests on in the laboratory.
*  Somehow it escaped, according to Brett Weinstein,
*  who is an actual evolutionary biologist.
*  He believes that that's probably that's very possible.
*  But he doesn't commit either way.
*  So I don't know. But that's not my field of expertise.
*  I don't. That's that's not my field of expertise.
*  I know. But I still want me to be misconstrued. Of course not.
*  That's all I'm saying. That's why I just had to have that.
*  It's not something I believe.
*  I think the whole thing is very it's it's so scripted.
*  Like in terms of it, I shouldn't say that it seems like fiction
*  in such a stark way that if you look, you've got an amazing
*  Jack Carr book about some foreign threat that invaded America
*  and brought a virus that brought the economy to its knees
*  and then gobbled up all the stocks and then kept people in their houses
*  and made people scared and then manipulated.
*  And I'm not saying that this any of this is happening.
*  Pretty much every disaster movie we've seen for the past 20 years
*  that we've loved to stream in totality as predictive programming. Yeah, sure.
*  I remember being on mushrooms once sitting on a hillside
*  thinking about the fact that every single civilization
*  besides ours current has collapsed.
*  If you go to ancient Greece and you look around those spectacular structures,
*  those people aren't there anymore, man.
*  They're not running shit. No.
*  Well, I think we'll be OK.
*  But there's some awareness needs to happen. Yeah.
*  And just back to taking it from a media angle, which I think you and I share
*  the virus where it came from, all disputable, whatever the reaction to it.
*  If the tests are OK, if the vaccine is a different that all that doesn't matter
*  to me right now.
*  What happened was some the first I remember this
*  because the first unprecedented thing that we heard was China
*  was shutting down a city of 11 million people. Right.
*  And that was like, holy shit, that's never happened before.
*  I paid attention like, God, man, that's some bad shit.
*  So we didn't know what was going on. We were all terrified.
*  But what we also saw on Instagram and Tiktok and everywhere else
*  was these videos of people dropping dead on the street.
*  Do you remember that? I do.
*  What was that? Where did that go?
*  Has that ever happened since?
*  I believe I think it has happened for some people that are poor health,
*  some people that get affected by this disease.
*  OK, well, I've only seen Chinese videos of this.
*  I have not seen it anywhere else.
*  I believe that that set something in motion,
*  some programming that was triggered by authorities
*  such as the World Health Organization, Fouchy, Berks, who I remember from AIDS.
*  And they're not clean on all of that.
*  There's a lot of people pissed off about how they handled the AIDS crisis.
*  Well, what's wrong with how they handled the oh, they did tests wrong.
*  All kinds of shit was wrong.
*  This Michael Musto in the Village Voice or a scathing article
*  about how Fouchy just wasted all this fucking money and people had died.
*  It was it was really and Fouchy was hobnobbing with Elton John and the whole,
*  you know, is that your phone?
*  How dare you?
*  The Podfather doesn't know how to this way.
*  Me. Yes, my we could just talk.
*  Let me just like that.
*  I hope you leave all that in there, Jamie.
*  No, I love that. Yeah, no, I like it.
*  That makes it. I love the fact to use a flip phone as well.
*  Shout out to Ari Shapir, also flip phone enthusiast.
*  Flip phone. I actually think Ari has abandoned the flip phone.
*  The other day, he called me and I said, is this your flip phone?
*  He was like, no, it's an iPhone.
*  I'm like, oh, motherfuckers call me from an iPhone.
*  Thought it was a flip phone.
*  Anyway, a lot.
*  I just I just I just need to tell you because you're my friend.
*  No one else.
*  Listen to me, Joe. Why?
*  You're so smart.
*  They should all listen.
*  Who's not listening?
*  And what are you saying that they're not listening?
*  What I'm saying is that just look at the evidence in front of you.
*  I think that this is a globalist type of movement.
*  I think a lot of it has been driven by China.
*  They have their hooks in a lot of us in a lot of different areas.
*  And in politics, in education, in finance,
*  and in fucking every media, Hollywood, sports, in everything.
*  And I think that if this was a plan, I think that it was intended for
*  some other date, not all the players and the pieces were in place.
*  Remember, conspiracy therapist analyzing it.
*  But they saw a go signal was thrown by them.
*  And then we start.
*  And and by the way, New York Times reported
*  one hundred and forty thousand Twitter bots were
*  were targeting Italy with these Chinese shutdown videos.
*  And, you know, so I think that that had something had something to do with it.
*  How the how the mechanisms of social media were used
*  to get people to shut down.
*  And there seems to be a lot of dishonest people in the medical field,
*  left, right, whatever.
*  I don't care what the president says.
*  Just looking at all the different voices out there.
*  You've seen them.
*  You know, you see the words get taken off of YouTube.
*  I got questions.
*  You know, seems like some valid things are out there.
*  They're told to shut up.
*  Well, there is a problem with stifling debate, right?
*  It's a problem.
*  Yeah, especially when these people, some of them,
*  whether you agree or disagree with that, all infidelity is caused by demons.
*  Wasn't that one of the things that lady said?
*  Oh, yeah. What did she say?
*  Oh, yeah. The doctor, Simone, the one Simone.
*  And I'm not sure I know which one.
*  What did she say about alien DNA?
*  There was something about she had she she has a typical Caribbean
*  type church with all kinds of whacked out shit.
*  And there's some strange ideas.
*  Yeah. Well, Catholic Church, Judaism, there's all kinds of weird stuff everywhere.
*  Shouldn't you let those people talk?
*  Yes. Right.
*  Like you have to shut them down.
*  And shouldn't you have a video that responds to that that explains?
*  Yeah. Hey, no, this is actually what's going on.
*  The reason why she thinks that is because she doesn't understand blah, blah, blah.
*  Or here's what she's saying.
*  That's valid because of this, that and the other.
*  The problem is you're either with us or against us.
*  And it's been the problem with human beings
*  since the beginning of time.
*  We are team players.
*  We love a fucking team.
*  We love being American.
*  You know, when people got happy, my old studio, because I had an American flag,
*  like, fuck, yeah, love the new look.
*  Oh, because I'm on Team America.
*  Right. We get on teams, whether it's team progressive or team
*  conservative or team rational or centrist or, you know,
*  you don't think the libertarians are taking it far enough.
*  All that stuff is a it's a
*  there is there is a labels.
*  I don't I think labels should be illegal.
*  If cocaine is illegal, labels should be illegal as well.
*  You shouldn't.
*  There should be no Democratic Party, no Republican Party.
*  I don't want Green Party. Stop. Stop it.
*  Libertarians, everybody just thinks you're mean.
*  Let's stop with the names.
*  Unaffiliated, unaffiliated.
*  How about it would benefit everybody?
*  If you wanted to combat, if you really wanted to.
*  Yeah, that's not true, because then people would feel suppressed
*  and they would want to get they would want to get back at you.
*  They would go more hardcore underground.
*  What's like backwoods?
*  Parties, I believe there is an element in our society that is small,
*  but it has interesting, powerful positions
*  that hate America.
*  Just they're not left or right.
*  They just have whole different ideas and it's been inside this country.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Is it that they hate America or is that their interests?
*  Like they can they can.
*  It's more profitable or beneficial for them.
*  I guess it's always for power to try to do something.
*  There's ideologies.
*  Look, I think you're right.
*  All Americans, I know we're good people.
*  But I mean, I don't even like saying that.
*  I do. People are generally good people.
*  Sure. The vast majority.
*  Otherwise, we'd all be dead.
*  Sure. Because you would go when you when you have an all until you.
*  See of media around you that we live in telling you it's black, it's white,
*  it's left, it's right, it's up, it's down.
*  This is why I encourage podcasts.
*  And this is why I have to create podcast index dot org to be independent
*  from Apple, mainly.
*  I think that's a good idea.
*  But however, as a company, Apple has taken the most uniquely
*  neutral approach when it comes to podcasts.
*  Apple has been an excellent steward of podcasting and excellent steward.
*  Maybe the best because they're not profiting off.
*  Here's the problem.
*  And this did kind of remind I fucked up when I met Steve Jobs 15 years ago
*  and he wanted me to bless podcasting and iTunes.
*  We talked about that last time. Yeah.
*  I also gave him my copy of the index that we had built at the time,
*  which kind of made Apple the de facto on ramp to submitting your podcast
*  because all other apps and everything has been connected
*  and getting their information, their searches from Apple's database.
*  So when Alex Jones was taken off of Apple podcast,
*  plop, plop, plop like dominoes, all these other apps no longer
*  had the ability to carry that feed because creating your own index
*  is a big fucking pain in the ass.
*  And the average independent software developer would rather work
*  on the experience and make categories and feature who he wants to.
*  Apple would feature NPR, PBS.
*  So there's all these experiences that can be built.
*  And these app developers can compete with, if you don't mind, Spotify.
*  I heart I'm just I'm just telling you, honest, we need to have an outside place.
*  And I'm setting up my own money and people donate or not.
*  And I think we can also love that structure.
*  Yeah, I think we can retool it to.
*  We can retool it to a platform of value and have ideas.
*  And so this will be this will be ready like soon.
*  There's there's always certainly a concern when any company has a relative monopoly,
*  whether it's YouTube or they're not bad.
*  They're not bad. They've been great guys.
*  But we're talking about with YouTube.
*  It's managing its scale is almost impossible.
*  And I think people tend to lead towards
*  they tend to lean towards control and minimizing damage. Right.
*  So if you're dealing with 31 million different YouTube channels
*  and then you have how many different videos each one of them puts out,
*  if you're if you're thrust in this situation, like what do you think
*  the amount of videos every day that go through YouTube's net is?
*  Let's guess that it's hundreds of millions of 500 hours a minute.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  By the way, YouTube's money should never live long enough
*  to watch everything on YouTube. 500 hours a minute.
*  Yeah. YouTube's real money comes from all those cat videos and other shit.
*  That's the long tail. That's where all the real money is.
*  We get pretty long views.
*  But the but as an elite messaging system, it's all breaking down.
*  That's that's kind of the problem.
*  Well, the problem is, it's not decentralized. Right.
*  The problem is, it's not.
*  There's a company that's in control of it rather than it being in control
*  by by the people that are using it.
*  This is the problem with all of Silicon Valley is I fucking hate them for this.
*  And that's why I have a flip phone.
*  I love your technology.
*  I hate your fucking business model.
*  But I think that their situation, if I could just for a second,
*  I think it's unmanageable.
*  And I think when they look at their ethics and what they want to do
*  with community and their standards in terms of society,
*  they think it's almost unmanageable if you allow people to harass people
*  or say terrible words or attack people or say crazy shit about 9-11
*  or promote some weird things about the earth being flat and the moon being fake.
*  There's something about them that like they just want to stop it.
*  Stop it. Stop it. It's not true. Stop it.
*  You want to step in.
*  Well, why do you think that is?
*  Well, it's just human nature, man.
*  It's an ideology. There's there's ideology.
*  Why do you think they want to stop it?
*  I think they want to stop it because it doesn't align with what they've accepted
*  as important enough to talk about.
*  But the problem with telling people what's important enough to talk about
*  is if someone has a crazy idea like, hey, man, the earth is hollow
*  and aliens live inside of it.
*  You have to be able to say, well, certainly one.
*  This is someone has to be able to come along and say, hey,
*  this is how we know it's not hollow.
*  And this is how we measure the density of the earth.
*  This is how we know about the core.
*  This is what we like.
*  The problem is not that these people are influencing other morons.
*  The problem is that there's a massive failure in education.
*  You can't suck me into a flat earth video, man.
*  Yeah, you can't.
*  I mean, I didn't I didn't spend a whole lot of time in school.
*  But I understand psychology.
*  I understand from a point of not trusting people.
*  I know when people are full of shit and when someone is making a video
*  like they're the one who has all the information about the fact
*  that the world is hollow and that there's aliens that live inside of it.
*  It's an attractive myth.
*  It pulls you in.
*  You know, but but I understand what people are doing.
*  I think all of this does have a benefit.
*  I think so, too.
*  Conspiracy theories, QAnon,
*  Vaxxers, anti-vaxxers.
*  It doesn't really matter.
*  Oh, the wayfair, children being shipped in cabinets, the adrenochrome,
*  the celebrities eating children and babies and horrible things.
*  All of that.
*  What that does is it is getting people to.
*  And this is why I think it needs they want it to be stopped
*  or people want it to be stopped because at least people are looking at other
*  things and consuming things and making decisions and saying, OK,
*  maybe I should question this question that this does have a way of getting
*  people to be more aware and question more things.
*  And that in its basis, I think is really good.
*  We've got training wheels on probably right now.
*  People have no idea what that we still have tailbones.
*  Joe Rogan. Hey, that sounded Jamaican.
*  Joe Rogan, we still have tailbones. Joe Rogan.
*  It's all Hyraman.
*  Yeah, we do. So what is this doing to us?
*  What is what is this this instant access everywhere doing to us?
*  Well, it's certainly having an effect on how we view
*  and what our expectations are of reality. Mm hmm.
*  You know, those the way we view reality is totally different now.
*  The idea of running around without a phone is preposterous.
*  The idea of not having a navigation system on your car is preposterous.
*  You know, I have one car that doesn't have a C.
*  It doesn't have it doesn't have.
*  Oh, it's the Porsche. Yeah.
*  The little 911. Yeah.
*  1993. Yeah. It's raw as fuck, man.
*  I had eighty eighty four 911.
*  It doesn't have power steering. No, no.
*  And there's the thing that happens when you if you're forced into that situation,
*  we have to drive something like that.
*  You go, oh, I got to pay attention to everything.
*  You could you can get into a drone state just fall left in one quarter of a mile
*  on Bridge Road. Yeah. Oh, Bridge Road.
*  Yeah. Turn to turn left. Right.
*  You just you get into a zombie.
*  I mean, well, so that's part.
*  So my not having a smartphone with me is not because of I mean,
*  we're being tracked as all kinds of what?
*  It's more about. Wait a minute.
*  You think we're being tracked? Yeah.
*  Russia or China or maybe our own commercial companies
*  that can sell it to whoever they want.
*  Oh, the US government, the US government doesn't have to spy on you.
*  They just go to Google or 10 other companies and buy your location data.
*  Is the problem that we gave up the commodity of data?
*  We gave it up.
*  No, we just need to be responsible and create less data and be smarter about it.
*  So I don't want to.
*  First of all, I don't want to be fucking.
*  I got enough problems in my life.
*  I don't want to be notified all the time when I'm when I'm moving around.
*  But could that have been stopped had we had a time machine
*  and you could understand what data would be in 2020 versus in 1998?
*  Yeah. We have gone back and wait a minute.
*  Wait a minute. Stop.
*  Data is a massive commodity that's worth billions and billions of dollars.
*  And we are treating it like it's not important.
*  We're treating it like the content is the most important thing on the Internet.
*  But clearly the thing that generates the most money
*  for like Google and Facebook and everybody else is is not that right.
*  It's what is it?
*  For sure, it's the data.
*  It's finding out where people live, what they buy, what their interests are.
*  What building a shadow profile of you. Yes.
*  How much money do you have?
*  What do you do online shopping?
*  Do you use Visa? American Express?
*  Silicon Valley is competing with the US with the Federal Reserve to be your bank.
*  Everybody wants to be your bank.
*  Everybody wants it, because that's when they control you.
*  But that's also when you get loans at negative interest rate.
*  So they actually pay you to take the loan to which you could pay off your student loan.
*  This is going to be a you're scaring the fuck out of me.
*  No, no. This is what you wanted.
*  You wanted universal basic income. Here it comes.
*  This is going to end, by the way, it's going to work.
*  This is the crazy thing. Now, the control will also work.
*  But we will with economy will be steerable.
*  I mean, all the I think that will that part will really work.
*  But let me tell you, the apocalypse is coming and you're going to need a bitcoin.
*  At least one.
*  Does you have one salesman?
*  No, I was very anti Bitcoin.
*  Really? It was very anti Bitcoin until I sold a shitload of them at like nine
*  hundred dollars. And I could have you know, I could have really made a lot of money.
*  Yeah. I got them for nothing.
*  Is people just gave them to me in the beginning and I denied it.
*  And then when you look at 10 years and like, OK, I'm what I'm where you go.
*  I don't fuck all the alt coins and all that stuff.
*  That's what I was going to do. I don't give a shit about it.
*  But here's the is there a risk in.
*  But here's the question about Bitcoin.
*  Is there a risk in having that be the standard?
*  Like, why can't there be competing crypto currencies?
*  Like, why are we so do we have to get committed to one?
*  And if we do get committed to one, is there the possibility of some sort of
*  manipulation? The same way we've seen with all the other currencies?
*  Well, people get involved. Yeah.
*  Ten years of data have shown that Bitcoin really is the only one that you can trust.
*  Right. Now, it really is not true.
*  I just said right. For no reason.
*  Yeah. The way the way I see it.
*  Yeah, the way I see it. That's really the only one that you cannot manipulate.
*  And all of the other coins are based off of it.
*  Do you know Andreas Antonopoulos?
*  No, the name rings a bell. Brilliant, brilliant.
*  I know Max Kaiser, you know. OK.
*  So I've seen his videos as well.
*  Max, Max, I've learned a lot.
*  And I and I know Max has been saying this from day one anyway.
*  So we have enough historical information to see that that right.
*  But that is increased in value no matter what you look at.
*  The the US dollar back to my five thousand dollar truck in the 70s,
*  fifty thousand dollars now, that value of that dollar has diminished by 10 percent
*  because they've just been printing more and more money.
*  Is that why? Or because of communists?
*  Is that what it is?
*  Yeah, well, of course.
*  Hippies and communists.
*  So for sure, the United States ruined the United
*  the USSR with financial trickery, for sure.
*  But now we're just the end of a rope.
*  Was it wasn't a lot of it, the space race?
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  Don't take that was the financial trickery.
*  There's no way there was all about devaluation.
*  It was really it was really quite amazing.
*  Multiple levels of good people.
*  But in their fucking that's good.
*  You know, a friend of mine who is a computer wizard
*  was doing this thing where he was tracing
*  these certain pages that were organizing like antiva rallies.
*  Yeah. And he would follow the IP back to Russia.
*  Yeah. What the fuck?
*  Maybe maybe Russia, maybe China.
*  But the fuck we had.
*  Hillary Clinton called them techno experts, and we sent them in to
*  to the fucking Balkans, Ukraine.
*  We did all that. That's all our techno experts.
*  Right now you have Belarus.
*  You know, people are protesting and it's really being organized
*  around one telegram channel called Nextra.
*  And these guys worked for US State Department.
*  Yeah, they got pictures of selfies of themselves in the state department.
*  You know, obviously some kind of propaganda outfit,
*  but they're they have, you know, two million followers.
*  And those people are like, OK, we go protest over here.
*  A lot like Black Lives Matter.
*  You know, this stuff is being coordinated.
*  But again, with this, it's so important to talk about nuance
*  and not being connected to any ideas.
*  This is just my view, man.
*  No, no, I'm thinking today, bro.
*  I got no agenda. I think you're right.
*  You're also not right.
*  There's also a bunch of people that are involved in that
*  that really have good intentions. Yeah, of course.
*  I'm generalizing to the max.
*  No, no, you're not even generalizing.
*  You're stating a fact
*  that foreign interests are manipulating our outrage.
*  That's a fact. Yeah.
*  But we're also doing it to other countries.
*  We are. And we're doing it internally as well.
*  You know who Renee DeRost is?
*  Yes. She was. Yes.
*  She was. She's been on this podcast.
*  Yeah, it's very interesting because that company that she worked for actually
*  apparently worked for the special election in Georgia, I think it was.
*  They actually applied some of those tactics.
*  It was. Is that is that for sure?
*  100 percent? I don't know.
*  100 percent. I think I think I think maybe that is true
*  with the company that she worked for.
*  But I don't know. She may not have been involved in it.
*  I do not believe she would have been.
*  She's a very interesting person.
*  They knew how to do it.
*  They had figured out how to do this stuff.
*  Her podcast with Sam Harris.
*  Have you ever. Yeah, yeah.
*  It's amazing. I've heard.
*  It's a couple of years back.
*  Yeah. Two years back.
*  And that's around the time.
*  Jamie, when was the name of that group she was with?
*  Because it was a foundation and a company and the data for democracy.
*  And I know a bunch of people.
*  What was the first one? New Knowledge.
*  I know a bunch of people said that they were involved in some
*  some things that mirrored some of the things she was talking about.
*  But I'm like, maybe they were.
*  But I mean, I don't think there was there was actually not the company
*  she works for. She's an individual.
*  You know, right. As an individual. Absolutely. Absolutely.
*  But as an individual talking to her about all these different memes
*  and all these different companies that were in these people
*  that were involved in Russia from the IRA, the Internet Research Agency,
*  like they're actively manipulating outrage.
*  They're trying to fuck with people.
*  They're trying to make people upset. And it's working.
*  Yeah. But this is being done.
*  Everyone's doing this.
*  But isn't there marketing companies doing it for the clients?
*  There are fast food companies, Burger King, McDonald's.
*  They're like going to war.
*  They like slam fest on on social media all the time.
*  They're like upping one other.
*  Fuck you, Burger King. Fuck you, Pizza Hut.
*  This is this is completely cultural.
*  Shit is changing, man.
*  They're all lucky that right now is a silent killer.
*  In and out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Go ahead with your ads.
*  Have you been you like water burger?
*  You tried our water burger. You like water burger.
*  You guys are cute with your water burger comparison to In-N-Out.
*  You can eat shit.
*  But water burger. By the way, no, man, water burger is the bomb.
*  Even In-N-Out loses to Five Guys. How about that?
*  Water burger uses special people to serve.
*  Five Guys uses jalapenos.
*  You know what I'm talking about, James? Yeah.
*  Murderers. So we have mentally challenged people
*  serving you at water burger.
*  Oh, they're fucking fantastic.
*  Oh, well, they will talk about the ketchup and you can.
*  Yeah. And they recognize you're in a hurry.
*  You then you should not be going to water burger.
*  Go to fucking a burger there.
*  You Five Guys, whatever you want.
*  You do not deserve the water burger experience.
*  You can't be in a hurry at either one of those places.
*  Yeah. Both of those.
*  The reason why they're awesome is they cook them right in front of you.
*  Mm hmm.
*  See, it's like cook them right in front of you or I hate myself
*  and I want Jack in the Box.
*  Those are the questions. Yeah.
*  That we need to answer. Yeah.
*  I'm really only a Burger King or McDonald's guy.
*  My issue would be late at night coming home from comedy.
*  If I was exhausted and tired, I did like two shows.
*  Yeah. Irvine improv.
*  Then I drove the hour.
*  I'm going to stop at McDonald's to eat three filet of fish like a fucking wolf.
*  I need it. Hey, man, are you going to miss your hang there at the comedy
*  comedy store?
*  It doesn't exist right now.
*  It's currently banned.
*  No, it's not banned.
*  Alcohol.
*  Alcohol is somehow or another better than jokes.
*  Yeah, we're drinking themselves to death and hanging themselves
*  with ceiling fans.
*  So I need to talk to you.
*  I need to talk to you about the division part because we can do something about.
*  I think we can.
*  And that division part, I'm
*  reluctantly coming to the acceptance that this stupid fucking show
*  that I created a long time ago with Brian Redband, young Jamie Vernon,
*  has some sort of social responsibility because.
*  I mean, it's the amount of people that listen, I don't want I'm a moron.
*  You're not supposed to be taking advice from me.
*  If I connect you to people that are interesting, congratulations.
*  But trust me, I like you.
*  I'm trying to figure my own things out.
*  If I'm 13 steps ahead in terms of like we're running a marathon,
*  13 steps ahead of you or 13 steps behind.
*  We're all doing the same thing.
*  We're all just trying to get better.
*  Wherever we are at any point in time, we're trying to get better.
*  And the best thing that anybody could ever encourage you to do
*  is think for yourself.
*  Use real critical thinking.
*  Don't connect yourself because I look people drive by me with American flags.
*  I'm a sucker. OK, I'm a sucker for America.
*  I love America.
*  My grandparents came here from Italy.
*  They had a great goddamn time.
*  They created my mom.
*  They created me and my my sister.
*  We are Americans.
*  I see that flag. I'm like, fuck yeah.
*  America, baby.
*  Fuck in America. Mm hmm.
*  But I think there's a problem with any kind of teams.
*  There's a problem with any any time we we look at each other like we're
*  on this and you're that. So fuck you.
*  And I think we need this is what we need to abandon.
*  We need to abandon our attachments to ideologies.
*  Even ideologies that we haven't recognized as ideologies.
*  Like, you know, like whatever the fuck it is.
*  The problem is not brown pride like Cain Velasquez.
*  You know who he is? No.
*  He's like one of the greatest UFC heavyweights of all time.
*  The only thing that kept him from being the GOAT,
*  the greatest of all time ever, is the fact that he kept getting injured.
*  He had a bunch of injuries like shoulder surgeries, knee surgeries, back surgery.
*  Like he's had he had like a cage put around his spine.
*  But when he was part of the problem was his will to fuck people up
*  was stronger than his body.
*  And so he would push his body past its limits and he just kept getting injured.
*  But that's also what made him so special, because when he was on top,
*  he would just smash people, just run through him.
*  He's the most American motherfucker of all time because his dad walked here
*  from Mexico. His dad walked, walked
*  from Mexico. He lives in San Jose.
*  You know how long that took?
*  That's a long fucking walk.
*  And his dad still do it, man, worked hard and gave him a life.
*  And then he became, in my opinion, when he was at his best,
*  the greatest heavyweight I've ever seen, in my opinion.
*  And he was a force of nature, insane cardio.
*  But his ability to overcome the feeling he could push through things
*  that other people weren't willing to.
*  That's why his body fell apart.
*  His knees blew out, his back blew, everything broke.
*  But it was because his mind was so strong.
*  Right. That's America.
*  That's America. Yeah.
*  Like that's as America as it gets.
*  As are my roots from Ireland, Scotland, Germany.
*  Exactly the same. Yes.
*  So what if we're very sensitive, we're very sensitive.
*  I think the root of most of this is coming from the racial issue, black, white.
*  And we need to we need to define some terms.
*  And this, I think, is very helpful.
*  Instead of saying African-American, black American, black, negro,
*  whatever we've had in the past.
*  I prefer ADOS, which is a lot of people understand this now,
*  which is American descendant of slavery.
*  That that makes very clear who you're talking about.
*  So you can say black, but Kamala Harris, not black.
*  Black. Yes.
*  Black in color, but not American descendant.
*  So you would make a clear distinction between an American descendant
*  of slavery and someone who.
*  If we want to fucking fix our country.
*  Yeah, yeah, we got to do that.
*  If we want to fix our country, this is what we have to do.
*  Malcolm X said before he became, you know, nation of Islam crazy.
*  A little off the radar for me.
*  He said the only way to fix the racial problem in the United States of America
*  is have a white man, a black man sit down at the table and work the fucking shit out.
*  That's what he said.
*  And I've been doing that for a year.
*  Yeah, because of a podcast, Mo Fax with Adam Curry.
*  But I've been talking to this.
*  I've been talking to this.
*  This is exactly what he started.
*  Calling me, explaining to me what a dose was.
*  I was trying to figure it out on no agenda.
*  And we were talking for an hour once a week.
*  I said, fuck it. This is a podcast.
*  And I have gotten an education in his.
*  He's like, does he have a website?
*  Who is he? Mo facts dot com.
*  M O E F A C T Z Mo facts.
*  It's not his real name.
*  His name is Mo.
*  It's real. That's short for Maurice.
*  But it's not facts. Is that his last name?
*  No. Imagine if it was that.
*  Well, he's like he was born.
*  He's like the Dalai Lama.
*  Well, it's like Trump is forty five savage.
*  You know, you got to have your you got to have.
*  What does that mean? Forty five savage.
*  Forty fifth president. Forty five savage.
*  What is forty five savage?
*  That's President Trump.
*  But what? That's his nickname.
*  A rapper called Twenty One Savage.
*  So he's so he's hello.
*  Hello. Hello.
*  Somehow or another, I'm younger than you, but older than you.
*  I got lucky this time. I got fucking lucky.
*  Yeah. Anyway, talking about so listen to country music.
*  What if what if our problem? OK.
*  So when when you have a dos,
*  American descendants of slavery, which Moe is one. Right.
*  If you have a dos, when politicians say the black and brown community,
*  they feel fucked because it's not just the black.
*  This is a group of very special Americans who deserve to be recognized as such. Right.
*  This is why they've always been led down the path of voting Democrat.
*  And now there's all this shit is in play.
*  So that's why black white is always played on us, because that's our weak spot.
*  That's our Achilles heel.
*  We're embarrassed about it.
*  Yeah, I agree with you. Fuck yeah. America.
*  I love my country.
*  I love our country.
*  But we have some fucked up shit that we're we instead of dealing with it,
*  we're letting other people hijack us over it.
*  That's what's going on here.
*  And and it's not racism that we suffer from.
*  It's nepotism. It's nepotism.
*  And I'll explain why.
*  If it truly was, and I can tell you, systemic racism absolutely existed
*  in America, and it went all the way up into the 70s.
*  With no man about the house rule.
*  When they came up from the south and went into the projects created by,
*  I guess, FDR and, you know, because they typically ate their own food.
*  Now they're coming here to work.
*  So the projects were created and welfare, but you could not have a man in the house.
*  And this went into the 70s that have patrols, making sure that there was no
*  family with children and a father.
*  Now we have 75 percent of all children in America
*  without a father in the household.
*  You and I, we got parent privilege.
*  We're not white privilege, parent privilege.
*  A man. My dad was, you know, didn't work out that great with us.
*  But he did put some shit into me and I grew up and he was around.
*  And there was some that influence was there.
*  That's our problem.
*  Who's running Black Lives Matter?
*  Name me one male leader of Black Lives Matter.
*  No, it's all women.
*  And I have no problem with it.
*  But I do question what's going on.
*  I can't argue with you because I don't know who the leaders are.
*  Oh, Patrice colors.
*  There's a number of women who,
*  yeah, and they all come from the old radical kind of Marxist.
*  Just one more thing.
*  True communists in 1936 tried to they want to come and overthrow America.
*  This has been going on for a long time.
*  We tried to export democracy.
*  They tried to bring socialism into us.
*  Clear. We do it by blowing your country up and rebuilding it.
*  They do it other ways.
*  They came in.
*  They wanted to propagate this message and no white people came.
*  But the poor black people came.
*  And so they became very associated with Marxism and leftist ideas.
*  And they were basically taken through into what is today is, I guess,
*  the Democratic Party.
*  And that's not working anymore because there's just strife
*  and there's no real solutions.
*  And even the first African-American president, not a dos,
*  didn't really deliver for them.
*  So this is this election, this time right now, it's fucking.
*  They're fucking with us because of this one thing
*  for their own power, left and right.
*  Is it? Oh, man.
*  Is it a that was an excellent joint I smoked earlier.
*  It's very good. Very good stuff.
*  Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you.
*  Is it possible that we're in this weird state with people
*  because we've decided that we are we're losing power in other aspects of our life.
*  So we're getting more and more determined to take it back in other places
*  because the fact that so many people have been denied the ability to make a living.
*  I mean, it's kind of crazy.
*  Yes. I mean, I don't know what to think about it.
*  But it seems to me that if I'm allowed to go to certain essential businesses
*  with a mask on and no one's dying.
*  I mean, if I'm going to a supermarket and everyone's wearing a mask,
*  everybody seems OK. Right.
*  And scientists seem to think they're OK.
*  Like at what point in time do we allow that for everywhere?
*  And at what point in time do we allow people to take chances?
*  We allow people to flip dirt bikes.
*  We allow people to fucking jump out of helicopters.
*  We allow people to do all kinds of crazy shit.
*  We allow people to wingsuit.
*  Why don't we allow people to not wear a mask?
*  Why don't we allow people to open up their business?
*  Why don't we allow people to do whatever they want to do?
*  Is it really the right and the idea is, well, you have to protect the other people.
*  I agree you do have to protect the other people.
*  But one of the things that's going to make the other people more vulnerable
*  is the collapse of the economy.
*  And we're not saying that for some reason.
*  There's this weird thing where politicians want you to love them
*  and they want you to love them.
*  So if you are leaning towards defunding the police and
*  and making sure that all the socialism ideas get accepted into major
*  universities and it gets taught in the curriculum and grade school,
*  if you drone on enough and the person who's running for mayor
*  knows the only way that they can win is to embrace your ideas,
*  they're going to fucking do it.
*  We got a dirty system.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  And you should be able to vote from your phone.
*  Right. But you can't. Right.
*  So we got this weird, corrupted, fucking intertwined system that
*  I mean, it's it's all voodoo.
*  Well, first of all, every country gets the government she deserves.
*  The question the question is not why do we allow people to tell us what to do?
*  It is why are we allowing them to actually tell us what to fucking do?
*  Who is now seriously?
*  We are afraid we've been.
*  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
*  This is a good one.
*  It's one thing to say the plane might crash, the car might crash.
*  You might get hit by a car.
*  You might die of an overdose.
*  It's another thing to say some other fucker without a mask might kill you, bitch.
*  That's some real fucking fear.
*  And that's not to be taken lightly.
*  That is not to be.
*  And they have they have fucked with us over this.
*  I don't care whether it's true or not or what's true or not.
*  The cavalier nature of this shutdown and fear and colors and stages
*  and numbers and charts and connecting it to the stock markets.
*  I don't like that about President Trump at all.
*  But see, he looks at what he calls the economy.
*  I don't know if he's behind this digital dollar or not,
*  but I think we're all going to be taking care of the 10 million
*  are going to be on a universal basic income.
*  And that's going to happen.
*  I'm not worried about that.
*  But what are we left with?
*  And just where do we go from there is going to be the question, because
*  look, what is what is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's slogan?
*  Do you know what their slogan is?
*  Brain damage in prison time. It should be.
*  Build back better.
*  Hmm. So that's pretty that's pretty clever.
*  OK, it's so clever that the same slogan is used by the United Nations,
*  the the Green New Deal Organization, three six three fifty dot org.
*  Boris Johnson is using it as his campaign.
*  Francois Macron using it as his campaign.
*  Justin Trudeau. Build back better.
*  This is a globalist plan. Build back better.
*  This is a globalist plan.
*  It means we're going to shut down all
*  coal and and gas and fracking.
*  And we're going as much as possible the transition to solar and wind.
*  Doesn't that sound like a good idea if it's feasible?
*  Yeah, I don't think it's feasible.
*  And but but what is being promised with the Green New Deal is we will create
*  good paying green new jobs.
*  Now, that's just a philosophy, whether you think it's good or not right now.
*  I don't think so. But for sure, I know that Bill Gates,
*  who is a big part of, you know, this Green New Deal,
*  that he's investing in nuclear plants,
*  because when the sun don't shine and the wind don't blow, you need some power.
*  And it's going to come from his nuclear plants.
*  How does Bill Gates have any ambition left?
*  Oh, man. Maybe he's being blackmailed.
*  What do you think he knows?
*  No, I think he's being blackmailed of stuff he's done.
*  I don't know. He showed up without a sweater.
*  Allegedly. Yeah.
*  Someone's got a picture of him with a tank top on doing
*  doing the fucking most muscular.
*  Yeah, you can't. This is another thing, man.
*  This whole Epstein business.
*  This has gotten millennials.
*  What's that?
*  Bill Gates meets with Jeffrey Epstein many times despite his past.
*  So this has gotten everyone nuts.
*  The kids are going like, ah, that guy.
*  And, you know, this is it's good, though, because there's something there.
*  Obviously, there's obviously something there.
*  Obviously something there.
*  Who the fuck knows where it is?
*  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop.
*  You seem to be one of those guys who's really in the conspiracies.
*  No, let me break this down. I analyze.
*  Let me break this down.
*  There's no way there's anything more to what you're seeing in the news.
*  Oh, well, it comes to a story.
*  Excuse me, please, sir.
*  About a man who traveled to Fuck Island with Bill Clinton 26 times.
*  Oh, wait, did he fly with Bill 26 times or you traveled to Fuck Island?
*  The government just fined me.
*  They just took the money straight out of my digital dollar wallet.
*  Oh, well, yeah, you thought you were fucking free with that flip phone.
*  Son, you're connected to the Internet.
*  This is what's so beautiful, man.
*  You're in the universe.
*  I'm in the universe.
*  You know, Dave Rubin's in the universe.
*  Ben Shapiro's in the universe.
*  Alex Jones is in the universe.
*  People are. There's a whole new structure.
*  Yes. We're out of control.
*  We don't know what the fuck they're doing.
*  They're going to try and control all of us one way or the other. Yes.
*  But the Internet, we pretty much have that.
*  We got free reign, man. We do, but we don't. We got it.
*  Yeah, we got so much.
*  We have a lot, but there's also a lot of censorship.
*  You don't need any of that.
*  You set up mastodon. You got your own network.
*  You don't social. You don't need any of that.
*  Let's be realistic when it comes down to it, Joe, for sure.
*  But there's a lot of people that had prominent voices that are silenced.
*  Yeah. Right. But they're they're now very prominent in a much smaller circle.
*  I'm prominent in a circle.
*  It got bigger once I visited you.
*  And I hope that yours got bigger as well.
*  And the two can be completely unaware of each other.
*  And crossovers happen and and the network starts to grow.
*  It's a whole new way of communicating.
*  No, I understand that. And I know you appreciate it.
*  What's happening before that? You're the you're.
*  But there's certain people that just get banned forever
*  from some social media platforms.
*  Yeah, but not from other ones. That's my point.
*  Yeah. But in this environment, shouldn't we take into account?
*  Like if you were going to ban someone, if you're going to like, say, listen,
*  there's a rational expectation
*  that a person should be able to say your beliefs are not in line with theirs.
*  They're going to kick you off this business that they own. Sure.
*  As long as the bit like.
*  But when it gets to be YouTube and you have 31 million subscribers and how many hours?
*  Five hundred hours a minute. Five hundred hours a minute.
*  Yeah. It's it's such a pipeline.
*  Like you can't tell me you're really monitoring this thing correctly.
*  It's not possible. No, of course it's not.
*  That's why we have everything has to be distributed.
*  It has to be.
*  But I think there should be much more stringent rules on whether or not you can ban someone.
*  Oh, I so don't give a flying fuck about what Facebook or YouTube or Google do.
*  It's so unimportant in the vast scale of what we can do.
*  I understand that. And I agree.
*  But in the individual, the person who has the YouTube channel,
*  who has earned this position and got screwed
*  and got screwed, that's not fair.
*  No, it's not. It's also not rational that they could just do it.
*  They don't have to go through a lengthy court proceeding.
*  They could just remove your income. A couple of things.
*  I believe on the commercial platforms that we're talking about in this case,
*  the problem is the business model advertisers don't like controversy.
*  Advertising has gone down drastically since the word coronavirus or covid-19
*  was blocked because they didn't want controversy.
*  So that's the reason why these networks do it.
*  I don't think they. Yes, there's people who ban conservatives specifically,
*  but that's because of the elite messaging system, the mainstream media,
*  also the pharmaceutical industry, a lot of finance is this message.
*  So that's what advertisers want.
*  Look at the pussies that the NBA are in Nike and how they kowtow to everybody.
*  Yes, I said it.
*  Look at how they kowtow and what they will and will not allow.
*  So that's all money based, very capitalistic, by the way.
*  That's totally cool.
*  But now we go to the way you and I were raised.
*  You know what? You're 50, you're 52.
*  53 now. Yeah, I'm 56 tomorrow.
*  Basically halfway dead.
*  I want to be 106. I got it.
*  I'm going to be 98. That's my that's my target. 98.
*  Yeah. Why that number?
*  I don't know. Well, my grand my bring my grandparents both lived to 98.
*  My paternal grandparents.
*  The reason why I brought up Gavin is that I think that there I have had
*  a couple of podcasts with him and people have had like weird conversations.
*  Sure. And I've said this is one of the things I've said is like, look,
*  the guy's mostly fun. Yeah.
*  Mostly fun. And like anybody that does wild shit, you can get lost in the woods.
*  And if you get lost in the woods of race or or or or whether or not
*  people should be able to able to able to do drugs or whether or not
*  people should get paid a minimum wage, that's a livable wage.
*  You get lost in the woods and any ideology and it becomes a problem.
*  Let's go back for whatever reason.
*  When when someone shifts one way or another and we conflict with those ideas,
*  we never give anybody any room for for just being a person.
*  Most of the time, I've been around that guy. He's a nice guy.
*  But let's go to the basics of how I
*  there's two things I was taught growing up.
*  Sticks and stones will break my bones. Names will never hurt me.
*  Secondary. OK, I will.
*  I've made this created in the depression.
*  Hold on. They're fucking terrible.
*  I don't so mean. Exactly.
*  And I can pinpoint when that happened, too.
*  So we had that. And then the.
*  I don't like what you say, but I will defend to the death.
*  You're right to say it.
*  These are the two core values that I was raised.
*  That's what I'm talking about.
*  That's what I'm talking about with everybody, whether it's that.
*  Those were the core values.
*  And that is our constitutional deal.
*  Yes. That's the deal.
*  And this includes Louis Farrakhan.
*  This includes everyone. Everybody. Everybody.
*  Everybody. Mitch O'Connell.
*  Everybody. Tell me what you think, bro.
*  Exactly. Right. All of them.
*  And this is this is so important.
*  The moment we stop other people from expressing their opinions,
*  first of all, we are coddling everybody else.
*  We're trying to pretend this is where it happened.
*  But we're trying to pretend that other people are dumber than us.
*  Like, I know, I know that that preacher is full of shit,
*  but I need to protect you, Adam Curry, because you might just give up your money
*  for this one person because he needs a new jet.
*  OK. Right. So this started about six years ago
*  when hate speech came into the conversation
*  and bullying and bullying became bullying laws,
*  which I remember because we were doing the show and like, this is an actual
*  First Amendment violation to create a law that says
*  you can't say something mean about somebody else.
*  That's bullshit.
*  Now, it may not be nice.
*  It may not be appropriate in the setting.
*  It may not be according to the school rules, but actual laws were created.
*  So now we have hate speech and hate crimes, which is really undefinable.
*  But it's all it's all sadly all
*  geared towards controlling what the fuck you can say.
*  Well, it's it's a natural human instinct when you have power to exert it.
*  It's natural. Yeah. It's why there's Alphas.
*  We're too good, man.
*  We're we're nice fucking people.
*  And we let us men be treated as doofuses in every single commercial, every TV show.
*  Oh, sorry, honey. I got the wrong washing powder.
*  Do you know why we do that? Because we want to fuck and we want.
*  I know we got to get over that.
*  You want the wife to calm down. You got to get over that shit.
*  I'm sorry. I fucked up the laundry.
*  No, once you learn that that woman is just as sex crazy as you are,
*  she just has a different way of expressing it.
*  Once you figure that out and you play that game and they play your game
*  and you know the game and you're fucking equal, bro.
*  And that's when sparks fly.
*  I found that I'm telling you, I found that with my wife.
*  When that shit happens, that's it.
*  And this is what is this is what happened with Donald Trump.
*  This is what I truly believe.
*  I agree with you, by the way. I'm joking around.
*  No, I know you do. I know.
*  I love that you give me shit because it makes it all coded
*  and people who are really listening will get it.
*  People are like, here's a supporter of Gavin McInnes.
*  I'm a supporter of human beings.
*  They got triggered two hours ago.
*  I'm also a supporter of people that are radically left wing that I don't agree with.
*  I think a lot of them just need hugs.
*  We need to be embraced by our community.
*  So we we we dig our heels in and we fight against anyone
*  that we think opposes our safety, our security and our comfort.
*  And our and our and our ability to be to feel loved and to be happy.
*  Here's where you in particular can change the world.
*  Jesus Christ. I want to lay it on you, bro.
*  Yes, you can change the fucking pot, Father.
*  And just by the way, shout out to Texas Silver Star Whiskey.
*  Yeehaw, motherfucker. That's very good.
*  It's good shit. It's very smooth.
*  What can I do to save the world?
*  So feel like I'm in a watchman before before all.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Before all this BLM stuff came in, it was male toxic masculinity.
*  And a lot of a lot of it, of course, me too.
*  And a lot of it. Absolutely right.
*  And there's a lot of that bullshit. But yeah.
*  We let we let them cut our gonads off
*  and we need to stand up a little bit.
*  Not that women can't do what we need to do right now,
*  which is take control of the fucking situation in more ways than one.
*  But we need to help shepherd them.
*  I know a lot of bad ass women.
*  So do you, who could fuck anything and anybody up?
*  And they're great and they could be great leaders.
*  But we need to shepherd the whole civilization of men and women,
*  in particular, men and men with their families, particularly in ADOS.
*  That's where we need to see this happen.
*  And that's why Trump is going to probably sweep the election
*  with a male black vote who are sick of this shit.
*  And they see it and their gonads dropped.
*  They went, you know what? Fuck yeah.
*  And this is not a bad thing. This is very, very good.
*  It's very good.
*  It's controversial, I'm sure, because people just don't like to hear that.
*  And I and I'm like you, man.
*  LGBT, LGBTQ, IAPK plus.
*  I know the whole fucking acronym forwards and backwards.
*  I grew up in Amsterdam.
*  Hello. But I'm anti war.
*  You know, I don't like spending like a motherfucker with the government.
*  I don't want a digital dollar, but I do want love and peace
*  and everything that we can have.
*  I got this doesn't have to be either or.
*  Right. It doesn't have to be.
*  Why? I vote across the board.
*  I'm like, oh, that guy, her, you know, here in Austin,
*  no matter who's up there, I'm against them.
*  You know, the kind of prejudice that I receive is so minimal.
*  Oh, really? It's offensive if you discuss it.
*  But really, with the but one prejudice that I've always encountered
*  is that I'm a bro.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  But it's valid.
*  It's the thing. If I was if I was someone who wasn't a bro
*  and I saw me, I'd be like, that guy's a bro.
*  It's not bad that they look at it that way.
*  In a sense, it's their job.
*  If you're going to mock the opposing idea.
*  Yeah. And the opposing idea is easily mockable.
*  Yeah. As am I. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You're supposed to do it. It's mean.
*  It's it's a feeling. It's no, but it is.
*  It is. It's mean. It doesn't feel mean.
*  I'm OK. OK. I just work out a lot.
*  I go through it all like whatever they're throwing at me.
*  I burn it off. It doesn't feel mean. Yeah.
*  Because I was them.
*  I've been that person who was disenfranchised and lonely
*  and disconnected and didn't have like real close friends and didn't
*  have a real like community where they say I'm protected.
*  I'm connected. I didn't have that.
*  So I understand all sorts of weird,
*  unnecessary anger that people have.
*  But my perspective is we have to look at the world
*  that we exist in currently as a series of pipelines
*  to your consciousness.
*  And you have to limit the amount of entries
*  because there's there's only a certain amount of bandwidth
*  that you have to managing life.
*  And if you have a thing you love, whether that thing is
*  you are a songwriter and a singer and you have you have these thoughts,
*  these emotions that you wish you could figure out a way where other people
*  could see the beauty in your perspective and to put it through a song
*  that rhymes with the perfect notes on a guitar and just get into someone's
*  consciousness and make them feel better.
*  You want to do that. Right.
*  And this is what what it is to be a person.
*  What is a lot of kids 20 to 30, I just call them kids, are doing this now.
*  They're disconnecting, they're unhooking, they're getting flip phones.
*  They got no cable subscription.
*  And this is because they're poor.
*  And the best no income.
*  This is the best.
*  You have to eat the rich.
*  I know several homeless guys and they all have phones.
*  And they got data plans and it's no problem.
*  It's you can be homeless in America with a smartphone in L.A.
*  That's a real problem. You can camp.
*  It's the same here right now.
*  Minnesota doesn't have a whole lot of homeless people that make it in the winter.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  It's too hard out there. You got to get a job.
*  No, this is this is a a dumb idea.
*  The way Austin went about this.
*  Austin is not the worst. L.A. is way dumber.
*  L.A. is preposterous.
*  It's so sad what what has happened to all of California.
*  L.A. has Boulder, Colorado inside of it.
*  Yeah. But homeless, homeless. Yeah.
*  I mean, they don't even know what the numbers are.
*  They were 70,000 when the economy was booming. Yeah.
*  When the economy was at its peak a couple of years ago,
*  there was 70,000 homeless people in Los Angeles. Yeah.
*  What's the current estimate?
*  I don't know.
*  But I think we talked about this before,
*  that the primary cause of homelessness is catastrophic loss of family.
*  There's that, but there's also drug addiction.
*  But that comes along with it.
*  But yeah, maybe a lot of people are abused.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  But I think like a severe
*  perturbance of your development emotionally, psychologically.
*  Yes. As a child contributes greatly to you being a homeless person.
*  Even drug users are a community. Yes.
*  So then they have their own community of drug use and scoring and whatever else.
*  I was still a community. I was under the bridge once.
*  One of them underpasses that was a campground.
*  And I was looking at these dudes just hanging out, talking to each other.
*  I'm like, if you didn't have nothing, this might be a better place to be.
*  I want to take you to Community First Village here.
*  Just a little bit outside of Austin.
*  You're trying to give me tuberculosis or some other sort of. Yeah.
*  What do you do?
*  It'll blow your mind when you see this.
*  This is just small, tiny homes.
*  OK, this is a nonprofit that set it up and they're getting people back
*  on their feet in their community, in their own community.
*  There's no policing.
*  It's really magical what's happening there.
*  This was my reason why I thought that universal basic income is a good idea.
*  What I thought of is not.
*  Not. An impossible like
*  you could live off of it sort of.
*  But it's a struggle, just enough so you can get by.
*  That's the idea. So just give people just just say, listen,
*  there's something wrong if bankers can make a trillion dollars a month,
*  like whatever the fuck the number is, there's something wrong.
*  How about this?
*  Let's figure out a way to organize taxes
*  so that people get enough so that no one in America has to starve to death.
*  If we were kind people who are truly patriotic,
*  the number one goal would be no one who lives in America should starve to death.
*  Right. Correct. That's number one.
*  And then from there, we move on to other things. Right.
*  That's a good way to start.
*  And I'm here to tell you again, it's coming.
*  And I think the number will be 24 to 2500 dollars a month.
*  And anyone who has or is has or is
*  making less than seventy five thousand dollars will get that.
*  That's ridiculous. It's going to happen.
*  But isn't if you make more than 50 grand a year, shouldn't you be on your own?
*  Like, listen, bro, like help the system out.
*  Disconnect. You want to try living in Austin on 50 grand a year?
*  I like I like tent living.
*  Yeah. Well, OK. You're in.
*  Buy batteries. You're in. You're in. You're in.
*  Well, in that case, you're in.
*  No, you're right.
*  But what I'm saying is we don't want people starving to death. No.
*  We don't want people
*  ever being in a situation where they don't know where they're going to get shelter.
*  OK, so where we're going to get food.
*  But but hold on.
*  But is the situation where it's at because of
*  unintended, uncontrollable circumstances like Covid,
*  where everybody's like, what the fuck? Who? Who?
*  Who would have told you you need to have a year supply of money and food?
*  No, it's nobody would have told you that, right?
*  But that's where we are now.
*  It's our mentality. You can't blame those people.
*  It's our mentality, our mentality, which
*  went away from true community helping each other.
*  Often that was situated around a church.
*  That's why we have none still, you know, the kind of with the hospital services,
*  all kinds of services, barter services with the butcher if you only had wheat, etc.
*  And we've moved towards this man in the middle.
*  Hey, my fucking neighbor is an asshole.
*  We don't go over anymore and talk to the neighbor and say, bro, can we talk?
*  No. Hello, 911. My neighbor is being an asshole.
*  Everything we have a goddamn middleman for, that is our own fault.
*  We need to realize that that we do need to communicate
*  peer to peer at some point to have.
*  You can't have a community if you're only talking through lawyers and that's true.
*  But every now and then you get a neighbor like Rand Paul, Rand Paul's neighbor
*  fucking tackles you and breaks your ribs.
*  What do you do? Yeah, that can happen.
*  What do you do with that guy? You need to have someone you can call.
*  I'm not against that. I'm not against that.
*  I'm just saying. But so that neighbor, he didn't call the police and say,
*  Rand Paul's a fucking right wing racist or whatever.
*  He went over there and beat his ass.
*  And that's sad. But Rand Paul should have shot his ass.
*  Well, no, no, no. Yes, yes.
*  He attacked him from behind. Yes, yes.
*  Took him down from behind. Broke his ribs. Regardless.
*  He should have shot him later.
*  You get my point that everything here, every covid sneeze has a lawyer attached to it.
*  Everything's a fucking legal affair.
*  We're always deal.
*  I'm sure in all deals you've done as a manager and lawyers and accountants.
*  And like and that motherfucker goes down the line.
*  And if you know, you know, if I could just sit with the guy for two minutes,
*  like, let's do this right now. Entanglements.
*  Thanks. Get the way of the world.
*  Deeper and deeper.
*  The world that's what's so beautiful about life.
*  And this is a great time.
*  Well, it's a great time to be a podcaster.
*  It's beautiful about life because all of these things that have happened,
*  whether it's the Internet or the electric car or.
*  Anything air travel, someone competing against other people
*  that are also formulating similar ideas.
*  I mean, this is just what we've had.
*  And what we're experiencing today is a massive moment of chaos,
*  which in my personal life has always been followed by a great growth.
*  Yes. Always. Yes.
*  Because my personal life and I believe in the microcosm
*  and I believe in the macrocosm and I believe there's a situation
*  where a thing that you feel that you if you can express it the right way,
*  it resonates with people and it can help everybody.
*  I really do believe that. Yes.
*  I think it's part of one of the more fascinating things about
*  the way we feel when other human beings express themselves,
*  whether it's a speech to a graduating class, you know, whether it's
*  a book that you wrote or a film that you made.
*  There's something that people do that makes other people feel a certain way.
*  And we recognize it when we're creating it. And.
*  What those things are, those moments of of of of energy,
*  we're all come together in excitement.
*  We can maximize those.
*  We can have more of them instead of being in conflict over fucking
*  whether or not Ellen DeGeneres is a bitch.
*  And let's just let's figure out a way to be just stop.
*  Just be nice.
*  There's this better feelings for yourself and for the community
*  and for all around you by just just putting your energy into positive things,
*  putting your energy into things that are beneficial.
*  It's easy to attack. It's easy.
*  Now, you're global, which makes it so great.
*  This is happening in every country around the world.
*  Black Lives Matter, racial strife, racial division, very different story than us.
*  It's in the UK, it's in the Netherlands.
*  Everybody has some story.
*  And but it's all different.
*  They should not have the same guilt maybe that we should have.
*  But it's being used as a wedge to divide people.
*  And I think that we have enough platforms and enough reach
*  to let people know that figure it out, go look around.
*  But you're definitely being manipulated.
*  And the whole idea is not to have that happen.
*  What you just said.
*  And we have the means.
*  We don't need to go through every mainstream Silicon Valley company
*  to communicate with each other.
*  So that is there for us at the taking.
*  We just have to do it. It's that simple.
*  We have all this power.
*  We're just not using it yet.
*  But there's always conflict between human beings.
*  Of course.
*  And there always will be because there's there's a desirable mating outcomes.
*  And there's yell all you want at each other online.
*  Yell all you want. That's great.
*  I hope we find places and there are many already for people to go
*  yell without anyone intervening or taking down.
*  Just let them yell.
*  Let them yell. Let them yell. Let them yell.
*  It's good. Let it let it all out.
*  Taking someone away is fucking stupid.
*  It's short sighted and stupid for short term capital gain.
*  This is what I'm talking about in terms of censoring people online.
*  I think it actually has unintended consequences of bolstering up the other side.
*  Of course it does.
*  Because it makes them look like the people on the right now look at the people on the left
*  as being unreasonable, unwilling to talk.
*  And they banned this person from Facebook and YouTube.
*  So now I get to go back to my America Online analogy
*  because it's inevitable.
*  This is what always happens.
*  America Online was a closed system and the internet was out here.
*  And everyone on AOL, I'm sure you were on there like, oh, cool chat room.
*  Not me, bro.
*  Yeah, you were looking up conspiracy theory.
*  Shut up, Rogan. I know what you were doing.
*  You and your fears.
*  Meanwhile, we're on the free internet going all conspiracy dot alien probe in my anus.
*  And I got a picture of it and all this.
*  And so we're having a good time.
*  Kids on AOL went, hey, AOL, we want to access the internet, man.
*  We want the fucking internet because that's where the danger is.
*  That's where the cool stuff is.
*  And they finally opened up a little portal.
*  Okay, here's your browser.
*  And everybody was gone.
*  And AOL became a dial-up access service.
*  Because everybody wants...
*  Do you remember this?
*  We want the...
*  Yes, man, I was a part of this shit.
*  Ready for this?
*  Yeah.
*  You've got mail.
*  Pretty good, right?
*  Goodbye.
*  Goodbye.
*  Solid.
*  So...
*  It's always a dude telling you you've got mail.
*  That's your boss.
*  So...
*  Right? It's not a Chinese lady.
*  That's where it's always going to be at, my friend.
*  It's always going to be the dangerous outside.
*  That's where I like to live and thrive.
*  Well, there's always going to be the tip of progress.
*  And everything else underneath is going to be...
*  But the question is, who's right when you see these people in Portland
*  that are fucking burning trash in the lobby of the mayor's apartment complex?
*  Are they right when they're holding up a...
*  A fucking...
*  A big sheet that says, resign?
*  Are they right?
*  I don't mind about this big sheet with resign.
*  And you can't be making fire.
*  That's not okay.
*  That's not okay.
*  You can kill all those people.
*  No, you can't kill anybody.
*  If they threw that fire in and they didn't know that the floor was plastic...
*  No, but of course not okay.
*  And the plastic took off...
*  That's not okay.
*  Like instantly and burned the whole...
*  And everybody in this...
*  How many fucking...
*  I think there's like 1,200 units or something.
*  The good news is this shit is starting to end because...
*  Is it?
*  Joe Biden campaign realized that this was not good for their numbers.
*  And so now they're out saying, no, you should stop rioting.
*  Stop rioting.
*  It's a real danger that they...
*  Yeah.
*  It may not be...
*  Maybe...
*  We have a problem.
*  Just some people...
*  I think you know it inherently, but no federal troops can go into Portland
*  or any other place without it being requested.
*  This is very important in our structure.
*  We don't have a stasi system.
*  You can come in and fucking kick everyone's ass.
*  You have to get requests.
*  Yeah.
*  You got someone's going, hey, I need your help.
*  Come on in, feds.
*  That's what it's for.
*  Federal government is very unimportant really in the overall scheme.
*  It's supposed to be.
*  But we good people of America have let it come pretty far with going back to what it's supposed to be.
*  Can we pause on this?
*  I gotta pee so bad.
*  Can we hold this, Jamie?
*  Yeah.
*  You need to pee?
*  Yes.
*  Let's do this.
*  All right.
*  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
*  First ever podcast from Austin.
*  And we're back.
*  That was wonderful.
*  I'm here because of you.
*  I said that at the beginning, but it is true.
*  Now, I want to know about your other plans.
*  So Tina, the keeper, my wife and I, we've been catching up on a little Joe Rogan history.
*  We've been watching your standups during the shutdown.
*  You, my friend, are one funny motherfucker.
*  And you do physical shit and you're so on.
*  And it's just where are you going to use this creative energy, this side of you in the world?
*  I mean, what's the plan?
*  Where does this go?
*  What do you do as a comic?
*  Because I know that I know you're a podcaster and obviously you're changing the world.
*  But I know that I think I know that your core passion is that.
*  I love stand up, but I think it's really important to just be a person.
*  And if you I did one comedy date during the pandemic.
*  I did the Houston improv.
*  I did it with my friend Brian Moses and I did it with my friend Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  We had a great fucking time.
*  I met Willie D from the ghetto boys.
*  Dan Crenshaw came down.
*  We had a good time.
*  But the end of the day, I was like, damn, I don't want to catch it
*  and give it to somebody I care about.
*  Because you're fucking new.
*  Right.
*  If I knew that I couldn't ever give it to somebody, I could only get it myself.
*  I'd have a different perspective.
*  And I'd probably be.
*  I think you've already you've already adjusted your risk profile.
*  I mean, yesterday when I was here, I got the antibody test and everything still hurt.
*  Does it?
*  Damn.
*  Well, I use this finger a lot apparently trigger finger.
*  I use it for mouse clicks.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck sensitive little thing there.
*  But right away, you know, even without even waiting for the results,
*  you're like, nah, bro, you don't have it.
*  You're good.
*  Listen, which is appropriate.
*  If you're not on how we've always taken.
*  This is the view of people we've always taken.
*  If you look healthy and you feel healthy, you're probably healthy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  This is what it's crazy to think it that way, isn't it?
*  Yeah.
*  Instead, now we're like, you might have it.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's understandable because when it did emerge on North America,
*  we thought it was going to be like the plague.
*  We thought it was like the Spanish.
*  We were we were shown models and everything.
*  They might have been right and they might have been wrong.
*  Fortunately, they were wrong.
*  But this idea that it's a conspiracy, I'm not buying it.
*  But all of it, I think it's more than anything.
*  There are people that take advantage of moments of things that happen.
*  But there's also like people just panic and make good moves and bad moves.
*  And they don't necessarily have to make sense in retrospect.
*  It wasn't it wasn't the right call in terms of like what we thought
*  like the covid-19 was going to be for this country.
*  But they thought it was going to be way worse.
*  And if they were wrong and it was way worse, it would have been horrific.
*  So what is the mechanism where the people in every country can communicate this back
*  in a manner to the people who we've chosen to represent us?
*  That's not offensive.
*  Well, to take it into account, this is how we feel and we need some change.
*  There were protests in Trafalgar Square, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin
*  and in Switzerland, Zurich.
*  And they were completely peaceful.
*  Nobody with masks just saying, hey, we want out.
*  Now, we have here other problems going out is now an issue because of rioting and protesting.
*  But in general, people around the world are starting to say,
*  we don't like this.
*  And they're trying to communicate it.
*  We are the only fuckers who have the guns to back it up.
*  That's what's interesting right now.
*  Because that's also what they're for.
*  That's also what the Second Amendment is about is to, in my mind, to protect the First Amendment.
*  But also like, hey, we all the people here, I don't want this.
*  And we're kind of willing to back it up.
*  So here we are with our stuff.
*  Yeah, it's such a strange perspective.
*  It's fucking it's medieval, Joe.
*  But here we are.
*  We haven't done our we haven't learned our history.
*  We haven't looked at it properly.
*  Did you see the video of what happened in Portland when that guy did?
*  Yeah, of course, of course.
*  I mean, it's like basic tribal war.
*  One guy sprays mace, the other guy shoots a gun.
*  My buddy Moe, he says, this is a civil war between white people.
*  We're stepping the fuck back.
*  And he's right, man.
*  He's right.
*  Yes, but now more than ever, we need to get together with our ADOS brothers and sisters
*  and say, stop, this is bullshit.
*  We're not.
*  This is not the real problem here.
*  Stop it now.
*  Well, anytime you have an open group that anyone can join,
*  it's hard to get people that do the dumbest shit to get to the front of the line at the
*  top of the heap.
*  Yeah, but we doesn't necessarily jive with the ideas of the rest of our children
*  have been over socialized.
*  They've been made to be afraid of everything they say.
*  Can't make a joke about Christians, can't make a joke about Jews, can't make a joke
*  about gay, lesbian, transgender, can't make a joke about can't even slip up on one little
*  thing.
*  Forget race.
*  Are you doing the work, Joe Rogan?
*  You've got to read the book.
*  This is book.
*  That's White Fragility by Robin D'Angelo, the biggest perpetrator of this crap I've
*  ever heard of.
*  But I read Matt Taibbi's response.
*  Spot on.
*  Taibbi is a legend.
*  I pay for his content.
*  I'll pay him $40 a month.
*  I'll pay him $400 a month.
*  That guy is doing the work.
*  He's one of the most important journalists.
*  The only guy who reported on the Wall Street 2008 and he had to go and learn how all this
*  intricate shit worked.
*  He's a real representative of his honest opinions.
*  That's rare.
*  A journalist.
*  That's the problem.
*  We've gotten hooked into these systems, whether it's right or left or whatever it is,
*  where your vested interest is in agreeing with whatever the people on your side think
*  it's just real dangerous for people.
*  It's not how we operate.
*  Well, there's another problem.
*  What we all used to see was the typical local news.
*  You see your Today Show on NBC.
*  They break in with the local weather.
*  What we saw in Wisconsin is we saw a struggle.
*  We saw cops walking behind a guy.
*  We saw the guy trying to get into his car, the cop pulling him back, shooting.
*  We saw that.
*  What is distilled down to the Today Show local level is unarmed black men shot by cops while
*  getting into car.
*  I don't care what happened.
*  You can't present that as the facts that we've seen.
*  That's bullshit.
*  So either don't do it or show it or maybe just wait until we have some information
*  because that is setting a biased message.
*  By the way, Fox News is just as complicit on all sides of this.
*  Who the fuck knows who's running that show?
*  It should be something along the lines of police shoot man.
*  Thank you.
*  That would be a good starter.
*  Is it that we have this expectation for, whether it's Reuters or CNN or whatever,
*  for them to be...
*  Authoritative.
*  Perfect.
*  This is what happens.
*  Well, turns out no.
*  It isn't the problem.
*  There's money involved.
*  And if they can say police shoot black man, unarmed black man, that's worth more money.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that a consideration, do you think, when they write headlines?
*  Yes, completely.
*  I just read the other day, Texas mandates vaccines for all school children.
*  I'm like, all right, let me take a look.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  Of course, Texas has conscientious objections.
*  Give me fucking break.
*  Is that like naturopathicnews.com?
*  No, that was mainstream.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, mainstream.
*  An affiliate of Reuters or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the problem.
*  I know that everybody thinks they're fighting a good fight.
*  I really do believe that.
*  Of course we do.
*  That's what makes us so great.
*  It's the thing about people.
*  It's so easy for us to accept one ideology versus another.
*  Well, we just have to remember one thing.
*  We just have to, then this is the thing that's most shocking.
*  There is, it's okay to disagree.
*  It's okay to be angry with each other.
*  Were you just looking at Jamie's ass?
*  He was going into the tricaster.
*  I kind of looked like you were.
*  I have to make sure his back's okay.
*  Jamie broke his ass.
*  And I feel responsible.
*  Really, really broke his ass?
*  Yeah, we had those hoverboards.
*  I almost broke my ass too.
*  Jamie was filming it.
*  And the hoverboard went left and he went right and he landed on his, Jamie?
*  On your hoverboard?
*  Care to explain?
*  On the corner?
*  On his butt bone?
*  I have to only assume that's what caused it,
*  but the actual injury didn't come for 10 months after that.
*  Really?
*  It was a fracture, an actual broken ass?
*  I didn't get an x-ray, but there was a bone that was not where it was supposed to be that caused
*  a litany of problems up and down the side of my body.
*  A bone that wasn't where it was supposed to be?
*  Yeah, some little bone in the part of your hip that it's back down.
*  Did it break off?
*  No, it just was adjusted in a weird spot.
*  If I feel it now, it doesn't feel like it used to.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I can hear clicks and pops from my stretch and stuff.
*  That's the craziest thing about chiropractic shit, right?
*  It's like even though it has a wacky beginning, what if the dude was accidentally right?
*  Right now I have weird crazy pops in my neck that hurt sometimes, but
*  I don't know if a chiropractor could fix it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  If you hear the story of like, what was the woman that wrote chiropractors are bullshit?
*  Oh, gosh, I don't know.
*  Was it that?
*  There's a guy who is a producer of my show, and he's like, I really want you to give this to Joe.
*  He's all about chiropractic, and apparently you're against that.
*  You don't believe in it or whatever.
*  And he's like, dude, I just wanted Joe to see it, and this is one guy he could talk to.
*  And it's very interesting because I don't know anything about the controversy,
*  whatever.
*  It's just very interesting.
*  Who wrote it, Jamie?
*  Yeah, Yvette.
*  I just didn't want to fuck over last night.
*  The Entremont.
*  She was a guest on the podcast, and she researched chiropractic medicine.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I didn't know this.
*  It's interesting.
*  Created by a dude who was a magnetic healer.
*  And he was killed by his son, ran him over with a car, took over the business,
*  and started promoting the idea that adjusting people's backs to fix fucking leukemia and shit.
*  Oh, I don't know about all that.
*  Blindness.
*  I don't know about all that.
*  You just pop people's backs.
*  It was lunacy.
*  But I think, what if maybe they were onto something accidentally?
*  It is possible.
*  Well, that's like my applied kinesiology, which you don't believe in.
*  What is that?
*  Applied kinesiology.
*  And I've been going to this.
*  Sure, I don't believe in it.
*  Because we talked about it after the show.
*  I might have changed my mind.
*  Okay, well.
*  And by the way, when you called two days after the show, that was a thrill.
*  I'm like, holy shit, Joe fucking Rogan just called me.
*  You texted me.
*  You called me.
*  You called me.
*  It bothers me that it's a thrill.
*  No, that was like, no, because I remember.
*  I really connected with you.
*  It was cool.
*  We did.
*  We had a good connection.
*  I liked that.
*  I really do appreciate you as being your patient zero.
*  You really are.
*  You're the guy who started this whole thing.
*  100%.
*  There's no one else who deserves the credit.
*  It's you.
*  And you're also an interesting guy because you've always had an analytical view of anything.
*  Whatever problems there are, technological, political, you look at it.
*  And when I listen to your podcast, I'm like, this guy's thinking about what's going on here.
*  Is this happening?
*  Is that happening?
*  You're not committed to any one cleanly grooved path.
*  Like you, I have a lot of people who I'm connected to.
*  Particularly because of the show, you were connected to some of the most amazing minds
*  that are out there.
*  And you suck that up.
*  It's crazy.
*  You suck it up.
*  It's true.
*  You memorize stuff.
*  I have the same thing.
*  You memorize stuff.
*  I'm like, oh, okay, that's interesting.
*  And you can weigh that.
*  But ultimately, I don't think either of us really come from any,
*  I really want it to be like this or that.
*  No, it's just pure luck.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Pure luck.
*  And what the fuck is this?
*  But this is a crazy, crazy time.
*  We are so connected.
*  There's so many impulses, so many signals, so much happening.
*  Mayor of Portland, get out of that fucking apartment building.
*  They know where you're sleeping, bro.
*  There's a thousand other people sleeping in that building.
*  Get out of there.
*  The good chance all of that ends November 4th.
*  The good chance a lot of things end November 4th.
*  It's September.
*  They're going to light that guy's place on fire.
*  But doesn't that kind of show that it's out of control?
*  Something has to happen.
*  What if?
*  The reason why all this shit is going on up there.
*  It's just a little piece of what's going on in the world.
*  Everyone's depressed.
*  It's like a big old Twilight movie.
*  It's all up, getting rained on and shit.
*  My buddy, he used to be my assistant.
*  Back at MTV, he was the VJ coordinator, Ken.
*  And he took this all, and I love Ken to death.
*  He took it hook, line, and sinker.
*  And he and his husband haven't seen another human being for four or five months.
*  They have nothing, nothing came in, nothing came out.
*  All he knows is that Trump has sent in goons to go and create a problem in downtown Portland.
*  There's a lack of real information for a lot of people.
*  There's a lack of information.
*  I'm not saying one way or the other, but all I know, I'm seeing President Trump
*  doing some very interesting shit.
*  And he's standing in the middle of things I've thought have been a problem for a long time.
*  The media for sure, he calls it fake news.
*  The pharmaceutical industry, a lot of bullshit.
*  He's sitting right there going, this is bullshit.
*  And while he's still making a lot of interesting things happen that I don't think is good,
*  he's also removed the pharmacy benefit managers.
*  So actually the prices will actually come down.
*  He's deregulated insurance so you can do it across state lines.
*  These are all things that I think are very, very good.
*  He's standing in the middle of the military industrial complex saying,
*  it's the fucking military industrial complex.
*  They want war.
*  I'm here to keep that shit down.
*  We'll sell our stuff.
*  Those things I like a lot.
*  The problem is his persona, which is what, you know these people very,
*  you've been around very successful people.
*  A lot of them are illiterate.
*  Can't even write a fucking email.
*  But they're incredibly wealthy and successful because they have-
*  They like to use you are.
*  Excuse me?
*  You are instead of you're.
*  That's an issue.
*  With someone really smart.
*  They send you an email that says you are instead of you are.
*  These incredibly, or there with EI.
*  Yeah.
*  So these people, the elites of the world, which is really.
*  I don't know if they're illiterate.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  They will tolerate a Donald Trump at their party because he's rich
*  and he's important to them.
*  But when it really comes down to it, he's not part of us.
*  So that's the problem.
*  This is you've seen this.
*  Right.
*  But isn't that just human nature?
*  Yes.
*  I'm not saying it's not, but let's not.
*  They do that with everything.
*  Recognize it and move on.
*  Let's just recognize.
*  How do we do that, Adam Curry?
*  By doing this podcast, Joe Rogan.
*  We are the world.
*  We are the children.
*  We're going to make that shit happen.
*  We can help.
*  Yeah, I think just by being men, giving a male perspective,
*  doesn't matter which guest you bring yourself.
*  And that's important.
*  That's why.
*  Why are people attracted to you?
*  Why?
*  Besides you being very handsome.
*  Why?
*  Somewhere in my wife's shirt.
*  Yeah, whatever.
*  You've got a beautiful family, man.
*  She's got a she had this elbow shirt on.
*  That's a good one.
*  It's mine, bitch.
*  I didn't say bitch.
*  If I did, she would know I'm joking.
*  Of course she would.
*  Dude, I think we're in a weird stage as human beings.
*  I really believe this.
*  And that we have this battles going on between people
*  and all sorts of ideologies and perspectives.
*  And some of them are real valid, right?
*  Like police shooting people they shouldn't shoot.
*  Real valid.
*  And then you see videos of them not shooting white people.
*  Maybe they should have shot.
*  You see those things.
*  You're like, hey, what the fuck is going on?
*  Especially if that's all you see.
*  If you're a young black man, you see all you see is videos
*  of cops shooting black guys and not shooting white guys.
*  If someone just shows you three or four of those in a row
*  and you have a job and a family and you don't have time
*  to be researching shit, how do you know if that's
*  representative of the whole world or not?
*  Even if it isn't representative, isn't it offensive?
*  As a singular event in the history of people
*  where someone gets shot just because of what they look like.
*  We all agree with that.
*  Of course.
*  The problem with that, more than anything,
*  is how it divides us and how we look at each other.
*  We're supposed to look at each other as the same.
*  We're supposed to look at it as just people.
*  And anything that takes us off that line,
*  whether it's male, female, gay, straight, black, white,
*  privileged, non-privileged, we've got to let that go.
*  Everybody has to stop themselves and think about
*  how you're thinking.
*  What is making you respond?
*  What is it about you or your personal history
*  that is making you respond in a very responsive,
*  reactive, sometimes violent manner?
*  It doesn't matter who you are.
*  And we all have abuse, we have situations, we have pain.
*  And this is being triggered every single day
*  by very simple things that we can easily be triggered about
*  because it's accepted.
*  But I have all kinds of issues that you can say something to me
*  and it'll trigger me.
*  I'm sure you have them too.
*  And only after you've been around for a while,
*  now we're half a century, we've seen some shit go down.
*  Do you realize, oh man, we should let these other people,
*  these younger people know that you've got to look at yourself.
*  Why are you being triggered like this?
*  We also have to realize that we're in a biological mosh pit.
*  Big time.
*  Big time.
*  It's a mosh pit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not just in terms of our genes, but it's also our ideas.
*  There's all this battling going on.
*  And this is just how, I remember I watched this documentary
*  on the Congo once.
*  And they realized it was a BBC documentary, it was amazing.
*  And they realized that certain spiders had formed packs.
*  Have you ever seen that?
*  No.
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  Like a fucking deer would run into this spider web
*  and be like, what's this?
*  Yeah.
*  And they would...
*  We can learn so much from looking at our environment around us.
*  They figured out how to work together.
*  How to work together, yeah.
*  Work in packs.
*  And I remember thinking that, I'm like, this is all madness.
*  It's all a battle for the top of the heap.
*  I think it's important to restate that we're all in our individual webs,
*  we're in the Instagram web and the Twitter web.
*  There are other places where we spiders can come together
*  with groups of other spiders and create our own web that grows.
*  And it sure, it may be parlor, maybe parlor is bullshit,
*  maybe mastodon is bullshit, but collectively it all means...
*  That's cool.
*  This is a minor version of it.
*  Holy crap.
*  There's a BBC Congo one where it's like a real musty looking,
*  cobwebby looking web and they all work together
*  and they jack birds and shit.
*  Oh yeah, totally.
*  Oh my God.
*  So we can do that too.
*  And what is the internet?
*  It is a web.
*  It is a web of servers and computers and phones and watches
*  and we can control a lot of it ourselves.
*  We can.
*  But this is my thought, Adam Curry.
*  When I look at something like that, I'm like, that's just what goes down.
*  If you let it, if you let groups overcome, we can get together.
*  Well, I see that differently.
*  Oh no, I see us as humanity being able to build a web collectively
*  and in that we catch all the fuckers that we're done with who have kept us apart.
*  We can...
*  Spiders don't give a fuck who they catch.
*  They catch birds, bro.
*  Tweety birds.
*  Well, maybe that isn't that socialism?
*  They all catch one bird and they eat it.
*  I don't think so.
*  I think they just, I think they eat each other eventually.
*  Like female black widows.
*  Anyway.
*  They kill the male.
*  There's many ways to connect and organize through the internet.
*  It doesn't, it doesn't have to be stupid things that are apps and bullshit.
*  It just doesn't have to be that way.
*  Eventually someone's going to realize it and it'll become cool.
*  It'll become the internet of the internet.
*  And then people will want to go there.
*  That's how it works.
*  For sure.
*  All I'm thinking is that there's a...
*  I need a little bit more there, Joe.
*  There's a...
*  That is some good stuff.
*  It is, right?
*  There's a way that we can look at all this in terms of like minimizing conflict as a priority.
*  And I don't think it's necessarily a priority.
*  We ain't got conflict, but...
*  Minimizing conflict as a priority.
*  We don't have to hurt each other.
*  We don't have to...
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  And there's something that we have to make an acknowledgement that we're all the same,
*  that we're on the same team and I don't think people feel like we are right now.
*  I think this is how the right feels when you ban people, even if they say ridiculous shit.
*  If it's ridiculous to you, and I get it, you feel it's ridiculous?
*  Good.
*  Why do you want to protect other people from something that you immediately recognize as ridiculous?
*  And that's the moment when you need to ask, why am I responding to this?
*  Why do I need...
*  Why do I feel the need to say this and that's because of deep trigger?
*  But it's also the deep concern that the people that are doing this are going to affect people
*  and change their perspective and make people believe something that's not true
*  and it'll change the course of history or whatever.
*  Okay, well that's just fucking ridiculous.
*  You got to stop that shit.
*  It's not necessarily wrong though, right?
*  No.
*  It did work with Hitler.
*  No.
*  But the real answer is not stop that person.
*  No, of course not.
*  The real answer is come up with a much better rebuttal.
*  Yes.
*  A better rebuttal, you lazy fox.
*  Exactly.
*  Convince me with whatever you got.
*  You can't ban people.
*  And there's a lot of that going on, but when we let ourselves be tied to some fucking
*  digital overlords, we'll always be disappointed.
*  Which brings us back to things that were deleted from Facebook and YouTube.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  When it comes to this pandemic.
*  Whether or not they're right or wrong.
*  You don't need to go through that.
*  There's many different systems out there.
*  You shouldn't be able to do that so easily.
*  It should be somehow or another voted upon.
*  Like if someone...
*  Well, how about... who cares?
*  How about just we have a place that we go that everyone just kind of pays for their
*  little bit, their little group and this exists.
*  It's been around for 15 years.
*  People will come.
*  They're going to get tired of this shit.
*  All the opposition voices are gone.
*  What are you going to do?
*  Blase TG tomorrow.
*  Adam Curry comes out as communist.
*  Fuck you.
*  No.
*  I'm right.
*  I'm right about this.
*  I can see the writing on the wall.
*  You have a very strong opinion about something where you might be correct.
*  I'm just jumping ahead.
*  I'm just...
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You might be correct.
*  I might be wrong.
*  I might be full of shit.
*  You have a good point though.
*  I'm jumping ahead.
*  I can see where it has to go.
*  Jack Dorsey's even talking about decentralizing and perhaps federating different social networks.
*  He understands.
*  People need to cut that dude some slack too.
*  Jack Dorsey is like...
*  We were so tribal.
*  God damn it.
*  He is very conflicted because he has to deal with his income, his shareholders, his board members.
*  He can't have conflict beyond certain realms which are determined by
*  a certain group of ideas that just run certain shit.
*  He was one of them.
*  It's all advertising.
*  We're fucking a-holes.
*  You just pay a little bit of...
*  I'd pay for your show.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I'm scaring me.
*  I'm going to pay for your show because I like your show.
*  It's worth it to me.
*  The only thing is if you had asked me how much, I would have paid you much more than
*  it's actually going to cost me at Spotify.
*  But that's up to you, my brother.
*  I love you.
*  I love you.
*  When I see someone like whether it's Jack Dorsey or even Zuckerberg, anybody who's
*  put into a position that no human being has been responsible for.
*  It's impossible.
*  They've never been responsible for media empires that connect uncounted people.
*  And shame on us for expecting anything interesting or innovative out of that whole group,
*  including the Congress.
*  Shame on us.
*  We created this shit.
*  We knew what's going on.
*  We dictate what's going on.
*  But no.
*  We're just following along.
*  Oh, whatever.
*  Fuck it.
*  We have so much power.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  How many people are on Facebook?
*  I'm not on Facebook anymore.
*  A couple billion.
*  A billion?
*  A billion?
*  A couple billion.
*  Jesus, Jamie.
*  Who knows?
*  A billion with a B.
*  Okay, seems normal.
*  That's what they say.
*  Well, give that dude who looks like an alien all the money then.
*  Seriously.
*  No, it's really...
*  Yeah, it's actually double that.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a lot of cash, kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Respect.
*  It's an incredible amount of money.
*  Monthly active users.
*  But Joe, just...
*  2.6 billion a month.
*  1.73 a day.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  But if you just zoom out...
*  Oh my God.
*  Put that back up.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's insane.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  That's close to, what, a third of the humans?
*  So, you know, Facebook...
*  Those are not real people though, but yes.
*  Take away Nordic folk.
*  Facebook has created a beautiful, beautiful advertising machine.
*  And I give a thousand percent credit to Zuckerberg, his vision, and whoever else has worked with him.
*  It is such a beautiful mechanism for micro-targeting.
*  He has delivered on a lot of the promise that we were all looking at.
*  Like, you'll be able to get there.
*  And I've been complicit in that.
*  The right ad to the right person, just the right moment, just when he's scratching his nuts,
*  wants to buy the car, we'll know it all, we're gonna give it to you.
*  And he has delivered largely on that promise.
*  Unfortunately, with age and wisdom, I've come to realize that was a very bad thing to want.
*  It's a very fucking bad thing to want.
*  Is the real concern that that gets connected to AI?
*  Of course.
*  And then AI...
*  It's already happening.
*  And AI is being skewed in so many interesting ways.
*  For a while, if you typed in American inventor, you would get all black inventors.
*  Black colored skin.
*  I don't know if they were all Eidos or not.
*  So that's an overcompensation of the algorithm for some reason.
*  So these things are happening.
*  It's the thing that I believe all people like you, all people are good.
*  They want to do good.
*  They're convinced that they have to do this.
*  Like you have to say, I'm a racist to be good.
*  Please think about what you're doing.
*  Could you imagine if hell is reaching some connection between virtual reality
*  and artificial intelligence where they trick you?
*  They trick you into living in a world with no pain.
*  I can completely envision that.
*  They trick you into living in a world with no conflict, no advancement, no improvement.
*  Well, we are right now for all of eternity, but that's actually hell.
*  Are you there?
*  A slow trickle.
*  Are you there, Joe?
*  Right now?
*  No.
*  I'm feeling great.
*  But are you going to go there?
*  No.
*  Dude, we can do better.
*  But the idea that it's a slow trickle where there's no risk ever.
*  I think you have to take risks.
*  I think it's a big factor in being a human.
*  Yes.
*  I think you have to do it.
*  This is why many, many very successful people, whether business or academics,
*  certainly royalty, they all develop a super specialty.
*  They can do some study algebra.
*  Others will study economics and they become very successful
*  because they need that challenge as all human beings.
*  We need a real challenge in our life.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I think.
*  To be our full self.
*  I think we do too.
*  I think we need a challenge.
*  Also, all other aspects of our life in terms of what we believe in.
*  I think the problem is that if you believe one thing and I believe an opposing thing,
*  we have to be violently opposed to each other.
*  I think the problem is that people become too married to their ideas.
*  And if we could just avoid that, if we could just talk to people.
*  Look at this example.
*  You and I are not on the same page on a lot of things.
*  What are we not on the same page of?
*  No, I think I'm much more.
*  We joke around conspiracy theory, whatever, but I'm pretty serious about a lot of things I said.
*  But you respect me for what I'm saying.
*  Even if you haven't figured it out or don't like it or whatever, it doesn't matter.
*  You're like, okay, you heard it, you registered it.
*  100% don't disagree with you.
*  No, but you know what I'm saying?
*  All my thoughts on conspiracies are from ignorance.
*  When you say something like, I'm just as ignorant.
*  I'm just as ignorant.
*  That's the beauty of it.
*  But I'm not married to it.
*  But in the past, when I was younger, I would have been.
*  I would have been married to some dumb idea.
*  So just as you can get really married to a dumb idea,
*  you can get married to fuck your dumb ideas.
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
*  For sure.
*  Let's stop calling it something and labeling someone a conspiracy theorist.
*  You're lighting things on fire and throwing them into
*  a little lobby of an apartment complex filled with people.
*  That's this is a terrible, unaffected message.
*  It's not how we want people to behave.
*  Well, when it's not punished, it's a very bad message.
*  Well, it's also a terrible call for escalation because if you kill people with fire,
*  they're going to come back with guns and kill you.
*  Are we trying to start a war?
*  This is bananas.
*  And if you feel like you haven't been represented,
*  there's other ways to get the message out.
*  As frustrating as it may seem, you shouldn't light buildings on fire.
*  The black bloc and Antifa is completely separate from Black Lives Matter protests.
*  And I don't agree with pulling down statues without debate or discussion.
*  But the black bloc, which is really whenever you see the helmet,
*  the backpack, the black outfit, that's probably not your average run of the mill protester.
*  Are we in an Avengers movie?
*  Possibly in a way.
*  To think that it's not possible is ridiculous.
*  I think it's kind of now being admitted everywhere.
*  Even Joe Biden is now, because it's bad for him in the polling,
*  is coming out and saying, okay, these are agitators.
*  Fuck yeah, they are.
*  And this is being downplayed, not being shown to you because you need that.
*  And by the way, when you have in race riots, you have different levels.
*  So you have the protesters.
*  Protesters, fine.
*  Then you get the agitators, and the agitators start to break shit.
*  Then you get the guys with the umbrellas, and they start to break windows,
*  showing you where the third wave, which is truly the poor, poorest of society,
*  they come in to go grab stuff.
*  And why do they grab stuff?
*  Because they've seen everybody is grabbing something for themselves.
*  They've seen it all.
*  The politicians, they're not stupid.
*  They've seen the politicians.
*  They've seen Hollywood.
*  Everybody steals, steals, steals.
*  The agitators, the people with the hammers and the umbrellas, they say,
*  there you go.
*  These people go in, they get what they feel is theirs.
*  That's part of their American dream at this point.
*  So we have to recognize what's happening and then take it away from just black or white racial issues.
*  This is people fucking with us,
*  fucking with us because of our history,
*  and it's triggering a lot of deep emotional shit.
*  And it's really evil to exploit that.
*  And I think we need to go to therapy.
*  We need to go to therapy as a country.
*  Do you think this is like a plan to fuck with us?
*  I believe so, yeah.
*  By who?
*  Well, it could be China.
*  It could be just globalists.
*  It could be Russia.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  We do the same to other countries.
*  We're exporting to how many times we said,
*  we're bringing democracy to your Middle East.
*  Come on, man.
*  Come on, man.
*  I did a Joe Biden.
*  Look, here's the deal.
*  Come on, man.
*  You lying two-faced pony soldier.
*  That's a great phrase, though.
*  What? Come on, man.
*  Two-faced pony soldier.
*  I've never heard it before.
*  He's a savage.
*  You got that?
*  I'll fucking pop the stitch when he says that.
*  No, he is not a savage.
*  That guy is a problem.
*  It's really interesting.
*  It's like if the world was a simulation,
*  this would be a fantastic moment where you had to decide
*  like how preposterous are you going to let it get?
*  We're sitting around there.
*  We got the game under control.
*  Hey, Joe, Joe, Joe, I got it.
*  We'll do this dude against this dude.
*  Imagine if you were in charge of a sleep simulation,
*  like a dream simulation, and you were on the outside.
*  You, Adam Curry, fucking kitchen gloves, the whole deal,
*  working all the cords.
*  And you had to like, OK, we got to bring this guy out.
*  Let's do this.
*  Let's just see what happens.
*  Let's let things get more and more preposterous
*  to the point where he's willing to come out of this programming
*  and be awake again.
*  But you've been in a simulation this entire time.
*  Yeah.
*  And who says that you and I right now,
*  this conversation is not a part of the manipulation
*  of that exact simulation?
*  That's what my concern is because I know personally.
*  That's the best part.
*  If I wasn't me, I would assume that someone's telling me what to do.
*  But I'm telling you, no one's telling me what to do.
*  That's the weirdest part about it.
*  You have synchronicity and it happens.
*  It falls into place for you, right?
*  Maybe.
*  I mean, they're telling you what you can't do.
*  You can't commit crimes.
*  Your life in general, every move seems to kind of fall into place for you.
*  A lot of them do.
*  Even bad things.
*  If you think if a bad thing happens, generally it's because I did something stupid.
*  Like I thought wrong or I said the wrong thing
*  or I moved in the wrong direction.
*  Then I had to recognize why I moved.
*  All those things are good.
*  If you have a bad set, like a bad set in stand up,
*  or it's the best example of bad moments.
*  I can only imagine how horrifying that must be.
*  Sometimes you come out with a new joke.
*  It just doesn't work.
*  I'm going to just open with this.
*  Maybe you have one too many Jack Daniels in the back and you get a little frisky.
*  Didn't quite handle it right.
*  You feel like you're just going to get on stage and take over Adam Curry.
*  But the joke does not come out exactly how you wanted it to because it's fresh.
*  Like a stand up joke is sort of like a thing that you have an intention and then there's a result.
*  Oftentimes they misconstrue the result with your intention.
*  Like if you bomb, you're like this motherfucker, why did it hurt my feelings?
*  You want to make me feel bad?
*  This terrible comedy.
*  The exact opposite of what the intention is.
*  It's just he just missed.
*  It's the literal artistic equivalent to crashing on a surfboard.
*  Isn't that where the edge is?
*  Is on something that should be offensive but somehow you laugh about it?
*  Well, sort of, yeah.
*  But it's also what your ideas are and stand up a representative of what you actually feel as a person.
*  Can you make a controversial idea palatable?
*  That seems to be what it is.
*  So what you're doing, if we just take it back to the simulation,
*  you're debugging your own program.
*  That is the definition of AI.
*  That you are artificial intelligence.
*  To me, this is the big joke.
*  We are the artificial intelligence and these guys are just like pretending that they got something.
*  That's a way to look at it.
*  Here's my way to look at it.
*  I don't think we've been talking that long.
*  No, not at all.
*  I think we've been talking about 40,000 years, man.
*  If that, yeah.
*  I don't think it's been that long.
*  I don't think we're that good.
*  My mom, my mom.
*  My mom died 15 years ago.
*  My mom used to tell me, I said, you know how they came up with the name brush for hairbrush?
*  I said, no.
*  She goes, was it dude?
*  Yeah, this fucking thing with the, and he went like this, bruh.
*  Really?
*  No, of course that's what she really said, but obviously it's bullshit.
*  But it was just like, yeah, man, that really made me realize that we really haven't been there that long.
*  You know, some fucking caveman just came up with the brush.
*  Well, the human being.
*  Only took a little bit.
*  This form of human has only been around for what?
*  Just a little bit.
*  Half a million years?
*  Yeah, whatever it is.
*  At the max, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't it?
*  What's the threshold, Jamie?
*  It's like an estimate.
*  I think it's between 250 and 500,000 years ago, homo sapiens emerged.
*  Somewhere.
*  Sure.
*  That's nothing.
*  No, it isn't.
*  That's so little.
*  That's so little.
*  I don't know if you remember, but you were saying something with Duncan that was,
*  you were talking about us actually being the spaceship and that we are hurtling through the
*  universe at this amazing speed and all the, and everything's whipping by.
*  And I love that because you really, when you zoom out of reality and it's all given,
*  yeah, we're on the earth, it's round or whatever, fuck it's flat, doesn't matter.
*  It's still a thing in space with this round or flat.
*  It's in space.
*  We're flying, we're moving, we're doing stuff.
*  That realization or just thinking about that in general, just people just talking about,
*  wow, man, we're in space.
*  Look at the sky.
*  Look at the stars.
*  What does it mean?
*  It's a coward's perspective.
*  Just look at the treetops.
*  Yeah.
*  It really is.
*  Yeah.
*  There's something about it.
*  Which is why marijuana is something I support.
*  So important.
*  That's what I'm talking about, Doc.
*  I support that shit.
*  Come on, Governor.
*  Definitely.
*  Get on board.
*  Abbott will get there.
*  Abbott, I love you.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we'll see.
*  We'll see.
*  We'll see.
*  Don't get too easy with your vote there, Joe Rogan.
*  Listen, I'm getting easy.
*  Your endorsement's going to mean a lot in the Drone Star state.
*  I'm letting people know that I'm your friend and I'm wearing my wife's shirt.
*  That's right.
*  You are appropriate.
*  Listen, it's not bad.
*  Make some money off this shit.
*  Stop.
*  Stop playing games.
*  It's not killing anybody.
*  Listen, if Texas is a place we can own a fucking tiger.
*  I had a bit in my act.
*  That is pretty crazy.
*  This is a fact.
*  This is a 100% fact.
*  There's more tigers in captivity in Texas than all of the wild of the world.
*  There's more tigers in dudes' backyards.
*  I know.
*  But you can't have weed.
*  Really?
*  Are we really being responsible here?
*  You'll learn that there's codes in Texas.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's easier to own a tiger than a dog that's been labeled as dangerous.
*  We'll...
*  It's estimated there could be from 2,000 to 5,000 tigers living in...
*  That's so many.
*  5,000 tigers is unheard.
*  Imagine if you saw 5,000 tigers coming over the hill.
*  You're like, there's going to be nothing left of me in seconds.
*  My buddy Gene has huge snakes in his apartment.
*  What?
*  Yeah, he has...
*  Does he have a baby?
*  No, it's just him.
*  One is 16 feet long.
*  Have you heard those stories?
*  Tigrit, I think.
*  Tigrit?
*  Oh yeah, they have names.
*  Did you just say 16?
*  16.
*  I think it's like 15 or 16.
*  It's incredible.
*  And it's really very interesting to see.
*  They have an interesting life, these snakes.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what that is for me?
*  That's like holding two 80-pound dumbbells and trying to keep your face above water.
*  How long can you do this before those things eat you?
*  No.
*  You got a 16-foot snake in your house, son.
*  No, no.
*  I think he's a boa constrictor, so he only...
*  But he goes into the bathtub when he feels it's time for a bath.
*  He's sleeping.
*  They sleep most of the time.
*  Yeah, it's a trip though.
*  Because you know, I go there like, no, all right, let me say hi to the snakes.
*  Because it's like his family.
*  I was watching a video today of a guy who was fishing in Australia.
*  I don't know if it's a guy or a girl, but they caught a big fish.
*  And it is like the dangers of fishing in Australia.
*  And as this guy is reeling this fish in, a crocodile comes swimming out of the water
*  and steals his fish and they're running away from this crocodile.
*  No.
*  Dude, crocodiles are so scary.
*  They have them here.
*  They have them here too.
*  We have...
*  Alligators.
*  Alligators.
*  You have an alligator.
*  Different animal.
*  Yeah.
*  We allow those in America.
*  Listen, if we had crocodiles in America the way they have them in Australia,
*  we would kill them all.
*  Really?
*  Fuck yeah!
*  Have you ever been to Australia?
*  No, I haven't.
*  Yeah, I have.
*  For stand-up.
*  But I've never seen those crocs.
*  In 1990, I went.
*  I did a documentary and went into the outback and just learned so much.
*  And I don't even recognize Australia anymore.
*  So this dude caught a fish and the crocodile comes and jacks it.
*  Holy shit.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You gotta run, son.
*  Give up the fish.
*  So I bet they probably wait.
*  Done.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh!
*  There's your fish, bitch.
*  That's a huge fish.
*  That crocodile just swallows it down.
*  Crocodiles are so spooky, man.
*  They're so big.
*  Look at that thing.
*  It's a monster that lives in the jungle.
*  We gotta shout out to everybody down under.
*  Everybody in Victoria, in Melbourne, who are being locked down like fucking rats.
*  They're locked down again.
*  Shout out.
*  Shout out to Adam Green Tree.
*  They're getting screwed.
*  They're playing the same damn script down there only six months later.
*  It's crazy.
*  Well, they're trying to probably protect people and keep their hospital beds.
*  Yeah, that's all.
*  We flattened the curve.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're probably trying to do a lot of those things.
*  But it just seems like no one's doing it right.
*  It seems like there's no country that prepared properly.
*  It's almost like who the fuck saw this coming?
*  No one did.
*  And there was a pandemic department that we had here that was shut down by Trump.
*  When?
*  Well, yes, but that was transferred into a...
*  Transferred?
*  Into a...
*  Yes.
*  So not necessarily shut down.
*  Not shut down.
*  It became a biological weapons group.
*  Jesus!
*  Yes.
*  Has the same function as a flu.
*  So that is a little different than the story.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Explain that.
*  So the pandemic response group that was within, I believe, the National Security Council.
*  This was the one that Trump was accused of dismantling?
*  No, he did dismantle it.
*  He dismantled it and took...
*  It was only two people or three people and took the resource.
*  Yeah.
*  It's in the National Security Council.
*  So it's a real responsibility, but they transferred that into a biological weapons
*  program to be on the lookout for that, which has the same characteristics as what happened.
*  Either way, doesn't seem like it worked very well, other than the president shutting down
*  some travel or most travel from China and Europe and the UK against everyone else's wishes.
*  That part, I think he did well, but I don't know how well this biological warfare outfit worked,
*  because if anything, the tests were either sabotaged or sucked or the CDC is inefficient,
*  ineffective.
*  I don't know, but we got that too late.
*  And what we got, the PCR test that spin up the DNA samples 37 to 40 times instead of 30,
*  is producing results that could be a lot of 30, 35% false positive.
*  So when you don't have any data to work with, you're fucked.
*  You're fucked.
*  We have nothing.
*  You don't have the data.
*  35% false positive?
*  30% false positive.
*  This is in the New York Times just last week.
*  And so just to make sure that even though the New York Times is full of shit,
*  I think when they publish something good, it should be noted.
*  But isn't also that one of those things where they don't know how effective it's going to be?
*  They have to implement something.
*  They find out how it's effective by looking at all the data that they get back.
*  What's effective?
*  Any kind of tests.
*  This is known testing policy.
*  Normally you spin it up 30% for a PCR test.
*  But when COVID-19 emerged, when was the first test?
*  Well, the first ones were bogus and some of the CDC tests actually contained some of the virus.
*  It was fucking crazy.
*  It was a huge botch.
*  Tests contained the virus?
*  Yeah, it was a huge botch.
*  Not all of them, but it got fucked up.
*  And that's when Trump said, President Trump said,
*  okay, we're now doing the Abbott system.
*  You got all the commercial labs and you got all that going because they were just failing.
*  They were just failing.
*  But what then happened, I'm not so sure that that's honest because there's a lot of incentive
*  in the pharmaceutical and medical system to skew things a certain way to make sure you get paid.
*  You can't deny that's taken place historically.
*  So there's some of it happening.
*  And the main way to make sure we had a lot of positives,
*  instead of 30 times amplification of the fragments of the virus that you're looking for,
*  they did it 37 to 40 times and that gives you a lot more.
*  It's known science.
*  It's just not told.
*  Well, one of the big complaints recently wasn't that the tests are too accurate.
*  Too accurate?
*  In a sense that they're labeling people as positive that are no longer contagious.
*  They're too sensitive rather than accurate.
*  Yes, that's exactly what it is.
*  So people are getting a false positive saying-
*  They're not contagious.
*  Nothing at all.
*  So in order to test positive, if you're going to get symptoms,
*  you have to have a certain amount of viral load.
*  So you have to have more than just a little bit.
*  If you had it, just talking here, I might not get it, but if we're making out,
*  slowly swapping spit and having a good time with each other, I might get enough-
*  What kind of music would we be doing?
*  Total 70s porn music.
*  I thought about David Bowie.
*  We'd have Jamie make it all red.
*  Old school David Bowie.
*  All right, I'll do it.
*  Whatever, whatever turns you on.
*  There's a star man waiting over you.
*  My child will be horrified when she sees this.
*  She'll be like, Dad, seriously, you need to back off on that shit.
*  It's a great goddamn song though.
*  So yeah, we don't have any real data anymore.
*  I think-
*  Well, I think here's the thing.
*  We want someone to be in charge when everyone is trying to figure it out in real time.
*  But the nature of our entire system is not someone's in charge.
*  The president can't say shut it down.
*  He just can't say that.
*  That has to come from the governor.
*  And then here in Austin, we have different rules that the governor has allowed,
*  but you don't have to have them, so they're not mandated.
*  So that system goes back up the line.
*  And in Austin, this is what I don't like.
*  We were told again, mass, social distance, close the bars, etc.
*  Once we're into the next phase, which is instead of 40 hospitalizations per day,
*  an average of 22, then we go to the next phase and then we're allowed to open up some more.
*  But there was like, nah, we're going to wait until September 8th because schools are opening.
*  We don't want to jeopardize that.
*  When you do that to Americans, that is fucked.
*  And they're misjudging how Americans take that shit.
*  You give us a goal, Joe, we'll go like, we all will go.
*  Any color creed background, fuck yeah, we're going to do this.
*  We're going to get this fucking goal.
*  Flatten the goddamn curve.
*  We're going, bitch.
*  This is what we do.
*  Right?
*  Semper Fi, we go.
*  We all go.
*  Where we go, when we go all.
*  Right.
*  We go all.
*  And then when they say, okay, great job, but now we're going to take another couple of weeks.
*  We have to meet his right next goal.
*  That's not, we go, what the fuck?
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's what's happening.
*  And this is the danger because it could just be ugly.
*  It could just be ugly.
*  But something will have to happen.
*  The real danger is not letting the actual interaction take place.
*  The real danger is in silencing opposing opinions.
*  Of course.
*  I feel like when you're doing that, if you have a platform, whether it's like Facebook
*  or YouTube or Twitter or anything, if you have a platform and in that platform,
*  some people believe X, why others believe Y.
*  If you just decide to shut down everyone that believes Y, you create a tyranny.
*  You have a tyranny of ideology.
*  Like you have to believe, especially if it's connected to the economy,
*  like it is in Hollywood.
*  This is one of the things that I experienced.
*  I didn't experience it personally.
*  I wasn't a victim of it by any stretch, but I had friends that were,
*  they would have this perspective that they knew they had to have if they went into meetings.
*  They were trapped.
*  Otherwise they would, could I have a little more?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Otherwise they wouldn't have to get the gigs.
*  Man, I don't even think it was the fault of the people that were enforcing it.
*  Of course not.
*  I think it's just a natural scenario where human beings, one more time.
*  Salud, brother.
*  All right, Salud, brother.
*  To the real pod father, the real one.
*  To the real Joe Rogan experience, Jamie.
*  Jamie's asleep.
*  Big fucking part of this thing.
*  He's been here all day.
*  I love that Jamie is like, he's like a hot property now in Austin.
*  Hot property.
*  Jamie is like, he's like, what?
*  This motherfucker's here alone.
*  Yeah.
*  Is he single?
*  Single?
*  Dangerous bitches headed your way, son.
*  My goodness, this guy, how old is he?
*  He's young, right?
*  He's 12.
*  Look at him.
*  25, 25, whatever the fuck it is.
*  Yeah, man, he's been getting DNA shots every day I've known him.
*  He is living life.
*  Once the NASA people got into, see, once I had to reverse my stance on the moon landing
*  and then the CIA people took over, Jamie started getting shots.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's been on UFOs.
*  He's like the nerdy type.
*  Jamie's already got a neurolink.
*  Ask him.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah, he got it.
*  Fuck those pigs.
*  That was kind of weird, man, with the pig demo.
*  I'm like, Elon, man.
*  I like it because he always does the anti-demo.
*  I didn't even watch that.
*  I'm like, come to me when you're working with monkeys.
*  I could not.
*  And Tina's like, what the fuck?
*  Are you actually watching?
*  I see Elon Musk with pigs.
*  What's going on?
*  When you can turn a raccoon into that Guardians of the Galaxy character, come to me then.
*  I love the idea.
*  I would love to try the interface instead of the keyboard, just be able to think it
*  and make it go.
*  I love to get the analysis power of the computer, but I would like to be able to turn
*  it off.
*  I have two concerns.
*  I would like one.
*  I don't want to be an early adopter, but two, if you're not an early adopter, what if those
*  motherfuckers just take off and control everything?
*  No, no, no.
*  Dude, Elon, we're talking about it.
*  It's not that simple.
*  It takes more than just the first generation of early adopters, but I would say get in
*  early.
*  Get in early is what I'd say.
*  He was saying it might have a massive increase in their productivity.
*  Of course.
*  But that would be a huge advantage.
*  Do you know what's really fascinating, and this does play into this, most companies who
*  have had people working from home have now cut 40% of their real estate portfolio.
*  This is going to continue forever.
*  The remaining 60% of their real estate portfolio offices, they've increased.
*  No more cubicles.
*  It's executive offices, meeting rooms, conference rooms.
*  Everyone else is going to be working from home.
*  The productivity almost across the board, from what I understand from my friends who
*  are in IT integration, is up significantly because people now know that they're at home.
*  If you were working on the road, if someone heard a bird tweeting in the background, you'd
*  be busted.
*  Like, you fucker, you're not in the office, but now it's accepted.
*  People are working from anywhere and everywhere, and companies are fucking loving this.
*  Do people call people out on bird sounds in the background?
*  Back in the day?
*  Oh yeah, if you go to a conference call.
*  Who the fuck?
*  Put it on mute, bitch!
*  You're walking through the city.
*  You're in Macy's, I hear you.
*  Oh yeah, all that shit.
*  I had that too.
*  Remote work, it seems like it makes more sense.
*  It's done, it's done, it's done.
*  So live where you work, work where you live.
*  But what happens to the cultures that are created by big businesses all working together?
*  The whole world is changing, Joe Rogan.
*  I know, but is that-
*  This is what's taking place, man.
*  This is why you keep that in view for us.
*  You keep bringing all the crazy fuckers.
*  Put that shit on me.
*  You have a huge responsibility.
*  Don't you put that evil on me!
*  You're in Texas now.
*  This is where legends are born, Joe Rogan.
*  But don't, I mean, don't you think all, a lot of what we're talking about here,
*  whether it's a conspiracy or just the way things happen when systems conflict with each other
*  and one gains control and the opposing forces move in and take more control.
*  So it's always been that case.
*  In 2006, I was living in London and I got an invitation from the Queen of England.
*  Damn, son.
*  And she was relaunching the Royal website and I was invited to come and be a part of that.
*  And they picked me up in a car in a Mercedes, interestingly enough.
*  I was hoping to be a carriage.
*  Should have been a Rolls.
*  But you know the front gate at Buckingham Palace took me right through the fucking front gate.
*  It opened up.
*  I went in there, was in this waiting room with about a hundred other people.
*  And there was, you know, art I'd never seen.
*  Rembrandt's, Van Gogh's, I've never seen those before.
*  And then the whole ceremony and then you shake your hand, you know, you go down the line.
*  It's Mr. Adam Carrey.
*  And I looked straight in the eye.
*  Everyone's bowing.
*  I'm like, let me look in there.
*  What do I see?
*  And I saw nothing, man.
*  Lizards.
*  Yeah, lizard.
*  But the fact is that if we still are willing to believe that we need this tradition of this old
*  lady with funny hats living in some prime fucking ass real estate in the middle of London,
*  we got a lot of thinking to do.
*  Well, we don't.
*  We got a lot of fucking thinking to do.
*  We're American, goddamn it.
*  We're here in Texas.
*  I don't know what you're talking about with England.
*  That's right.
*  This is the People's Republic of Texas and it stands on its own.
*  Those folks over there with the kings and the queens, they can go fuck themselves.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
*  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
*  you have to like these people and they have ultimate control. Here's one of the more ridiculous ones. Whether you're bipartisan, whether you're whether you're a staunch Republican staunch Democrat, please hold on for a second. Why is it okay that if you get elected president, you can pardon people like is the law the law or is it not the law that you have a **** get out of jail free pass? Yeah, you have a get out of jail free pass. Yeah, that's one of those that's one of the millions of dollars.
*  Yeah, we did all kinds of crazy **** Yeah, you can just swoop in. That's one of those. That's one of those. There's a couple things you can do as a president including appointing Supreme Court justices. This is kind of at the core of of solidifying that that executive branch. They needed some power. That's weird. So, Congress, House of Representatives, they get the purse. They get the money. Yeah. Senate gets to be just cigar smoking douche bags who like **** around all the time like whatever but they they have you know, they make it happen. These are the the back room cigar smoking
*  deals and then we have the executive branch who needs it. You know, they need to have some power and so their power because of course, the Supreme Court for us is like oh, the Supreme Court said it man. That's the end of the **** line which technically is not. That's why we let the president appoint the Supreme Court and and federal judges. Isn't that weird though? The the president has a four year term. Yeah, but they can they can appoint someone who's there for life. Well, they're all they're all appointed for life only if someone dies or leaves. So, it's not every
*  president gets this president Trump got some major **** break here and you know, he got two, maybe a third. Pretty tight. Maybe a fourth depending, you know, and I wish no ill on anyone but RBG, you know, she's on the ropes. It seems she seems to be bulletproof. I don't know and I like her. She's she is I don't agree with a lot of her decisions but she is an American success story. If you if you know her story about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that's a very very powerful woman who really
*  is impressive. I gotta pee again. **** you Joe Rogan. Let me pause and then you tell me the Ruth Bader Ginsburg story. Are we the is this the first time you, Joe Rogan has had two pit stops on the show? Yeah, I think so. That's
*  probably the first time, right? Two or three hours. I'm out of shape. I took a whole week off. I had to move and set up the spot. My bladder shrunk back down to normal size. My my bladder was very impressive at one point in time. I can go like four or
*  five hours even. No pee in. Just strong. Stay strong but eventually it's shrunk back down. So how can we support you moving here to Austin? I'm already here, ****. What are you talking about? I don't know. I wanna help you out. What can we do for you? What do you need, man? What can we make easier for your life? You've already done everything. My goal as a person and this is this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately because I have I had a hard time coming to grips with this idea that people are listening to what I think. I'm not
*  an expert in anything but I've come to the conclusion through all the trials and errors and pros and cons of my life that if we just go into things with the intention of working things out and not of fighting, not of conflict, it's possible that all the excess energy that we have that's dedicated to these unnecessary conflicts that maybe we can come to a comfortable agreement for both
*  parties. We're **** that up because of this ancient DNA that we have that leads us to always wanna go to war with opposing tribes. I feel it in myself. I felt it in myself when I was younger. I've fought against it. I've analyzed it. I've been confused by it and humiliated by it. It's a part of being a person and it's a very strong motivation and I've mocked it in many times even in pro and con jest.
*  I understand what it is. I get it. There's a thing that we all have. We wanna be loved and accepted by a group of our peers and our community but that that that leading to doing that out of fear, it leads to a lack of critical thinking which leads to ideologies which is why we have cults.
*  It's true. It's true. No, it's really true. In the in the late it was probably 8081. I was quite young but I wound up in Los Angeles and I was trying to have some meetings trying to figure out if I could be somewhere in Hollywood or something. It was like a total lark and I had one or two phone numbers from I think the backup singer or maybe you remember there was Janet Jackson. What have you done for me lately? Yeah, I remember that. There was an answer record to that. It was a
*  answer record. Here's what I've done for you lately. It was kinda one of those deals. I don't listen to those cuz those are negative. Well, but back in this time, so I wound up in probably Compton area and it was a it may I don't know what radio station it was but it was probably one of KLX or or the equivalent of New York BLS and there were these guys doing rap battles and they were and so it kind of transformed from gangs to rapping. That's how
*  how hip hop really got started. You know, you were battling against him and you had the break dance battles all these different. It was it was pure tribes against each other. Maybe today's version instead of bullshitting each other on some fucking. There it is. Exactly. Oh my god. That's so 80s. That might be one of the most 80s things I've ever seen. I don't wanna say we have. Oh my god. It was amazing. That totally discredited my whole argument.
*  That's that's you really ruin it. Once people see the shoulder pads like Curry's full of **** Shut up, man. That's period. Should not be spoken. Maybe we should all just be doing podcast. Everybody get a **** podcast together. Work it out. Yell at somebody over some kind of Skype connection. That's not the worst idea. It just get started. Get started. Get started. I honestly believe that we should come up with some sort of an agreement for how we communicate. Don't be ****. Yeah. Yes. By example, that's the only way. By example. Just
*  that alone will shift so many things into the proper. Yeah. Proper position. I mean. By example. Yeah. I really I really just be example. Just be an example. That's all it is. And I think we also have to acknowledge that people **** change and grow over time and you know. Do we ever? If we if we want people to get better, we have to assume and we have to acknowledge that whoever they are today is not who they were yesterday and there's a lot of people that are like I see it a lot with either alcoholics or drug addicts.
*  Or people just dismiss them and they go, ah, **** guy. He's just, you know, he had that thing with Oxy's. He's always gonna be that right. No, no, people can absolutely change. Are you sure they can change? Yeah. If they decide they can change and they go on to become amazing people. There's a grip that anything can get on you whether it's opiates or coke or whatever the **** it is but there's there's some things that become you. There are you. They're the you're new. The new Adam Curry system. Interwoven. Interwoven.
*  Interwoven. Built in there. Involves cocaine. Yeah. Yeah. It's well no but yeah. But I mean it involves it involves. If you got hooked on cocaine. Well, it's it's marijuana. That is that is throughout my entire system. My being. It's how I. Let's just say it.
*  A lot of life. We both love it. It's an amazing thing. What the **** Thank god for trailers. Um. I've never done that but if I did. That's all. That's it. That's really all it takes and and people have to at least and this is the big problem. Not be afraid to say what you think and think about how you say it's try and say
*  something nicely but don't be afraid of using something that is politically not right or it could be a or the term problematic is **** by itself. Either it's a problem or it's not a problem. I think we have this undeniable inclination to uh form groups and form groups. That's okay.
*  People that think along our lines and then everybody who opposes those thoughts, we close ourselves off to their perspective and we fight against them. It's just it's a natural thing that people do and it's uh it's one of the reasons why we have so many problems with all kinds of different ideas is that people whether you have this idea when you've made a decision on a controversial issue in your mind. Most of the time what what you're basing your decision is on your own.
*  Your own perspective, your education, how you a wealth. Let's just be the give it the best possible results and saying you're looking at any problem as uh you're gonna look at it objectively. We come up with your own perspective but your perspective is gonna be different than someone who grew up in Miami which is gonna be different than someone who came from another country. Everyone's gonna have their own like. Thank you. This is the core of America by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Just tie into that. My friend Mo. He he was born
*  and grew up in North Carolina lives in Virginia. He's ADOS. We we've never met each other. I've never even seen him. Doesn't matter but one day, I'm gonna go hang out with Mo and I'm gonna eat whatever the **** Mo's family eats. I'm gonna hang out with his children and talk the way about things they're interested in and he's gonna come and he and his wife will come and visit us and he'll see our side and our culture and it's beautiful because you can enjoy it with each other and still be different. We don't have to be forced into this one. It's all the same thing. I don't believe in that. It's definitely not fun.
*  It's not fun. That's not fun. But that it doesn't have to be all the same thing. You know, I mean the idea of like just people. Yeah. Just people doesn't mean it's all the same. No. It means uh. But you have to. We're all just people but there's there's people that live like this and there's people that live over here and there's a different climate there and this place is really cold. I get the idea that's not where some forces want us to go. What is that though? That's just people jockeying for control. Like should we concentrate on them or should we really concentrate on what we
*  actually think about these things? I think what we all think about when I talk to rational people, what do they think about these things? They kind of think what I just said like just people. It's just people. Yeah. It's good, bad, smart, different, interesting, fascinating. Everybody's different. Yeah. People who don't read who say brilliant shit. Yeah. It's people who uh you know can't see and they can play guitar. Yeah. That's it. It's so easy but isn't that all basically coming from a place of fear either not fitting in or not being
*  understood or not understanding and and just being afraid of what that means and I think that's fueled by a lot of things around us which is afraid. It's fear. It's always fear. It's a great mechanism. There's always a lot of fear and I think that that fear uh encourages people to engage in group think and it discourages them from coming up with a contradictory opinion. If there's a narrative that all the really aggressive people whether it's right wing
*  or left wing, there's a narrative that they're espousing. Yeah. There's a gravity to that. You wanna you wanna tell people I'm in man. Yeah we need to do that. Lock them borders down. Oh yeah we need to do that and like eat the rich like whatever it is. One side or the other. There's a draw to that. What we need to learn is not to immediately say you're wrong and I hate you because of it. That's because once we admit that we everything we just talked about, I don't know if I'm fucking
*  right. Just my opinion. What you say is your opinion. I know you're saying. We could be wrong. So you just have to recognize that and I don't what I don't understand and that's part of the mechanism somehow is this and maybe it's triggered by black and white checker boxes. Maybe it's triggered by somewhere over the rainbow. I don't know what's going on but for some reason we're being triggered into hating someone with a different idea and that's fucked. Yeah. That is completely fucked up. Exactly. That's not necessary. Have you have you ever seen um the uh documentary
*  that was on the debates between Gore Vidal and um oh yeah this is a while back. Yeah yeah yeah. 1960s. Yeah. What was it called? God damn it. What the fuck's the British gentleman's name? There it is. I don't remember. Best of enemies. That's what it is. Yes. It's Gore Vidal and who is the uh. That was a very famous. I'm high as fuck right now. I can't remember. That's right. William F Buckley. How about this? There was a really fascinating moment where William F Buckley got upset at him and threatened to
*  punch him and shit. Threatened to hit him. Oh yeah. It's real intense. Yeah. Intense but this it's again it's this if if I think I'm right and I think you're wrong and I wanna prove that I'm right and you're wrong it becomes a it becomes a game of tennis. It becomes wrestling. Yeah. It becomes a contest. And any contest that people engage in. Like there's all sorts of factors that come into play. Like the Mongols didn't conquer like a quarter of the world because
*  their ideology was right. They just they they had the right factors in place that allowed them to do that. Elephants. All kinds of shit. So if someone has if someone has a control of a situation doesn't necessarily mean that they should.
*  William F Buckley son William F Buckley Jr. Who is one of the founders of the conservative America. His son Christopher was married to my cousin Lucy and this is damn dude. Oh yeah. My whole family is all kinds of government shit. Lizard people right. Come on son. No no no. Maybe.
*  Maybe. My uncle Don is is incredible. He was he was very high in the CIA. He became Bush seniors national security adviser. So basically like the Michael Flynn or the condolence arise or they frisk you at Thanksgiving. Well it's very interesting because I've never been cleared. I have no clearance. And so at some family gatherings some of the other cousins of cousins who I don't really know that well.
*  We can't talk about this because you don't have clearance. I'm like sorry. Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah. But that's that's that's really if you look at the no agenda show that's really it's been a truth seeking of my own life because when I was in my teens my parents.
*  They both told me that they had been involved in they were I guess a call civilians in the State Department and that's why we had lived in Uganda when I was very young and I think that's why I probably moved to Europe. And you know there's a lot of people who are my whole family is definitely patriots.
*  They've done a lot of weird things. They've been involved in weird shit. Everything from well my my paternal grandfather was in the lieutenant commander in the Pacific. You know the Japanese theater. My maternal grandfather Albert Shovel. He actually was German but he landed at Normandy. He was in fucking D day.
*  Oh purple heart and all the shit for it. So everybody was kind of involved. We got all kinds of you know very patriotic. I've talked to all of them and I've actually talked. It's funny enough my uncle had much deeper conversations with and he's he's close to 90 now. So he's you know he's kind of done.
*  I mean he's he I hope he stays around for a long fucking time. He and his wife. He was a bastard of South Korea. This is a major dude and I believe he recruited my parents. Both of them are gone so I can talk about it. I can't say exactly what they were were doing but I do know one thing is that and this is why I think once I realized this I have distrust of the media is that I believe my father was in Uganda to report on certain things.
*  I believe he was in Uganda to report on certain events that were taking place. This is before Idi Amin came in. Whoa. So Abotei was still president and I think the the US controlled Abotei. I'm not sure if they controlled Idi Amin but he would write a story about something happening there and it may not have been exactly what the story was but it was a pro-America or pro-America agenda story and because it was in the I know let's call it the fucking Uganda Times. The New York Times and the Washington Post could say according to the Uganda Times
*  this is what's happening. So that story became truth but that story was actually a message from United States intelligence or the president or whatever or the State Department whatever our democracy idea was whatever our fucking agenda was.
*  And so when they told me they was really telling me like you know we're not in this anymore we're not doing any of that and you know we're legit but it opened my eyes to having lived this huge lie not that I knew it but you know why did my dad come home one day and he was able to speak French fluently.
*  Like what the fuck. I remember some of that. You can tell me whatever you want. That's a cool language. Okay bro. No it's not. Well it is actually but so that kind of stuff was was kind of mind blowing and it really reset my thinking and I have a I really don't know much.
*  Both my parents passed my dad passed last year he was 80. He was last several years of his life where you know the thinking was really not there anymore. Just kind of went downhill and we never really had it. He was he was gone a lot.
*  You know I don't blame him because he did what he had to do and I think all my family are very patriotic no matter what they were involved in. I think it came from a good place.
*  And so I've kind of become this this counterweight to all of that in some odd way and but I know that a lot of stuff is bullshit and I know because I feel that my immediate family was involved in some of the creation of that maybe a long time ago but I don't think got any better.
*  Yeah I think everything evolves right and if people are pulling the wool over people's eyes in the 1960s. I think it's only gotten much much much much much worse. Much better at it. Yeah. The internet has been a blessing and a curse at the same time.
*  It's always how it's going to be with everything in life. As long as we realize it as long as we can think have it in the back of your mind. This could be bullshit. Just have that in the back of your mind.
*  It's always a possibility with all these systems if you're looking at it like without any connection to who's right and who's wrong. You just look at it like this little like a battle of like bugs battling it out.
*  Look at it in terms of like what are the qualities of each side and what would consider the source. Yeah consider the source. It's hard for people. But also come out and walk in nature.
*  Connect. Turn off the phone. Leave it at home. Just disconnect. It's important for your immune system. Yeah I really believe that. I think so. Leave that shit at home. Go without it. Make love. I know it sounds nutty but make fucking love.
*  Is that a Bad Company song? Feel like a bacon. Hello we're old bros from the 80s. Yeah of course it is. Fuck yeah. Hell yeah. Any any sex song will do. Any sex song. Any sex song will do man.
*  Yeah man. That's what we need to do. Remember what was the song about the kid? Shooting Star? Everybody thought they were that kid. Shooting Star. When I was in high school. Johnny was a school boy when he heard his first Beatles song. What the fuck is that? I grew up. I was in Holland. I think I missed that one. Who was that? You don't know that song? Who the fuck was that? Isn't that Bad Company? Shooting Star. It's a song about a rock star. I don't remember. Fuck I feel stupid now. It's an amazing rock star who dies young.
*  I had a certain set of stuff in Europe growing up around the same time because I was really there from seven on through teenage years. There it is. So I had a lot of different stuff. Bad Company. Second straight album. That is Bad Company. Okay. Okay.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah. Yeah. I love those guys.
*  People loved or hate Bruce Springsteen.
*  I will love him forever just because.
*  But I don't really see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff anymore.
*  I don't have to.
*  But his songs like are like...
*  Captain Jack is one of my all-time favorite songs.
*  To me it's the river.
*  That's a great song too.
*  How about Brilliant Disguise?
*  Oh, well, that was when I was just starting in television in Europe.
*  And they had that...
*  Is it you baby?
*  Just the...
*  Yeah.
*  the really kind of soft cool videos like when he had fire oh baby I'm on fire
*  hey daddy home you were feeling that shit that's a pedophile so they were
*  bullshit that was rock and roll bitch that was rock and roll they cannot do
*  not associate that with the bars hey little girls your daddy home I went to
*  Moscow with skid Row and all those guys I don't really mean that Bruce no he
*  knows you know just jokes can we still do these we'd have to pretend and we're
*  allowed to do jokes anymore Adam Curry how do you feel about that can you you can still do jokes
*  can't you when's your next special I need a special I can't do comedy right now so how many
*  is gonna take a couple years before you get one together you think with writing and testing it out
*  who knows man who knows when what do you need you really need an audience right yeah to test that
*  shit well not just test it it's like just to perform to do like who knows when we can perform
*  again you know like right now guys are doing some folks are doing outside places for the
*  doing what's this Chappelle camp or something about this is like some like Dave Chappelle took
*  over like what's going on with an outdoor wedding chapel and he set it up as a comedy show socially
*  distance everybody gets tested I saw one one show but there's more going on it does them all
*  the time doesn't come but where are they waking you see on YouTube in Yellow Springs Ohio but
*  can you see them online yet to go you have to be there I love this guy that guy is fantastic so
*  you have to go there it's not it's not recorded nothing bullshit all right this has got to be HBO
*  Netflix he's got it no he's got to be there can we go there can we go there yeah for sure have you
*  been I have not yet have you been invited I've been busy yeah yeah of course you with moving
*  this place this is the night show we've ever done no I'm good I don't want to be sympathy but
*  this is the first night we've ever done in this show in this space so it's been a like a weird
*  transition to just decide we're getting out of LA and then literally two months later can I ask
*  you about that just because I had similar I was gone within six weeks once I had arrived here I
*  mean so you felt it and you know you took your family down here to check it out you guys had
*  been here before you got business here right you've been here before yeah yeah I've been here many
*  times I love the city it just seems like you went you move real quick I was surprised well my kids
*  are in zoom classes it's a real bummer it's a bummer and I think it's not I think it's and I'm
*  not saying this is clearly I'm not saying they should be in school I don't know maybe right maybe
*  you're you know what you know what the situation is what you're seeing right now what I'm saying
*  is zoom classes are not healthy for kids it's weird it's a weird disconnect they're not around
*  their friends when they are around their friends they're more frantic it's like I believe that
*  children need a certain amount of socializing with each other in order to develop of course
*  I think it's important I think it's really good for them I think it's good for them to emotionally
*  experience conversations with each other unsupervised it's good it's good to learn how to talk to people
*  it's good to you know go to your parents and tell them you know Debbie got mad at me because I said
*  and you say well you know Debbie probably thought this yeah you have these kind of human human
*  interactions yeah this is what's I feel like if the kids aren't right in front of each other
*  all the time like that they're missing some of that I don't know if I'm right I'm hoping that
*  this is just a momentary roadblock and then a few months later from now we have some sort of viable
*  medication whatever we whatever it is whatever it is we realize okay we're gonna be okay and
*  people can go back to school but kids part of their development is interacting with other kids
*  it's just part of what it is the whole point of going there it's a there's a dance they learn
*  they learn I remember things that I said that was mean when I was five years old are you worried
*  about your kids having this lapse of this now they're 15 and 12 I think or 13 no 12 and 10
*  I don't I'm not worried about it in terms of I don't think it's surmountable it's a minor
*  concern you know the real concerns like don't let your kid get eaten by a tiger in Texas where we
*  have a lot of those fucking tigers your kids starve to death don't you know there's a lot bigger
*  concerns but I think that as a parent like if you know something you're supposed to teach it to your
*  kids if you have an idea of something you're supposed to explain to your kids if you think
*  if you see things that are going in a weird way so in this in this way it's like you feel more of
*  a need to have conversations with them about just just life overall and also what they're
*  what they're learning in school but life overall maybe even more so to let them know like all these
*  people you see these people right here they're people just like your dad's a dummy right you know
*  and your mom has to figure things out like that's the whole world okay okay your dad will tell you
*  right now dad's a daddy's a dummy okay don't come to me with math problems but like I'm gonna
*  protect you as much as I can but you have to recognize that this whole world is filled with
*  dummies like me okay so most people that are making the decisions or at the very least are
*  choosing the people that make the decisions are like me and dumb so know that and then know that
*  a lot to swallow for a 12 year old ten-year-old but but but when you communicate with them and
*  like let them know like hey like we are all trying to work this out this is what being a person is
*  do they do you think I mean my daughter just turned 30 my stepdaughters are 23 and 25 finally
*  get it my 30 year old yeah she fucking gets it so so good she really told she really gets it it's
*  awesome when they get it she's actually seek when I divorced second times and this is the third final
*  marriage it's a charm I love it I was so in love in love with my best friend thank you and and vice
*  versa my daughter came to me said she sat me the lioness came back to the lion she said listen I'm
*  glad you left her this is what you've done wrong here's the stuff that thing is fucked up here's
*  how you fucking damaged me with some really stupid fucking shit and it hurt me a lot but I've
*  forgiven you and now you were going to get up on your two feet you're gonna be a fucking man you're
*  gonna move on and she blessed me on everything and it was the most beautiful moment in my life and
*  from there it's just been soaring soaring and that's when she had she had figured it out she
*  had figured it out before I had that's very impressed with her that's having very impressed
*  with her yeah and that was just and you know what I think every child eventually comes to their
*  parents and has a version of that conversation at some point yeah for sure and I think the hope is
*  that you'll do better than yours did and then your kids will do better than you did and we
*  evolved but we're so afraid of you know making it worse or making them feel the pain that we
*  felt or rejection or disappointment and that's very it's a slippery slope you know what you do
*  there yeah I think we have to go back to what we're talking about we haven't even been talking for
*  that long we've been talking for 50,000 years and already we've dumbed it down to fucking fingers
*  on a touchscreen but do realistically it's been so short here the amount of time you make a good
*  point we were talking yeah we're no longer talking we're texting we're texting Joe we're texting it
*  hit a weird dip I think we're gonna be okay we're texting I honestly feel like if you looked at the
*  way technology evolves things technology evolves things towards demand and I think there's a
*  legitimate demand today for more connection and people are finding it sure ace in jars
*  yes yeah of course yeah yeah yeah they're doing of course I think if technology could eliminate
*  this bizarre aspect of social media where you write things out and a person is not in front of
*  you when this communication is delivered and you know you're hurting their feelings but you don't
*  have to experience their pain or look in their eyes and see their uncomfortable my stepdaughter
*  Ellen she had moved she moved to Chicago with her fiance just before two weeks before the shutdown
*  from Austin to there they were getting ready they had jobs lined up everything shut the fuck down
*  the horrific shit they've gone through but they already were on the path and they're now accelerating
*  that path they're going to Maine they're unplugging they're gonna live completely within a smaller
*  nomads smaller community no smaller community it glows going going back a little bit and I don't
*  think there's anything wrong with that we can learn a lot from this and if that's the trend and
*  we all make babies please that's we still have to make children dogs are not a substitute I love
*  dogs we need to keep making babies people otherwise we come Japan and the Japanese dead trap the money
*  will be fine you we're gonna have UBI some version of it will be very innovative you got to keep
*  pounding the old in and out eh you got to keep making babies we need babies otherwise that will
*  be a problem that's just my view I could be wrong I smoked some weed today there's a thing that
*  people like to say like like I think we don't need any more people oh we're overpopulation bomb yeah
*  it's been going on forever but it is kind of true there's a lot of people especially if you're in a
*  place like LA yeah but there's also what's also kind of true is don't you like people I love people
*  they're my favorite things people are the best things in the world to play they're awesome yeah
*  but there is a problem there's too many of us there really is is there really it seems to always
*  work out it was supposed to be too much here and too much then and too much then I'm not I'm not
*  opposed to the idea we got a lot of space man we got a lot of space in the world still for now maybe
*  if we keep growing eventually it's gonna come to a point but then there's the other concept that as
*  things westernize people are less and less less and less likely to have children early in life
*  because they want to that's okay their career that's okay but then the populations drop no but
*  you still got to do your two points 2.3 children you can have do it later yeah that use my parent
*  I remember my mom said I'm getting my tubes tied because I've done my duty to the country 2.3 she
*  had three kids I've done my three kids I'm above average I'm tying that shit up done with that and
*  that and that was what you did at the time I'm not the tubes tied tubes tied that's right and
*  then she's still divorced and had a much happier life without my dad I believe imagine back in the
*  day when there was no tubes tied there was no nothing yeah but Joe what do we grow up with you
*  stick your dick in you're gonna get AIDS that's what we grew up with what the hell was all that
*  about and where'd that go it went away with yeah went away with science went away with science and
*  voting isn't it amazing it's amazing how it went away it killed I went away what do you think happened
*  but wasn't those protease and what with HIV that's a whole nother show by itself for real yeah it
*  really if you really look I can give you some books if you and I've done this I've just like
*  I've looked at 9-eleven all this stuff there's a lot to it the HIV and it's Anthony Fauci it is
*  dr. Burke's it is redfields all the same people and is it that anytime there's anything huge like
*  that's an enormous medical concern there's an also enormous amount of money involved is that part of
*  the problem yeah yeah that is well the whole the whole system it in 2008 or 9 there was a financial
*  conference JP Morgan chase Goldman Sachs whatever and they were talking about the future of medicine
*  and vaccines and everyone was all jacked up about it because vaccines are not regulated the same as
*  every other medication so they you know they you can't be held liable if someone has a problem from
*  your vaccine now there are vaccine courts where the government quietly gives you money and you can
*  get some restitution but if the vaccine is shit you can't sue the pharmaceutical company so they
*  saw this as a great it's like holy shit this is great thinking from a financial perspective you're
*  giving people medicine charging for it before they're sick right this is great so you had
*  vaccines against smoking addiction and things that really I don't think fit the actual description
*  of vaccines and now we're at the magical RNA the mRNA vaccine which is supposed to not trick
*  your immune system by giving you a piece of the original virus but just trick your immune system
*  into changing something in your DNA that will reject the virus when it encounters it so it's
*  a little different and it's not been proven to work but jeez as you're freaking me out on curry
*  it's it's very mainstream knowledge it's not like this is something new why does it seem like the
*  next chapter of the horror movie because that's what it is it's released yeah everybody's forced
*  to not work unrest in the streets murder racist murder yeah possible all about fire would always
*  have what always happens and our game fucking Joe and fucking Adam we got our fucking shit
*  strapped on I have faith in the Republic I'm not worried the pred doesn't matter who our
*  president is the Republic still has all the tools and the legality to function fine I don't care
*  they I have a preference that's irrelevant I think there's a Republic continues to function
*  one way or the other we have the right tools in place doesn't matter whose president is not life
*  or death there are shortcuts to a good future that's for other people to determine but we
*  don't have to be worried about shit because America I'm glad you're optimistic and I think
*  there's a there's a real value in being optimistic I share your optimism I think we move if you look
*  at human beings from you know measurable history to today it's it's a clear path of doing better
*  it doesn't mean that everything's perfect right now it's not but we got to look at behavior we
*  got to look at like what what do you do do you want someone lighting the building on fire because
*  there's a guy inside you disagree with who is the most progressive mayor in the country of course
*  progressives he's like not enough like not progressive enough this guy is the most progressive guy the
*  mayor of Portland might be the most doesn't that show that we're a little misguided and we just
*  have to stand back and take a look at what's going on I think they're they're misidentifying
*  the conflict it's not as simple as I believe this and you believe that and I want to be rational
*  and you want to be you remember and we're talking about how you need some kind of challenge survival
*  challenge in your life to be a full human being yeah this I think unfortunately what happens to
*  probably younger people I'll say 20 to 30 is that their challenge has now become this dangerous
*  game of taunting yeah burning doing more than just protesting it can start with protesting but
*  that becomes a thing of lifeblood that you need to have and need in order to feel like a full human
*  I mean this is yeah we have our own challenges to feel like we are full humans I you know you have
*  yours I have mine it's providing for your family and certain level of success or whatever you're
*  looking for creating balance right creating harmony happiness it need yes it's some way
*  it needs the input but it needs the inputs and results you need something that's hard that's
*  either physically challenging or mentally challenging or just work intensive or concentration
*  yeah and this replaces that for a lot of people I think just would need something to do 100%
*  and it excites the tribal aspects of our imagination it really does and it's unfortunate that it does
*  that because it it forces people to behave and it's really like the conflict has already
*  been established it's a it's already clear conflict it's not as simple as I think one thing you think
*  a different thing and you can tell me why you think something and I can just accept it without
*  a judgment on me as a human being in my intellect and the problem is if you have something that's
*  opposed or is opposing the ideas I have in my head I think that you got me you made you know
*  you tapped me out you made checkmate right I'm like fuck this guy I'm gonna fight this out right
*  that's so your ego gets involved we need some deprogramming we need deprogramming specifically
*  in the idea that your ideas equal you that's crazy like you like you can most you should be
*  that thinks and when ideas are presented to you you just thought hmm is that valid is that good
*  for everybody is that bad like what is that is that poison the drinking water right and then
*  then move from there but when we look at anything through the lens of ideology we have these
*  boundaries we you know you can't be it's fear I think it's choice still public and I think it's
*  still fear that you want to look over there but you're almost kind of afraid like what if I agree
*  with it you know we have to be we have to find the courage to be less afraid of being open to
*  other things there's a lot more people than than anyone really realizes who are not red or or
*  blue or white or black a lot we had these meetups no agenda meetups and it's just self-organized
*  people they get together all over the world five people twenty people you know sometimes bigger
*  sometimes smaller and they're from all different ages backgrounds colors religion race but they
*  know one thing I'm gonna be clumsy here and I'm not gonna get triggered by any fucking shit you
*  say and we know that agreement is there and even if people are completely opposite it's like okay
*  man good one of the beer that's possible we can do this we can do this we can do this and this idea
*  that you have to be you know everyone has to be in agreement of every single goddamn issue in the
*  world otherwise you can't connect with them it's nonsense it's bad for all of us I think what we
*  were talking about earlier that labels should be illegal it's a joke but it's not no it's not a
*  joke really there's something to it man there's something to the idea that labels are a real
*  problem with us they're a real problem because we we adhere to those labels then there's like a
*  like a checklist of things you need to I'm on this I'm pro second amendment you have to write
*  all these things down and then you have to like if someone is on the same tribe as you you have to
*  agree with them about everything everything politically I think a lot of my views overlap
*  with what someone call conservative you know but I find that an incredible insult is you call me a
*  Republican or even a libertarian or Democrat I don't want to be fucking labeled anything I don't
*  need that it's not fair I think the best evidence that this is actually taking place is what's
*  happening right now between the right and the left and how polarized everything is how a weirdly
*  poll yeah but is it really I think that I think that everyone's now in agreement okay shits out of
*  control we got to stop this whatever's going on in the streets it's not everywhere but it's enough
*  of it that it's fucked up we got to stop it yeah everyone's in agreement so now both political
*  parties are kind of you know the Democratic Party and they've come in sailing in okay yeah we think
*  this should stop so that I think it will start to stop this is gonna have to happen well we it's
*  one of two things is gonna happen it's gonna stop or it's gonna accelerate right and that if it's
*  all dependent upon how what kind of reaction people have to it whenever you want to take over
*  society the best strategy is strategy from above and below so the below right now and if let's
*  just say if someone is thinking about this and running this and trying to fuck with us below is
*  your on-the-street riots black lives matter inequality whatever people are pissed off about
*  above is kovat that's that's why it's dangerous for us because we have this over pounding factors
*  yeah overall fear hurricane and an earthquake death and you don't and an asteroid oh and an
*  asteroid yeah I think we both agree that we probably can be okay through this yeah it's
*  better if we don't freak out yeah and we look for possible positive outcomes and that's what I think
*  and I think and it's hard it's hard it's hard yeah and honestly I think what I what I said
*  earlier about controversial people having platforms I think it's important that people
*  figured out for themselves you can't trick me with a faith healer why is it gonna trick you is
*  he gonna trick your kids what are you telling your kids like isn't the problem that we need to educate
*  people as to what people are capable of lying about trickery cults evangelists late-night TV
*  people trying yeah all your money shouldn't we like let them exist and then point to them so yes
*  it's an alligator that'll eat your dog I believe that alligator yes if you walk that alligator by
*  the lake you'll eat your dog now if there's illegality going on within any right or whatever
*  then you need to of course to process that immediately but it is illegal like you're fucking
*  pretending me you're talking to Jesus and you give me an anointed bandana that's gonna protect
*  you from any financials no I don't I know I don't think that should be illegal no fucking way what
*  do you know what do I know about the bandana the code the power of the bandana can be very big I
*  don't know Tom Hanks movie and it's real which one big something like that remember big head like
*  the thing yeah of course I know what that was imagine if you were me and I was you for like
*  24 hours we had to go about our lives what would you do would be the first thing you did wow
*  I don't know man that's really I think I probably go test out what I can do with my jujitsu and all
*  that fucking shit let me go to the gym first like fuck back kick fucking motherfucker okay I like
*  this I listen remember this when I get my old body I can imagine when that does happen where
*  people can literally become like you could put your body in an Olympic gymnast body yeah why
*  not that's Elon that's Elon's that ultimately that's where Elon's going I'm sure what did you think
*  about the test with the pigs well again I think I love Elon for his hey here's my cyber truck it
*  has bulletproof windows shatter like and then we're like fine man the fucking fucking ball
*  bearing at is fine you know I know it'll be great in the final mix it will fix it all and he does
*  it's like the pigs the pig doesn't want to come out like I know what you're doing you I'm good
*  with it I like the idea I'd love to see people who have MS or ALS whose brain is not commute
*  Parkinson's whose brain is not communicating the functions to be able to keep those going
*  because I think that's the initial application and that's fantastic right but am I interested
*  in at least I am very interested in the application of direct interfacing just I'd like to go just go
*  I just want to do my email right like that and everything just happens because he's right the
*  interface between our brains and in the network the whole community the world yeah is actually
*  gone from ten fingers to one or two with our phones I like the idea of upping that bandwidth
*  transfer I think that but I would like to be able to make sure I can turn it off and I have control
*  when I when I want it it would doesn't it sort of go in line with what we were talking about
*  what people have only been talking for a short amount of time sure like sure before people were
*  talking it was just grunts and pointing pictures trying to figure out how to kill the deer in a
*  way we're going back and we went from emojis on the wall to emojis on text smiley face puke emoji
*  mask emoji but you get it right so get it that's an abstraction of language that's so it sends you
*  a yellow face so that is actually how computer code works yeah computer code is binary you have
*  an assembler on top of it they got it maybe interpreted and got a scripting language and
*  then it's almost English and before you know it you're just saying this emoji and you put these
*  two emojis together you know exactly what I mean that is crazy so when you get that when you get
*  the raindrops with the with the it is crazy with the fucking what is that thing the eggplant eggplant
*  yeah you know what I mean Joe Rogan not answering my texts not answering my not answering my my my
*  eggplant water and mojo text eggplant water that's a bold move by peach peach peach exactly you can
*  bring that to court and people like I don't see anything the guy likes fruits and vegetables
*  trying to tell me clearly vegan elect surfing that's another benefit of the of the phone the
*  flip phone I can't really do emojis yeah that's good Adam Curry shall we wrap this up yeah Joe
