# Joe Rogan Experience #1438 - Andrew Santino
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDzGRT06er0)
*  You know who else carves guns like that? Who does? Jesse James. Remember Jesse James? The chopper maker dude?
*  Yeah. Yeah, that dude makes guns now. In Texas. That's all he does? He's still making bikes. I think he makes bikes too.
*  But he makes a lot of guns. Like dope guns. Like engraved and frost. And hand carves them. Yeah. Fancy guns.
*  The dude that we were talking about, I think he's an LA guy, but he hand does them. He's a Mexican gentleman you're saying?
*  Mexican dude. A Mexican man. Carves into the guns? Yeah, he carves into them. He does beautiful artwork, all hand designed.
*  And then people pay him to do his design. They don't say, like, here's what I want. The whole deal is you give him the gun and he just does it.
*  It's not like, I want this on here. He's like, no, no, no. You give me the piece, I do the art, I give it back.
*  You know what's interesting about Bernie Sanders? What is this? Is this the guy with the guns? That's it, yeah.
*  Let me see what this looks like. I was going to say what's interesting about Bernie Sanders is his real close relationship with Killer Mike.
*  Killer Mike is a big pro Second Amendment man. I mean, he believes in guns. He believes you should be able to protect yourself and protect your family.
*  And what? And Bernie's so against it? Well, I don't know if Bernie's so against it because he talks to Killer Mike and they don't scream and yell at each other.
*  Killer Mike. In Vermont, we don't need guns. I don't think we need guns in the Northeast.
*  How did he do yesterday? He won Vermont, California, Colorado, Utah. And is that it? And then Biden.
*  Biden's still in the lead, right? Is Biden number one now?
*  Yeah, he's ahead 435 to 381 as of right now. That's pretty good.
*  Elizabeth, let me tell you something. I worry about both of them because they're older gentlemen, but I worry about Biden more.
*  He looks like he's like it's almost like his skin is thin. Well, I think his brain seems to be skipping.
*  Do you know what I mean? It's almost like an old scratch DVD. Well, you got to realize he's fucking tired, dude.
*  Just forget about just being old. Doing the pace that he's doing is fucking crazy.
*  It's going to get on that Trump speed, that Trump speed, whatever that Sudafed from Germany.
*  I'm on Poppers again. He's got the best shit and he's already ranking on them.
*  It's already hilarious. You see what he did, Mike, for Mike Bloomberg. He hit under the podium.
*  He pretended he was Mike Bloomberg. Tiny Mike. Yeah, I'm going to be able to see over the podium.
*  He goes behind the podium and then he's calling him Sleepy Joe. He's doing stand up.
*  It's really I say it on stage. He ripped. He fucking rips. Did you see the clip from the other day where he's like, is this guy, is this guy Mexican?
*  He says he's Mexican. You really Mexican Mexican? He's Mexican like I'm Native American. I'm Elizabeth Warren.
*  He was ripping and they were losing it. He rips. He's funny. He's funny. He says funny shit.
*  We were talking about this yesterday. Mike, he's got a lifetime experience of being in front of the camera.
*  He knows how to do it. He's a showman. Well, it's like everything else, like podcasts or stand up or I would imagine any kind of public speaking.
*  The more you do it, the better you get at it. The more you realize your mistakes, the more you tighten up your game, the more practice you get.
*  And he gets a lot of practice. I mean, he's doing public speaking all the time.
*  And when he gets to do something where they're all on his side, it's probably fun. Like those things he does when they're all on his side.
*  So those are good times. That's a you ripping an arena. That's basically what it is. They're all there to see you.
*  He's not playing a club. He's playing a fucking sold out arena that are like, bring out Trump.
*  If he brought other guys to do 10 in front of him, you know, type him up and bring Jared and I'll tell you what, once he's out of the White House, he's going to be more popular than ever.
*  He's going to be a hero because let me tell you something, people forget this, but they didn't like Ronald Reagan when he was in office.
*  George Bush. Well, but Reagan is a big one, though, because Reagan became like this hero afterwards.
*  But during the whole Iran contra thing when he was going on television, say he doesn't remember. Do you know what Jimmy Tingle is? Great stand up comic from Boston.
*  But he had a joke. I remember I was an open micers back in the 80s when Reagan was brought in front of whoever was at Congress that he had talked about.
*  Selling guns to Iran when he did it, he would say, I don't remember.
*  That's what Reagan was saying. And he might not have because he really did have Alzheimer's. Remember? Right.
*  So Jimmy Tingle goes, Mr. President, just here's a little tip. If you ever sell guns to someone who hates us, jot it down.
*  Because make a little note. Put it in the refrigerator.
*  Yeah, and he got love. Such a simple joke.
*  Yeah, let's hear it. Let me hear it.
*  I have no recollection of doing so.
*  Okay.
*  But that could be my memory. I don't remember.
*  Well, as you sit here now, do you have any recollection of approving for John Poindexter to send these specific letters to Congress?
*  Well, again, it's a case of memory. I don't recall whether he did or not.
*  Okay. And my question to you is, would you have approved the sending of these letters to Congress by John Poindexter if you knew that they adopted false information that had been previously supplied?
*  That's crazy.
*  That's a problem, too. There's so much rhetoric involved. I don't even know what that question was.
*  That's good.
*  They pile on all these things and then you go, I have no idea what you're saying. What are you asking me?
*  Right. There's so much legalese.
*  Right. At some point he does seem trapped in too many questions.
*  It's kind of like I watched that clip of Betsy DeVos and that Wisconsin senator going at it about how she doesn't know the numbers for charter schools.
*  I don't know if you've seen this, but she's unaware of the numbers presented of how many charter schools fail.
*  But he's throwing so many statistics at her. How could you even keep up?
*  I mean, she does sound like a bumbling dumbo, but you just bury someone with stats.
*  They're going to go, I don't even know which one you want me to address, and I don't have any information in front of me to fight it.
*  So when they do that sometimes with politicians, I'm always like, of course they're going to drown. How could he fight out of that?
*  Yeah, clearly that's like a combat strategy.
*  Unless you're Trump and then he diverts. He's so good at it. He'll take in all that stuff and then go...
*  Well, he's never been in this kind of a situation where he had to answer questions in a court.
*  Not yet.
*  That would be interesting if he did.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  I think he'd probably get in trouble because a lot of his stuff is shutting things down and he could get out of order.
*  But my point is we both know, even if someone's good at that, if they do that and they hit you with a bunch of stats and it fucks you up so hard you can't answer their original question and you're supposed to be grilling them.
*  We know what you're doing. You're not communicating in a way that you are actually trying to communicate with the person.
*  You're playing verbal warfare. You're fighting.
*  You're trying to back them up on their heels and smother their reach and get them in a corner and pound on them.
*  That's what you're doing. You're overwhelming them with a barrage of information.
*  Just like you'd overwhelm someone with a barrage of punches. It's the same thing.
*  When you see their weakness, you're like, I'm just going to hit them.
*  It's not even the same thing because you're not supposed to be doing that. You're supposed to be having an exchange.
*  You're supposed to be talking to each other. You're supposed to be someone getting to the bottom of it.
*  But we know that he doesn't want to tell the truth. He doesn't want to go, yes, I did sell guns to Iran.
*  I sold guns.
*  And I sold cocaine in the inner cities of Los Angeles because I was trying to crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.
*  I induced crack into the streets.
*  I mean, all that stuff really did happen. Yeah, that's not a conspiracy theory anymore.
*  No, the CIA or whoever was working for the CIA sold drugs in the inner cities was brought in through freeway Ricky, who's the original Rick Ross, real Rick Ross.
*  The real Rick Ross didn't even know what he was doing while he was doing it.
*  And then after it was over, like these guys didn't figure it out until like long past that they were working with the government like Rick Ross had no idea.
*  He had no idea. He just thought he was awesome at selling coke. He didn't know he was completely protected.
*  Yeah, but that's kind of did you watch the pharmacist?
*  I should say completely protected, but I should say that he was in bed with the government.
*  Right. Do you watch them? The pharmacist?
*  No. What is that?
*  That's all about the distribution of Oxycontin and specifically like what it's done to kind of the East Coast.
*  This kind of started in New Orleans. The documentary is all about it. But up there how it got really bad.
*  This pharmacist basically, his son, I don't want to give it away, but his son tragically died and he started to investigate like why all this stuff is kind of happening in New Orleans.
*  And the epicenter was this Purdue Pharma that made Oxycontin, the biggest distributor of Oxycontin in the United States.
*  And the whole documentary kind of shows you how it was just they weren't orchestrating this thing to try to solve people's pain.
*  All the documents and emails are just like these are big hitter areas, meaning like sell, sell, sell.
*  So all these sales reps were going out pushing, you know, like they're fucking like they're trying to sell cars.
*  I mean they were selling them like candy. It's crazy. I mean the government was totally totally okay with it.
*  I mean the FDA didn't have anything against it for a long time. They were like, oh, they're solving pain.
*  So much money.
*  The money involved is staggering. It's hard for us to even understand how much money is coming in from pills, just from pills.
*  And here's the thing about prescribing them. This is, let's be honest, everyone's in pain.
*  Yeah.
*  It's part of being a person.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're, and especially if you're an older person that's maybe got a difficult job like you have to carry things and move things around that are heavy, you're in fucking pain.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You got back problems. Everybody has back problems. So you go to these people with back problems and they're like, I got a fucking solution.
*  This is the fix.
*  This is the fucking fix.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you get soul poison. Once you get hooked on soul poison.
*  Well, and then what happens is these doctors, this woman, Jacqueline Clegg, that's who the documentary focuses on, she's running a pill mill, right?
*  So like she's writing 70, 80 prescriptions a day and you get all these doctors on there that are like, that's impossible.
*  To see 70 people is not, you couldn't do it even if you were fucking.
*  How could you see 70 people in a day?
*  It's impossible.
*  That bitch is flagrant.
*  So she was making unbelievable money.
*  Just bro, stop it. Let's break this down by the minute.
*  Yeah.
*  70 a day.
*  There's eight hours in a day.
*  Yeah.
*  So let's, she said 70 to 80. Let's get crazy and say it's 80.
*  Right.
*  So there's eight hours in a day. So she's seen 10 people in an hour.
*  In an hour. Yeah.
*  Each hour.
*  Yeah.
*  Not counting lunch. No coffee breaks.
*  There is no lunch.
*  If you have to shit, hold it in. We're here to make money, baby.
*  No bathroom breaks. Let's go.
*  Well, she was operating at night. That was the whole thing.
*  Oh my God.
*  The whole thing was about she would have a New Orleans cop in her lobby
*  to make sure that nobody was trying to bust her.
*  Strong armor.
*  Yeah, she paid off the cops. It was crazy.
*  And they got no trouble.
*  You pay security detail money for cops.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, the cops are happy. We're all working together.
*  Yeah, and the cops are like, what do you mean? I'm just protecting the front.
*  The cops are like, hey, he's not breaking the law.
*  No, he's not. He knows what's going on in the back because he's probably getting chipped off a few.
*  The law is very sketchy. It was really sketchy back in the day.
*  Did you ever see who did it? Who made Oxycontin Express?
*  What was the company behind that?
*  I don't know.
*  See if you can find that.
*  Was that a movie?
*  Oh, it was a made for television thing.
*  A PBS?
*  That showed investigative report. I'll get you the people who were in it, too.
*  Vanguard.
*  Vanguard did it, but who's the woman and the man behind it?
*  Mariana Vanzeller.
*  Put it up so I could see it so I could say it because they were on the podcast.
*  They were really cool way back in the day.
*  Yeah, Mariana Vanzeller. And wasn't her husband involved in this as well?
*  I think so. Anyway, awesome documentary that detailed what was going on down there.
*  In Florida, they didn't have a database.
*  So if you went to me and I was a doctor and you're like, my back hurts.
*  I'm like, you need drugs. And I gave you Oxycontin.
*  You'd like, thanks, bro. And then you go over to Jamie.
*  And you go to Dr. Jamie. I'm like, my back hurts.
*  He goes, you need Oxycontin. He goes, thanks, bro.
*  And he gives it to you. And then you just keep going.
*  And so they would go to 10, 20, 30 different doctors.
*  And they have this thing called pain management centers.
*  You go to a pain management center.
*  You see some soulless doctor sitting there just writing out scripts.
*  And the only thing they write scripts for is Oxycontins and painkillers.
*  And then they go right next door to the pharmacy.
*  It's in the same thing. One door is here. One door is here.
*  You go right next door and you get your drugs.
*  Like in the same building.
*  It's a one-stop shop for drugs.
*  And there's no computer system to check. You just keep doing it.
*  And look, everybody who does drugs does drugs for a reason.
*  Whether you do real heroin, whether you do coke.
*  You're doing drugs because there might not be a reason that makes sense to you.
*  But they want to do those drugs.
*  You can come up with reasons why you want to take painkillers.
*  Almost anyone.
*  People are always in pain. My shoulder hurts.
*  Take half one of these. Half. Got it.
*  I'll take half now and half right after it.
*  It's just crazy how many of them there are.
*  If you looked at the actual numbers of prescriptions that are written every year in this country, it's like, what are you talking about?
*  Have you ever taken anything?
*  No, not that stuff. I did a morphine drip once though when I was in the hospital for my knee reconstruction in like 93.
*  And dude, it was awesome. I was laying there. I was hitting that button. Bang.
*  And I was on a continual motion machine.
*  I had a patellar tendon graft, which means they'd cut a piece out of your bone of your kneecap and a piece of bone out of your shin and connect it to a strip of your patellar tendon.
*  Then they open you up like a fish and they screw this in on one bone and screw that on another bone.
*  They reconstruct you a new ACL. It's awesome. It works great today.
*  To this day, I throw kicks with it, run with it. No problem.
*  And you were floating on the clouds.
*  Oh my God. So I'm on this machine that keeps your leg moving after so it doesn't stiffen up.
*  So the blood doesn't clot and stuff.
*  So this machine's moving like this and this fucking drip. I'm hitting this drip hard.
*  Bang, bang, bang, bang. It's like a warm hug.
*  Like when I was lying there, I was like, I get it.
*  The only time I've experienced that very similar was when the old Nyquil was available, the real codeine filled Nyquil.
*  Yeah, when it fucked you up.
*  And I'd be high the next morning.
*  I was so high. I was lying in my bed. I felt so good. I felt so loved.
*  I felt so much better. It's like before the drugs, I was miserable. I had the flu. I felt like shit.
*  But then as soon as I took that stuff, I was like, I feel loved. I feel like I'm just floating in softness.
*  I get it. I get why people need that.
*  I'm the opposite, man. I tore ligaments in my leg and they gave me Vicodin and it had an adverse effect.
*  It was so bad, I had to go back to the doctor and I was like, it's giving me crazy anxiety.
*  I couldn't sleep and I was eating a few of them to try to kill the pain.
*  The pain would get worse and the guy was like, maybe Vicodin you don't mix.
*  And it made me angry. I was going through these night tremor spells and shit.
*  I was like, this stuff is, I couldn't do it. I never touched it again.
*  Some people love that stuff.
*  I had a friend of mine, he used to take Vicodin's and play guitar.
*  He said it made him really creative.
*  Really?
*  Really. I think I took either Vicodin or Percocet. I can't remember after that first knee surgery.
*  But I only took it once because it made me so stupid.
*  I remember it dulled the pain a little bit but I was so dumb, man.
*  I was just half out of it.
*  Your brain is not full.
*  I'd rather be in pain. This is stupid. I can't even enjoy a television show.
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on. I'm laying in my apartment.
*  I can't even watch TV because I'm so stupid.
*  I hate that shit. That's the thing that I like.
*  I think I have a high tolerance for medication.
*  There's a weird dude.
*  He's calling me an alcoholic.
*  Hey, hey, Joe, Joe.
*  A functioning alcoholic.
*  You can look it up though. There's a thing about redheads.
*  Redheads have a gene where they have high pain tolerances and high tolerances to certain medicines.
*  Every time I've ever taken stuff, nothing really works for me the way that it's supposed to.
*  People say all the time, what do you just pop a couple of Advil?
*  Advil has never done anything for me my whole life.
*  If I could take three or four, it doesn't fucking mean.
*  You know when they give you those, if you go to a doctor, if you've got some kind of thing, like a headache or whatever,
*  and they give you those super Advils, you know, that like triple the dose or whatever,
*  I take those things and they're nothing.
*  So I end up throwing them away.
*  Why is it okay to discriminate against redheads?
*  It's one of the last fun things to discriminate against people that would still actually hurt their feelings.
*  Because we're still white.
*  We still are underneath it all.
*  They're like, he still has advantages.
*  Deal with it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's actually when I see like a redheaded black guy, I'm like, oh man, double down.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I have seen redheaded people that are really good at taking punishment.
*  And I've always wondered, like I've read things about redheads having a higher tolerance for pain too.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  Was that that article he brought up?
*  They showed about it.
*  It's like it's something, it's something in, I don't know what there's, I'm going to misquote it.
*  But yeah, the MC1R gene belongs to a family of receptors that include pain receptors in the brain.
*  And as a result, a mutation in the gene allows, appears rather to influence the body sensitivity to pain.
*  That makes sense.
*  There's so many Irish dudes who can take an insane beating.
*  You know what I mean?
*  A 2004 to end on top of that, just the toughness of the Irish people.
*  Oh, they're fucking their background.
*  Just a redhead from Ireland with that MC1R gene.
*  Jesus Christ, you don't have to kill them.
*  MC1R sounds like a Mortal Kombat character.
*  MC1R.
*  It does.
*  Like a bike.
*  Like some sort of fucking ninja bike.
*  The mutation in the MC1R gene also occurs in brunettes, although it's less common.
*  In the latest study, the researchers tested for the MC1R gene variant, finding that in 65 of 67 redheads.
*  Holy shit.
*  And in 20 of 77 people with brown or black hair.
*  That's interesting.
*  So it's like, what is that, like 30 something percent of people that are brown hair, but almost, what is that, like 90?
*  97, 98 percent?
*  Almost 98, 97.
*  That's crazy.
*  So all redheads can take a beating.
*  Mentally and physically.
*  Congratulations.
*  Oh, you can take a beating mentally.
*  It's in mentally too.
*  But that's to prepare you for life as a redhead.
*  That's exactly.
*  You've got a turtle shell.
*  God was like, this guy's gonna get shit it on.
*  We better make it.
*  Bro, you have a mental turtle shell.
*  I do.
*  Yeah, I have a mental shell.
*  You just have to like, I think every redhead I know has an attitude because of how you're treated as a kid.
*  Yeah.
*  I've talked about this before.
*  People think that it's not a thing.
*  It's a thing.
*  If there's a room full of people, right, and a bunch of PC mongers or social justice warriors are in the room, everyone would be like, you can't say anything about him, can't say anything about her, about her.
*  If they got to a redhead, they'd be like, it's fine.
*  Yeah.
*  They can.
*  They're white.
*  That's not that big of a deal.
*  They're still full white.
*  Like imagine making fun of a handsome white man with blonde hair, would you?
*  Hitler's dream.
*  Yeah, probably Hitler's dream.
*  Hitler's dream.
*  You can make fun of him that way.
*  Yeah.
*  But otherwise.
*  Nazi motherfucker.
*  Like you could easily, and no one would feel bad because it's perceived that they have all the advantages.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though, what if they're, you know, they're homeless and they're, you know, they've never.
*  How about they're dumb?
*  That's the biggest disadvantage a person ever has.
*  Right.
*  If their brain doesn't work.
*  How many really handsome dummies do you know?
*  I mean, most.
*  Bro, I know a couple guys that are dream boats, but they're dumb as a rock.
*  They're so handsome.
*  They have just beautiful faces and perfect cheeks and they just look great.
*  He's not talking about you, Jamie.
*  I'd be so excited.
*  Stop, stop.
*  Jamie raised his hand.
*  If I was a girl, I'd be so excited to meet those guys.
*  But part of me says those poor bastards are at a disadvantage because everything's so easy.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  They're big, giant, handsome people.
*  Like you see a six foot tall, perfect man.
*  Like, do you know what kind of pussy David Hasselhoff must have been getting in the 80s?
*  Insane.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  Insane.
*  The girls were catapulting themselves in his direction.
*  It didn't matter if he was smart or not.
*  Spread leg.
*  He was beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and he was really tall and classically handsome.
*  You know, that's a giant advantage.
*  And if you have that giant advantage and you don't have to work hard to meet women, look at him.
*  Jesus Christ, what a dream boat.
*  Yeah, he's a babe.
*  Are you fucking kidding me?
*  Look at that face.
*  He's beautiful.
*  Where's the naked one where he's on the rug?
*  That's the funny one, right?
*  He's a really nice guy, too.
*  He did an episode of Fear Factor.
*  Did he?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He did a series of shows with Fear Factor.
*  He –
*  This is what's great about back then, though.
*  You didn't have to have a great body.
*  At all.
*  Like, nobody had a six-pack.
*  No one had packs unless you were a bodybuilder.
*  Yeah, look at him.
*  Like, he looks like a guy who's maybe worked out three times.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Yeah, he kind of knows where the gyms are.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when someone in a hotel goes, we have a gym, and he's like, I'll check it out.
*  You know?
*  Hey, it looks good.
*  I love this Nautilus equipment.
*  Yeah, he was – but my point being, like, that guy –
*  Look at that – look at that – no – like, no muscle structure.
*  Look at his fucking arms.
*  There's no muscle structure, dude.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, he didn't do much working out.
*  But you don't need to back then.
*  You could be like a Hollywood dude who didn't ever – it's kind of like Leonardo DiCaprio
*  might be the only guy who's that famous and good-looking today that has a bad body.
*  Ugh.
*  Bring – his body is shit.
*  That dude has a shit body.
*  For a famous guy, dude, he has a dogshit body.
*  All the guys in his level are – Brad Pitt, Ryan Reynolds, all these dudes are jacked
*  to shit.
*  Jacked.
*  Jacked.
*  Jacked.
*  And you see Leonardo DiCaprio, and you're like this – this schlubby, Play-Doh-looking
*  fucking body.
*  Dude, he's so good, though.
*  He's so good.
*  I know.
*  He's the pumpkin.
*  He gets everything.
*  He does whatever he wants.
*  But he's such a good actor.
*  He's so good.
*  He's one of my favorite of all time, because he made movies back then that I loved and
*  now that I like.
*  You can forget how good he is because he's so handsome.
*  You can forget.
*  But then you see a movie like – did you see – look at his body.
*  It's perfect.
*  Perfect.
*  That's Burt Kreischer if he lost 100 pounds.
*  I mean –
*  It's perfect.
*  It's a dumpy, regular dude's body.
*  He's built perfect.
*  And look, he's not – he's not trying to hide it.
*  No, it's awesome.
*  He's seven months pregnant.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  Just waddling around there on the beach with a cocaine baby inside his belly.
*  Leo and his second trimester.
*  He can do whatever the fuck he wants.
*  He's a fucking modern day Jack Nicholas.
*  That's why I appreciate this dude.
*  Jack Nicholson, not the golfer.
*  The actor.
*  Damn, that would have sounded better if I got the name right.
*  He's a modern day Jack Nicholson.
*  Like, he's not trying with his fucking body.
*  He's just being an amazing actor.
*  Dude, in Dejango when he played that evil dude.
*  Unreal.
*  Fucking A, man.
*  You buy it.
*  You believe it.
*  So intense.
*  That fight scene was one of my favorite fight scenes.
*  When he fucking hits these intense moments, like in The Revenant as well, it's another
*  movie where he has these moments where like, fuck, you forget how good that guy is.
*  You forget how good he is.
*  Yeah, did you like Once Upon a Time or no?
*  Loved it.
*  You did?
*  Loved it, except the Bruce Lee scene.
*  But that's, I'm a Bruce Lee fan.
*  I'm a dork.
*  Real disrespectful to Bruce Lee.
*  It didn't make sense.
*  Because even though Bruce Lee was very confident, he deemed that he was arrogant.
*  That's what Quentin was saying.
*  And this is not, you know, I just don't think he was a Bruce Lee fan.
*  Has any athlete at that caliber not been arrogant?
*  Can you name me someone that good?
*  This is where things are swirly, right?
*  Because Bruce Lee wasn't like a professional athlete per se.
*  He was an actor, but he was also one of the most important martial arts pioneers ever.
*  Because he was like a true dyed in the wool innovator.
*  And if you look at his skills, like when he did the Green Hornet and Game of Death and
*  Chinese Connection, just his kicking and striking skills.
*  Off the charts technique.
*  Beautiful technique.
*  And for the time, very few people had technique like him.
*  Like in the later years, people's technique improved.
*  People had a chance to see more styles in video and see more of what's possible.
*  But if you go back and watch even like legends like Jim Kelly and like some of those other,
*  like Joe Lewis, who was a heavyweight kickboxing champion, not the boxer.
*  You see those guys playing in movies.
*  Their technique was not as good as Bruce Lee's.
*  Why was he so sharp?
*  He just was a genius.
*  He's a genius martial artist.
*  He understood more about martial arts than anybody of his era because he understood that
*  everyone was being imprisoned by ideology.
*  Like if you were a judo guy, you had to stick with judo.
*  You couldn't learn Muay Thai.
*  If you learned Muay Thai, you'd be disrespectful to your master, disrespectful to your style.
*  And people get mad at you.
*  When I was training in Taekwondo and then I started kickboxing, my instructor did not like it.
*  They did not like one of my instructors in particular did not like it.
*  Didn't think I needed to do it.
*  Didn't thought I could get everything that I needed at there.
*  But I knew that wasn't true because I was going to gyms again boxed up.
*  And I was like, OK, I'm getting my bell rung.
*  I need to learn how to use my fucking hands better.
*  And I started going to boxing gyms.
*  And these there was very like you couldn't do that.
*  You weren't supposed to do that.
*  Like they were a little bit lenient with me because they knew I was a lawyer and I was an instructor.
*  I was trying to learn things.
*  Right. But when you go to a Kung Fu school, if you thought you could go to a karate school,
*  they would fucking beat you.
*  Like the people would really kick your ass if they thought you were leaving to go train with a karate school.
*  Wow. It was real weird.
*  So back in the day, Bruce Lee was the only guy he was training in Wing Chung and quite a few other martial arts he studied.
*  But then he started studying Western boxing.
*  He started studying wrestling.
*  He started studying judo.
*  And, you know, he did some grappling training with Gene LaBelle, who is supposed to kind of represent the Brad Pitt character because the Brad but in a different way.
*  The Brad Pitt character is this ultimate badass stunt guy in that movie and him and Bruce Lee get in a fight and, you know, he kind of kicks Bruce Lee's ass.
*  Right. He really fucks him up.
*  Really fucks him up. Kicks him into a fucking car.
*  He folds the door. The real story when Bruce Lee met Judo Gene LaBelle, Judo Gene LaBelle was a stunt man and he's a fucking gorilla.
*  He was a heavyweight or light heavyweight judo champion.
*  And I mean a fucking bear of a man.
*  And he just picked Bruce Lee up like he would pick up you or me.
*  Yeah. And walked around with him on his shoulder like just being cute with them.
*  And Bruce Lee was like, OK, teach me.
*  And Bruce Lee and him trained together.
*  And even in I think it was Game of Death, when the opening scenes, he gets this guy.
*  It's either in a crucifix or an armbar.
*  I forget.
*  But he gets this guy in a submission technique, which would be in the very first ever MMA gloves.
*  Like that. I don't know who invented those gloves, who designed them.
*  But those gloves that Bruce Lee was wearing in I think it was Game of Death, those was it Game of Death or Enter the Dragon where he wore those gloves?
*  I think it was Game of Death.
*  Those gloves that he was wearing, they were just like UFC gloves, just like UFC gloves, just a little bit different, a little more puffy than UFC gloves.
*  But anyway, he gets this dude down and gets him in a fucking armlock and he taps him.
*  That's Judo Gene LeBell shit.
*  Like LeBell taught him how to do that stuff.
*  But what I was saying is like it's not impossible that Bruce Lee would get beat up by someone like Gene LeBell.
*  In fact, I would bet everything on it.
*  I would bet the fucking house.
*  If Bruce Lee had a fight with Gene LeBell, Gene LeBell would grab him.
*  And just like he would do you or just like you do me, he would choke him unconscious.
*  That's just facts.
*  This is just facts.
*  That's not the problem.
*  If they had that in the movie, that wouldn't be a problem.
*  The problem is like they had Bruce Lee act like an asshole.
*  Yeah.
*  And there was no real evidence that he acted like that.
*  He was certainly confident, but it was also because he was a brilliant man and he knew he was brilliant.
*  He knew he was right.
*  He combined all these martial arts.
*  He was the first guy to combine things.
*  He was the first guy to take some of the kicks from Savat, which is like this French kickboxing style.
*  And he would combine them with movement of fencing.
*  He was really interested in fencing, how they had these big entries.
*  Right.
*  And he realized that there's like a technique to these big entries with the sword that you could apply with a punch.
*  And so he was into fencing and he was into everything.
*  He was a genius.
*  So what was Quentin trying to say?
*  He made him out to be a dickwad.
*  But he didn't like him.
*  I don't think he knew him and it was more fun for him to make him out to be that way.
*  Look, everybody in the movie was someone who they weren't.
*  Right?
*  Like all the Manson family winds up, spoiler alert, they turn the tables on them and they all get killed.
*  And none of the innocent people die.
*  It's a fucking wild scene, the movie.
*  The thing is they made a guy who's a beloved historical figure.
*  They made him out to be a dickwad.
*  It's like he does whatever.
*  When he's making these movies, they're just wild ass movies.
*  He does whatever he wants.
*  That's why those movies are so great.
*  I would never tell him what to do.
*  But I'm just saying the only thing I didn't like was that this guy who is this, you know, is there an equivalent in other sports like Bruce Lee?
*  It's hard to say because he wasn't really a competitor.
*  Right?
*  He had maybe like one karate match that was recorded.
*  I'm sure he had some gym fights.
*  Everybody who got involved in martial arts had some kind of gym fights where there were real fights.
*  Like is there someone who transcended their sport a little bit?
*  Other than, like think of any other sport of that era.
*  Or it's more than a sport, right?
*  Fighting is like a little bit more personal.
*  What one person transcended the whole art like Bruce Lee did?
*  Yeah, it's hard.
*  I mean the only guy that like comes to mind that dynamically is such a remarkable athlete like Bo Jackson is maybe the most impressive, quiet, humble athlete that my generation has ever seen.
*  Bo Jackson was not only a pro baseball player but a pro football player and was fucking insane at both.
*  And when he was done because of injury, unfortunately, he relegated himself to still becoming this like very centered athlete.
*  There's a video of him shooting bow and arrow with his toes and ripping bullseyes.
*  I mean he's an incredible dynamic athlete who's very quiet and humble and was always kind of the guy who never boasted the way that his image was put up, right?
*  Like his image was put up to a degree that was like one of the greatest of all.
*  Like Bo knows he was a campaign.
*  He became a superstar.
*  But his image was based on his accomplishments, not based on him talking.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Bo was never a guy that was very like in your face and loud and boisterous.
*  You know like a guy today would be like Ochocinco, you know like Chad John.
*  All those guys, they're big flashy, they're talkers.
*  I'm the shit.
*  Deion Sanders is a better example of a guy who was a football player and a baseball player.
*  Neon Deion, bro.
*  Showtime.
*  All he did was talk about how good he was.
*  Bo wasn't that way but in my opinion was the most dynamic athlete I ever saw as a kid.
*  He was fucked.
*  He used to break baseball bats over his knee when he got mad if he struck out.
*  And it looked like me cracking a twig.
*  But if you try to find a video of him shooting that bow, it's the most impressive thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.
*  He whittles them and makes all of it himself at his house.
*  He lives up in the woods somewhere.
*  I swear to God, dude.
*  He was on my friend Steve Rinell's podcast.
*  He's an eater.
*  He's incredible.
*  It's a really interesting episode.
*  So yeah, he's got a bow making shop.
*  He got really into bow hunting.
*  But now he can't draw a bow back anymore.
*  His shoulders are so fucked up from football that he has to use a crossbow now.
*  I mean, he's one of those guys that was, I guess, the only way I can compare him is just his humility was overwhelming.
*  He never really was a loud, boisterous guy when he, both when he played and after his career.
*  So that was the only thing that I think would parallel Bruce Lee because everything I know about Bruce Lee is like...
*  But this is my difference.
*  He was a super accomplished athlete.
*  Bruce Lee was a movie guy.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a movie star.
*  But you don't think that...
*  He's a different animal.
*  Yeah, I guess that's true.
*  But I mean, but from you saying, from your perspective saying like, he was a martial artist, right?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So then isn't that still true without the movie shit?
*  He was a phenomenal martial artist.
*  He was definitely a phenomenal martial artist.
*  Just didn't compete.
*  Didn't really compete.
*  Well, yeah.
*  I guess that's part of it.
*  But I mean, like, can you not compete and still be at the top of a thing?
*  I mean, is that possible?
*  I don't know, man.
*  You know, that's the one thing that if I was going to make an argument against me as a
*  commentator for the MMA, for MMA, I've never fought in MMA.
*  Like, it's kind of hilarious that I'm a commentator for MMA.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though I'm a fan of it and I know mostly what I'm talking about.
*  You know, I have...
*  Imagine that's on the contract.
*  You must know most of what you're talking about.
*  That's what I know.
*  Mostly what I'm talking about when it comes to wrestling, like, I've really...
*  It's really interesting to work with guys like Dominic Cruz or work with Daniel Cormier.
*  Daniel Cormier in particular was like one of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA.
*  I mean, he's an active wrestling coach and Dominic does a lot of coaching too and a lot
*  of MMA coaching too.
*  But both guys are so good at breaking down the technical aspects of it.
*  It makes you realize how little you really know about certain specialties, you know?
*  But are they good at what you...
*  The difference is, are they good at also articulating emotion and the public viewpoint?
*  That's the difference.
*  Well, I can give expert analysis of ground fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  Ground fighting, I can give expert.
*  Like, this is just, you know, not to blow my horn, but I know what's going on.
*  Like, the way a lot of people know what's going on with boxing, I can tell you what's
*  going on with chokes and when someone's in trouble, when someone's not.
*  And I can see it because I've been strangled a million times.
*  I can see where he's in trouble.
*  I know what that is.
*  I'm like, this guy's in trouble.
*  Like, and some people can't see that.
*  But most MMA fighters at a certain point in time, they know most basic shit in terms of
*  positions and when things are dangerous.
*  But when stuff gets exotic, like weird rubber guard transitions or strange chokes, like
*  people invent new chokes all the time, there's always something new that you haven't seen
*  before.
*  Like, how the fuck did he do that?
*  And then you have to go back and watch it again.
*  But do people think...
*  How many people think that you did fight?
*  I don't think anybody does.
*  You don't think so?
*  No, I kickboxed.
*  And, I mean, if anybody looks at my record, I had three kickboxing fights.
*  And I don't know how many taekwondo fights.
*  A lot.
*  Probably a hundred.
*  What was your record?
*  I don't know.
*  I had two and one in kickboxing.
*  I lost my last kickboxing fight.
*  But as far as taekwondo, I have no idea.
*  I won the Massachusetts State Championship four years in a row.
*  And I won, I think it was called the American Open, which is a big tournament that I won.
*  I came in second place in the US Cup.
*  That was a big thing in...
*  That was in Connecticut.
*  And I fought the national champion in the finals.
*  And I thought I beat him.
*  That was when I was like 19, 20.
*  That was when I was at my best.
*  When I was around 21, before I tried out for the nationals and try...
*  I was going to try to make the Olympic team.
*  That's when I was starting to box and kickbox.
*  And I was losing faith in taekwondo.
*  I was realizing that there was...
*  I had a distorted perception of what I could do.
*  So it was just way...
*  You were way more engaged with boxing than you ever were with taekwondo.
*  I was getting beat up.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it was.
*  I would go to these kickboxing gyms.
*  And when I would just...
*  When I kickboxed guys, I could kick them so hard,
*  they couldn't get close enough to box me a lot of the time.
*  So I'd kick them in the arms.
*  I'd kick them.
*  And they'd be like, what the fuck?
*  And then I could...
*  Even though my hands weren't as good as those, my legs were so much better.
*  Because a lot of these guys couldn't kick at all.
*  So as long as we were starting at a distance,
*  I could slam my legs into them and they'd just be terrified.
*  Like so many guys just be...
*  They would just try not to get hurt.
*  Because someone can kick and you can't kick.
*  That's a terrible feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  It's terrible.
*  A kick is so much scarier than taking a...
*  Because punches, I feel like...
*  Like you're getting into a fistfight.
*  If someone fucking kicks you in a fistfight, I'm done.
*  I'm getting whooped.
*  It's so painful.
*  There's so much mass in the leg.
*  And they're so heavy.
*  You don't realize how hard it is until you get hit.
*  Even just kidding, hitting the arm.
*  It fucking sucks so bad.
*  When someone slams their shin into your arm, you're like,
*  Motherfucker.
*  It sucks, dude.
*  But when I was boxing with dudes, I was getting lit up.
*  And I was like, I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  I'm gonna get a kick.
*  Like when someone closes the distance on you, you don't know what you do with your hands.
*  You don't know how to protect yourself.
*  You don't know where the punches are coming from.
*  You're not used to it.
*  And you have to get used to it.
*  And the only way to get used to it is to learn how to actually box.
*  And I didn't know how to actually box until I was like 19 and 20 when I started going to these other gyms.
*  And then when I realized I had these giant holes trying out for Taekwondo, like doing Taekwondo tournaments,
*  I still competed in Taekwondo, but less.
*  I wasn't excited about it anymore because I realized like this is if I want to be a complete martial artist,
*  like I want to follow like Bruce Lee's teaching, I found a hole in my game.
*  I have to patch that shit up.
*  There's a whole part that I thought I knew how to do and I didn't.
*  I know how to punch things like I could punch things hard.
*  But you think that's boxing until someone pops you with a double jab left hook.
*  Pop, pop, pop.
*  And you're like, oh, no.
*  What is this nonsense?
*  When technique comes to play.
*  What is this lean hand uppercut you just fucking chin me with?
*  Do you think that's also because you're obsessed as a human.
*  You're obsessed with finding the next level of things.
*  So you were leveling up too.
*  Like Taekwondo just became kind of boring to you too.
*  It wasn't that because I still wasn't the best in the country.
*  You know, I'd lost in the finals to the guy who was this Kareem Jabbar, I think his name was.
*  He sounds good.
*  He was good. He was very good.
*  He was the national champion.
*  You know Kareem Jabbars are good.
*  I lost a decision, but I'm telling you, I thought I won that.
*  But there was a lot of wacky decisions in Taekwondo.
*  I mean, I definitely lost a lot of fights.
*  But there was ones that I won that I didn't get the decision.
*  Is it a point system?
*  Yeah, but it's a weird point system.
*  It's very similar to boxing where, you know, you're like, you decide.
*  I never understood, but I love boxing watching my whole life.
*  I don't get, I still don't get boxing scoring when you're like, what?
*  Where do they come up with these numbers?
*  It's just people that aren't good at it.
*  You know, if you had like elite boxing judges, like that's what I used to love about HBO boxing.
*  It's like comedy judges.
*  Harold Letterman used to do the, he used to tell you what the score was.
*  He would tell you what the score was.
*  You know, like so he would say, this is how I have it.
*  You know, I think Rosario has been doing the best work.
*  And he would, you know, break down the fight.
*  It was part of what was fun.
*  But anyway, I wasn't bored with it in that I achieved the highest of heights.
*  It was that I realized it had holes in it, like big holes.
*  Big holes.
*  Big holes.
*  Like if I was in a street fight with one of those boxers and I was in a bar where I couldn't
*  throw a kick, I would be in deep shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Deep shit.
*  And so I learned how to box.
*  But that was right.
*  So like my experience, like I'm no expert.
*  That's my point.
*  Like I'm not a guy who should be explaining like everything that's going on.
*  Yeah, but it's entertaining.
*  That's the, like we talked about before the show, all these NFL guys are mad because Tony
*  Romo got a $17 million contract and they're way better than him on the field than he ever
*  was on the field.
*  A lot of these guys are getting paid way less than this dude was.
*  And they're like, how the fuck is this dude getting paid?
*  And he's just talking.
*  Yeah, and he's just chatting.
*  Well, that's what makes guys like Neon Sanders, Neon Dion, be so flamboyant because that's
*  where you get money outside of just playing.
*  Well, and the truth is guys like Romo, he does have, and this is something that you
*  would share, his acumen for the game is so strong, but his also like his opinions are
*  so real that he's not trying to save a job.
*  A lot of times these announcers, they're trying to just save a job.
*  You know, they're like doing the right thing.
*  They're being safe.
*  Yes, they're toeing the line.
*  Boring!
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  He'll call out an offense or a defense and say, well, this is why they fucked up that
*  last play.
*  And I think America goes, oh shit, that's great.
*  That's cool to know.
*  Versus someone just going, here's the play and there's the play and that's what happened
*  and okay, here next.
*  I mean, it just gets people get bored of the same kind of announcers.
*  Well, it's also his insight is going to be so much better than anybody who hasn't played
*  the game.
*  He's so keen.
*  He came off the field.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's why in the UFC they do a great job with guys like Michael Bisping, who was a
*  former middleweight champion.
*  He does a lot of commentary now and he's great.
*  DC, DC commenting.
*  Yeah.
*  Dominic Cruz, Paul Felder, who's great at it too.
*  And all these guys that have fought before, especially at the really highest level, maybe
*  even fought some of the guys are doing commentary for, they can give real insight as to things
*  this guy does, what they train for, tendencies.
*  Do any of these ex fighters ever become trainers or coaches?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, a lot of them.
*  Because that's like the thing in the NBA is like become a coach.
*  It's like they all want to become a coach.
*  Not, not as much in the NFL, but NBA specifically.
*  It's big with that.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know what makes me sad when fighters become coaches and then get fat?
*  Well, they all get fat, dude.
*  A lot of them get fat.
*  Not all of them, but a lot of them get fat.
*  I don't want to call anybody out.
*  There's a bunch, there's a bunch in boxing.
*  There's a bunch in MMA.
*  And then you see them and you're like, damn dude, what's going on?
*  You ain't training?
*  I'm eating.
*  Well, when they're done fighting, man, they're just done.
*  Well, because a lot of these athletes, they spend their every waking moment, like not doing the fucked up thing that we all get to do.
*  And so then when they get a break, I think at some point they're like, fuck it, dude.
*  But that was one of the reasons why it's so impressive that a guy like George St. Pierre takes four years off and comes back better than ever, because he never stopped training.
*  Right.
*  Like you really never stop training because he's a martial artist.
*  Right.
*  He's not just a fighter.
*  He fights professionally and he's a world champion, but he's also a martial artist.
*  That's what he is.
*  So he's always training and he trains because he enjoys it.
*  So like when I see a guy like him that takes years off, you see him looks like a fucking Greek god.
*  He's sculpted.
*  You know, it looks perfect.
*  Doesn't look like he's taking a day off out of the gym.
*  Right.
*  He looks as good, if not better than he did when he was the welterweight champion of the world.
*  He looks amazing.
*  But it's more fun.
*  Isn't it more fun, though, to see a guy like.
*  You get fat as fuck.
*  Yeah, like the fear, like the fury fight.
*  Like what a story to tell for a guy to get fat and then thin again.
*  Yeah, but that's different.
*  He's still a fighter.
*  Sure.
*  He had just a depressed moment in his life.
*  But we're talking about guys who become trainers after fighting.
*  Right.
*  And they get fat.
*  That makes me sad because I think they're sad.
*  Well, yeah, but they're also missing out on the thing that they used to get to do.
*  I mean, it's got to be weird to put on a suit as a coach or a trainer or whatever.
*  Put on the proper gear when you're not doing the thing anymore and watching it.
*  You know what?
*  It's like I quit basketball my senior year because I liked partying a lot.
*  And I was like, I say this, I fucking I found drugs and I was like, take it easy, basketball.
*  I just and a friend of mine invited me out.
*  We were getting stoned and he invited me to go to a game because we knew one of the rival school guys who were playing.
*  We want to see him afterwards.
*  And I went and I was baked out of my head, but I was sitting in the bleachers watching them play and a piece of it killed me.
*  I didn't think it was going to affect me because I was like, I'm over basketball.
*  I'm never going to play in college.
*  It was fun while it lasted.
*  I got to move on.
*  But it did kill me, dude.
*  A piece of me was sitting there being like, fuck, this sucks.
*  That like I remember what that felt like that thing.
*  And when I got taken away that when I took it away from myself, it does fuck you up.
*  It's exciting.
*  It stays in your brain.
*  Yeah, you're playing a game.
*  You're trying to win.
*  They're trying to win, too.
*  Yeah, the ball's going there.
*  No, it's over here.
*  I'm going to try to grab it.
*  Pass it to me.
*  Oh, take the shot.
*  Yes.
*  You feel like a hero.
*  Right.
*  It's like you would like you retiring.
*  If you retired from comedy and if you went to see a stand up show, it would eat you alive.
*  Probably unless you were done.
*  Unless you're really done.
*  Are you really going to ever be done?
*  Not me.
*  No, but I don't think.
*  Some people.
*  But who do you know that of the greats that you love and respect are just done at some
*  point?
*  Steve Martin.
*  He's still touring.
*  He's touring right now.
*  Yeah, but not really.
*  He's not doing stand up.
*  He's doing this two man show with Martin Short where I watched it.
*  They do stand up b-bits.
*  But I also think Steve got music.
*  The music bug took over, which to me, still the same parallel.
*  He's still performing.
*  I think the music bug took over.
*  Well, he had it back then.
*  I mean, don't you remember his stand up albums had King Tut, doo doo doo.
*  Yeah, he had a bunch of songs.
*  But now he's like an outright musician.
*  That's all he wants to do.
*  So that to me is still the same.
*  He's doing a different thing.
*  He's doing it differently, but he's still performing.
*  So to me, I always think when someone goes, oh yeah, when I retire, it's like you're never
*  going to fucking retire from comedy unless it tells you you've got to go away.
*  I don't think comedy, I don't think we ever quit.
*  I think it just, you know, like, wrinkles.
*  Well, the thing is if you can still do it, why would you stop?
*  You know how fun it is?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, we talked about this before.
*  I feel bad for people who can't kill.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  You've never felt that?
*  Yeah.
*  You go on stage in the OR and just rock the house.
*  It's the best feeling in the world.
*  And when you got a new punch line, bam, and it hits, boom.
*  When you know it's coming, too, the way it feels.
*  And you see people happy.
*  You look out, it's all these smiles.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody's having a good time.
*  Right.
*  Everybody's happy.
*  You feel that.
*  You feel like you're making people feel good.
*  Yeah, that's why I think it's hard.
*  It'd be really hard to quit.
*  It's like a sad, it'd be a sad, a sad moment to like give that up.
*  You know when they say when a guy retires, that's when he dies sometimes?
*  My old man retired, it's different, dude.
*  His lust for life is a little bit different now.
*  He's going through waves.
*  He's getting better, but it's weird, man.
*  It just feels like he's a people person.
*  He wants to be around people.
*  And now that he doesn't have that anymore, I'm like, go get a fucking shitty job at a
*  clothing store or something.
*  Go get a bullshit job so you can talk to people.
*  Because being at the house is miserable.
*  He doesn't do shit all day.
*  He watches Fox News and eats beef jerky.
*  And I'm like, get the fuck out of the house, dude.
*  Dude Fox News is designed for old people.
*  It's on loop.
*  It's on loop in the living room.
*  So many old people when I go over to their house, they're watching Fox News.
*  Fox News, man.
*  White men over 60, it's mandatory.
*  They watch Fox News and shake their head.
*  I can't believe these libs.
*  I can't believe them.
*  See?
*  Lock her up.
*  Lock her up.
*  What are they trying to sneak in?
*  I don't believe them.
*  I don't trust them.
*  They run out of so much material.
*  Sometimes when I come home to my parents' house and they've run out of material to talk
*  about on Fox News and they start getting really heavy into pop culture, that's when it makes
*  me laugh.
*  They're like, did you see what Ariana Grande was doing the other day?
*  This is when they're out of shit.
*  They got nothing to talk about.
*  They're empty at some point.
*  Well, then you have guys like, these shows are opinion shows as much as they are news
*  shows.
*  They're mostly opinion shows.
*  Yeah.
*  A big part of it is opinion.
*  It's just such a weird time, man.
*  What's really interesting to me, too, is if a liberal goes on Fox News, they get a ton
*  of shit.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like any of the presidential candidates that have been on Fox News, I think Yang, I know
*  Bernie's been on Fox News, and I think Tulsi's definitely been on Fox News as well.
*  Yeah.
*  And people just get real mad at them.
*  Yeah, because there's this thing.
*  What are you doing over there?
*  Yeah.
*  Talking to those propagandists.
*  Those fascists.
*  It's like the way that people talk about you is really funny when they label you with something.
*  And oh, there's our boy.
*  What's Joe Biden doing?
*  What happened?
*  There's our bud.
*  Oh, Biden was there, too.
*  Look at him.
*  See, I just wonder about his skin.
*  That they're pulling it back with fishing wire to keep it up on his head?
*  He seems oddly stiff.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  It seems like everything's pulled.
*  Like, there's not a...
*  I expect a certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain age, particularly
*  around the forehead area.
*  I'm just not seeing it.
*  I'm not seeing any movement either, which makes me wonder about that.
*  I want to see expressions in your forehead.
*  My worry is his lack.
*  He has a very big...
*  He lacks the ability to have a cohesive story.
*  He's not good at being...
*  Have you ever seen him talking to the kids by the pool?
*  It's the weirdest fucking clip.
*  Talking about his hairy legs.
*  What the fuck?
*  He's like to a bunch of little black kids.
*  He's like, and the black kids would come up and they'd see my hair go up and bubbles
*  come up.
*  They touch my hairy legs.
*  What the fuck?
*  I just think his brain is...
*  He's losing a lot of...
*  I tweeted something this morning because someone put up a video of models on a runway on a
*  catwalk and they're all tripping and falling in the same spot, these dumb shoes they're
*  wearing.
*  And I was like, this is Biden's brain cells.
*  It's like they think they're on the right path until they get to this spot and then
*  they just can't fucking...
*  Did you see the thing that he was talking about?
*  God creating women?
*  No.
*  And then...
*  He called his wife his sister or some shit.
*  Created by the you know...
*  I forget what it was.
*  I forget what the gaff was.
*  But it was one of those...
*  We listened to him.
*  We're like, what are you saying?
*  It's like he has no brakes.
*  His car is going down the hill.
*  It's like, ah, jeez, I hit a fucking tree.
*  He's like, hit the wall.
*  Fuck it.
*  There it is.
*  Can't remember the word creator.
*  Refers to God as the thing.
*  Hey, actually, I'm not sure if you're listening to this.
*  Hey, actually, I like that more.
*  That's funny.
*  You know what I think?
*  I have a different take on it.
*  Let's play it.
*  I have a different take on it.
*  Because when I listened to it, I said, oh, I know what he's doing.
*  Which one do you think it is?
*  The bottom one.
*  The second one.
*  He doesn't want to...
*  Here, let's play.
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
*  All men and women created by the...
*  You know the thing.
*  Stop.
*  Pause.
*  You can't be president.
*  What?
*  Stop.
*  Pause.
*  Pause.
*  Listen, we can't play any games here, folks.
*  This is a really old man who can't talk.
*  This is not a joke.
*  Like that right now.
*  You know the thing?
*  Play that again.
*  Play that again.
*  This should get you into a mental hospital.
*  They should be like, hey, Joe, you all right?
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
*  All men and women created by the...
*  You know the thing.
*  He had three strokes while he was saying that.
*  The first one, what was that word?
*  Self-evident?
*  Is that what he said?
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
*  It didn't sound right.
*  He'll hear it again.
*  Let's do it.
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
*  Self-evident.
*  Self-evident.
*  Self-evident.
*  He's drunk.
*  That dude's either drunk or he can't talk.
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
*  He shouldn't be doing this anymore.
*  Self-evident.
*  And then he says, when he goes, he could have just said all men and women are created, and
*  he could have just said equal and gotten out of there and been like, fuck it, and instead
*  he goes, the thing.
*  I think he didn't want to say the creator because there's a lot of people...
*  The religious thing.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people that would say, well, what are you trying to say?
*  Do you believe in evolution or not?
*  Are you a science denier, Joe Biden?
*  Joe Biden's a science denier.
*  That's it.
*  But that's part of the problem with all these...
*  My biggest beef with anybody in the Democratic Party when you watch these debates is they
*  all want to say the thing that they really feel, but they're tiptoeing because they're
*  scared out of their fucking minds of someone going, oh, did you...
*  Warren just said, see?
*  And she's not...
*  She's anti-trans because she referred to...
*  They're waiting for them to fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they're making people behave the way they would like them to behave.
*  They're forcing compliance.
*  Right.
*  Meanwhile, Trump is just like, trans fags, I don't care, fuck them all.
*  He doesn't give a shit.
*  We were trying to find it yesterday.
*  Did you find that thing for Titania McGrath?
*  God, I love that dude.
*  He's awesome.
*  God damn him.
*  Every day.
*  He's a really nice guy too.
*  Yeah.
*  The interview was great, but his perspective on the chaos is so perfect because he just
*  a little bit of how dumb they are and just shows everybody and it says so much.
*  A little dumb tweet says everything you need to know.
*  He tweeted something today that was phenomenal.
*  I was trying to remember what I was looking for because I couldn't find it.
*  There was a series of...
*  It was a tweet in response to a series of tweets about removing a flag that said woman,
*  a noun, a female human.
*  And then people were saying, that's a transphobic dog whistle.
*  You should remove that immediately.
*  And then he's like, that's true.
*  I forget the exact...
*  Females have never been women.
*  Or women have never been females.
*  Female humans.
*  Female humans.
*  It's like...
*  It's so great.
*  You find it...
*  It's real recent.
*  Unless he's tweeting all day every day.
*  And they took down the flag.
*  There's a lot of tweets.
*  It's a response to a picture.
*  Here, I'll show you what I'm looking at.
*  Okay, show me what you're looking at.
*  Where did it start?
*  20 hours, keep going.
*  Oh, this is two days ago maybe.
*  Three days ago or something like that.
*  So you'll see there's a flag in the...
*  That's it.
*  See, first one.
*  Go to the first one.
*  See that?
*  There it is.
*  Look at this.
*  It says, hey, Sefton Council.
*  Flag you're flying at the moment is a hostile transphobic dog whistle.
*  Recognizes a symbol and brand of one of Britain's most outspoken invisible trans antagonists.
*  Excuse me.
*  Antagonists.
*  And the leader of a transphobic hate group.
*  Okay.
*  Well, he might be telling the truth there though.
*  That might be something that really anti-trans people do fly as a flag.
*  Even though it is just the definition of a woman, that might actually be true.
*  It could be.
*  See, the thing is one thing is what it is.
*  What it is is a fact.
*  But if that's something, if it has some logo on it that represents some anti-trans group,
*  does it?
*  Can we find out if it does?
*  We should know.
*  Because it's either one of two things.
*  It's crazy to say that it's transphobic because all it is is the biological scientific definition
*  of a woman.
*  And it's woman empowerment is maybe the initial intention was to be like, women, go women.
*  But underneath it all it might be some fucked up.
*  You can't say go women if it's women versus trans women.
*  You can say go women if it's women versus men.
*  Right.
*  But you can't say go women if it's women versus trans women because trans women are women.
*  You know what I say to women, Joe?
*  I say get back in the kitchen.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  You probably do say that.
*  That's where you belong.
*  You do say that.
*  Yeah, that's what I say.
*  Fucking terrible.
*  So find out if that flag actually is the flag from a hate group.
*  Because if there was a transphobic, let's imagine not someone who's like, hey, I don't
*  think trans women should fight biological women and not tell them that they used to
*  be a man for 30 years, which is my position.
*  This is what got me called transphobic.
*  That's not really transphobic because I really don't care if you're trans.
*  I'm happy for you.
*  If it makes you feel better to be a woman or better to transition to a man, congratulations.
*  Really.
*  As an adult.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But there are groups out there that don't like trans people, like literally don't like
*  them and think that they're all insane and then they all should be committed to mental
*  institutions and that they should never call them by their female name.
*  You should never treat them like they're a woman.
*  Maybe that was the head of that group.
*  That's a different perspective.
*  But it was a council.
*  He was tweeting at a government building, which is why I have a hard time believing
*  that that's the angle.
*  That's why I'm like, who put the flag up?
*  Where'd the flag come from?
*  Clifton Council.
*  You click on that Clifton Council and see whom they are.
*  But that's the problem is like, look, like there's a difference though.
*  There is.
*  But also, do you think, do you think that that it just blankly, do you think that was
*  the intention of that flag?
*  I think most likely if I was going to fly a flag that said woman noun, a biological
*  female, I was saying that a biological male is not a woman.
*  That's probably what I was saying.
*  Sure.
*  Depends on why they're saying it.
*  Are they saying it because these trans women are encroaching on female spaces like female
*  sports or are they saying it because they don't think it's morally right for someone
*  to transition to become a woman?
*  I mean, why are they saying it?
*  That's the question.
*  It's not what it is because what it is is inarguable.
*  Yes, that's what a woman is.
*  The question is, do you think that a trans woman is the same as a biological woman in
*  terms of like the respect they deserve and whether or not you should treat them in a
*  friendly manner?
*  Right.
*  Whether or not, or whether you should discriminate them or be allowed to discriminate against
*  them.
*  That's where it gets weird, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think I hear all this stuff and I just, I think about that asteroid that's
*  supposed to come and I'm like, hurry up.
*  I don't really give a fuck anymore.
*  I'm just fucking-
*  We got through the black plague.
*  Let's go.
*  You don't think we'll get through trans people?
*  No, no.
*  We'll be fine.
*  No, I'm saying we don't, all this nonsense, I think global warming is going to be good
*  for us.
*  I think we deserve to get out of here for a little while.
*  What are you talking about?
*  I think the earth needs to start from scratch.
*  I think we need to get fucked off this planet and the earth needs to start again without
*  us.
*  I think we're getting too heavy.
*  Or someone sounds like a quitter.
*  Yeah, I'm out.
*  Hey, hey, I'm done.
*  You sound like a quitter.
*  I'm done.
*  I'm done.
*  The real problem is people trying to get people to comply with their perspective and not recognizing
*  other people's perspectives and then being like militant about supporting their side.
*  Yeah, but like, look, an educated person is cool with almost everyone doing what they
*  want, what they please, right?
*  So what we're really doing is saying most educated people would go, do you care about
*  trans?
*  I'd go, I hope they're fucking happy.
*  I don't care.
*  I don't care what anybody wants to do as long as it makes them happy and that's a part of
*  their life that they choose to do, that no one's forced them to do, then I hope that
*  they're happy.
*  Why would I care?
*  I think only uneducated people have a tough time accepting somebody else's needs or wants
*  to be what society doesn't deem the norm.
*  More insecure.
*  Yeah, because if you're fucking educated, you have other things to think about and to
*  worry about.
*  Are there just educated people that are bigots?
*  Sure, sure, but I do think it's more rare.
*  Yeah, I think so too, but I think there's a lot of really kind people that aren't educated.
*  I think really it's just...
*  Or ignorant perhaps.
*  Maybe that's the thing.
*  Maybe there's a lot of...
*  Okay, so let's say this.
*  There's members of my family or friends or people that we know, quite educated, who are
*  ignorant towards people so they've never met a trans person, so they're a little weary
*  of them perhaps.
*  It doesn't mean they hate them.
*  Yeah.
*  It means they might go, I don't know, man, I've never fucking seen one.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Well, let's be honest.
*  Before people felt real comfortable and they still don't really, but they're more comfortable
*  now, I think, coming out than they ever were before.
*  Yeah, people should feel comfortable.
*  There wasn't that many, but my point is there wasn't that many of them.
*  Like when we were kids, how many trans kids were in your high school?
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  Yeah, but also there probably were kids that wanted to be trans.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  They just societally had this weird bar on them that was like, hmm.
*  That's what's weird.
*  It's like that bar has been lifted in some ways.
*  How many more bars are going to get lifted?
*  That's my whole thing too.
*  What else is next?
*  Foxkin, people that are... they think they're animals.
*  Yeah, but I'm cool with that.
*  Do you know about all that?
*  I went to high school with some kids that thought they were animals for sure.
*  There's always a kid that wears ears and prances through the hallway.
*  Yeah, furries.
*  They're furries now.
*  And people are like, Mikey's funny, man.
*  You just gotta let him fly.
*  If they get together, they have a good time.
*  You know, like those furry conventions.
*  Right, I've seen them before.
*  They get together, they're having a good time.
*  But that's always sexual.
*  It always turns into a... it's never like a... we just do this because this is how we
*  feel.
*  It's like we like to fuck in costumes.
*  That's what it is.
*  Yeah, and you take a peek as Woody the Woodpecker doll is about to fuck you.
*  You look at his herpes-ridden dick, like what is going on?
*  Is this a personal experience?
*  Oh, there's a person under there.
*  All sweaty with staph infections and shit.
*  Imagine the perfect job for one of those kids in high school that wanted to be an animal
*  is a mascot for a sporting team.
*  That's like the most...
*  They're just in there jerking off in between.
*  There's all these guys running around.
*  Everybody's going crazy.
*  Nobody knows who you really are under there.
*  You can dance around, act silly.
*  It's probably hot as fuck in there though.
*  So we talked about this.
*  I went to a basketball game when I got home the other day and I was like, I wonder how
*  much they make.
*  I wonder if they only do it because it's a free trip to the game because there's no way
*  you can't make a lot of money doing it.
*  I can't imagine.
*  I would imagine you don't make a lot of money.
*  First of all, you're replaceable.
*  You just put that head on somebody else's body and no one's even going to know.
*  We're done with you, Dave.
*  Why?
*  Dance around.
*  I'm going to hire my nephew instead.
*  Well, whenever there's a mascot, like Ronald McDonald, you're like, hmm.
*  Yeah, why?
*  Yeah, and I remember there was some McDonald's, maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly, but
*  didn't they used to have McDonald's?
*  You can meet Ronald McDonald at some McDonald's?
*  He used to be, yeah.
*  The figure himself was at charity events a lot.
*  But there's a guy dressed up like him?
*  Is that what it was?
*  Yeah, but it wouldn't be at the location just on a random day.
*  There was always like, the Ronald McDonald house was a children's sponsorship and they
*  would do like, you know, they would do a lot of events.
*  He was out a little bit more.
*  But it's almost like a Santa Claus type deal.
*  Totally.
*  I mean, if Ronald McDonald asked for too much money, they'd be like, bitch, nobody knows
*  what you really look like.
*  Let's get a new Ronald.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Why don't we use the same nose?
*  Yeah, we got Ronald in Kansas is way better than you do.
*  We're shipping him in.
*  Tom's nose is the same size as your nose.
*  Right.
*  You don't even have to switch the little red thing.
*  Mascots for fast food is very interesting.
*  I've never even thought about that, why that exists.
*  Burger King never had one.
*  It's for kids.
*  They're roping kids in.
*  But why Wendy's has Wendy?
*  Yeah, cute little girl.
*  Makes you want to go there and get a burger.
*  Taco Bell has Alejandro.
*  You know him.
*  Do you know him?
*  Alejandro the Taco?
*  No.
*  No, it's not a real thing.
*  He had a little dog for a while.
*  Taco Bell had a little dog.
*  What was his name?
*  You know, that's a comic.
*  No, that's a comedian that does that voice.
*  Is it?
*  Carlos Equaziri?
*  Is that his?
*  I don't know how to say his name.
*  The guy from Reno 911?
*  He did it?
*  Yeah, the Yoquero Taco Bell.
*  Carlos Equaziri.
*  Look that up to make sure that I'm not fucking out of my head.
*  But yeah, he did that campaign.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, the Yoquero Taco Bell.
*  Yeah, but Burger King never had one.
*  They didn't need one.
*  Huh?
*  They got the King.
*  Remember they have all those commercials of them.
*  He just doesn't talk.
*  Yeah, he doesn't say anything.
*  He's not really like a fake.
*  He's just like a symbol more than anything.
*  I guess Wendy's didn't talk much either.
*  What was your fat out?
*  Dave Thomas though.
*  He was the creator.
*  I mean that's from Columbus so I know a lot about it.
*  Wendy's would be from Columbus.
*  We had White Castle.
*  That was our trash as a kid.
*  That's also a headquarter.
*  It's interesting if you have someone like In-N-Out that doesn't, they don't do fast
*  food.
*  It's not really fast food.
*  I mean it's pretty fast but it's way better.
*  It's medium fast.
*  They actually cook it right there.
*  When you get it it's just way better.
*  By far.
*  It's not even close.
*  So if you go by Burger King and you see the drive-in there might be one person there.
*  You go by In-N-Out, that motherfucker's around the block.
*  Never not.
*  It's never not packed.
*  There's always a line.
*  It's because it's a better product.
*  But how come everybody else doesn't go, hey I got an idea.
*  Why don't we make it better?
*  Did you watch the founder movie?
*  Yeah, that's why.
*  The founder?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  About how they made it just, it was about speed.
*  Because McDonald's became a production line and they learned that shipping burgers frozen
*  was way more efficient and they lost less product and they also cost them nothing.
*  In-N-Out was willing to take a hit because they were a family run business and they were
*  like there's only a few locations will do better product for a little bit higher of
*  a price and not franchise it yet.
*  Because now you can only franchise it if you're a member of their family.
*  You know that?
*  Good.
*  They get it up.
*  Whatever they're doing.
*  Yeah, no.
*  You can only buy, you can only open a franchise if you are an extended member of the original
*  family.
*  I'm happy.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's great.
*  They keep it that way.
*  They're great.
*  Because if they went the other way it would go to shit.
*  I mean dude, you get raw onions on a double-double.
*  Like, woo, son.
*  It's the best.
*  It's so good.
*  It is the best.
*  It's just, but the thing about it is there's nothing comparable.
*  Like there's no one else is doing it except Five Guys.
*  There's no one else is doing it like that.
*  Don't just shake your fucking head at Five Guys.
*  I don't like Five Guys.
*  You guys can take a walk.
*  No, dude.
*  How dare you both.
*  But Fat Burger is a sit-down restaurant in Southern California.
*  That's like a sit-down.
*  Fat Burger is pretty good.
*  And Wada Burger and Fat Burger are on the same level to me.
*  They're like, you sit down when you eat.
*  Nobody drives through Fat Burger.
*  That's true, but maybe Fat Burger should be on that list.
*  Burger stands are a thing here that really don't exist a lot of places.
*  There are a lot of still small places.
*  But here's the thing.
*  How come Fat Burger doesn't have the kind of clientele base that In-N-Out does?
*  Like there's a Fat Burger.
*  That's what it is?
*  Yeah, but I would also argue.
*  Why don't they know about drive-thrus?
*  Why wouldn't they have a drive-thrus?
*  But I bet you, I bet you, I bet you it has a lot to do with strategic locations as well.
*  I bet you In-N-Out puts itself in places where they know they're going to have.
*  No, there's a Fat Burger right up here on Ventura.
*  It's in a great spot.
*  And it usually gets a few people in there.
*  But I'm saying it's never got the kind of lines.
*  But he's right.
*  It's a drive-thrus thing.
*  The other thing is Fat Burger, they do the same thing.
*  They cook it right then when you order it.
*  I don't really do it.
*  I don't do it.
*  If I'm going to get out of the house and eat one of those, I'm going to have In-N-Out.
*  It's the only one I will really go to.
*  Fat Burger's pretty good.
*  And I don't like that.
*  I don't like Five Guys is not a drive-thrus either.
*  That's a fucking...
*  What's the one that came to LA everyone freaked out?
*  Steak and Shake.
*  Shake Shack.
*  No.
*  Because it came from New York.
*  Shake Shack.
*  That's it.
*  They had a huge line for like months.
*  Pass.
*  It's okay.
*  But it's like a gourmet version of all...
*  Is it?
*  It's a gourmet?
*  Is that good?
*  Yeah, a gourmet chef made it all right.
*  Isn't that the place that was in Ohio that was outside of the Funny Bone?
*  No.
*  What was that place?
*  Probably some local Columbus place.
*  That's how you really want to get diarrhea.
*  That's some Shack thing.
*  Some Shake Shack or Steak.
*  Oh, Steak and Shake.
*  Steak and Shake?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's it.
*  Okay.
*  See, my fucking dumbass had those two like...
*  Oh, it's that one.
*  My dumbass had those two connected.
*  That's not even a hamburger.
*  Those are technically steak patties or steak burgers.
*  I don't...
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, it's like an old...
*  This chili with spaghetti.
*  Is that Skyline Chili?
*  That's a Cincinnati thing.
*  Yeah, but they have that in Columbus as well.
*  Yeah, yeah, all over Ohio.
*  That's all over the Midwest.
*  Wisconsin does that.
*  Chili with spaghetti.
*  They do it up here.
*  Pretty goddamn good when you're drunk.
*  Oh, dude, go to Chili John's here in the Valley.
*  You never heard of Chili John's?
*  No.
*  They do that on...
*  You know Chili John's in Burbank?
*  You never heard of it?
*  That's what they do.
*  There was a guy from the Midwest.
*  He put one over there.
*  There's a few places...
*  I'm on a colon cleanse.
*  ...that you hear about when you're like, oh, that's real?
*  Like that...
*  I don't know if there's a 24-hour steakhouse in downtown LA.
*  What?
*  Pacific Dining Cart.
*  It's like a legit 24-hour steakhouse.
*  You and I can go there tonight at 4 in the morning...
*  Let's fucking go.
*  ...and get a legit steak, like a fucking bone-in ribeye, medium rare, mashed potatoes with
*  the fucking sour cream and chives, kid.
*  How come I never heard of this before?
*  What the fuck?
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't eaten at it.
*  I've eaten at the one in Santa Monica.
*  Save.
*  The writers...
*  I don't fucking...
*  I don't remember which show it was on.
*  I forgot which writer told me about this.
*  But it was quite a few years back, and I looked into it.
*  There's a 24-hour Pacific Dining Cart in downtown LA.
*  24 hours.
*  You're the only guy I've ever had steak with at 1.30 in the morning.
*  You're the only dude of my whole life.
*  Thirty-six years I've been on the earth, and you're the only guy that we go on tour together.
*  It'll be me and you, and we'll be late night, and you'll go, you're hungry?
*  And I'll go, yeah.
*  But usually I'll go, I'll just, you know, whatever, eat something small and quick.
*  You're like, let's go get a big fuck-off steak.
*  And we will.
*  Well, the good thing about going to big cities like New York or Chicago, there's always some
*  weird spot that serves food real late.
*  Four o'clock in the morning, the kitchen's open till three.
*  You're like, really?
*  And if we call and they're like, I'm like, I'm coming with Joe.
*  They're like, okay, we're open.
*  We're open.
*  We just reopened.
*  We closed, but we reopened.
*  That's very nice.
*  It's been great.
*  Yeah.
*  That was Dallas, right?
*  Didn't we do something like that in Dallas?
*  What's in Dallas?
*  Dude, the days, I'm bad with that over where.
*  Woo!
*  Late night steak after a fucking great show.
*  Nice.
*  No, it is the best.
*  Late night eating has changed.
*  Comedy will change the way you eat.
*  It's so funny when you're young in comedy, you eat a certain way because you don't have
*  any fucking money.
*  And then when you get along in your career, you get to eat better and you eat so different.
*  Your hours change.
*  It's so weird.
*  Like when people ask me what time I eat lunch or breakfast, I'm like, all that shit is depending
*  on where I am and where I'm going.
*  People say it's not good to eat late at night.
*  And I think really it's just food.
*  I think the real problem is eating too much food.
*  So when I eat late at night, I don't eat the next day until like one in the afternoon or
*  later.
*  I don't eat breakfast most of the time if I eat late at night.
*  I get up and I work out.
*  I do something.
*  I might not eat until two or three in the afternoon.
*  Right.
*  Don't they say it's what you eat?
*  It's not when you eat.
*  I mean if you eat and then just go to sleep, that's not the best.
*  Really, you should be moving around.
*  Your body could probably digest things better.
*  But the real problem is what you eat.
*  When you're out on the road, man, it's so easy to eat bullshit.
*  I know.
*  It's so easy to fuck off and start eating candy and eat whatever nonsense trail mix
*  you see at the fucking...
*  There's bullshit everywhere.
*  Yeah, you could pretend the trail mix is nutritious because it's got nuts in it.
*  Right.
*  It's got M&Ms.
*  You just ate three bags of M&Ms though.
*  You ate so many M&Ms.
*  Then some of them have chocolate chips in them.
*  Yeah.
*  Even better.
*  That's the best version.
*  That's not good for you.
*  That stuff's good for you.
*  No, especially because when I go on the road, I like the sauce.
*  If I go to a bar, I'm going to have the sauce and I'm going to have a couple of wings.
*  It's a part of the thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just so hard to not do that.
*  Especially after you're tired.
*  See, the thing about those shows too is especially when we have nights where we do two shows,
*  you're fucking cooked after those.
*  Yeah, you're tired.
*  You put out a lot of energy and there's a lot of concentration involved.
*  There's a lot of anticipation.
*  Then when they're over, and then you're like, fuck, I'm hungry.
*  Because if we do two shows, that means we're going to do an eight and a 10.
*  The 10 is over at midnight-ish.
*  We're going to eat somewhere around one.
*  That means we're not eating between...
*  I won't eat two hours before a show.
*  That means I ate at six.
*  Right.
*  So it's like seven, eight hours later, you're fucking starving.
*  You're ravaged.
*  You're starving.
*  Last time we did that, when me, you and Tony were eating, we ate at 4.30, we had dinner.
*  It's like Austin fucking geriatrics eating dinner and then 1.30 in the morning.
*  But if you do that, you get real fuel for the show.
*  Eating right before a show is the kiss of death.
*  Can't do it.
*  Yeah, it just slows you down too much.
*  It slows you down too much.
*  It gets too heavy.
*  It gets too heavy.
*  And I'm trying to be more focused on like when I get to the hotel, I just go right to the gym.
*  Yup, that's what you got to do.
*  It's so painful, man.
*  But it's a thing you have to do like this is what I do.
*  I don't have an option.
*  It goes jerk to the gym.
*  If you give yourself an option, you'll fuck off.
*  You're fucked.
*  Well, I used to just get to the hotel, jerk off, and then nap.
*  Every single time I'd go, I'm going to nap, and jerk off.
*  There's no way I'm not going to do this.
*  And now I jerk off in the gym.
*  The other thing is I always have phone calls that I have to make or emails I have to answer.
*  And if I start fucking around with those things, it could be an hour later and then I watch a YouTube video.
*  Is that real?
*  Then I have to Google it.
*  How the fuck?
*  And the next thing you know, I'm down a rabbit hole and it's an hour and a half later.
*  I'll tell myself, yeah, but I think I've got a good bit of this fucking...
*  This praying mantis bit is going to kill.
*  These Mongols with their flying eagles that they use to kill wolves.
*  I think there's something in that.
*  But it does do.
*  Sometimes you do get such a good bit from going down these stupid little wormholes for no reason.
*  Yeah.
*  How did people ever even write jokes in the 80s?
*  I don't even know how I did it.
*  You know, there was...
*  There was so much more observational humor.
*  There was so much more observational humor.
*  That's like the Seinfeld era of like, by the bus you get on a bus, you get in a train.
*  That's why airplane jokes got quote unquote played out because it was like that's all people had.
*  There was no fucking internet.
*  They weren't walking around with the internet in their pocket.
*  And comics would always talk about airplanes because they were always traveling.
*  So it would be hotel, room service, knock knock, do not disturb, like all these things.
*  What does do not disturb mean in Spanish?
*  Illo will.
*  The maid comes in.
*  I'm coming.
*  We're all coming.
*  Yeah.
*  Woo.
*  I know it sounds like we're shitting on Seinfeld.
*  Like I'm doing an impression of Jerry, but I'm not.
*  No.
*  Just the idea.
*  That era was like there was limited subject matter.
*  There was limited things to talk about.
*  Do you think that bubble, that comedy bubble from then is the same as now or now is bigger?
*  I don't think the bubble's the same.
*  I think the bubble that people had in the 80s is like people were just falling in love with stand up comedy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this is what we have to realize.
*  And this is where it's really crazy.
*  It's really hard to imagine.
*  But this is true.
*  When you think about the bubble, let's go back to 1980 and stand up comedy and Jerry Seinfeld, please welcome this guy and that guy and all these different comics that were really popular in in the 80s.
*  That was only 40 years ago.
*  OK.
*  So you go 40 years before them.
*  You have nothing.
*  You have no stand up.
*  Right.
*  I mean, you literally have jokes.
*  You have guys who do emcee work at different clubs that bring up a band and then they'll do like the Don Rickles thing.
*  They'll pick on guys in the audience.
*  And then Lenny Bruce comes along in the 50s in the late late 50s and the 60s.
*  And Lenny Bruce gets arrested a bunch of times for talking, for explaining things, for talking about how he really sees things for using words that are forbidden for talking about subject matter.
*  He does a different thing.
*  Nobody had done that before.
*  This is new thing.
*  And then Mort Sahl does like political humor.
*  And then George Carlin changes from being this like Johnny Carson type seven minutes set on late night TV guy with a suit on to being this hippie who talks about the dirty words you can't use on television, the seven dirty words.
*  Yeah.
*  And everything shifted.
*  But that that didn't happen that long ago.
*  So in the 1980s, people still didn't understand what it was.
*  So a guy would go on stage and he looked like a comedian.
*  So he assumed he was a comedian because he knew how to talk like a comedian.
*  He's like, what's going on?
*  What is this wild kingdom taking place in my house?
*  I got a cat.
*  I got a mouse.
*  Let's get them together.
*  Like there was comedy that wasn't really comedy.
*  It's like they were almost like premise merchants and they never figured out how to bring it to real comedy.
*  They just had a bunch of tricks and a bunch of like.
*  Half duct tape premises, but they sounded like a comedian.
*  I mean, I told my wife, if that's what you need to do, you go right ahead.
*  And then everybody laughs really hard, but they get like that.
*  There's a rhythm going on.
*  They think they should go along with it.
*  Those guys get into the workplace, right?
*  They become part of the ecosystem and they actually had like careers.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're being but their boats start taking water and they drive.
*  They're driving.
*  They're driving.
*  Yeah.
*  But their boats start taking water and they drown and they all sink and they all went away.
*  If you go back to those days of the 80s, the early 90s, there was like a whole bunch of comedians that were doing some weird thing where they were like mimicking the sound of stand up comedians and talking about things that comedians talk about.
*  But they were missing like, you know, and you have cement, you got to add a bunch of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you only had three of those things, you just get this.
*  What is this?
*  Yeah, it doesn't sound like they have missing something.
*  That was a different boom.
*  That was like people didn't know what comedy was like.
*  We're going to go see some comedy.
*  We're at the local comedy hut and here comes the guy with the tie and the rolled up sleeves.
*  Hey, now they're obsessed.
*  Now it's an obsession.
*  Now comedies become like this.
*  The fandom, I think, is something that I can't articulate.
*  It's wild to watch like definitely different.
*  It's just I mean, you've seen way more than I have in that sense.
*  But even when I first started in comedy, I just the fandom wasn't the same.
*  It wasn't people didn't lose it like they do now when they meet all of these comics and go see them live.
*  I think it's a good thing.
*  It's just wild to see it's become bigger than stand up a little bit.
*  I mean, it's a weird thing.
*  It's a weird thing for sure.
*  But I think one of the things is different is how prolific the comics of today are and how much stuff they're putting out.
*  If you look at a guy like Burr or Ali Wong or I mean, look at anybody who wrecked Segura, someone who regularly cranks out really good specials.
*  Like the output's incredible.
*  Yeah, no, it's way stronger.
*  Every two years or so, they're putting out this murderous new special and they're constantly working at it.
*  And that just didn't happen before.
*  And Binder was talking to me about that.
*  Binder is doing that documentary on the comic store.
*  We were talking about how he was saying that those days people didn't work that hard.
*  They had one special maybe and then the next special would be years later if they had ever one ever had one again and they would have material that just was tried and true and they would stick with it.
*  And he's like, I come in here and I see these guys just constantly cranking over and turning over new material.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just it's a different kind of thing.
*  And the like those guys that I was talking about that were around before that kind of sounded like comedians, but they were missing something.
*  You know what they're really missing?
*  Embracing it as an art form.
*  They were using it as a way to try to get a sitcom.
*  They were using it as a way to try to get fame and to try to get success.
*  But they weren't in love with the idea of being an artist.
*  They were in love with the idea of crafting a new bit and trying it and tweaking it and getting it going and making it happen.
*  What am I doing wrong? What am I doing right?
*  What's I do more of?
*  What's I do less of?
*  And then putting it all together in this fucking like you're using alchemy, man.
*  You got a sorcerer's hat on.
*  You're mixing this bitch together to boom.
*  All of a sudden it gets this big giant laugh like you've conjured up some magic.
*  Yeah. You can get that big pop.
*  Yeah. The chemistry is unbelievable when it works.
*  Also, when you say a joke one different way and you're like fuck and it doesn't go the way that it's supposed to go.
*  I do that all the time on purpose and ruin jokes just to see if it gives me anxiety.
*  I'm like fuck. Why did I rearrange the words?
*  But you have to think you have a certain number of sets, right?
*  If you don't rearrange the words sometimes, you don't know that magic spot.
*  Like you missed the magic spot.
*  You know it's like you ever accidentally almost give your missus the old one and the old bumhole because you're looking for the spot and you missed the spot.
*  And you're like hey.
*  Well that's what I tell her. I go I suppose on accident.
*  Whoops.
*  Nah. It was purpose.
*  Oh my god.
*  Oh Zayman.
*  You shouldn't say that on the internet.
*  No. I don't let her listen to stuff.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah. She's not going to listen to anything.
*  She stays in her cage.
*  Jamie don't laugh at that. That's not funny dude. Okay.
*  Don't let that. That is not funny.
*  I keep her where she belongs.
*  You know what Jamie? I think you're allowed to laugh because I don't think he means what he's saying.
*  I think what he's doing is called talking shit.
*  Dead serious.
*  I think he's talking shit and it's confusing.
*  It confuses me sometimes.
*  You're right though that it was more the goal was like could I get a TV special from it or a TV series and now it's changed so much that like.
*  Bro those guys wanted to make it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know they wanted to be in. They wanted to be accepted. They were on the outside and they were hungry and ambitious and then they wanted to make it.
*  Right.
*  And then they got in and when they got in they were you know like Kinnison doing the fucking intro to a John Bon Jovi video that kind of shit.
*  Like you're partying with those guys.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean.
*  They wanted to be.
*  You're in.
*  Fame was so much more appealing back then.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Ladies and gentlemen you know please welcome Sam Kinnison.
*  Right.
*  And he raises his arms and hey ladies and gentlemen hey.
*  You know and sit down on the couch. It's like you're famous.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that's what people wanted.
*  They wanted they wanted to be the famous guy who did shows and you did shows like even Jenny.
*  Who was one of my personal favorites who was in my opinion one of the great unheralded comedian.
*  Richard Jenny.
*  Richard Jenny. Yeah.
*  Fucking amazing comic. He hated it man. He didn't want to do the road. He wanted a sitcom. He wanted to be a movie star. He wanted to be Jim Carrey or Tom Cruise or someone on a sitcom. He wanted to be Seinfeld.
*  It's funny because like I do TV sometimes and you give me shit about it all the fucking time.
*  But like it will know it pales in comparison to the way I feel about stand up.
*  But it is something I still love the performance of it.
*  But if you said I had to be gun to my face there's no way I would give up. I mean I just couldn't do it.
*  I mean my goal if if if my ultimate goal if someone's like what is the ultimate goal is to tour for as long as I can to set to crowds that are there to see me.
*  That's to me there is nothing I could do on TV. There's nothing.
*  There's no fucking Quentin Tarantino role I could ever get that would feel as good as being in a room with people that fucking paid money to watch you do it.
*  No way I would give up the other shit in a heartbeat.
*  No of course. But there's nothing wrong with doing the other shit. If you enjoy doing it. I give you a hard time because it's fun to give you a hard time.
*  I know you love you love shitting on me about doing this stuff.
*  Yeah but look I got to curb your enthusiasm with Larry David.
*  That's different. I would never shit on you.
*  That was a pinnacle for my life. Yeah I would I told them I would have paid them money.
*  Only a few times have I been so into a thing where I've been where I push my agents and go I'll fucking I'll lose a lot of money just to have the opportunity to try it.
*  Yeah of course. Like Galifianakis to show baskets on FX. I used to love that show.
*  I mean it's a great show. Not usually but I told I even said I said tell them I will I will do anything.
*  I'll be in the background because I think that show is so fucking good.
*  Did you ever watch it. No I haven't heard. God it was so.
*  I just heard of it just now for the first time.
*  Baskets was a show on FX that Galifianakis created.
*  Oh it's not on anymore?
*  I don't know if they're still doing it. I don't know if it's still on. I'm disconnected right now.
*  I love Zack though. It's just you can't keep up. There's too many things on.
*  That's the problem. I don't know what's on and what's going and what's coming anymore.
*  They're passing by you in the night.
*  Yeah well yeah we're working with like Larry was like one of those moments of making him break. That's what it really is. Making that guy laugh to me was like.
*  Yeah he's Larry David man.
*  He's a beyond. He's a wizard.
*  Yeah he's a guy who I can tell his comedy was perfect for this and not the stage.
*  You know how they talk about how he talks about how he's not a good stand up.
*  Yeah. You can you know why. Do you know what I mean when you meet a comedian immediate comedian and you go I know why you're not a stand up but you're great at this thing.
*  Yeah. That's exactly what he is. He's a genius with this live interactive aspect of acting comedy.
*  He's so good at that and writing the scenes.
*  Thank God he found it man.
*  Yeah it's why he found it.
*  But I but I have seen those tapes of him doing old stand up.
*  Yeah. Yeah I've seen I've seen some clips. He you know different. I bet he made the comics laugh. I bet it was one of those.
*  It was a comics comic for sure.
*  Yeah but if we were in the back of the room we'd be howling. Do you know who's on top of his fucking game right now. David Tell.
*  Yeah I mean.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I don't think I've ever I rarely see him miss.
*  Did you see him at the improv last week.
*  No I watched him and Ross at the store when they were both.
*  Tony and I did did a show at the improv last Wednesday and I tell did the late show. God damn it was good.
*  Yeah. God damn it was good. He was so funny and so silly.
*  Effortless.
*  And it's so it's just it's all silly.
*  Yeah.
*  It's jokes go into jokes go into jokes.
*  He's he hasn't changed you know his sensibilities because of all the woke backlash.
*  It's still balls out comedy really well written stuff really funny and just such a good guy.
*  I think he's reminding everybody we're still comedians.
*  Yeah.
*  We're just comics.
*  Most of us realize that the ones who've backed off you know they're the ones who have like a deep sort of tentacle connection to the business.
*  Yeah.
*  The ones who are like really connected to the business like their executive producing sitcoms and they're a part of this and a part of that.
*  They've backed off the wild shit.
*  Well because they know that they're there.
*  It's a threat to them.
*  You know it's self policing and it's they'll still talk like that in the green room.
*  They'll still make you laugh.
*  But they're scared.
*  You know everyone's scared of getting called out now for jokes which is just I mean I get I get that people haven't.
*  Decided to make this distinction but there's a giant distinction between someone talking about something because this is their actual feelings on something and someone saying ridiculous shit that they don't really believe because it's funny.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you stop that in any way as soon as you try step that for yourself or if you're trying to get someone else to stop it what you're really doing is you're enforcing a particular very narrow band of behavior.
*  Right.
*  If you get stuck in that narrow band of behavior it's real hard to see outside of it.
*  It's real hard to see that this is ridiculous.
*  Right.
*  And as a comic when you see comics getting mad that other comics are touching on certain subjects or using certain language it's like oh you're missing the whole thing.
*  You missed the whole thing.
*  That's a mole.
*  I feel like that's a mole inside of the operation.
*  Someone's like I don't like when he does those that stuff and you're like oh no.
*  I can't believe you're still saying bitch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know the depth of what that word means for people you know what that does.
*  That's my favorite.
*  Do you know what that does.
*  Please tell me chubby white guy.
*  Please tell me.
*  Well that's like there was a dude there's a there's a guy who had a great tweet.
*  I don't want to say his name because you know I don't know if he wants it out or whatever but like he basically had a tweet and he got a lot of backlash from the community because he was like all these East Side comics that used to shit on the comedy store for a lack of quote unquote diversity.
*  They're the same people and he's an East Side guy.
*  He goes as one.
*  I'm saying these are the same guys that get you know that pay no mind to the fact that we're living in a gentrified used to be Mexican neighborhood and our audiences are all fucking white dudes with beards that look the same.
*  And he got a lot of shit.
*  But I was like yeah fuck.
*  I hit him up and I was like yeah you're right though.
*  Like this old idea that the store used to be a it's just a bro bro hang out and it's all there is.
*  It's like dude that line.
*  There's so many different kinds of people on that lineup way more than you see when you go to other shows.
*  The only people that say that are the people that can't work there.
*  It's very simple.
*  It's jealousy.
*  It's 100% jealousy.
*  I mean there's people that think that maybe there's a style that you see at the comedy store that they don't appreciate.
*  That's okay but the styles it varies so much from Jeselnik to Deleah to you to Hinchcliffe to Diaz to Owen Smith.
*  Sklar brother.
*  You're talking about people that this is all over the fucking map.
*  It's all over the map.
*  It's all over the map.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think that's why I love the tweet.
*  Laura Beats or Ali Makovsky.
*  There's so many different sort of styles of comedy out of that place now.
*  Right.
*  You can't say it's all bros.
*  It's nonsense.
*  It's just good comics.
*  That was the old way which I'm glad he was being he was like no.
*  These people are just like free thinking pushing out new weird fucked up sometimes challenging shit because the store supports it.
*  Like that's all it is.
*  It's like now we finally have a place where it's like you could say it there.
*  There's no freedom in suppressing people's ability to express themselves.
*  You just create an environment where everybody's scared to be themselves or everybody's scared to take chances.
*  Right.
*  If you're scared to take chances.
*  Look if you don't push the boundaries you don't find out where they are.
*  You create your own boundaries like you when you're doing material and you're trying to come up with a bit sometimes a bit in the beginning is highly offensive.
*  But then you turn it into something that's everybody accepts and it's great.
*  Right.
*  This was the real argument for Louis CK when Louis CK had a recording of his leaked and there was a bit where he was talking about these kids were survivors of school shootings.
*  He's like you're not interesting just because you push some fat kid in the way like like and you're laughing.
*  See he got a lot of shit for that and people were funny were saying it like it's cruel and other comics said it was hacky and this like first of all he had done comic books.
*  First of all he had done comedy in 10 months.
*  Second of all you know how comedy works.
*  That was a seed.
*  He's working out a plant.
*  He wasn't delivering a fucking origami plant or what's those called the little small ones.
*  What small origami bonds bonds.
*  He was delivering a perfectly trim bonds.
*  I'm like origami.
*  Yeah.
*  Perfectly trim bonds.
*  I see that they sell on the side of the road.
*  Yeah.
*  This was a this is a seed.
*  Right.
*  Because it's already kind of funny that like that these people that are on television all the time the survivors of a school shooting and that they might just be survivors.
*  They don't necessarily have to be interesting.
*  Now he didn't in his defense have any time to prepare.
*  He had 10 months of no stand up.
*  Then he just does stand up and get some laughs off this premise.
*  That premise in six months could have been a fucking nuclear bomb.
*  Right.
*  He would have figured out a way to expose how goofy it is that just because someone survives a massacre we want to parade them on CNN every couple weeks and ask their opinion about gun control and about various things like he's right.
*  But look someone's going to have a fucking great bit about Greta Thunberg.
*  It's the same thing.
*  You got some 16 year old kid that's you know she seems weird to begin with.
*  And then she's on TV going how dare you.
*  And you're like what is this.
*  And then you keep seeing her over and over and over again.
*  Who's putting her on TV over and over and over again.
*  You fucking people are like what are you doing in a lot of ways.
*  It's kind of like why is she interesting because she's 16 and dealing with climate change as opposed to him who's 29 or her who's 50 or him who's 82.
*  Like what are we talking about.
*  She's got some random person who wants to say how dare you about climate change.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're going to they're going to stop going to school till someone does something about it.
*  They're on strike like what is this really.
*  Is this really what's on the news.
*  This is a play for her to get out of going to school.
*  She's like I don't like school.
*  They're like you don't have to if you sail around the world.
*  I just think the whole that whole thing about they find what works for them categorically because she's a good look.
*  Yeah. And they're like push her push her push her push her.
*  See that that's why like when you go back to Louie's bed about the school shootings like yes it's gross to make fun of someone who survived a school shooting.
*  But that's what he does.
*  He does jokes in the moment.
*  You know that he's saying something that's awful that you're not supposed to say so you'll laugh.
*  It's not how he really feels.
*  So for you and comics to pretend that that's how you really feel like that's fucking disgusting what you're doing.
*  Yeah they know.
*  Not only do you know you're being deceptive or you really don't understand comedy in which case you should stop.
*  Just stop doing it because you don't understand it like and you also don't understand the process or you're at least like if I bet if you asked him like is that ready.
*  For Netflix release he'll be like no no way I'm done coming in 10 months.
*  I was hoping that bit would come into something.
*  These are notes he's going off of right.
*  Yeah shit down.
*  He had some ideas trying it out.
*  Finally gets on stage to fuck around with it and somebody records it and puts it on YouTube.
*  Well he's apparently I haven't seen him but from the grapevine I've heard that he's touring he's murder his new hour is murder murdering.
*  And I'm curious to know what or what platform or where he's going to go with it right.
*  He's got to be independent I'm sure.
*  I think he's going to release it on his website.
*  Right because people are too afraid and I can't.
*  He's recording very soon.
*  Oh he is?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Allegedly.
*  Maybe I know some.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Look I want to see it.
*  I want to see it before he records it.
*  But listen I mean we could talk about him till you blew him in the face.
*  Right.
*  And I think you know leave the guy alone.
*  I don't know what happened those nights.
*  I know he has a very different story than the story that's been depicted in the media and I know he definitely did some stupid shit you shouldn't do.
*  Sure.
*  He didn't open any doors.
*  He didn't tell anybody they have to do it.
*  Didn't try to scare anybody.
*  He asked if he could jerk off from some front of people.
*  Is it gross?
*  100 percent.
*  He would say so.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean he has jokes about it.
*  Right.
*  You know.
*  And did he apologize?
*  Some people don't think he apologized enough but I don't even think I don't think we know the whole story.
*  Well that's the thing is I don't know.
*  We don't we really don't we're in the we're so in the dark about what really happened.
*  It's like we have an idea that we think what happened but no one really knows.
*  He hit the perfect moment on the wave.
*  Oh my God.
*  He hit the perfect moment on the Me Too wave.
*  That Me Too wave fucking.
*  Harvey Weinstein was like a fucking hurricane force wind behind his back.
*  He's out and fucking.
*  Where those old cars.
*  Well like the north shore of Hawaii is gonna catch one now to the biggest fucking Me Too wave just swallows him whole.
*  It would have been a gross thing anywhere else in history.
*  Sure.
*  But at that moment I mean.
*  Shut it down.
*  There was a moment where he went on stage at Skankfest and the audience went crazy.
*  I saw.
*  They cheered and went crazy.
*  And I either retweeted or liked it and someone went fuck you.
*  He sexually assaulted women like no he didn't know.
*  No one ever said he did that.
*  Also definitely didn't do that.
*  He asked if he could jerk off and he did.
*  Do you think he shouldn't have done that.
*  Yes I agree.
*  He shouldn't have done that but he did that.
*  Right. And then that's it.
*  That's what he did.
*  Yeah. That's what he did.
*  If you think that's gross.
*  Yes. But that's what he did.
*  There's other allegations that disturb people that maybe someone from his management did something to stifle the career of someone else.
*  That's fucked up.
*  If that's true.
*  That is fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  I do not know if that's true.
*  Here's the biggest problem again.
*  None of us know.
*  I don't know either.
*  I don't know that's the truth.
*  I'd like to find that part out.
*  But he doesn't.
*  I don't know if that was because of him.
*  I don't know if the management did it without his knowledge.
*  I don't know if it ever happened at all.
*  I don't know if it's exaggerated because I know many of the things that were said about him were exaggerated.
*  Again, this is not exonerating him.
*  What he did was gross.
*  He thinks what he did was gross.
*  But it's like, what do you want?
*  You want him to never tell jokes again?
*  He's one of the best comedians of all time.
*  He acknowledges that what he did was wrong.
*  At what point in time do we forgive people?
*  At what point in time do we say someone was doing something fucked up and now they've paid this tremendous price emotionally, psychologically?
*  When do you let them out of jail?
*  When you let them out of jail.
*  What's the time?
*  I say let them out of jail.
*  Let them out.
*  Let them out of jail.
*  Free Lou.
*  Free Lou.
*  Free Lou.
*  It's a strange time for people with accusations and being mean and ganging on people online and bullying and activism and chaos.
*  There's so much noise.
*  It's so much of us interacting with each other simultaneously too.
*  It's so hard to have peace these days.
*  Yeah.
*  On stage, that's the only way I get away from all the bullies.
*  That's the only way I get away from all the bullshit.
*  Especially because we're embedded in the internet.
*  That's the hardest part.
*  It is the hardest part.
*  Right now, we're doing it.
*  Talking to Adam Curry about it yesterday.
*  We were talking about just outrage.
*  He's like, you just really can't be in that all the time.
*  You can't subject yourself because there's always something to argue about.
*  You'll never run out of topics.
*  No, you're fucked.
*  All you have to do is have a few topics that you like to argue about.
*  Let's just say you're a person pro First Amendment, pro Second Amendment, pro choice, pro gay rights, pro trans rights, pro civil rights.
*  You just take those things that you feel very passionately about.
*  And then just put those hashtags online, on Twitter, and then go look for conversations and go to war.
*  Right.
*  That's what you do.
*  Yeah, you can do it all day.
*  You can do it all day.
*  You can talk about the Second Amendment all day.
*  You can all day argue with gun nuts and people who hate guns.
*  You can take both sides.
*  You can have two different accounts.
*  You can have one account where you're like some fucking hillbilly who thinks everybody should have 80 guns or you go to jail.
*  Or you can have the other thing.
*  We need to trust our government and throw all the guns in a fire.
*  Yeah, you know, use them to make a statue with a giant penis like we could do.
*  We could literally argue all day long about immigrant rights, about whether or not they should detain them at the border.
*  You could be involved in that all day long.
*  I mean, you would never have a moment to sleep.
*  No.
*  If you just engage with everybody who engaged with you, you'd never have a moment to sleep.
*  People do it. That's what's crazy.
*  They do do it.
*  People spend endless amounts of time on it.
*  That's why I try to check out Twitter.
*  You know, it's like all those things.
*  Facebook I deleted.
*  All I want to use those things for is to promote what I'm doing tour-wise.
*  Like, hey, come see me and also make a couple of fucking fart jokes once in a while.
*  Like, it's worthless.
*  That's it.
*  I want to make some dumb jokes and then be like, come see me live.
*  I just can't.
*  I've stopped years ago engaging when people are like, is this how this is?
*  I'm like, never.
*  I don't want to get into it.
*  I just don't deal with it anymore.
*  Well, the sheer number of people out there that are bored in their cubicle somewhere trying to get a rise out of you.
*  Yeah.
*  People are so bored.
*  Well, it's also because, you know, it's nice to be engaged.
*  You know what I think they compare it to?
*  It's like when they start flirting or dating somebody.
*  It's the same kind of engagement you get excited for the next piece of engagement, right?
*  Oh, right.
*  Have you said something back then like, oh, shit, I got him on the hook.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of it's trolling has become a new thing of like PCP.
*  It's constant engagement.
*  It's the same kind of feeling you get when you start talking to someone that you're interested in.
*  You're like, holy fucking talking to me back.
*  And then you get this tennis match of like emotion.
*  So it becomes this heightened thing in your world.
*  Now it's like a new thing to have.
*  You're like a big red snapper in clear water.
*  You're moving towards the Lord.
*  Oh, he bit the Lord.
*  He bit a little bit.
*  Come on, you fuck.
*  Take a bite.
*  You fuck over here.
*  Did you see Oprah fall down?
*  Yes.
*  And it's honestly she's a little old to be falling down.
*  You loved it.
*  I loved it.
*  Wow.
*  Loved it.
*  She didn't get hurt.
*  People get hurt.
*  She's fine.
*  She's dead.
*  She died?
*  Yes.
*  All right.
*  Ding dong.
*  The witch is dead.
*  No, she did.
*  And she died from the fall.
*  Yeah, we're fucked.
*  No, she didn't die.
*  No, she's fine.
*  That's weird.
*  It's nice to see somebody hit.
*  No, it humanizes her.
*  She is such a figure of perfection.
*  Women should learn those fucking shiny bottom shoes.
*  Them bitches are useless.
*  You can't wear those things.
*  They're so slippery.
*  Those really expensive shoes that the gals like that always have the shiny bottoms.
*  Here, here she is walking.
*  And I believe she's talking about balance, which is LOL.
*  The irony is staggering.
*  Flat ground.
*  All things are equal or at peace at all times.
*  Oh, she bites the dust.
*  Let's see how she recovers.
*  She says new shoes.
*  Oh, those rude fucks.
*  They can edit it so she hits the ground over and over again.
*  Well, you know what?
*  I got to say, I like how she framed with her elbow and then did a roll.
*  She absorbed a lot of energy in a roll.
*  Good technique, Ope.
*  Not bad.
*  Here we go.
*  Frame.
*  A little bit on the left hip.
*  That shit's probably sore.
*  But one thing you got to say about Oprah, she works out a lot and she's got muscles.
*  She went and ran a marathon recently.
*  I don't know this to be true.
*  I think she did a marathon in six hours, which is not the best time, but she still ran 26
*  fucking miles in a day.
*  Don't you think it's nice to see people fall?
*  It's humbling to watch someone fall.
*  I just think that's-
*  Four and a half hours.
*  Did she really?
*  That's an hour faster than Burt Crusher.
*  Burt, you fat fuck.
*  That's about as fast I bet I could do it.
*  She didn't really run it four and a half hours?
*  Four and a half hours.
*  Four and a half hours.
*  How fast is that?
*  Like a mile?
*  10-17.
*  That's really good.
*  That's a good clip.
*  Wait a minute.
*  She's doing-
*  Better than you, bitch.
*  No way.
*  That's right.
*  Imagine you and Oprah in a race.
*  She's doing-
*  And she dusts you.
*  Ten minute miles?
*  Yes.
*  Twenty-six of them, bitch.
*  So that's what?
*  Six miles an hour about?
*  Woo.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  Are you scared?
*  You scared?
*  Let me tell you something.
*  You feel a little nervous right now.
*  Okay.
*  I'll see what everybody says.
*  I just typed in Oprah Marathon time.
*  That's very good though when she was 40, which makes- she was probably on speed back then.
*  And steroids.
*  Quaaludes.
*  She's hopped up.
*  She's not everything.
*  No, I just think it's humbling to watch someone so beloved take a little stupid spill.
*  It's just kind of like, yeah, that's the balance of the universe.
*  She's perfect to everybody.
*  It's nice to watch perfect people fall a little bit.
*  That's fun.
*  I understand.
*  She's a part of the people now, especially if she's like, new shoes.
*  You know how this goes.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah.
*  She's got slipper shoes, man.
*  That's not what it was.
*  Yes, it is.
*  She's getting older.
*  That was I'm getting older fall.
*  Watch it again.
*  That was like I lost my balance from I'm just getting older.
*  Yeah, but it's those stupid shoes, man.
*  I can't find a recent one.
*  There you go.
*  She didn't write one any time soon.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  The story has gone on around recently, but it was about 25 years ago when she did it.
*  I swore there was one that they were referencing a year before.
*  She ran it for a late birthday.
*  She ran one of the marathons for like her 50 something birthday.
*  It would be her 60th.
*  She's in her 60s, right?
*  I feel like her 60th birthday or something like that.
*  I would never run a marathon.
*  No, never.
*  You'll never catch me.
*  Someone's scared.
*  No, I run almost every day, but I'm never going to run a marathon.
*  Why?
*  Because I don't need to.
*  It's an insane amount of distance.
*  Look at how defensive he is out of nowhere.
*  Like someone's grilling.
*  I don't need to.
*  How about this?
*  How about this?
*  I mean, yeah, that's right.
*  How about this?
*  Cam Haynes runs one a day.
*  Yeah, Cam.
*  Come on.
*  He does.
*  I know, but it's like enough.
*  We get it.
*  No, you don't get it.
*  That's too much.
*  You don't get it.
*  It's too much.
*  His knees are going to fucking fall off his body.
*  They're great right now.
*  They're going to fall off.
*  He's older than you.
*  He looks good.
*  Send me your knees, Cam.
*  Send me your cartilage or your lack thereof.
*  No, I wonder if you run a lot, the inside of your knees gets accustomed to it.
*  Like it gets a callus in there?
*  Well, no, like it strengthens.
*  No.
*  Is that possible?
*  Cartilage wears away at some point.
*  It's just not made to do that that much.
*  Oh, no, that's true.
*  Look it up, baby.
*  Cartilage is gone.
*  How do those fucking 100 marathon people, those dudes who run those ultra marathons,
*  how do they do it year after year after year?
*  Because they can't do it their whole life.
*  You do it for a chunk of time until your knees just get shot.
*  But imagine if it's just like, if you're just a bitch, it gets to the point where your knees
*  are shot.
*  But if you keep going, you push through, your knees wind up fixing themselves.
*  Your legs just break.
*  No, your legs callus over.
*  Well, it's like there's a campaign for a great cyclist called Shut Up Legs.
*  You look up Shut Up Legs, it's like a whole thing about him.
*  People worry about running ruins knees, but a new study finds the activity may in fact
*  benefit the joint, changing the biomechanical environment inside the knee in ways that could
*  keep it working smoothly.
*  Carrying less weight is known to reduce risk for knee arthritis.
*  Come on.
*  Running may be good for your knees.
*  That's the New York Times, you dummy.
*  You don't know jack shit.
*  Okay, the failing New York Times?
*  Shut your mouth.
*  The failing New York Times?
*  What are you, Trump?
*  Lion Ted, crazy Hillary.
*  Who wrote it?
*  Oh no, it's Lion Hillary.
*  Crazy Ted.
*  Many people worry about running knees, new studies.
*  My decades of running.
*  Okay, but there's a little evidence to support the idea that a growing body of research suggests
*  reverse.
*  Hell, this is clickbait.
*  The New York Times got us.
*  Epidemiological studies of long-term runners show that they generally are less likely to
*  develop osteoarthritis in the knees than people of the same age who do not run.
*  Sometimes scientists speculate that running may protect knees because it is often associated
*  with relatively low body mass.
*  Carrying less weight is known to reduce the risk of knee arthritis.
*  That makes sense.
*  It's saying there's little evidence that it ruins your knees.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, it's saying little evidence that it ruins your knees, but it also says some scientists
*  have speculated running.
*  So there's no evidence and proof.
*  They're just saying this is also a possibility.
*  Go back up to where it was.
*  Oh, the widespread argument generally follows the lines that running will slowly wear away
*  the cartilage that cushions the bones and the joints and cause arthritis, but there's
*  little evidence to support the idea.
*  That makes sense.
*  Okay, okay.
*  So what I was saying, I was incorrect.
*  I just tried to jump paragraphs.
*  I missed the context of it.
*  Well, that makes sense.
*  Look, these fucking guys that I know, this is what I'm saying.
*  These guys that I know that run all the time, they have good knees, and you would think
*  they didn't.
*  These volunteers...
*  Stop, stop.
*  These volunteers visited a clinic where they had blood drawn from an arm.
*  The researchers also siphoned off a small amount of synovial fluid, a lubricating fluid
*  that reduces friction inside joints from the right knee.
*  Healthy knees contain only...
*  What is that word?
*  Supcon?
*  Supsum?
*  I don't even know what that word is.
*  Arthritic or otherwise unhealthy knees tend to contain much more.
*  Interesting.
*  All right, well, my knees are going to be good.
*  This is all speculative, too.
*  There's not enough research supporting it, too, so who knows?
*  Well, it makes sense, though, that your muscles would be stronger, and then that would probably
*  support your knee better than a person who doesn't exercise.
*  I don't know.
*  But that cartilage wears out either way.
*  Anybody you know that's a great athlete, they always say that the knee cartilage wears from
*  so much wear and tear, especially jumping a lot, like basketball players.
*  Yeah, but that's different.
*  That's explosive plyometric type movements.
*  It's not running.
*  Running is just steady running.
*  Yeah, but it also depends on what you're running on, too.
*  But there's a difference between running.
*  It's like going left, going right, and cutting and exploding to the left.
*  Like a move that you would do on the court.
*  Right.
*  And then if you're running on a trail where it's got some dirt, you get a little cushion.
*  Yeah, there's some absorption there.
*  This is a...
*  That was from 2017.
*  This one is more updated off of a new myth-toppling new study that says that middle-aged runners
*  do actually rebuild the health of their knees.
*  See, what did I tell you, Cheeto?
*  I had an idea.
*  We'll see.
*  A myth-toppling new study of novice middle-aged runners suggests the answer is a qualified...
*  What is the question again?
*  Scroll up.
*  Could it be that marathon training and racing are actually good for our knees?
*  Maybe.
*  This is another one of these things.
*  A myth-toppling new study, you son of a bitch, of novice middle-aged runners suggests the
*  answer is a qualified yes.
*  The study finds that taking up distance running rebuilds the health of certain essential components
*  of middle-aged knees even if the joint starts off somewhat tattered and worn.
*  What did I tell you, bitch?
*  Show me the studies.
*  The results also contain a caution.
*  Marathon mileage could erode one vulnerable area within the knees the study finds if runners
*  are not careful.
*  But we won't want to talk about that because that's not what the article is about.
*  But what is that vulnerable part?
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  That's what they do though.
*  They bury it.
*  Stop complaining like a Chicago person.
*  Scroll down.
*  I have the study.
*  I was going to check that.
*  But what does it say?
*  There was one area it said.
*  That's what I was going to check in the study if it says.
*  Well, just scroll down.
*  I'm sure it'll tell us.
*  Oh, they're going on other studies down here.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  One must study.
*  Another study.
*  But what is it saying?
*  What part of the knee?
*  Focus on running activity harms knees.
*  Do you scroll down?
*  The question is, hmm.
*  Is that the end of it?
*  No.
*  Why do they do that when they break things up?
*  I can't stand that shit.
*  You have one free article remaining.
*  Subscribe to the Times.
*  What is the problem with the injury?
*  I'll check.
*  What is it?
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Find the one.
*  I would imagine cartilage is the big issue.
*  And meniscus.
*  Then you're done.
*  Yeah.
*  If you twist your knee and you cut your meniscus.
*  Have you run a marathon?
*  No.
*  See, you're giving me shit about it.
*  You wouldn't do it either.
*  I wouldn't do a half either.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I don't want to run with all those people.
*  Okay.
*  Very specific spot.
*  It says the improvement to the damaged subchondrial bone of the tibial and femoral condylyes.
*  Makes perfect sense.
*  Was found following the marathon in Novus Runners.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  So, and patella cartilage.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That's the bad part.
*  That's what it does bad.
*  Worsening of the patella cartilage.
*  Mm.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah, but can you fix that yet?
*  I mean, they give you those stem cells.
*  Yeah, stem cells.
*  Well, I know that they do micro fractures and shit.
*  Like, they do all kinds of different things to people to try to heal the cartilage in
*  their knees.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I just realized how privileged running is.
*  I was like, I just get to run sometimes during the day.
*  Yeah, just so you don't get so fat from eating all the food you want.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  All the food you eat.
*  Our problem in America is eating too much food.
*  We have way too much access.
*  We're spoiled with it.
*  Yeah, but I just realized that at the time of my day, I get to go, I can run to the gym
*  and then run home.
*  And that's like a nice day I get to have.
*  Nice.
*  Lucky dude, man.
*  Nice.
*  No, I wouldn't run a marathon because I don't like the people that do.
*  That's genuinely it.
*  You see all the people that get the thing, the culture.
*  I don't want to be a part of it.
*  No, thanks.
*  You don't have to be, man.
*  You could be a lone wolf.
*  Woo!
*  Ringing the fucking bells and taking the...
*  I don't want to do any of that stuff.
*  No.
*  You could be a punk chants.
*  Yeah, that's dope.
*  On your phone and just listen to that as you run.
*  Boooooooooooom.
*  Diggory doo music.
*  I would do that shit.
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  Just...
*  And then my heart's like...
*  Keep that thing going for four hours.
*  I would do...
*  I would go run in the middle of nowhere before I'd ever run in an actual marathon plan thing.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So you would run the 26 miles.
*  Like maybe you run a track.
*  No, it can't be on the track.
*  When I first moved to LA, I tried running at UCLA because my buddy got me a pass to
*  go work out at their gym.
*  And I did a track...
*  You're bored?
*  Pfft.
*  Miserable.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  If you had a track, like a standard university track, how many feet is that?
*  Like what is that, quarter mile?
*  What's most...
*  Each lap is quarter mile.
*  Quarter mile?
*  Yeah.
*  How many times do you think you can go around?
*  I mean I could...
*  Do you think you can go around a hundred times?
*  Are you paying me?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I could do it as many times as you want to pay me.
*  What if like you and Jamie have to bet?
*  Jamie doesn't run.
*  We need this three point shoot up before we get into this race.
*  Yeah, let's do three point shoot up.
*  You can do that too.
*  And then we need to do a race.
*  You can do that too.
*  You don't run, do you?
*  Yeah.
*  Do you?
*  Do people do that though?
*  It seems like that would be like a great bet.
*  If these ultra marathon runners really want to put their money where their mouth is, they
*  get together on a track.
*  See how long they could go?
*  Let's see who goes first.
*  Oh, that's fucked.
*  That sounds killer, dude.
*  They would never stop.
*  They would never stop.
*  They would never stop.
*  You can stop to pee or shit.
*  That's it.
*  What's the math because I'm dumb?
*  What's 26 times four?
*  Well, if it's a quarter of a mile, that means four of them are a mile.
*  So it'd be...
*  104.
*  You'd be pretty close to a hundred.
*  You'd have to run 104 times to run a marathon on a track.
*  104 laps.
*  Yeah.
*  So to answer your question, can I run 100 laps on a track?
*  Fuck no.
*  You're closing in on a marathon around 100 times.
*  Yeah, 104 times is a marathon.
*  No way.
*  No fucking way.
*  Oh.
*  Imagine you get into like seven.
*  Seven.
*  You hit seven and you're like, all right, I think I did it.
*  I don't want to loop around this thing.
*  Look at this football field again.
*  Miserable.
*  That's you miserable.
*  I haven't even hit eight yet.
*  Yeah, you're not even close.
*  It's going to take another two and a half minutes for you to get to eight.
*  And then you get there.
*  Eight.
*  Fuck that.
*  I got 92 to go.
*  Can you run stoned?
*  Oh, yes, I can.
*  You like running stoned?
*  I love it.
*  I can't do it.
*  Why not?
*  You can do it.
*  I'll do it with you.
*  I'll show you you can do it.
*  No, because I'll get high with you and I want to hang out and play pool or something.
*  Yeah, you run high.
*  It's great.
*  See, I can do certain exercises high.
*  What can you do?
*  Stretching, yoga type of shit.
*  Yeah, I can do that stoned out of my mind.
*  That's fun.
*  I just can't run because running to me is like I need to be in this mood that I get in.
*  When I get in this little mood and then I start to run, it's like a zone that I get into.
*  When I'm high, I'll fall right out of it and I'll start thinking about way other shit.
*  People who surf, they say that's the move.
*  Surfing high.
*  I like snowboarding high.
*  That's very fun.
*  I like riding down a mountain stoned.
*  I can't believe you don't like skiing.
*  It's so weird that you don't like going down a mountain.
*  How do you not like it?
*  Because I do so many things that are already thrilling.
*  I don't need this other stupid thrilling thing that might ruin my knees.
*  That doesn't make sense.
*  That's like saying I don't want to ...
*  Dude, I wrecked this last time because some lady slid into the trail in front of me and I almost took her out.
*  I have a small fracture in my shin bone.
*  Oh, you hit her?
*  No, I hit the ground.
*  Oh, you smashed the ground.
*  Dude, I smashed hard.
*  That's what it is.
*  I was trying to go around this lady.
*  She's a noob and she was on this hill.
*  She was like, oops, sorry, oops, sorry, and just slid right into the trail.
*  There was people over here and people over here.
*  I'm like, I could plow into this lady.
*  I got to go down.
*  I tried to go around her and my legs went out from under me.
*  I hit my head hard, like really bad.
*  Do you wear a helmet?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I still got my bell rung, but I fucked my knee up.
*  Then the next day I'm in yoga.
*  When I'm bending down real low, I'm like, oh, this doesn't feel good.
*  It felt weird.
*  It felt like something's wrong.
*  Then I got an MRI on it.
*  There's a small fracture.
*  It's called an insufficiency fracture.
*  It's like right where I had meniscus cut out of that knee too.
*  The bones actually bang into each other because there's no meniscus there.
*  There's a crack in the bone.
*  On your shin?
*  Yeah, there's a crack in my shin bone.
*  It's not a big one.
*  It's a small area.
*  It's really not that big a deal.
*  I'm in a bad state of mind.
*  I'm in a bad state of mind.
*  I don't even feel it anymore.
*  I don't even feel it anymore.
*  What do they have to do for it?
*  What can they do for it?
*  I got some stem cells shot into that and some PRP.
*  I just took it easy.
*  I didn't do anything pounding.
*  PRP is platelet-rich plasma.
*  They spin your blood and they put it back in.
*  I'm fascinated by that shit.
*  It's good stuff.
*  There's so many different methods now to accelerate healing, to accentuate healing.
*  That's a good one.
*  Exosomes is what they used.
*  I've used that on a bunch of different things, on knees and shoulders and shit.
*  Stuff's great.
*  For the average Joe, what does that cost?
*  I don't know.
*  See?
*  I wonder.
*  It's not cheap.
*  Normal people can't do it.
*  Well, it should be like a normal therapy.
*  It should be something that you go to the doctor and your insurance covers it.
*  They do that to enhance healing.
*  It makes a big impact.
*  I've sent many people to get it.
*  My friend and his wife had a problem with her hip and they were going to operate on
*  her labrum, her hip labrum.
*  They shot some exosomes in there.
*  Then when they went to do a follow-up examination, the issue was gone.
*  Four months later, the issue was gone.
*  It was healed.
*  It wasn't healing itself.
*  It was getting worse.
*  They had one exosome shot into this lady's labrum.
*  Then next thing you know, four months later, when they go to look at it, they're like,
*  it looks great.
*  She's like, I don't feel any pain anymore.
*  It stopped hurting her.
*  It healed up.
*  It's not everything.
*  It's not everything.
*  It's not everything.
*  There's a lot of shit they can't fix.
*  When ligaments blow out, you've got to get it repaired.
*  You've got to get it surgically repaired.
*  There's certain things that become injured where exosomes or this stuff called Wharton's
*  Jelly, which is this new advanced stuff, or mesenchymal stem cells, all these different
*  versions of stem cell therapy that they use.
*  Some of them use bone marrow.
*  They go into your bone marrow, extract stem cells from that and use that for different
*  injuries.
*  And re-inject it in different areas or bodies.
*  Yeah, they do some sort of a treatment to it to make it, to really accentuate the stem
*  cells or activate them or whatever the fuck they do.
*  Some of them do it with fat.
*  They suck your fat out, so it's a nice little break fat ass.
*  Get in there and get some lipo.
*  I'm going to turn your lipo into some stem cells and fix all your joints.
*  That shit's wild.
*  I don't know.
*  There's not enough understanding of what's the best way to do these things.
*  I'm really lucky that I have a really good doctor that kind of like is very honest and
*  very, I wouldn't say skeptical or cynical, but he's very pragmatic and very honest about
*  the potential both ways, whether it could do nothing or it could want to be a waste
*  of time or it might actually work.
*  There's not enough information on some of this stuff.
*  So you're experimenting.
*  Yes, I'm a fucking science project.
*  Yeah, but you love that shit.
*  It works.
*  I'm the polar opposite.
*  I'm like, figure it out on Joe, then give it to me.
*  Come see me.
*  See if it breaks.
*  I don't want to be the first.
*  I don't want to be the first.
*  It's not the first.
*  There's been thousands and thousands of patients.
*  Still seems young to me.
*  No, no.
*  And then some people do have peer reviewed studies on the benefits of some of these things,
*  particularly people with Dr. Neil Reardon has treated people with certain neurological issues.
*  They've helped them with stem cells with like CTE type stem cells literally injected straight
*  into your fucking head and stem cells injected intravenously for some certain issues that
*  people have.
*  Yeah.
*  To try to fix your fucking brain.
*  Well, Aubrey DeGray, who's a life extension specialist was on my podcast last week.
*  Yeah.
*  And he thinks that that's the future of regenerative medicine is that there are these advancements
*  in stem cell therapy and medical technologies that they're eventually going to hit some
*  point where they can sort of treat aging like it's a disease instead of like it's inevitability,
*  right?
*  Treating it like it's a disease and actually reverse the process.
*  Holy fuck.
*  Holy fuck, bro.
*  No thanks.
*  You're going to look like you're 12 years old.
*  You're going to go so hard into it.
*  I looked 30 when I was 12.
*  You're going to fuck it up.
*  You're going to go so far.
*  You're going to turn into a little kid and your wife's going to go, I just, I missed
*  the old Santino.
*  But I got so much energy.
*  This is what you get, bitch.
*  And I can play a little league.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'll fuck you all day.
*  I'm crazy.
*  I'm going to fuck my friends and I'm going to fuck you 13 times.
*  Imagine if we get, we fuck up and you do stem cell therapy, but it goes too far and you're
*  like Benjamin Buttons.
*  It goes the other way.
*  Yeah, we all look like kids.
*  You go back to a kid.
*  You fuck up.
*  Imagine if they fucked it up.
*  Imagine if like they go, okay, we've never seen this before, Andrew.
*  How tall are you?
*  How tall are you?
*  Like six, two?
*  Six, one and some change.
*  Like six, one, like you're five, 11.
*  Like what?
*  And you look like you're 14.
*  What?
*  What are you saying?
*  I don't think there's anything to worry about because I think at the very least, like the
*  worst thing is you'll get to go 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 again.
*  You have to do it all over again.
*  It's like you're a 14 year old with all the knowledge and I don't think you're going to
*  get any younger.
*  You're like, what do you mean you don't think?
*  Well, we don't know yet.
*  We're not sure.
*  And then you come back in four months later and you're smaller still.
*  I'm nine.
*  Now you're nine years old.
*  You're losing like a year every six months.
*  I'm nine.
*  I'm holding in my poop.
*  My anxiety is at a high.
*  I'm nine.
*  Can you imagine if they can reverse the aging process, what if they fuck it up and turn
*  you into a baby and you got all this money and then you're like just signing over your
*  will when you're two and your family's like, he can't understand what he's signing.
*  No, no, no.
*  I'm two, but I'm 50.
*  Like you look like you're two.
*  You got the pen and everything.
*  You're ready to write shit down.
*  Mr. Baby.
*  Mr. Baby.
*  The family's like, there's no fucking way.
*  You cannot let him sign this.
*  He's like, no, but his mental capacity is not.
*  I'm 52 years old.
*  I'm not two.
*  But he can't talk and his arms are all flailing around.
*  He's like doing this like a baby.
*  You have to sign everything off by the time you can't talk anymore because it's going
*  to get to a point in time we're just going to make goo goo noises like trapped.
*  A 55 year old man trapped in the head of a baby.
*  Do you die then?
*  Yeah, you just crawl right back in your mom's pussy.
*  That's what you do.
*  Oh, so she's got to be around.
*  She's got to be around.
*  How's this?
*  How's this?
*  How's this?
*  How are they going to just put her on the same program?
*  Bring her back to time.
*  She's 20.
*  OK, great.
*  And then you climb right back in.
*  It was a reverse button.
*  You said like use it at the right time by the time you're 80 and just go back down to
*  the time you're six and then hit it again.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Do it once.
*  Go back to just live forever.
*  I don't want to live forever, but like just double instead of going to and then you but
*  then you'd go right.
*  I want to do it one more time.
*  Be imagine being slow and worse.
*  Imagine being 10 years old today.
*  Like if you just had to go back to school at 10 and kids be trying to bully you and
*  say stupid shit.
*  Do you imagine what you would do to those kids?
*  Murder.
*  Well, I wouldn't beat him up, but I just just talking to them how you could suck a good
*  mind fucking intellectually just trying to be mean to you.
*  Yeah.
*  I got Bobby.
*  You trying to be mean to me, Bobby?
*  Yeah.
*  What's the matter?
*  I know about your I know about your father's addiction and the fact that your mom is with
*  the neighbor.
*  Wait, what?
*  Oh, there's a great there's a great scene.
*  There's a phenomenal scene in a show called Pen 15.
*  These girls are like my age, but they play teenagers on the show.
*  What?
*  It's it's great.
*  It's really funny.
*  But there's a funny scene when she gets pep talked into talking shit during a fight and
*  she's like her friends that call him an aardvark dick and she's like, OK, what else?
*  And she's like, just use any ammunition you have against him.
*  Right.
*  And he's bullying the girl and she's like, whatever aardvark dick.
*  And everyone's laughing.
*  And then she goes, yeah.
*  And that's why your dad died.
*  And everyone's like, oh, shit.
*  That's mean.
*  It's such a good scene.
*  And she thinks she's like fucking like everyone's cheering her on.
*  Then she says his dad died and starts crying.
*  Yeah.
*  If you had the if you had the intellectual capacity to just shut down, I mean, it's it's
*  you emotionally break them.
*  Oh, you break them.
*  Like when I'm around little girls like my daughter and her friends and they're all like
*  talking about like sometimes they have a birthday party and so there's like 10, 12 kids at the
*  house and they're all talking shit to each other.
*  Right.
*  And you get to just hover and listen.
*  It's like the thing and they're talking about like some boy at school who's always a boy.
*  Yeah.
*  So some dork picks his boat.
*  He eats his boogers.
*  And he's so he's always trying to be funny.
*  So mean, you know, and one of them really like how old is she again?
*  Eleven.
*  Yeah, that's yeah, that's that's that's that's the age when the boys are starting to show
*  the signs of being like we're all getting hormones.
*  Yeah.
*  The boys are knocking the door.
*  Hey, boys are pushing a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the government.
*  We're just going to let you know that the neighborhood is going to be changing radically
*  over the next couple of years.
*  We just suggest you be careful.
*  Things are moving in newfound powers.
*  Yeah.
*  Boners.
*  Boners are coming.
*  God, boners are coming.
*  Boners are on the way.
*  The flight of the boners.
*  You prepare for your boner.
*  Meanwhile, no one even tells you what's going on.
*  And all of a sudden you got a hard on like what is that?
*  But that day on the bus, when you get a boner on the bus, holy shit, does it fuck your day
*  up?
*  My friend John Dudley calls them bumpy road boners.
*  Yeah, bumpy boners.
*  Something about when you're on a car that's bouncing around.
*  Yeah.
*  Somehow I know that dudes get boners sometimes because you're probably you know what it is.
*  It's probably the pressure on your prostate is activating your dick to get fucking you
*  And also you're on the way home and you're you might catch a glimpse of you know Natalie
*  who's got the tits already who's too young.
*  Start to get hard as shit.
*  You miss your stop.
*  There's always that one girl who's 13 with giant double D's.
*  That was Natalie.
*  What the hell?
*  She was stacked when we were kids.
*  What happens there?
*  I used to miss a bus stop.
*  Seriously sometimes I'd miss a stop if I had a hard on and I was afraid to get off the
*  bus with a boner even though you tuck it up.
*  You know you tuck it up in your pants and I was always afraid so I'd miss a stop or
*  two sometimes if I get a hard on the way home.
*  Wow.
*  I'd be so nervous.
*  I'd rather walk home.
*  Fuck that.
*  Yeah I'd rather walk.
*  How'd you go flaccid?
*  Did you talk yourself out of it?
*  I'd have a friend slap me and I'd start fighting with a friend.
*  Yeah.
*  If you start fighting with another dude friend your dick goes right into your body.
*  Or it doesn't.
*  Well then you got a whole nother thing going on.
*  Then you got a new thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Now I got another thing to be confused about.
*  I got a new thing now.
*  Yeah I mean imagine if you had to go through that all again though and didn't know anything.
*  The torture of seeing, I mean I only understand boys because I've never been a girl.
*  But going through like being 10, 11, 12, going through school, all the social things, not
*  knowing shit, you're a boy.
*  It's so confusing.
*  It sucks.
*  Once you finally become a man and you don't have to do that anymore you can just be at
*  peace in your own skin.
*  It's like oh imagine going through all that stuff again.
*  No.
*  Hiding jerking off too.
*  Like you're like a fucking, you're like a ninja.
*  They don't know what you're doing in the bathroom for 20 minutes with a magazine.
*  You're a little ninja jerking, you're a jerk off ninja.
*  Now I kind of hope my neighbors see me.
*  It's kind of part of the allure.
*  I jerk off in my living room sometimes.
*  I'm just hoping they walk by walking their dog.
*  Wave hi.
*  If they see you jerking off in your house I think you can get in real big trouble.
*  I think a guy got in trouble jerking off in his house with the windows open.
*  Shut up.
*  You're private.
*  No, no, no.
*  I think because you could see into this guy's house and he was beaten off they came and
*  got him.
*  Why?
*  Because there was kids or something like that?
*  I don't remember what the story was but it was a big deal.
*  Where people were like hey, hey, hey.
*  The guy is just jerking off inside his own house.
*  What is the big goddamn deal?
*  They had the door open.
*  Or the window open or something like that.
*  The front door is wide open.
*  You tell me there's not a guy who's out there jerking off with the front door wide open.
*  For sure.
*  Just letting in the breeze.
*  Of course there is.
*  They go to hotels and then they open up the door and they stuff a wedge in the door and
*  start fucking.
*  And they let everybody walk by and watch.
*  Yeah, leave the door open.
*  That's fun.
*  Vegas.
*  Especially before cell phones.
*  All these fucking goddamn tattletale cell phones.
*  And the dirty cameras.
*  Back then people just, I bet that was a common thing.
*  Just fucking with the door open?
*  Yeah, like Hells Angels.
*  They all took over a hotel somewhere.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Those guys.
*  They fucked with that door wide open.
*  Yeah, they fucked in the street.
*  They were at the bar.
*  On bikes.
*  That voyeuristic thing never was like a thing for me.
*  I know some people like fucking in public because they think it's hot to maybe get caught.
*  Never never got me.
*  I was always like, why?
*  I don't fucking, why do I want to know that someone's watching me?
*  That's creepy.
*  If you get arrested, you get weird charges too.
*  Like if you fuck someone in public in some places, they'll hit you with like a sex offender
*  charge.
*  Yeah, because it's exposure.
*  Yeah, dude, I had to fight that in college.
*  I had urinating in public.
*  I had to fight a public exposure charge.
*  Yeah, that's a real problem because that's a different goddamn thing that every man understands
*  and that's a little game they're playing.
*  Yeah, that's a dirty game.
*  You caught a guy taking a leak and you're saying that's public exposure.
*  Look, he shouldn't have been taking a leak outside maybe, but everybody's done it.
*  So stop.
*  I had to piss.
*  Yeah, when guys have to piss and there's no one around, they piss in alleys.
*  And we've been doing that since the beginning of time.
*  So for some fucking guy to pretend that that's like robbing a house or trying to kidnap a
*  kid.
*  Right.
*  Like that's not a sex offender.
*  No.
*  That's a guy who had to pee.
*  Yeah, but I had to be in a room in one of those rooms with people that did expose themselves
*  and I was like, nothing like these dudes, man.
*  I'm nothing like these fucking guys.
*  I was pissing outside.
*  Maybe you'd be happy if you pissed your pants.
*  I should have next time.
*  If you pissed your pants, they can't say shit.
*  Right, I know, it's not illegal.
*  You pissed your pants in public though.
*  Yeah, but I had my pants on.
*  Yeah, but still.
*  But still.
*  Have you seen these in Europe?
*  They've talked about bringing them some places in America, I think, but they haven't.
*  You stand in there and jerk off?
*  No, they have open urinals just like in the middle of the street.
*  Oh, this dude's jerking off in there for sure.
*  People will get drunk.
*  I bet that smells like fish.
*  Someone's pooped in one of those for sure.
*  Look at that.
*  Face the wrong way.
*  Open air urinals cause uproar in Paris.
*  What would they rather have, people just piss?
*  Look at that guy.
*  He's got his hog out.
*  Here's the difference though.
*  Otherwise they're asking all these coffee shops, can I use the bathroom?
*  And people are like, no bathroom, no bathroom.
*  Well let them go pee then and the thing.
*  I feel like those would fill up quick.
*  San Francisco has these.
*  Do they?
*  But they're enclosed.
*  San Francisco, they've ruined that place.
*  They're enclosed.
*  They've fucked up.
*  They've ruined that place by allowing people to just shit in the streets and not do anything.
*  I don't know what you can do about it, but they should have taken steps to make sure
*  it never got this bad.
*  Meanwhile, it's the highest concentration of billionaires on earth, I think that's what
*  someone said to me.
*  They don't live right there.
*  That's the problem.
*  They work right there.
*  They work close.
*  Yeah, in San Francisco.
*  Yes.
*  They live in like Atherton.
*  Atherton is the big spot out there.
*  What's in the center of the city?
*  Not Russian Hill.
*  No, that's not what it's called.
*  Mission Hill?
*  Elephant something?
*  I don't know.
*  If you look it up, the driver was telling me when we were there, he was like, no man,
*  more billionaires live in this quarter mile radius than anywhere in the world.
*  This Marin County, that's a lot of really rich people too, right?
*  Yeah, but this is in the city, in the actual city of San Francisco.
*  It's just the poo everywhere.
*  Yeah, lots of poo.
*  I've seen so many people that take pictures of people pooing there.
*  I mean, I saw, that happens in LA too.
*  I was on Fairfax and I saw a woman pooping at a bus stop.
*  Yeah.
*  Did I take a photo?
*  I did.
*  I did.
*  So fucking sad.
*  Yeah, there's nothing you can do about it.
*  San Francisco, they're fucking, they're drowning.
*  It's just so far gone.
*  The city is just filled with tents and it's so crazy.
*  I know.
*  They just hand it back over to the homeless.
*  I remember that's the human poo map.
*  Yeah, it's just full.
*  Oh my God, it's poo.
*  Where's the most poo?
*  You know, surprisingly-
*  Is that really the whole poo map?
*  That's where they found poo?
*  Look at that though, dude.
*  Is that real?
*  There's a park up there in the corner and that has the least amount of poo in it.
*  Look at this.
*  San Francisco, it must be a high spot.
*  San Francisco's human waste problem plotted on foul map.
*  The city itself is in trouble.
*  See this is how medieval diseases get, they resurface.
*  Yeah, they come back up because it gets in the rivers and the drinking water and all
*  that stuff.
*  Yeah, well that's how people got diseases back in the day in Rome, was because of bad
*  sewage.
*  They were pooping in the place they were drinking and eating from.
*  Oh, this is so bad, man.
*  People just shitting in the streets.
*  Well, take a while.
*  Isn't that the Ganges?
*  Don't they have, isn't it filled with feces and dead bodies and stuff and they drink and
*  bathe in it?
*  That's mind-bending to me.
*  But San Francisco, with all these rich people, has this giant homeless shitting problem.
*  Yeah, a billionaire and then two blocks away is a guy pooping.
*  God damn.
*  What could they do?
*  I mean they did something in New York City, right?
*  They did some strong arm type shit and they reduced the amount of homelessness in New
*  York City.
*  They cleaned up Manhattan.
*  It's like a sparkling clean.
*  Now it looks like it's like a Six Flags.
*  Manhattan has become this very pristine, nice, safe, clean.
*  It definitely could have gone off the rails in Manhattan too.
*  But they did it right somehow.
*  I don't know what.
*  What did they do?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean I think that was also the implementation of like they doubled their police force.
*  They started busting people for everything.
*  People got scared of doing anything illegal in the city.
*  Well we're real close to someone saying enough is enough and you get some dude who comes
*  in who's going to have some hardline Giuliani type attack on the homeless problem in downtown
*  in LA.
*  Because LA is up to 70,000 plus people homeless.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  It looks like Boulder, Colorado.
*  Yeah, that's a lot of people.
*  That's like Boulder of homeless.
*  Just all the people in Boulder but homeless.
*  And they're concentrated mostly downtown and by in like Venice, right?
*  Isn't that where the most of them are?
*  Boulder might be 100,000.
*  I think Boulder, I mean, might be underestimating the amount of people in Boulder.
*  How many people you think live in Boulder, Colorado?
*  100 sounds low.
*  Boulder's pretty big.
*  Really?
*  The school is there and the school alone has got to be 70k.
*  What?
*  107,000.
*  107.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  But that school has got to take up the high majority of that population.
*  Isn't that school massive?
*  That school is fucking huge.
*  I mean, 50, 60,000 kids?
*  That's the most for like any school really.
*  Like Ohio State or Texas is like 50, 60.
*  Yeah.
*  But isn't Boulder big like that?
*  College towns are strange, right?
*  You got young people and then the old people who like staying near the university.
*  Dude, people used to complain when I was in Arizona State.
*  People would bitch constantly about us throwing house parties.
*  Like, where do you fucking think?
*  This school has been around since 1896.
*  Yeah, and they used to be in those parties, these fucks.
*  Yeah, so stop.
*  So either fucking come over and get high with us or move.
*  Yeah, you gotta move.
*  You gotta move, dude.
*  It's not my...
*  The school has been there.
*  When somebody moves to a school area and they complain, well, you know what they did about
*  Westwood, UCLA.
*  That whole thing is fucked up.
*  What?
*  That's why there's no college town there because those community organizers basically made
*  it almost impossible for young and new businesses to open up that would be supportive of like
*  bars or restaurant culture.
*  They keep shutting it down because these old rich people in Westwood don't want that there.
*  They want it to be a neighborhood.
*  They fight UCLA tooth and nail to make sure that it's like, no, make the kids go fucking
*  live in Culver City or something.
*  It's bullshit.
*  It's bullshit.
*  Is it though?
*  Yeah, that's why...
*  What if your house is out there?
*  You wouldn't be thinking it's bullshit.
*  I wouldn't move to a place where a college is...
*  I wouldn't move a block from a fucking major university.
*  How about that?
*  When I was in Boulder, I was driving down the street and I saw a fraternity house and
*  I said, imagine you're in a Zac Efron movie and you live right next door to these fucks.
*  Fuck that.
*  That's like a Zac Efron, Seth Rogen movie.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a neighbor's...
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah, but do you know better?
*  That's what I mean.
*  You know where you're moving.
*  You know where you move.
*  If you move next to a major school, it's your fault.
*  I wonder if it's really cheap to live next to the fraternity.
*  Of course it is.
*  What do you mean?
*  It must be.
*  It's got to be.
*  Because it's a house.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there anything that fucks with your real estate value more than a fraternity?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Sorority is like, I bet they're loud, but they're probably not going to be lighting anything
*  on fire.
*  No, because they go to the guy's house.
*  They go to the frat to fuck shit up.
*  Also, the dudes are the ones with the problems in terms of violence and explosions and chaos.
*  Yeah.
*  Drunk men are way scarier than drunk women.
*  Drunk women just cry.
*  They scream.
*  They tell bitches they're going to cut them.
*  They might pull hair and punch each other, but it's nothing.
*  There's not bombs going off.
*  Drunk men are shooting guns and lighting cars on fire.
*  Yeah.
*  They're doing dumb things.
*  Drunk men are fucking dangerous.
*  But that's what you're supposed to do when you're that age.
*  Where's your supposed to do dumb shit when you first start getting drunk?
*  And you're also supposed to realize how dumb it is that you're living in the house with
*  these fucking savage men.
*  And you're like, I got to grow up.
*  And then by the time those three years or four years are done and you're out, you're
*  like, enough.
*  I'm going to be a different person.
*  I'm turning over new leaves.
*  I'm going to live alone.
*  I'm going to be a venture capitalist.
*  I'm going to be an angel investor.
*  But two of those guys still want to keep that party moving.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  That's Burke Chrysler.
*  He became a fucking comedian.
*  Two of those guys.
*  Yeah.
*  They just can't get out of that.
*  That's literally like Burke.
*  Burke was in school for 100 years.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, how long did he stay in college for?
*  Seven.
*  Seven years.
*  And he never graduated.
*  Or he did.
*  He never graduated.
*  Right?
*  I don't know if he did or not.
*  Does he have a degree?
*  He did, I think.
*  I guarantee you, he bribed somebody.
*  It's got to be in hotel management.
*  If he has one, I bet you that's what it is.
*  Imagine if he did spend all those years on school tuition.
*  What a waste.
*  So much money.
*  But isn't his parents, he comes from money, right?
*  He did.
*  That's what it is.
*  What?
*  What is top partier?
*  He had a degree in hospitality.
*  You nailed it.
*  I swear to God, in my life, I did not know that, but I just knew it in my bones.
*  I knew it in my bones.
*  I had friends that did that.
*  They went for, one buddy did agriculture.
*  Oh my God.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, but agriculture is real.
*  We need food.
*  He had nothing to do with it.
*  It was just a thing to do because he didn't know what the fuck he wanted to do.
*  Dude, that's so funny.
*  How much did that cost to get a degree in hospitality that he'll never use?
*  What do you got to say?
*  How much a year is FSU?
*  Look, he's got an amazing career in stand-up comedy, and I'm sure his experiences in the
*  university probably did something to enhance his perspective that would help him on stage
*  as a stand-up.
*  He's got a fucking movie out of it.
*  Yeah.
*  They didn't give him any money for that movie.
*  No, because the story was borrowed.
*  They twisted it, but it was all based on Burt Kreischer.
*  Totally.
*  That Van Wilder movie.
*  That was him.
*  Based on Burt Kreischer.
*  He says he was an English major for six years.
*  And then he's like, it's too fucking hard.
*  I can't speak no English.
*  I speak English.
*  I speak Florida.
*  I'm the machine.
*  Yeah, he looks exactly like what I ... If Florida was a person, it'd be Burt.
*  Florida was a human embodiment of fucking Burt Kreischer.
*  Yeah, with like a weird hat on.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No shirt.
*  No shirt, baseball hat.
*  Not even a baseball hat.
*  Like one of them weird ...
*  Fedoras.
*  Yeah, kind of like a half-assed fedora.
*  But no shirt on.
*  No shirt.
*  And flip-flops.
*  That's Florida.
*  He wears flip-flops every ... He gave me a pair of his own flip-flops.
*  He's got a company that makes flip-flops now.
*  Burt does?
*  Burt does.
*  Well, Burtys.
*  They're right here.
*  Hold please.
*  Hold please.
*  I got it.
*  That's insane.
*  Burt investing in a flip-flop company is ... And it's a company that pre-existed and then he
*  bought into it or he started it?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, he's made ... I did squats yesterday.
*  That hurt.
*  So it says Burt Kreischer Free Waters.
*  Free Water.
*  That's the name of these.
*  Yes, the company, I guess.
*  They're a very solid flip-flop though.
*  Thumbs up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, if you're into flip-flops, these are great.
*  I wear flip-flops once a year.
*  I don't really wear flip-flops.
*  What about those guys?
*  I don't like the toe divider.
*  I like slides.
*  You know slides.
*  I like slides.
*  You like those better?
*  I fuck with slides.
*  Yeah, I just can't do flip.
*  I don't like the toe divider.
*  It weirds me out.
*  That's where you draw the line, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What's better, Jamie?
*  You like slides.
*  Slides?
*  I don't wear ... If I did, I'd probably wear slides.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of dudes will rock slides with white socks.
*  Yes.
*  And serious dudes.
*  Like guys who go to the gym, like muscular young guys.
*  Yep.
*  They'll wear slides and socks and they'll go wandering about.
*  It's comfy.
*  If you ever wore flip-flops and socks and you went out ... People would smack you.
*  There's a difference.
*  For some reason ...
*  Some guys can.
*  Yeah, but for some reason, slides and socks is acceptable where flip-flops and socks are not.
*  Well, because then you do the Ninja Turtle toe.
*  You can't do the socks with the flip-flops because then your toe gets divided and then it looks really weird.
*  But isn't that strange?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it looks ridiculous.
*  The secure ... They're both ridiculous.
*  Wearing slides and socks looks ridiculous.
*  Now it makes sense to me.
*  But at least it looks casual, right?
*  Slides and socks is just ... I don't need to wear shoes, man.
*  I just slip my socks in these and go to the fucking grocery store.
*  I'm going to go run over there real fast.
*  You can go to the grocery store with slides on and socks.
*  I go to the bank.
*  No one will say nothing.
*  Nope.
*  Why would they?
*  You can go to the bank.
*  Yeah.
*  I do small errands with slides and socks on.
*  You're a successful comedian.
*  You make a good living.
*  You're not poor.
*  It's not like this is the only pair of shoes you have.
*  This is a choice.
*  Yeah, I've made an obvious choice.
*  You pull up in your Mercedes.
*  I don't have a Mercedes.
*  I'm looking at it right now.
*  Nope.
*  Nope.
*  I don't have a Mercedes.
*  Are you lying?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm giving back to the environment.
*  I have a Yaris.
*  I bought a Toyota Yaris.
*  This is not true.
*  No.
*  You have a Mercedes.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a bitch.
*  White man with your fucking golden locks.
*  Gucci slides are regular bullshit.
*  First of all, I would never buy Gucci fucking slides.
*  I would never buy Gucci fucking slides.
*  You don't like Gucci?
*  No.
*  I buy the Adidas ones you can throw in the trash.
*  Oh, is that why?
*  Because if they get fucked up, they're like 20 bucks.
*  You're not into the Gucci?
*  No.
*  You, of all people asking me that, you would never wear Gucci fucking slides.
*  I have a pair of Gucci slippers that my wife bought me.
*  How often you wearing those?
*  I've worn them twice.
*  Exactly.
*  She bought them a couple years ago.
*  They have tigers on the feet.
*  You know this hype beast pervert over here.
*  He'd wear it all the time.
*  Whoa.
*  You love that bullshit.
*  Pervert.
*  You are.
*  You're actually a pervert.
*  You're actually a pervert.
*  You're actually a pervert.
*  You're actually a pervert.
*  He's a hype beast pervert.
*  He gets, he comes on, he comes on, you like to jack off to like cool hype beast shit.
*  You know you do.
*  Wow.
*  Whoa.
*  You don't?
*  Easy.
*  Easy.
*  Like Jordans.
*  Not wearing like whatever.
*  You know I saw.
*  T-shirt or whatever.
*  I'm not.
*  I saw, what is that guy's name?
*  Phillip Pline.
*  How do you say it?
*  Who's that?
*  He's the guy that got in trouble because they had a couple of guys that were like, oh,
*  I'm not wearing a shirt.
*  I'm not wearing a shirt.
*  Who's that?
*  He's the guy that got in trouble because they took pictures.
*  He took pictures of his sneakers.
*  He didn't get in trouble, but Ferrari got angry at him because he has a Ferrari and
*  he took pictures of his sneakers sitting on his Ferrari.
*  So what?
*  And Ferrari said that he, they sent him like a cease and desist saying that he's damaging
*  their brand.
*  His car.
*  Oh, there's a sneaker guy.
*  Phillip Pline, I see.
*  How do you say it?
*  Is it Pline?
*  So there was like a big controversy because like, hey, he bought your fucking $300,000
*  car.
*  He should be able to take a picture of his sneakers on your car.
*  Set it on fire if he feels like it.
*  What the fuck?
*  His, it was something about his lifestyle, the lifestyle that he promotes, but the lifestyle
*  that he promotes is just his hot girlfriend and him and they're wearing clothes.
*  How do they, who do you think buys Ferraris?
*  What the fuck?
*  This is it.
*  So that's a dope color for the car.
*  That is a beautiful fucking color.
*  I've never seen a green Ferrari like that.
*  Ferrari threatens to sue?
*  Dude, that is a, that makes me want to make a Ferrari that color.
*  That's a dope color.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Tarnishes the reputation of Ferrari's brands and causes Ferrari further material damage.
*  That's his behavior.
*  They'll lose that lawsuit.
*  Letter to Pline also says that he was using Ferrari's trademarks for the promotional purposes
*  of increasing his own brand and products visibility.
*  Again, the car is pictured or Pline's own.
*  Ferrari is essentially claiming that Pline is harnessing its iconic imagery to bolster
*  his own brand and also denigrate Ferraris.
*  How is it denigrating Ferraris though?
*  Like scroll back up.
*  It's just a dope looking color Ferrari and some pretty fucking cool sneakers.
*  Those are cool.
*  I don't understand how that's denigrating the brand.
*  Who do they think is buying fucking Ferraris?
*  Like did they have this idea that it's Harvard grads that are buying Ferraris?
*  Well, some of them were Harvard grads.
*  I think most people that buy Ferrari didn't go to Harvard.
*  Do me a favor.
*  I want to see a full picture of his green Ferrari.
*  I remember we looked at this before.
*  Those pictures have been taken off Instagram.
*  Oh.
*  But just see if you can just find his green Ferrari.
*  Because I know that motherfucker, if he's got a green Ferrari, he takes a lot of pictures of it.
*  There's no way that's the only picture of his dope green Ferrari.
*  You would assume Ferrari's brand is to promote people who are like self-made, money-making.
*  That's what this guy is, right?
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  That's three days ago.
*  Is that it?
*  Is there any other ones?
*  Other photos of it?
*  Yeah.
*  See, it's just all his girlfriend looking hot and him looking sexy.
*  Here's a dope car.
*  It's a Lambo.
*  Here's my gold Lamborghini.
*  Here's my fucking...
*  Gold plane jet.
*  He's got a gold jet.
*  That's hilarious.
*  It might be.
*  I was at a store.
*  They have a store in Vegas.
*  They had $6,000 crocodile sneakers.
*  I was like, those are pretty dope.
*  You didn't know.
*  I mostly wear Chucks or different Converse or skate shoes.
*  I wear a lot of Adidas.
*  Pumas.
*  I like Pumas.
*  What's the most expensive dumb shit you bought then?
*  What's the dumbest where you're like, I can't believe I bought the $6,000 crocodile shoes.
*  What is it?
*  I don't really have one of those.
*  You got something, dude.
*  Nothing stupid that I don't wear.
*  My pool case is made out of alligator skin.
*  But that wasn't that expensive, was it?
*  A couple thousand bucks.
*  That's pretty expensive.
*  It's handmade.
*  But isn't that relative to pool cues cases?
*  Yeah, that's a really good one.
*  Nothing too crazy.
*  There's not something in the house that you're like, why the fuck did we buy that?
*  That's an insane amount of money for no reason.
*  The thing that I like that I spend money on that's kind of ridiculous is the cars.
*  Classic cars.
*  You made fun of my car.
*  You got a thousand of them.
*  I have one.
*  I didn't make fun of it.
*  I just pointed out that you're rich.
*  I'm not rich.
*  I'm on borrowed time.
*  Driving around in an AMG Mercedes.
*  Hey, first of all, my car costs half as much as Jamie's outfit.
*  Whoa, he's got a Dolph Lundgren t-shirt on.
*  Why do you keep shitting on Jamie?
*  Because Jamie doesn't get any flack for being...
*  Jamie's a billionaire and all the listeners know it by now.
*  Jamie's a multi-billionaire.
*  Everything Jamie posts online, he has lots of fancy, cool, new shit.
*  Oh, you're mad at my Jordans.
*  That's why I see.
*  He's angry.
*  I'm a little annoyed.
*  I'm a little annoyed.
*  I'm a little annoyed.
*  Annoyed and jealous.
*  The real world is about those golf shoes I got too.
*  Also jealous and annoyed.
*  Jamie gets some great stacks.
*  Jamie's got some great shit.
*  It's all love, Jamie.
*  None of it.
*  Are you still doing a podcast with Bobby Lee?
*  Yes.
*  Me and Robert E. Lee.
*  How often do you guys do it?
*  Direct to Send It every single week.
*  Comes out on Mondays.
*  It's called Bad Friends.
*  It's the most fucking fun thing I've ever done in my life.
*  That's great.
*  We talk to each other for just over an hour about a myriad of things.
*  I set up bits for him to do.
*  We do a bunch of different new fun stuff every single week.
*  It's actually been ... doing my own podcast is fun, but doing one with him has just been
*  like ...
*  Dude, he's the perfect guy for podcasts.
*  The podcasts are a thing for him.
*  It's the thing for him.
*  He's a hard ...
*  He's so silly.
*  He's a fun guy.
*  You get to know him and you love him.
*  He's such a sweetheart.
*  If you go to this week's episode, go to episode three and ...
*  What's with the shelf?
*  Who's the designer?
*  We have to get the designer to do the work.
*  This is half of the stuff we talk shit about from our fans.
*  Who put that together?
*  The producer.
*  You have a producer that decorates?
*  No.
*  We just told them to throw stuff on the walls because we're like, just put up some shit on
*  the wall.
*  Why don't you put some stuff on the wall that represents what you like?
*  We're going to.
*  We're going to.
*  It's brand new.
*  We just started the whole thing.
*  We haven't done it yet.
*  Also, you know ...
*  You need an American flag behind you.
*  That should be what we all do now.
*  Go to episode three and go to the very ... Well, go to the beginning.
*  I think that's the beginning.
*  This is an episode where I brought an airsoft gun to the studio.
*  Bobby with a gun is a ...
*  Look at those glasses.
*  You guys are reading a script?
*  What is this?
*  You love letters to each other?
*  Yeah.
*  We're reading sweet, sweet nothings.
*  But Bobby got a gun.
*  I mean, I gave Bobby an airsoft gun.
*  Go to the very end.
*  Who made the animation of Bobby?
*  I don't know who did that one.
*  Isn't that good though?
*  That animation ... He's wearing slides.
*  Well, he always wears slides.
*  Look at the animation.
*  He's wearing slides.
*  Go to the very end.
*  Go to the very, very end real quick.
*  There's a ... There's a lot of stuff.
*  There's a lot of stuff.
*  There's a lot of stuff.
*  There's a lot of stuff.
*  The airsoft gun comes out way later there at the very end.
*  Imagine if we all decided that every podcast we're going to have an American flag in the
*  background.
*  We all decided to do it that way.
*  Oh, here it is.
*  Yeah, and I shoot a TV.
*  People didn't like ... People got freaked out.
*  They thought it was a real gun.
*  I think this is one of you had to be there things.
*  Because right now it just looks like you with a gun.
*  Yeah, no, no, no.
*  I know.
*  No, I'm saying, but I brought an airsoft gun, which is a bad ...
*  Did you just break the TV?
*  Yeah, Bobby dared me to shoot the TV, so I did it.
*  We're children.
*  Is that a BB?
*  What's it shooting?
*  It's an airsoft gun.
*  It's a BB gun.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so you shot a BB at the TV.
*  Yeah.
*  I could shoot a gun inside of that.
*  You broke a TV?
*  Yeah.
*  Bob, Bob does that stuff to me.
*  Only when I'm with this moron do I do such dumb stuff.
*  Smoked cigarettes in there too?
*  Did Bobby smoking again?
*  Yeah, not inside.
*  We make him go outside.
*  How long did he quit for?
*  He quit for a while, didn't he?
*  Yeah, he was vaping.
*  He was vaping for a long time, but now he's back.
*  He's trying to get off of it.
*  He's trying.
*  We'll see if it actually happens.
*  Well, if he's smoking, he's not trying to get off of it.
*  No, he wants to stop.
*  He wants to stop.
*  But isn't that a weird thing?
*  If you're trying, you could just stop.
*  Yeah, I mean, I smoked for a while and I quit.
*  How long did you smoke for?
*  A couple years.
*  Do you like cigars?
*  Nope.
*  You don't?
*  No, because it makes me want to smoke.
*  Burr is always like, what do you mean you don't want to smoke?
*  I was like, because it makes me want to smoke a cigarette.
*  Sometimes I do want a cigarette.
*  You used to smoke cigarettes, didn't you?
*  Yeah, I could tell.
*  Burr loves the cigars.
*  That's the supplement is drinking.
*  That's because he doesn't want to drink anymore.
*  That's why he likes smoking.
*  I think he liked them when he was drinking too, though.
*  Yeah, but now more than ever.
*  I think he smokes way more cigars than he ever did when he was drinking.
*  Oh, yeah, probably.
*  Because now he's almost got rid of the sauce completely, right?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah, he went a whole year without drinking.
*  That's nuts.
*  It's funnier than ever, though.
*  Yeah, I don't think I could go a year.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  How long do you think I could go without?
*  What do you think I could do?
*  Have you ever done a month?
*  I've done a month.
*  When did you do a month?
*  You want to do Sober October with us this year?
*  Okay.
*  Do you?
*  Maybe.
*  I'm very scared and apprehensive about that.
*  You know how much I like drinking.
*  October is my birthday.
*  Oh, sweetie.
*  And I'm going to be, come on.
*  It's hard for me.
*  It's a thing every year.
*  I know, but it's so hard.
*  Every year when we do it, I'm like, this is interesting.
*  It's a thing.
*  But it's so easy for you because nothing has a grasp on you.
*  Like, drinking and smoking a little pot, it doesn't control you the way that, like,
*  Bert, it's a real challenge.
*  Bert not drinking is an actual challenge.
*  For you, I don't think it's a real challenge.
*  Well, it's a challenge in that it's something that you commit to.
*  Yeah, but you do that constantly on your own anyway.
*  You're doing it against guys that don't constantly do it on their own.
*  Yeah, there's a little bit of that, but it's good for people.
*  I think, but even for me, just knowing that I have to do something for a whole month,
*  and I think that's one of the really good things about when we did that workout challenge,
*  working out six hours a day, you realize you can actually do that.
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  I never thought he could do that.
*  I never even thought about doing that.
*  But when you know that you're competing against three other assholes and you're like, let's
*  fucking do this, bitch.
*  So everybody's getting up, like all hyped up.
*  And I would get up and I would read the fitness tracker results that, like, Tom had put in
*  fucking 15 miles earlier in the day.
*  I'm like, shit.
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  He's on the East Coast and Ari's doing something crazy where he rides a bike while he's watching
*  a movie for two hours and he's got this crazy high score.
*  I'm like, oh no.
*  And everybody was doing that.
*  So everybody was checking their app and then going and doing crazy shit all day.
*  So by the end of the month, we were literally working out at least three to four hours every
*  day, like hardcore.
*  That's absurd.
*  That's absurd.
*  I did one day, I did more than seven hours at 80% of my max heart rate.
*  Yeah, I worked out all day.
*  How much weight are you losing?
*  I was eating everything.
*  As you're just constantly eating.
*  I didn't lose any weight.
*  Because you're just maintaining.
*  I was also mixing it up so I wasn't going crazy.
*  I was doing cardio and I was also doing weights and I was doing a bunch of other things and
*  I was eating like a wolf.
*  I mean, eating like a wolf broke into a house and just tearing apart the cupboards.
*  It was horrible.
*  I was drinking a lot of soda too.
*  I was craving sugar from actual soda.
*  So I was drinking like a whole sugary cream soda.
*  I did this elliptical machine for I don't know how many hours, but it was at least five,
*  maybe six hours on this elliptical machine.
*  In one fucking sitting?
*  In one sitting.
*  What?
*  Where there's puddles on the ground.
*  the fire alarm in the room from my steam.
*  There's a video of it.
*  I made a video of it.
*  Of the puddles on the ground from my sweat.
*  If you just keep going.
*  If you watch movies that are exciting, and I have this TV right in front of me.
*  I watched the scene in John Wick in the Russian bath house where he kills everybody.
*  I watched that scene 50 times in a row.
*  Oh, you just kept looping it?
*  I just kept going back and watching it again.
*  Because there's something about that scene where you pretend that you're John Wick.
*  Or you pretend you're someone trying to kill John Wick.
*  And you're in the middle of this whole fucking shoot out stab him, cut that guy, look at
*  this one.
*  And it's a fucking super intense scene.
*  So I would just watch that scene over and over and over again.
*  And then I'd watch other movies and I'd get bored and I'd go back to that movie again.
*  And I watched John Wick too a bunch of times too.
*  But the hyper violent scenes, when you watch those, you feel like you're there, like you're
*  locked in.
*  Another thing is fights.
*  I would watch fights all day.
*  While you're on the elliptical.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So if you're on a bike or elliptical or a stair mill or something like that, you can
*  watch fights.
*  And you start seeing stuff happen and you're thinking, oh my god, this guy's, get up, get
*  up, get up, look out.
*  He goes, oh, Jesus, I'm always hungry.
*  And while you're doing that, the excitement of the fights carries you through your workout.
*  Are you listening to you call a fight?
*  Sometimes.
*  That's fucking wild.
*  Yeah, but it's really, it doesn't matter.
*  What matters is good fights.
*  Really it doesn't help me hear my own voice.
*  This is weird.
*  But the good fights, anytime it's a crazy chaotic fight, you'll get hyped up and your
*  mind will think about that more than you think about the burning in your lungs or the burning
*  in your legs.
*  And like just the momentum of something exciting carries you really far.
*  It's like music, music carries you really far.
*  Music for me, when I go run, it's music.
*  That's it.
*  Like I've tried to do on the elliptical when I watch something, I can't do that.
*  I just can't, like I got to have something.
*  Like a music or a podcast or an audio book.
*  Then I can get into it.
*  But if you know that you're going to be on the elliptical for hours.
*  It'd be hard for me to watch.
*  I don't know why, but I don't like watching something when I'm on a machine.
*  That's why, again, the gym for me is just a place to lift weights in between running.
*  I can't be in there.
*  The elliptical, the treadmills, they give me nightmares.
*  I'm like these fucking things.
*  I just got to be outside.
*  You like running outside.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I just can't do it.
*  No, it makes sense.
*  Yeah, I can't do it.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never done a spin class, but people love that shit.
*  Nope, not going to do that.
*  Look at you.
*  I did the Peloton in a hotel.
*  I did Peloton once in a hotel.
*  One time?
*  Yeah.
*  My tush was in such pain.
*  My undercarriage, my grundle, my nifkin and my asshole were in pain.
*  I don't think you're supposed to sit down.
*  Well, I was putting the seat in my asshole.
*  I thought that was what you were supposed to do the whole time.
*  Deep?
*  I spit on it.
*  No, I did it.
*  I did it.
*  I did the workout and it was a great workout.
*  I will say it was awesome.
*  But I don't like bikes that much.
*  I don't like biking that much.
*  It's just not for me.
*  Well, it's always more exciting to do something fun.
*  If you can play a game, if you can play basketball and you get your cardio from that, it's always
*  better.
*  That's great.
*  That's the best.
*  Or soccer.
*  Soccer is an awesome game for cardio.
*  Jesus, who has to be in better cardiovascular shape than soccer players?
*  No, but they run for 90 minutes straight, no breaks.
*  Yeah, and then they have another game tomorrow.
*  Yeah, it's a big day.
*  You got another.
*  All right, boys, rest up.
*  You got one in eight hours.
*  I mean, those dudes are always fucking cutting left and cutting right and stopping.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Those guys are in probably the most high-end cardio shape of all pro athletes.
*  They also pretend to get hurt worse than anybody in any other sport.
*  That's part of the thing.
*  I don't really love that, but it's part of the thing.
*  Ian Edwards was trying to explain it to me one time.
*  I just couldn't.
*  I was like, I don't know.
*  Imagine this is a sport where a big part of the thing is pretending you got hurt.
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  You have to fall down.
*  You have to fall down and pretend you got hurt.
*  Imagine a UFC fight if a guy walks in, flinches, and the other guy's like, and he has to get
*  down in the ref.
*  It's like, I'm warning you, dude.
*  Either hit him, don't flinch.
*  Well, that's like, they're flopping, flopping in the NBA.
*  Flopping is a weird thing, taking fake fall.
*  They do it in the NBA as well?
*  It's a big thing, man.
*  It sucks.
*  It used to not be.
*  I hate it.
*  But it used to not be at all.
*  But the idea is that you can get someone to call foul, trick the ref, and then, yeah.
*  And then when you start to build up fouls against the other team, they can foul out.
*  Why don't they check the replay before they ever do anything like that?
*  They do.
*  They do.
*  So if a guy flops and you know for sure that he's faking it, why can't you penalize him?
*  I mean, that's not part of the game.
*  How about you pull out a bitch card on him?
*  Bitch.
*  You pull out a pink card.
*  Bitch.
*  In soccer, you get a yellow card if you're being a bitch.
*  So you just want to do the basketball.
*  That's coward.
*  That's even better than pink.
*  Because pink can be powerful.
*  You can get a technical in basketball.
*  You can get a technical foul in basketball.
*  So pretending to be hit is a technical foul?
*  They don't really do it for that, though.
*  What do they do it for?
*  Like yelling or fighting or touching their ass.
*  But or if you're enticing some bullshit, like if a guy's flopping and the ref knows he's
*  full of shit and he's trying to entice this guy, he'll give them a tech if they're jawing
*  at each other.
*  Because that's usually what happens.
*  So in one way, it kind of leads down the same road.
*  You end up getting the refs call out the bullshit.
*  They have to do it in a different way.
*  Or they'll hit you with an unnecessary foul to check you to be like, I know what you're
*  up to.
*  You're full of shit.
*  Like, you know, taking a charge means if you stand still, someone's got to run into you.
*  Sometimes they'll call it on you just to be like, you're fucking you.
*  You know you're cheating a little bit.
*  You're stepping in the way.
*  You're breaking the rules.
*  Yeah, I don't I don't know basketball enough to know what's going on.
*  It's like a different the difference, I think, between like a fight and a basketball or an
*  octagon referee versus NBA referee.
*  The guys in the NBA are controlling the game.
*  Every game is different.
*  There's not there are rules, but some are easily bendable or breakable at times, depending
*  on what is actually going on.
*  Like if you might allow a travel if a player doesn't actually get advantage on that.
*  You're right.
*  Just took an extra step.
*  You don't want to slow the game down.
*  You don't want to ruin everything.
*  Say there to get is really kind of the end of it.
*  It's kind of like it's like intervening in a fight too much of a ref is coming.
*  It's like you don't want to you don't want to really fuck up the rhythm of this thing
*  because you know it's for the for the players purpose and the fighters purpose and for the
*  entertain.
*  You're like you're just ruining the fucking thing for everybody.
*  Wasn't there an issue years ago that referees were being paid by like gamblers?
*  Oh, Tim Donahue.
*  There's a whole like he's explained a lot yet about what he said he was betting on advantages
*  that he knew about not necessarily like making something happen in a different way.
*  I call bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  Weren't there referees though that were accused of doing certain things?
*  This guy got caught.
*  He was referee and he went to jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He got caught.
*  This actually happens more often than not.
*  I mean the most famous betting story is Pete Rose in baseball was betting.
*  You know.
*  But he they don't think he did anything to somehow or another.
*  Well he never bet.
*  He never bet on his team's games.
*  That was his thing.
*  He bet on.
*  I thought he did though.
*  I thought someone called bullshit on that.
*  I don't think they ever found it.
*  I don't think they found that.
*  He was I don't think he was betting on his own.
*  Why don't you Google did Pete Rose ever bet on his own games?
*  But anyway so the problem was that he bet on baseball.
*  Well yeah but Tim Donaghy the NBA ref they said they were betting on games.
*  You know what I mean Pete Rose.
*  He said he only bet on his team to win.
*  He never bet against them right.
*  He bet on other games and then only bet on them to get a W.
*  Well man am I wrong in thinking that that should be okay.
*  I don't think it's wrong.
*  If you bet on your team to win.
*  Why wouldn't you bet on your team?
*  Put your money where your mouth is bitch.
*  There's no book of 10 that says in 1960 bet against the team.
*  He bet against them.
*  That's what I read.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Okay so that's the issue.
*  But I think you should be able to bet for your team to win.
*  Can't you in a fight.
*  Yeah for your team to win for sure.
*  Yeah in a fight in Vegas can't you put a bet on you to win.
*  Could you bet on yourself to win.
*  Yeah guys do that.
*  Yeah I think that's totally fine.
*  A lot of fighters have bet on themselves to win.
*  Well why not.
*  I don't understand why not.
*  They should totally be able to do that.
*  But they're a one man team.
*  I think the real question would be if he bet against his team and it says he did and if
*  that is the case and he did something to win the bet and tried to cost his team like made
*  decisions that weren't the best decisions put the wrong people in his pictures.
*  Well then the other side of it is even on a one man team let's say me and you are fighting
*  I bet me to win but you know that you're going to throw the fight and I'm going to get you
*  some of the winnings.
*  Do you know what I mean.
*  That's the other side of it.
*  Oh okay because there's other people involved.
*  Yeah you could definitely do that.
*  We can make agreements.
*  That would be the thing if I said hey man you got to throw this fight.
*  You're basically paying you to throw the fight knowing that I'm betting on myself to win.
*  But yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah and I would bet against myself.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where it gets shady.
*  Well referees in boxing for sure have been shady and so have judges.
*  Judges have been caught for sure rendering decisions that didn't make any sense and then
*  you know.
*  Taken money.
*  Yeah they must have.
*  I mean I don't know how many times they've been like.
*  Let's find out.
*  How many boxing judges, boxing judge arrested for corruption.
*  Just Google that.
*  Pete Rose thing is very confusing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  More about I guess if he bet on him while he was a player versus being a manager.
*  And it says documents obtained by outside lines reflect betting records from 1886 which
*  is when he was a player.
*  1886.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  It showed no evidence that Rose who was a player and manager then bet against his team.
*  Sorry I misread that.
*  Well yeah but that was the stipulation of the Hall of Fame.
*  So there's no evidence that he bet against himself or his team.
*  Good.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean you know what I mean.
*  Like if I was a fucking player and the coach said I just put five grand on you motherfuckers
*  let's do this shit.
*  I'd be like that coach believes in us.
*  Fucking A.
*  He's putting his money on it.
*  You know the stipulations were the argument was whether or not he deserves to be in the
*  Hall of Fame.
*  Of course he does.
*  You know that was the whole thing.
*  Of course he does.
*  Yeah 100%.
*  It's a savage sport where guys are hitting a leather covered ball string.
*  You know.
*  Yeah what do you want.
*  I mean you're smashing this thing into the and you're running around.
*  It's a sport.
*  Sports are all dominated by savages.
*  What is this.
*  Maybe the worst referee I guess.
*  This video is about.
*  It's about the boxing thing.
*  Oh there was a really bad stoppage this past weekend in the UFC.
*  Really bad.
*  Really bad.
*  That gets so much controversy huh.
*  This one was a bad one.
*  It was the worst stoppage I've ever seen.
*  There was this guy.
*  Pull up the.
*  You can find it in the UFC's.
*  I've got to remember how to say this guy's name.
*  What did he claim he stopped the fight.
*  Well the referee.
*  I don't want to call the referee out.
*  There's no need to.
*  Everybody knows who it is.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  He fucked up.
*  Referees fuck up sometimes.
*  He thought the guy was hurt and he wasn't hurt.
*  He was faking it.
*  OK so the Magomed Ankalev.
*  I think that's how you say it.
*  And I forget I say Cudabella's first name.
*  I think it's Eon.
*  I think it's Eon Cudabella.
*  So Cudabella was playing possum.
*  If you watch the video.
*  You can see the video.
*  It looks like he's playing possum.
*  See he's pretending that he's hurt.
*  See he got hit for sure.
*  But look how he's waggling his head back and forth.
*  He's trying to sucker him in for that right hand.
*  He's trying to pretend that he's hurt.
*  And then throw that right hand.
*  And the referee stops the fight while he's throwing punches.
*  But look at him.
*  Look at him.
*  As soon as the referee stops the fight he's like I'm fine.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  That's not a guy who's rocked.
*  If you watch it again you can see that he definitely is getting hit.
*  But you can also see that like when he like that.
*  That's fake.
*  That's wobbly with the head.
*  Well because he's throwing those haymakers.
*  He's trying to lure the guy into thinking that he's so hurt that he can't control himself.
*  And he's trying to throw haymakers.
*  But he's also definitely getting hit too.
*  So I could see how the referee fell for it.
*  But you got to let guys fight.
*  You got to let guys fight.
*  And sometimes referees in the interest of the fighter trying to save a guy from damage.
*  They step in and they make a mistake.
*  That's an easy mistake to make because it is a really bad stoppage.
*  But because of the fact that he was faking like he was hurt.
*  But he wasn't faking like he was hurt enough to stop a fight.
*  No it didn't look like it.
*  When a guy's swinging back with big wild haymakers he can win at any time.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean we've seen that in a lot of fights.
*  A few of those look fucking brutal.
*  I mean there's been many many fights where you see a guy win a fight that he's getting
*  dominated because he catches a guy who gets overzealous and tries to finish him off.
*  That's what we got robbed of.
*  The referee fucked up.
*  Or the referee, I mean he fucked up.
*  But he also was a little bit tricked by this guy trying to lure this guy in by pretending
*  and then exploding.
*  He didn't look like he...
*  But even if the guy was really that rocked it wasn't enough to stop the fight.
*  That guy was throwing back.
*  He was defending himself.
*  He was moving back with his hands up and he was throwing a fight.
*  The fight just doesn't end when someone gets hit.
*  Right.
*  No the fight ends when you can't protect yourself anymore.
*  When he was defenseless.
*  He was not defenseless.
*  He was very dangerous still.
*  That was a bummer to watch.
*  That's one of those things.
*  Real bad.
*  Well you feel bad for the guy.
*  He fucked up a little bit.
*  The referee's not a bad guy.
*  He just fucked up.
*  And then the fighter, you've got to think that guy trained for months for that moment.
*  And he's trying to sucker this guy in.
*  I mean maybe he's got this thing that he does.
*  Is he Russian?
*  He pretends like he's hurt.
*  I don't know where Cudabella's from.
*  Cause that ref's gonna die for sure.
*  I don't remember.
*  If he's Russian that ref's dead.
*  Ref's dead in a month.
*  I don't think it's a corruption thing.
*  I think that's just a mistake.
*  It's fucking hard man.
*  Moldova.
*  Moldova.
*  Moldova.
*  It's a fucking hard job man.
*  You're in there.
*  These dudes are throwing their fucking knees in each other's faces and head kicking each
*  other.
*  And it's just you.
*  Yes.
*  That's the other thing.
*  Other sports have many refs.
*  You're the only one dude.
*  When do I stop it?
*  When do I stop it?
*  Fuck that.
*  The pressure is insane.
*  So many other sports can rely on other referees to go oh shit I think we fucked up.
*  Or I fucked up.
*  This one is like.
*  It's this dude.
*  That was a bad call.
*  Yeah that was a bad call.
*  But it happens.
*  It's a hard gig Tantino.
*  It's a tough gig to do.
*  Bro you didn't even talk about your show.
*  You have a new show.
*  I got a new show.
*  Doesn't it come out today or something?
*  Comes out today.
*  It comes out today.
*  March 4th?
*  It's already March 4th.
*  Comes out today.
*  How is it March 4th?
*  I don't know.

*  You and that little dicky!
*  Me and little dicky!
*  Hey!
*  There it is.
*  Who's that guy?
*  Wait, wait, hold on.
*  Play my...
*  When you play a clip...
*  When you play a clip about what I said about the show,
*  I can't believe they left it in.
*  Is that little dicky's parents?
*  That's his parents that play his parents on the show.
*  Look, at the very end there's a clip I say,
*  Nah, keep going.
*  Me, that's me talking head.
*  Listen to what I say about the show, you're gonna love it.
*  Turn this up.
*  And everyone should be embarrassed to be a part of it.
*  Alright.
*  It's a great show.
*  I actually think it's gonna be one of the best shows ever.
*  Little dicky thinks it's gonna be one of the best shows ever.
*  So congratulations on being a part of one of the best shows ever.
*  I hope so.
*  I just think it's funny the FX guy was like,
*  How do you think?
*  You know, they're fucking rousing me into saying something.
*  I go, I think it's one of the worst shows of all time
*  and everyone should be embarrassed to be a part of it.
*  And he's looking at me like,
*  What the fuck?
*  What are you...
*  I'm like, dude, I'm a comedian.
*  It's a joke.
*  What the fuck?
*  This is a comedy.
*  Like...
*  And they took it so serious.
*  I was like, dude, Jesus.
*  And they're making comedy.
*  No, these are the...
*  Get out of there.
*  Come back to the store.
*  No, no.
*  Why are you on TV?
*  Stop it.
*  See?
*  No, you know, these are the guys that are doing the promo,
*  the advertising company.
*  You know, they come in and be like,
*  Hey, tell us about the show.
*  It's like, what do you want me to fucking say?
*  I'm never good at those.
*  You need a better agent.
*  That has nothing to do...
*  No.
*  Agent shields you from that and says,
*  Mr. Santino, please don't talk to people that don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  That's like when you go to a premiere,
*  when you do a premiere,
*  they ask these questions and I...
*  Don't go to the premiere.
*  I have... You have to.
*  You don't have to.
*  You do. It's in your contract.
*  You gotta go.
*  Joe, see what he does?
*  You see?
*  Stop fucking laughing.
*  This is him just baiting me to get angry about it.
*  You have to go.
*  I don't have a choice.
*  Look, but the show is good.
*  People watch the show.
*  It's gonna be good.
*  Yeah, the show is good.
*  Watch the show.
*  It's gonna be fucking funny.
*  And if it's not, it's all Joe Rogan's fault.
*  You seem aggressive.
*  Because you know how to get my goat.
*  Like you don't fucking know.
*  Watch the show.
*  Watch the show on...
*  You in town Thursday night?
*  No, I go to...
*  I'm in Philly this weekend.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  You leave when? Thursday?
*  Thursday.
*  I'm in Philly all weekend.
*  Where are you?
*  Punchline in Philly.
*  Nice.
*  Come see me in Philly.
*  Nice. Telling them good jokes.
*  Domarera called me last night.
*  Who are you working with there?
*  An incredible young comic named Chris O'Connor,
*  who's great, dude.
*  I say young comic.
*  He's my...
*  We're the...
*  You know, young guy, I mean.
*  He's...
*  He's from Philly guy, now lives in New York.
*  He's fucking phenomenal.
*  So he'll be out there with me having some fun
*  and then a local young, probably funny host, hopefully.
*  Beautiful.
*  Is tickets still available?
*  A few are still left.
*  A few are still left for Philly,
*  and then I've got a bunch of dates.
*  Cincinnati, I'm going to fucking butt fuck Ohio.
*  Is it Cheeto Santino?
*  Oh, probably.
*  He's shitting on Ohio again.
*  He knows how...
*  He knows it's all love.
*  Easy.
*  Good luck going there.
*  They take Ohio seriously.
*  Dude, Ohio is too...
*  Yeah, I'm doing Cincinnati and Cleveland at the end of the month,
*  but no, all that stuff is on andrewsantino.com,
*  and then you and I have some fun together in 420, baby.
*  Woo!
*  That I'm excited for.
*  You and me and the Golden Pony.
*  That's right.
*  We're flying all the way to Vancouver.
*  I can't wait for that.
*  There's still some tickets, but not much.
*  A lot of nosebleeds left,
*  but we're doing an arena on 420 in Vancouver.
*  And how many seats do you know?
*  Do you remember?
*  It's thousands.
*  Thousands?
*  Thousands and thousands.
*  Yeah, man, I'm happy.
*  It's like 13,000 or something like that.
*  Oh, I love doing it.
*  I love doing my own shows,
*  and I love coming and doing your big fucking massive,
*  insane shows.
*  Those are ridiculous.
*  I'm still not used to them.
*  Arenas?
*  How could you ever get used to...
*  It's such a weird...
*  It's so weird.
*  But you don't love it as much as when we do theaters.
*  I love all of it.
*  You see, but don't you have...
*  Don't you like theaters more connective...
*  It is, but there's something wild about doing 14,000 people.
*  Like that San Diego 420 last year.
*  That was fucking wild.
*  That shit was wild.
*  Also, we got high before,
*  and I thought I got nervous.
*  Like I got to do push-ups or sit-ups.
*  I got too baked.
*  14,000 people in an arena on 420.
*  It was awesome.
*  It's gonna happen again in Vancouver this year.
*  Yeah, I'm excited.
*  All right.
*  You too, brother.
*  No, it's Andrew Santino.
*  You should make it Cheetosantino.com.
*  No, it's Cheetosantino...
*  Oh, oh, my website's Andrew Santino,
*  but it's Cheetosantino across social media.
*  Who has Cheetosantino.com?
*  I can't fuck with Cheetos,
*  because Lays will sue me.
*  But just get Cheetosantino.com,
*  so someone doesn't fuck it up.
*  I'm gonna do it before they shut me down.
*  Okay.
*  We should probably edit that part out,
*  so people don't hear it.
*  Goodbye, everybody!
*  Have fun, show!
