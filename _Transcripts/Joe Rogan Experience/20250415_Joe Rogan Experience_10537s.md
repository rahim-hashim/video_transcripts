*  I'm just so empty inside. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=21.0s)]
*  This fills the hole for like, like, it's like, you know, you go by, you're like, oh, and then you get home and go, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=23.0s)]
*  I hate my life. I hate my insides and no spirituality. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=29.0s)]
*  But I get to look at my emptiness on, you know, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=34.0s)]
*  Dripping with rapper diamonds. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=38.0s)]
*  I ran out of shit to buy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=40.0s)]
*  So like, there's nothing left. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=44.0s)]
*  What car are you driving? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=46.0s)]
*  Alexis IS 350. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=47.0s)]
*  Oh, those are fun. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=49.0s)]
*  It's nice. That's a good car. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=50.0s)]
*  Bulletproof. Never, never going to break. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=51.0s)]
*  And it's so fast. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=55.0s)]
*  You know, it's but this is how fucked it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=56.0s)]
*  OK, so the two. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=58.0s)]
*  OK, I had the Lexus 350, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=60.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=63.0s)]
*  I went and I had it for seven months, maybe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=64.0s)]
*  I went in to get it serviced and I was kind of depressed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=67.0s)]
*  So I bought a different car. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=73.0s)]
*  I said, I go, this is fucked up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=75.0s)]
*  So I bought the IS 350. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=78.0s)]
*  I had the other car for seven fucking months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=81.0s)]
*  I go, you know what? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=83.0s)]
*  That one looks cool. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=84.0s)]
*  So I bought that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=85.0s)]
*  And then I went in to get it that service. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=87.0s)]
*  And it was the exact same car a year later. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=91.0s)]
*  But I like the newer color, the newer gray, that gray, that whatever weird gray, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=94.0s)]
*  a slate gray. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=100.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it looks good. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=101.0s)]
*  I said, you know what? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=103.0s)]
*  Fuck. Give me this car. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=104.0s)]
*  I keep swapping them out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=108.0s)]
*  They must love you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=109.0s)]
*  I'm such a mooch. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=110.0s)]
*  I'm one year on my wife's birthday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=111.0s)]
*  I bought myself a new car. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=114.0s)]
*  I bought a BMW on her birthday. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=116.0s)]
*  Happy birthday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=119.0s)]
*  We could drive around in this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=121.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=123.0s)]
*  That probably played off well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=124.0s)]
*  Ah, fuck. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=125.0s)]
*  I buy her cars. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=126.0s)]
*  So, you know, I get bored easy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=131.0s)]
*  I get bored easy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=136.0s)]
*  And it's because of, you know, in life, in life, really, like, I see some of my friends [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=137.0s)]
*  doing arenas, doing this, doing that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=146.0s)]
*  But I have enough. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=149.0s)]
*  I really have enough. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=150.0s)]
*  But it's not enough. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=152.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=155.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=157.0s)]
*  One, I think for my, not for my personal life, my personal life, I got three fucking great [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=158.0s)]
*  daughters, three grandkids, another one on the way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=165.0s)]
*  My seventh year old is going to go to college, has a pick of all kinds of schools, you know, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=170.0s)]
*  good schools. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=176.0s)]
*  I fucking, in 11th grade, I raised my hand and go to the bathroom and I never came back. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=177.0s)]
*  I just walked out. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=182.0s)]
*  Like, I'm a fucking idiot, you know, my past. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=183.0s)]
*  And my kids all grew up, okay, the older one married a black guy, but he's light skinned. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=187.0s)]
*  Anyhow, the prettiest baby on the planet. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=192.0s)]
*  So, I have enough. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=196.0s)]
*  But when it comes to career as a comic, and you know, just one more fucking thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=199.0s)]
*  Just one more thing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=207.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=208.0s)]
*  I do know what you're saying. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=209.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=211.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=213.0s)]
*  You know, I've had specials, not Netflix, but it's always, it's like I'm always doing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=214.0s)]
*  the other club. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=219.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=220.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=221.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=222.0s)]
*  I'm always, and I'm very blessed and I love what I've achieved in this business, but it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=223.0s)]
*  seems like it's always like, okay, I got a special on Amazon now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=230.0s)]
*  But it's not, it wasn't, Amazon didn't buy it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=237.0s)]
*  We placed it on that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=242.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=243.0s)]
*  So, it's always, there's always one little thing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=244.0s)]
*  One thing, when every pilot my wife and I have had together, or I've had, gets this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=247.0s)]
*  close to getting picked up. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=252.0s)]
*  You know, I've heard, some of the no's I've heard, they almost sounded like yeses. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=254.0s)]
*  They were such good no's. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=259.0s)]
*  I walked out and go, that was the best no today. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=260.0s)]
*  That fucking no almost felt like a yes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=263.0s)]
*  So, in this business. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=266.0s)]
*  Do you think you put something in your mind to make all these things kind of fall short? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=268.0s)]
*  Have you ever thought of that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=273.0s)]
*  Well, that's what my wife says. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=276.0s)]
*  Do you ever thought that like maybe the way you interface with the world is like your [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=277.0s)]
*  expectations are tempered, like in a way where you almost want to fail because it's more [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=281.0s)]
*  comforting that it happened again, rather than this new thing of success, which is going [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=288.0s)]
*  to force you to really focus and work harder to get more success. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=293.0s)]
*  And it's a lot of pressure. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=297.0s)]
*  And then you think about all the times you fucked up before and you don't want to hear, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=299.0s)]
*  you don't want to hear no again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=304.0s)]
*  You don't want to hear it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=306.0s)]
*  But you feel like it's coming and you almost make it come. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=307.0s)]
*  Well, I get that in life, growing up from my childhood through drug addiction, I became [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=310.0s)]
*  comfortable being uncomfortable. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=319.0s)]
*  That was my life. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=321.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=322.0s)]
*  Comfortable being in the skids. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=323.0s)]
*  Being uncomfortable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=325.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=326.0s)]
*  This was what I was used to. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=327.0s)]
*  In this business, I don't really ever set myself up for failure. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=329.0s)]
*  I mean, I produce, I come up with albums. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=335.0s)]
*  I'm always coming up with new material and I got seven albums. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=339.0s)]
*  I'll probably make an eighth album, which is a pretty, it's a lot for a career, I would [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=343.0s)]
*  imagine. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=350.0s)]
*  I don't go into clubs and drink. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=351.0s)]
*  I don't hit on waitresses. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=353.0s)]
*  You know, so I don't know. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=357.0s)]
*  But my wife says the exact same thing you're saying. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=359.0s)]
*  My wife said to me once, she said, because I had this power of thinking, like when I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=362.0s)]
*  think really hard, it comes to me shit, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=368.0s)]
*  And my wife goes, if you think you deserve a million dollars, you'll get a million dollars. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=371.0s)]
*  And I said, God gives you what you need, not what you want. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=380.0s)]
*  And then she said, do you think Chelsea Handler needed a TV show? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=385.0s)]
*  So she kind of like debunked my whole need, you know, and want thing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=389.0s)]
*  I, if you believe in some kind of power greater than your spiritual, I'm not religious by [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=394.0s)]
*  any fucking, but shit comes to me. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=405.0s)]
*  I don't think I fucking screw things up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=410.0s)]
*  I don't screw things up like, you know, in meetings or when we do pilots or whatever. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=416.0s)]
*  I do what I'm supposed to do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=421.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=422.0s)]
*  I mean, in comedy, yeah, for years, I might have been a little aggressive on stage or [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=423.0s)]
*  a little whatever. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=430.0s)]
*  But, you know, I think everything now, especially now with clubs or whatever, it's all numbers. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=433.0s)]
*  They don't give a fuck if you light the waitstaff on fire. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=441.0s)]
*  If you sold out the room, they go, oh, great. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=445.0s)]
*  You were fabulous. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=447.0s)]
*  You know, I was, I was working catch years ago. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=448.0s)]
*  I was at catch and Bill Hicks. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=451.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=455.0s)]
*  So David Brenner's on stage and this is, they love David Brenner. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=456.0s)]
*  He's killing, killing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=459.0s)]
*  He is during the peak of David Brenner. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=461.0s)]
*  He gets off, Bill Hicks goes up and he says, growing up as a kid, I would see Robert Klein [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=465.0s)]
*  and David Brenner and I figure if they could do it, I could do it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=472.0s)]
*  That was his opening show. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=476.0s)]
*  So now he's doing his bit about Nancy Reagan, skinny, whatever, and call her the anti-crisis. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=478.0s)]
*  I mean, people are running out the door. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=485.0s)]
*  They're running out the door. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=488.0s)]
*  And then he gets off stage and he, he says to me, he goes, what went wrong? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=490.0s)]
*  But I swear to God, he goes, what was wrong? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=495.0s)]
*  Was he serious? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=499.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=500.0s)]
*  Or was he joking around? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=501.0s)]
*  No, he was, he was, whatever. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=502.0s)]
*  He was building. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=503.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=504.0s)]
*  It's hard to tell with him. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=505.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=506.0s)]
*  But anyhow, the manager or Booker, now after I said to him, you can come and do a spot [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=507.0s)]
*  here anytime you want because he was Bill Hicks. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=514.0s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=517.0s)]
*  He was Bill Hicks. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=518.0s)]
*  You know, I worked with him in Texas. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=519.0s)]
*  So when I first started and I'm watching him, you know, and we'll get back on track. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=521.0s)]
*  I'm sorry to go off on these things. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=529.0s)]
*  Go wherever you want to go. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=531.0s)]
*  So we're working in Texas. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=532.0s)]
*  He, he just breaks up. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=535.0s)]
*  His girlfriend breaks up with him at the time. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=537.0s)]
*  That's a true story. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=539.0s)]
*  So he goes, where can you get a hooker, a prostitute and a cab driver? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=540.0s)]
*  I'd like to have you clarify. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=547.0s)]
*  That's a lot of these young kids now that listen. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=548.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=551.0s)]
*  A prostitute. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=552.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=554.0s)]
*  So a cab driver takes them to one house because they would take you to the and, and I go with [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=555.0s)]
*  him. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=563.0s)]
*  He goes, take a ride. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=564.0s)]
*  So then we go to one house. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=565.0s)]
*  She knocks on the door and she opens the door and goes, you're a cop and slammed the door [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=567.0s)]
*  on him. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=572.0s)]
*  He's young, slammed the door in his face. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=574.0s)]
*  Then he went, but he also, the next place the cab driver took him, she opened the door [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=580.0s)]
*  and goes, you're too young and slammed the door on him. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=585.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=588.0s)]
*  The next night he did 10 minutes or whatever on how he can't, can't pick up a prostitute [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=589.0s)]
*  in Lubbock, Texas. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=596.0s)]
*  And I go, I'll never be this funny as long as I fucking live. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=597.0s)]
*  I've watched people going amazing. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=602.0s)]
*  You know, and then I was running them with Bastille. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=606.0s)]
*  That's when I was running with Bastille. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=611.0s)]
*  Frankie Bastille? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=612.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=613.0s)]
*  So he, I'll tell you a good story. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=614.0s)]
*  He's a wild fella. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=615.0s)]
*  I think I told you this story. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=616.0s)]
*  I've told this story and it's been told, but I don't know if I told it last years ago when [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=617.0s)]
*  I did this. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=621.0s)]
*  And then I'll get back to it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=623.0s)]
*  I'm not self-sabotaging. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=624.0s)]
*  That's what you were getting to in my head, in my self-sabotaging. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=627.0s)]
*  No, not self-sabotaging. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=630.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a self-sabotage thing. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=632.0s)]
*  It's a not understanding the energy that you're putting out there and being accustomed to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=635.0s)]
*  a certain result. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=640.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=641.0s)]
*  If you're accustomed to missing your playing pool, you're accustomed to missing the nineball, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=642.0s)]
*  you're going to miss that fucking nineball every time. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=646.0s)]
*  Well, it happens in golf too. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=648.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=650.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=651.0s)]
*  You got to reset the way you think about things. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=652.0s)]
*  And if there's something that's eating away at you that bothers you, that occupies your [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=656.0s)]
*  thoughts, you have to figure out what that is and clean that up. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=662.0s)]
*  That's a big part of the problem with a lot of people. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=666.0s)]
*  A lot of the problems with a lot of people is maybe they don't like something about themselves, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=669.0s)]
*  they don't like what they've done, they don't like choices they've made, and that's in your [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=673.0s)]
*  head all the time. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=678.0s)]
*  The lack of clarity, the lack of peace is in your head all the time. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=681.0s)]
*  This is not an easy thing I'm saying. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=687.0s)]
*  I'm not saying this is like, okay, here's the real formula, just go out, follow these [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=689.0s)]
*  three steps, and you're going to be rich and famous. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=693.0s)]
*  It's not that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=696.0s)]
*  It's just that success generally happens when you've got as many pieces as possible in order [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=697.0s)]
*  correctly. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=705.0s)]
*  And failure generally happens when you're overwhelmed by too many things that are not [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=706.0s)]
*  working right. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=713.0s)]
*  And your attention and your focus is on them. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=715.0s)]
*  You're divided. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=720.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of times you see it's like a terrible relationship. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=721.0s)]
*  I've known a lot of really talented people that sabotage themselves with a terrible [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=724.0s)]
*  relationship. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=728.0s)]
*  And they think somehow or another that this is just how relationships are, and they think [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=729.0s)]
*  how terrible relationships are, and they're terrible in that relationship. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=734.0s)]
*  And then they can never be who they could be. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=738.0s)]
*  They can never reach their full potential because they're always burdened down by these [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=742.0s)]
*  fucking squabbles they're having with their girlfriend or their boyfriend. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=746.0s)]
*  That's also true. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=750.0s)]
*  A God thing where you think I could fix this person or I could change him. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=752.0s)]
*  No one can change him. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=756.0s)]
*  That's Brian Callan. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=758.0s)]
*  Brian Callan his whole life. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=759.0s)]
*  I would tell him, get out now. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=761.0s)]
*  I met a girlfriend. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=763.0s)]
*  I'd be like, get out now. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=764.0s)]
*  I met a girl. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=765.0s)]
*  I'm one girl that he dated. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=766.0s)]
*  I literally within five seconds of saying hello to her, I go, come here. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=767.0s)]
*  I pulled the massage. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=770.0s)]
*  Cut to, okay. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=772.0s)]
*  He doesn't listen. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=773.0s)]
*  You know, later that night, like she's drinking wine. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=774.0s)]
*  She's fucking hammer. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=777.0s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=778.0s)]
*  Like she winds up living with him, eventually figures it out, gets rid of her. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=779.0s)]
*  A couple years later, he's walking down the street on Sunset and she's street walking. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=783.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=787.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=788.0s)]
*  Girl he was living with at one point in time. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=789.0s)]
*  This is Brian Callan. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=790.0s)]
*  He's like, he felt abandoned when he was young. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=791.0s)]
*  And so he, I believe I'm speaking for him. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=794.0s)]
*  And so he's a sweet guy and he tries to reach out and fix people. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=797.0s)]
*  Well, here's my Brian Callan story. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=802.0s)]
*  It's very funny. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=804.0s)]
*  I was middling for him at Carolines, which will never happen again because Carolines is close. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=805.0s)]
*  I'm middling for him. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=814.0s)]
*  So I get off stage and I'm singling. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=816.0s)]
*  This fucking smoking hot girl comes up to me and she goes, come on, let's leave. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=819.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=826.0s)]
*  I go, I got to sell my DVDs or CDs. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=828.0s)]
*  I have to sell my DVDs or CDs after the show. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=834.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there selling CDs and I see Brian walk out with her right past me up the stairs. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=838.0s)]
*  I fucked up. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=844.0s)]
*  But maybe I didn't. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=846.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=847.0s)]
*  Well, you definitely didn't because Bonnie's awesome. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=848.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=850.0s)]
*  It worked out for you in the long run. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=851.0s)]
*  But it's, yeah, you definitely should have left with her. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=853.0s)]
*  No, I shouldn't have because that's where, that in life is where I was supposed to be at that time when I was there. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=856.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=863.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=864.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=865.0s)]
*  No, you're correct. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=866.0s)]
*  Anything could happen. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=867.0s)]
*  And also, what if she's a nightmare and then you miss out on whatever, 400, 500 bucks you would have made selling DVDs. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=868.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't make that much. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=873.0s)]
*  I never did. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=875.0s)]
*  100? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=876.0s)]
*  Even 100? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=877.0s)]
*  Now you're going to a nice restaurant and eating there. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=878.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=881.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=882.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=883.0s)]
*  You know, it's this whole negative thing with my, and this is an ego by any stretch when I say stuff like this. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=884.0s)]
*  And I've, and my wife, I know I've earned respect from my peers. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=897.0s)]
*  I know it because I've done it from, from white to black comics, black comics that most white comics don't even know. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=905.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=912.0s)]
*  You know, we did a lot of those rooms. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=913.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=916.0s)]
*  I ended all those TV shows. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=917.0s)]
*  I did them all. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=918.0s)]
*  You know, please. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=919.0s)]
*  I started black comedy. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=920.0s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=922.0s)]
*  You can only hold a white man down so long. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=924.0s)]
*  So, and, and like, I think in life, I'm more about respect than accomplishment. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=927.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=937.0s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=938.0s)]
*  So you, you more about the respect from your peers. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=939.0s)]
*  Not only my peers, the industry too though. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=941.0s)]
*  The industry doesn't know, like say some club owner, let's say a club owner. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=944.0s)]
*  They're not sitting in the room watching your shows. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=948.0s)]
*  All they care about are the fucking numbers that come in. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=951.0s)]
*  I had a club owner once I said to him, and you're lucky you're way out of that, but I'm still, I'm in that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=954.0s)]
*  So I said to a club owner once he goes, I said, look, I'm as funny as I've ever been right now in life. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=961.0s)]
*  He goes, that doesn't fucking matter. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=966.0s)]
*  What does that matter? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=968.0s)]
*  And it's all a quick fix. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=969.0s)]
*  You know, they just want to sell tickets. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=971.0s)]
*  Sell tickets. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=973.0s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=974.0s)]
*  They got to keep the doors open. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=975.0s)]
*  But that's the weird marriage between the club owner and the comic. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=976.0s)]
*  You know, I used to tell comics, you know, we're not. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=979.0s)]
*  Every comic feels like they're battling it with club owners. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=983.0s)]
*  Like the club owner's never given them enough money. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=987.0s)]
*  The club owner's fucking them over. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=989.0s)]
*  Lied about it being sold out. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=991.0s)]
*  It was definitely sold out. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=992.0s)]
*  I want my bonus. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=993.0s)]
*  That kind of shit. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=994.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=995.0s)]
*  You don't want to be a club owner. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=996.0s)]
*  You don't. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=997.0s)]
*  You don't. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=998.0s)]
*  I mean, I give that advice and I became one, but just by necessity. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=999.0s)]
*  But I was like, this is an important relationship. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1003.0s)]
*  You got to be nice to them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1005.0s)]
*  And so they respect you. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1006.0s)]
*  You should because everybody in the beginning, you feel like you're [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1008.0s)]
*  ignored by them. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1011.0s)]
*  But it's a weird thing because they're just in the business of comedy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1013.0s)]
*  Unless you get like like Brian Dorfman and Zanies. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1018.0s)]
*  He really loves comedy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1021.0s)]
*  You know, there's a few Wendy from from Comedy Works in Denver. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1022.0s)]
*  I'll tell my Wendy story. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1025.0s)]
*  I love one. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1026.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1027.0s)]
*  Good story. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1028.0s)]
*  You'll like it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1029.0s)]
*  OK. But my point is, it's like. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1030.0s)]
*  Well, Corey in Rhode Island's one of the best fucking nicest guys on the planet. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1032.0s)]
*  Rhode Island's. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1036.0s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1037.0s)]
*  Comedy Connection. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1038.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1039.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1040.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1041.0s)]
*  Mark and Rochester. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1043.0s)]
*  James and governors. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1044.0s)]
*  The comedy connection in Rhode Island's weird because you're in a bank. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1046.0s)]
*  It's I know. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's how bad the market's doing. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1049.0s)]
*  Well, that was in the 80s. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1053.0s)]
*  He did that. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1055.0s)]
*  That was when I was a kid. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1056.0s)]
*  It's such a cool. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1057.0s)]
*  He fixed the whole thing up. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1058.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the whole camera system. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1059.0s)]
*  It's a great club. It was always a great club. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1061.0s)]
*  Plus, there's not a lot in Rhode Island. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1062.0s)]
*  So when you go there, people are so happy to see you. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1064.0s)]
*  It's yeah, it's my. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1066.0s)]
*  And I'm not bad mouth in her when I don't know her like this. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1070.0s)]
*  So I worked a club twice and the second time I worked there was Halloween weekend. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1073.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a guy in the audience in blackface, whatever, you know, so really? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1081.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was I don't know, 10, 15 years ago. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1086.0s)]
*  10, 15 years ago. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1089.0s)]
*  Ten years ago. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1090.0s)]
*  But wait a second. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1091.0s)]
*  So she. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1092.0s)]
*  She wasn't even there the week. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1094.0s)]
*  OK, she tells my manager I did a lot of crowd work, whatever. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1096.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1100.0s)]
*  So anyhow, this is so I'm working Syracuse Funny Bone and my middle very funny guy. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1101.0s)]
*  I think he passed away. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1110.0s)]
*  He was an older guy, really great joke writer. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1111.0s)]
*  He's from Denver. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1115.0s)]
*  He goes, Oh, I do a podcast, Wendy, and he sees that I'm closing. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1116.0s)]
*  And he goes, I'll talk to her. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1120.0s)]
*  So I email Wendy and I go, Hey, listen, why don't we start from scratch? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1123.0s)]
*  Let bygones be bygones. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1128.0s)]
*  Start over. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1131.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1132.0s)]
*  You know, I'd love to come back in and she doesn't get back to me. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1133.0s)]
*  So I write, by your lack of response, it looks like you want to move forward. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1137.0s)]
*  Here are some available dates. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1142.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1145.0s)]
*  She doesn't get back to me again. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1148.0s)]
*  Shocker. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1150.0s)]
*  Shocker. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1151.0s)]
*  And I write, Can I bring my own middle? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1152.0s)]
*  What do I care? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1156.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1157.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1158.0s)]
*  I'm trying to be funny. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1159.0s)]
*  So she was just upset that you did crowd work. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1160.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1161.0s)]
*  Well, she was. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1162.0s)]

*  There's shit that goes off in your head. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1517.0s)]
*  Even when you lose, you're like, I mean, I... [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1521.0s)]
*  Makes you feel like you're alive. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1526.0s)]
*  Something's happening. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1528.0s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1529.0s)]
*  I'm a guy who's been playing dice, and I walk to the table with 300 bucks, crap table. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1531.0s)]
*  And it's me and the whole table is... [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1536.0s)]
*  I mean, I held the dice for almost an hour, 300, I turned into 5,000. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1539.0s)]
*  The table's going nuts. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1545.0s)]
*  I'm winning everybody formula and diapers at the table. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1547.0s)]
*  They're fucking yelling, can't with that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1551.0s)]
*  And it's just such a... [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1553.0s)]
*  And then for the rest of the week, I didn't gamble again because I go, I can't follow [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1555.0s)]
*  that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1560.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that again. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1561.0s)]
*  So it's not like I'm obsessed with it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1563.0s)]
*  Numbers I am kind of, but I've been to casinos and worked for three, four days and not even [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1567.0s)]
*  played. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1574.0s)]
*  But when I do, it's like... [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1575.0s)]
*  Like me, my wife and I were in Canada and we went to a casino. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1579.0s)]
*  I go, well, let me go back to the hotel and put some... [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1583.0s)]
*  Put my credit cards and money there. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1587.0s)]
*  And she goes, you can't go into a casino with all your money and credit cards. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1589.0s)]
*  I go... [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1594.0s)]
*  How does she ask that question? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1595.0s)]
*  She knows you. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1597.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1598.0s)]
*  She should know you can't. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1599.0s)]
*  She's fucking with you. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1600.0s)]
*  Well, she knows you can. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1601.0s)]
*  Yeah, but she does... [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1602.0s)]
*  She should say good for you. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1603.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1604.0s)]
*  Yeah, she should say good for you. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1605.0s)]
*  That's smart. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1606.0s)]
*  But she didn't know me when I was an addict. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1607.0s)]
*  She never saw me when I was out there. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1610.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I... [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1612.0s)]
*  Well, I guess I did. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1613.0s)]
*  I knew you when you were an addict. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1614.0s)]
*  But you cleaned up nice. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1615.0s)]
*  You really did. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1618.0s)]
*  You figured it out well. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1619.0s)]
*  You really did. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1621.0s)]
*  So she should know that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1622.0s)]
*  Yeah, not to go to the casino with... [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1624.0s)]
*  A little bit more supportive. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1626.0s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1627.0s)]
*  How about that, Bonnie? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1628.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1629.0s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1635.0s)]

*  There's a few... [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1642.0s)]
*  People say comics shouldn't date comics. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1643.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know about that, because sometimes it fucking works really well. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1646.0s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1650.0s)]
*  Come home to a dentist? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1651.0s)]

*  trash. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1662.0s)]

*  So you're talking shit. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1672.0s)]
*  Well, to be a male comic, you've got to be fucked up. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1674.0s)]
*  To be a female comic, that's a whole other level of fucking up. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1678.0s)]
*  Because they go on a road. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1682.0s)]
*  They've got to worry about everything. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1684.0s)]
*  They've got to worry about fans. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1687.0s)]
*  Or females. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1688.0s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1699.0s)]
*  I always use it as an example, because comics will say all the time, don't date comics. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1700.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know about that. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1705.0s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1709.0s)]
*  Because why not? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1711.0s)]
*  I don't think you should never date... [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1712.0s)]
*  Although I stopped dating Italians when I was 21. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1714.0s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1717.0s)]

*  She was swinging, I was like, I can't believe she's swinging at me. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1723.0s)]
*  Like while this was happening, her arm was pulling back, it was coming towards my face, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1726.0s)]
*  like, I can't fucking believe this is happening. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1730.0s)]
*  Well, I only date Irish, like I can't afford a Jew brawn. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1733.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't fucking Irish. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1738.0s)]
*  I'd rather go to fucking Marshalls and Barneys. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1741.0s)]
*  Well, also like you probably... [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1744.0s)]
*  The thing about Jewish women, the stereotype is that they're very controlling. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1747.0s)]
*  It's like how the mom is. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1751.0s)]
*  It's like you take that role of like the mom of the house, then your wife becomes your mom. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1755.0s)]
*  That's the stereotype. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1760.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's always that way. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1761.0s)]

*  And we started dating. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1785.0s)]
*  I mean, I was already in the business for I don't know how many years. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1787.0s)]
*  It's like they say don't date comics. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1790.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, if you're a new comic and they're a new comic, it's going to be competition the whole time. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1792.0s)]
*  It's going to be jealousy. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1799.0s)]
*  But I was already established and she was established. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1801.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't have to be. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1803.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1805.0s)]
*  It could be. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1806.0s)]
*  But it doesn't... like these like hard, fast rules, they don't work. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1807.0s)]
*  It all completely depends on the individual. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1811.0s)]
*  I mean, how different are comics? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1813.0s)]
*  Like how different are you to Shane Gillis? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1815.0s)]
*  How different am I to Ari Shaffir? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1817.0s)]
*  Like we're all different. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1819.0s)]

*  That's right. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1857.0s)]
*  It was the 80s. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1858.0s)]
*  You don't remember, you might remember, we were working a one nighter in Seaside, New Jersey. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1859.0s)]
*  It was my ex-wife and me, you and her took a walk to the boardwalk. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1864.0s)]
*  We were in Seaside right on the boardwalk and it was just me, you and her. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1869.0s)]
*  I think you just came down from Boston and I don't think you were living in New York. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1874.0s)]
*  We were just doing some shows, some one nighters and shit and we did a one nighter. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1879.0s)]
*  Okay, I probably first... [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1886.0s)]
*  It had to be, I got 39 years with her, probably like 38 years ago. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1887.0s)]
*  That doesn't even make sense because I've been doing comedy for 37 years. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1894.0s)]
*  Okay, so then, okay, I was with Bonnie, I mean Kelly. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1901.0s)]
*  So I had, you're right, I had... [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1906.0s)]
*  How did you like 1990 then? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1908.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had like four years clean. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1909.0s)]
*  90 was when I first started coming to New York. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1911.0s)]
*  You were already clean by then? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1915.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and I was already married. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1917.0s)]
*  So yeah, I had five years clean. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1919.0s)]
*  So it was maybe like 34 years ago, which could fall, or 35. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1921.0s)]
*  So yeah, we're working a one nighter and I remember walking up the street, me, you and Bonnie, to the boardwalk. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1926.0s)]
*  It was to the boardwalk. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1937.0s)]
*  I mean Kelly, Kelly. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1938.0s)]
*  To the boardwalk. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1940.0s)]
*  To the boardwalk and it was just some one nighter. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1941.0s)]
*  And then, I don't know if we ever worked again together. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1943.0s)]
*  Oh, well, Dangerfields, we did some stuff with Dangerfields. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1946.0s)]
*  We did Carillons together too. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1949.0s)]
*  I remember doing Carillons with you. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1950.0s)]
*  Oh, we did a lot of Dangerfields shows together. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1953.0s)]
*  Do we ever do prom shows together? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1954.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1956.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1957.0s)]
*  And those... [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1959.0s)]
*  People should know what prom shows are. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1960.0s)]
*  So New York has a very weird thing where they take kids from like Staten Island and Brooklyn [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1963.0s)]
*  and they bring them in in fucking buses to Dangerfields and the show would run from like 7 p.m. till 5 in the morning. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1968.0s)]
*  No break. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1978.0s)]
*  No break. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1979.0s)]
*  Just you would go one show and you'd get paid by the show. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1980.0s)]
*  It was like, it was good money. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1983.0s)]
*  I forget what it was, but it was like you get paid, but like you can make a couple grand in a night if you did the whole night. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1984.0s)]
*  So you would do stand up from 7 p.m. till like 5 a.m. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1990.0s)]
*  But sometimes some of the shows were the same, some of the same crowd. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1994.0s)]
*  Most of the shows. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1998.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=1999.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2000.0s)]
*  They didn't move the people out. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2001.0s)]
*  They just pushed new kids in and they wanted you to do the same joke so that the kids would leave. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2002.0s)]
*  It's the best time to be a basketball fan. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2007.0s)]

*  So we were doing proms at Dangerfields and this is all young kids in high, you know, getting ready to go to college. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2100.0s)]
*  And Ronnie goes on. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2116.0s)]
*  He walks on stage in a robe, drunk. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2118.0s)]
*  He's not doing comedy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2121.0s)]
*  He's bumming the crowd. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2124.0s)]
*  He's talking about his divorce or death. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2126.0s)]
*  And all these kids are just all looking at him like the jury from my cousin Vinny when they were looking at the stuttering lawyer. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2129.0s)]
*  Their eyes were just going, what is going on with this man? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2138.0s)]
*  Right. And he just it was the most depressed. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2142.0s)]
*  And then I think Brian Regan had to follow him. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2145.0s)]
*  And the fact I mean, if you look at your career and some of mine and Brian Regan, we were doing prom shows. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2149.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I did. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2156.0s)]
*  There was a contest at Rascals and I think the winner got to do comedy on a plane. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2158.0s)]
*  That was back when they smoked on planes. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2170.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think John Stewart was one of the contestants. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2172.0s)]
*  Like, I remember doing I remember doing or else it was a Johnny Walker competition. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2176.0s)]
*  I was there. It was like me, John Stewart, Jim Gaffigan, you know, to do some Johnny Walker tour. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2183.0s)]
*  I don't fucking know whatever the contest was, but it was all these contests. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2191.0s)]
*  But you would see, look, I worked fucking clubs. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2195.0s)]
*  I was working one club once and after the show, it was in Scranton, PA at a holiday and me and another comic. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2200.0s)]
*  After the show, the owner brings us in the back room and pulls out a gigantic bag of coke and says, do you want coke or money? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2210.0s)]
*  And I took the coke. And the guy who took the money is Adam Sandler. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2218.0s)]
*  And look where he is. And look where I am. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2223.0s)]
*  And Adam Sandler took the money and he opened up. He was a guitar comic and he opened up. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2226.0s)]
*  That was a Nick's Comedy Stop thing, Coker Money. Oh, yeah. I worked in Boston. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2233.0s)]
*  Did they offer you Coker Money? I don't. And I was getting high. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2237.0s)]
*  Because when I first started comedy, somehow they what was his name? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2240.0s)]
*  Dominic and Jackie Gay or something. They liked me for some reason. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2246.0s)]
*  I would get stunk, but they would give me spots at Nick's and I would get either money or... [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2251.0s)]
*  But I would buy coke from Mike, the drug dealer that the Colombians killed. He was their coke dealer up there. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2256.0s)]
*  I would stay behind a connection at the Milner Hotel, which was all prostitutes and drug addicts. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2262.0s)]
*  Right. And, you know, I would go up there. Nick's was giving me shows upstairs, downstairs. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2269.0s)]
*  So the one time, the last time I was up in Boston, I did Springfield Mass and Westfield Mass, 252 Elm and some other Norm LaFauve shit. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2276.0s)]
*  Norm LaFauve, Western Massachusetts. Yeah. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2288.0s)]
*  So then I went to Nick's. I go, I'm not spending my money on drugs. I'm not. I'm coming home with fucking money. Right. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2291.0s)]
*  So I'm working this place called Plums in Worcester and this waitress, fucking smoking hot after the show. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2300.0s)]
*  Because I did some coke, bitch. She goes, you do coke? I go, yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2310.0s)]
*  I go, do you know where I can get any coke? And we couldn't get any coke in Boston. I'm not. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2315.0s)]
*  We drove from Boston. I went back to New York, bought a bunch of crack. We got a hotel, smoked all night. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2324.0s)]
*  We had sex, this and that. And it was Saturday night. And I'm 40 minutes from home. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2333.0s)]
*  And I have one more show in Boston on a Sunday. And I have to drive her all the way back to Boston. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2341.0s)]
*  No money left, maybe 10 or 20 dollars, just enough to get back to Boston, do my show, luggage in a fucking paper bag. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2348.0s)]
*  We stop on the way up in Hartford. We try to buy coke or heroin and we got ripped off. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2358.0s)]
*  She's crying because she's going to lose her job. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2366.0s)]
*  Fucking blood started pouring out of my nose as we're driving, just pouring out. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2370.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. I swear to God. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2375.0s)]
*  Well, and then she goes, my sister wants an ounce of coke. So I was going to set her up and rip her off. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2380.0s)]
*  And, you know, get a free ounce of coke. Well, anyhow, two weeks later, I end up in rehab. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2389.0s)]
*  That was my bottom, that fucking trip to Boston. I end up in rehab. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2398.0s)]
*  And about a year or two later, I'm working for at Lauderdale and her sister is there with her boyfriend who's the size of a fucking house. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2403.0s)]
*  So if I did rip her off, I would have gotten fucking shit killed, beaten out of me. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2413.0s)]
*  You know, what are the odds? So that last trip to Boston and I spent all the money I wasn't going to spend, but this girl was fucking hot. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2419.0s)]
*  You know, then I came out of rehab and I think I had like a month or two months clean and I'm working on Daytona Beach. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2428.0s)]
*  This fucking wait, I don't know. I was I had bad teeth, fucking jerry curl. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2439.0s)]
*  And my wife says she saw videos of me from her ass and she goes, you're such a mess. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2446.0s)]
*  But you had so much confidence and girls like confidence, right? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2452.0s)]
*  Because I would be on stage, fucking rotten teeth and fucking grease dripping out of my hair. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2456.0s)]
*  So I can mess. I look like a fucking rat and just hot waitress in Daytona. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2461.0s)]
*  We go back to her place and I'm making out with her. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2469.0s)]
*  And something tastes funny. I go, what? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2472.0s)]
*  And she pulls out a bag of coke and I had like a month clean, two months. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2474.0s)]
*  I go, I can't do that. I got to get out of here. I mean, I fucked her. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2478.0s)]
*  But then I left real quick, you know, you know, and it was scary. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2481.0s)]

*  I could pawn this watch. Right. It would be enough money for me to die. Right. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2510.0s)]
*  You know, money I've hidden around the house. You know, no one's going to find it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2514.0s)]
*  I don't even think, hey, we're going to go to Faust's house and find his money. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2520.0s)]
*  This shit is fucking hidden well. All right. So go fuck yourselves. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2524.0s)]
*  So anyhow, I'll die. Just know. Look, for a year and I got to get back on track, I stopped eating not keto, but cut back on carbs, sugar. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2529.0s)]
*  Just I did real well for a year. I mean, I was fucking ripping up again and from my age and it's harder. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2545.0s)]
*  My daughter comes upstairs and goes, oh, I made homemade chocolate chip cookies. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2553.0s)]
*  I'll give me one. Well, the seventh cookie I had thrown the garbage, the seventh. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2557.0s)]

*  There's no there's no one time to fuck. I play golf and guys are drinking a beer. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2566.0s)]
*  I go, what the fuck you do? We like to taste fuck off. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2572.0s)]
*  Gatorade tastes good. You drink to get drunk. What are you drinking a beer? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2575.0s)]
*  You know, and it's just and then on stage if I go, I quit, someone goes, quit or shut the fuck up. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2579.0s)]
*  You're here having wine coolers, bitch. So your mother's car to get high. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2585.0s)]
*  Go fuck yourself. Wow. You don't know anything about getting high. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2589.0s)]
*  You're fighting with people aren't even here. I know. I'm just telling you. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2592.0s)]
*  You're the shower argue with these guys. Oh, you know how many fucking arguments I've had? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2600.0s)]
*  I know you're going to bring in your whole pro-Palestinian crew that I was going to fight today. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2605.0s)]
*  I have stuff printed out. We'll read later. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2611.0s)]
*  But that's funny. You haven't fights with you don't ever lay in bed or argue with have arguments with people that know you've never had. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2616.0s)]
*  I did when I was young. Yeah, I figured that out when I was younger. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2626.0s)]
*  This is stupid. And when the impulse comes, which it does, I just I go, this is stupid. I talk to myself. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2630.0s)]
*  I just coach myself. Yeah. You got to have like another voice in your head. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2637.0s)]
*  Yeah, but most people have one voice in their head and that voice is like, we should go get high or we should do this. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2642.0s)]
*  We have to have a second voice. And the second voice is like, what advice would I give me? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2647.0s)]
*  And the advice I give me is like, you're wasting your time arguing in the shower with someone who doesn't even they don't even know you're arguing with. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2652.0s)]
*  I know it's true. Not even there. You're like replaying it out in your head so you could have had a better thing to say to them. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2659.0s)]
*  They say to live and rent free in your head. Yes, that's what it is. Yeah. I don't allow anybody in my head. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2665.0s)]
*  Well, I had the second for I do. And I'm not religious by any. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2671.0s)]
*  But I'll say, you know, God, get me off. You know, what should I do? What's my purpose? Or what can I do in life? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2676.0s)]
*  You know, look, my main purpose in life, besides be my main purpose is staying sober, because if I don't, I'm dead easily and everything I throw away. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2684.0s)]
*  Then my family, obviously, you know, and my and my career, you know, all the shit I put about Israel, this and that. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2695.0s)]
*  That's that's my life is comedy. But I think in life, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem with what's going on in this world with in this mainly in this country, the anti-Semitism in this country. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2705.0s)]
*  The anti-Semitism in this country is weird because it popped up like it was hiding. You know, after October 7, it popped up like it was hiding. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2720.0s)]
*  I was like, what? Where has this been here the whole time? It was weird. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2728.0s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of it in on Twitter and these places that I think is not human beings and that inspires human beings to get bold. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2732.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of it that's bots. There's a lot of it that's I see these. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2744.0s)]
*  When someone says something outrageous on Twitter, I'll go to the account and see like what what they're doing and what and sometimes I go, oh, this isn't a person like you can figure it out after like a couple of pages. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2750.0s)]
*  Like this is not an actual person. This is a person that jumps onto every controversial subject and says something insightful. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2762.0s)]
*  They do it over and over again. And you see it with abortion. You see it with immigration. You see with voting. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2770.0s)]
*  You see with the rigged elections like there was an FBI analyst who took a look at Twitter before the purchase and he said, I think it's as much as 80 percent bots. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2775.0s)]
*  I think we're getting played as a civilization back and forth. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2786.0s)]
*  I think we're getting I think so many people are vulnerable to like following a narrative. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2791.0s)]
*  Well, and and and I I agree. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2797.0s)]
*  And I've said this and I believe in free speech. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2800.0s)]
*  When we talked about this, you didn't agree with it. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2806.0s)]
*  I didn't agree with free speech. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2809.0s)]
*  No, no, no. What I said about the Internet that some people in life use that shouldn't have a platform in life because they're they're nuts. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2811.0s)]
*  Like if you had somebody in the audience that's nuts, you're going to you're going to take them out. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2822.0s)]
*  You're going to get rid of. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2827.0s)]
*  Right. But that's the difference between an audience and the Internet is you don't have to engage with the nuts. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2828.0s)]
*  OK, but there's people that are following these nuts. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2833.0s)]
*  OK, you take whatever is going on in the Middle East, whatever, whatever side you're on, Israel, Palestine, whatever. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2836.0s)]
*  Why are college campuses letting this happen on campus where Jews can't go to class, where they're being harassed, where they feel threatened? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2849.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of that stuff is funded. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2862.0s)]
*  Yes, funded by Qatar or whatever, but or whatever, whoever whoever is doing it. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2865.0s)]
*  There's there's most certainly there's funding and organization involved. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2870.0s)]
*  These aren't organic protests. Just pop up. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2874.0s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2876.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to think they are because some people join organically. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2877.0s)]
*  They hop in, but it's not. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2880.0s)]
*  No, it's these are all being organized, of course, including the anti-Elon protests, including like, you know, the end oligarchy rallies that they have with AOC and Bernie Sanders. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2882.0s)]
*  All this shit is getting it's all getting funded and astroturfed and they're busing people in. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2893.0s)]
*  They're manufacturing a movement. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2898.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2900.0s)]
*  Of course. And I mean, listen, they didn't all go out and buy the same tents. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2901.0s)]
*  You know, they, you know, it's and there's I don't know how many that are getting funded and then they bring in, you know, it's just like the tents are crazy. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2906.0s)]
*  It's just camp out for Palestine. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2916.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like, you know, I don't want to get into the 80s and foreclosures on farms, you know, farm aid. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2918.0s)]
*  Well, when banks were foreclosing on farms, Jews were going, look, the Jews are foreclosing on our farm, the Jewish bankers, and they weren't even the bankers doing it. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2930.0s)]
*  It was the WASP bankers. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2941.0s)]
*  Jews barely worked at Chase Manhattan in the early 80s or 70s. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2943.0s)]
*  But they blamed the Jews. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2946.0s)]
*  But they blamed because it's easy to go after, you know, that. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2947.0s)]
*  So throughout the Midwest or the South, it's easier to build up hatred or a group to go after a smaller group going, hey, these people are closing on your farms. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2952.0s)]
*  These are the people that are doing it. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2965.0s)]
*  And these people don't have the knowledge and the hate just grows and grows from generation to generation. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2967.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2973.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2974.0s)]
*  So, you know, same with, you know, that I got shit I printed out is, you know, I'll show later. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2975.0s)]
*  Maybe I don't know. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2983.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, I'm a comic, but I really you see what I post sometimes. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2984.0s)]
*  I post some shit and it's not I'm not anti. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2989.0s)]
*  I'm not anti. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2995.0s)]
*  You're pro is pro is but I'm you're pro Jew. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=2996.0s)]
*  I'm pro Jew in this country. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3000.0s)]
*  And I'm not religious by any stretch. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3001.0s)]
*  I don't fucking it's I think it's a holiday now. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3003.0s)]
*  It's Passover or something. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3006.0s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3008.0s)]
*  I'm not religious. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3009.0s)]
*  My cousins were my family wasn't black. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3010.0s)]
*  Think about it as a people. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3012.0s)]
*  I think about it as yes, as a people. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3013.0s)]
*  You know, if what was happening in this world to black people or gay people, these colleges would put an end to it. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3016.0s)]
*  It would stop. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3023.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3024.0s)]
*  If people were ripping down posters of hostages of black hostages or gay hostages when that was happening, it wouldn't happen. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3025.0s)]
*  It was that was crazy. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3035.0s)]
*  You know, that was crazy where people were upset that people wanted people to bring the hostages home like these hostages. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3037.0s)]
*  Some of them were aid workers. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3042.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3044.0s)]
*  Some of them were people that like lived there so they could help people in Gaza. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3045.0s)]
*  The whole thing is so crazy. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3049.0s)]
*  But I wonder like how did they get turned that way? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3051.0s)]
*  Or were they like what I said, like they were in hiding. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3054.0s)]
*  There was like anti-semitism as a person who's not a Jew. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3058.0s)]
*  I would hear about all the anti-semitism like, yeah, there's always going to be some. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3061.0s)]
*  But maybe everyone's exaggerating. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3065.0s)]
*  But then when this after October 7th, it was just like, oh, what the fuck fucking everywhere. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3067.0s)]

*  Oh, I get Italy. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3083.0s)]
*  You're going to fight back by any means necessary. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3084.0s)]
*  I 100 percent. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3087.0s)]
*  Can I show you some stuff? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3089.0s)]
*  OK, now we don't have to talk. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3090.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3092.0s)]
*  I got to do a little of it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3093.0s)]
*  A little whatever you want. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3095.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3096.0s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3097.0s)]
*  I'm joking around. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3098.0s)]
*  But yeah, no, I understand. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3099.0s)]
*  And I think that's also one of the things that people like my wife to keep away. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3101.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3105.0s)]
*  People get angry about Jews is because they think that Jews always stick together and they like Jews above all else. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3106.0s)]
*  And then it's like, hey, fuck those people. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3112.0s)]
*  You know, there's like that walled garden approach. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3114.0s)]
*  You know, if you got that, you got a manila envelope like you're in fucking court. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3117.0s)]
*  Look at this relax. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3122.0s)]
*  I'm I come. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3123.0s)]
*  We got charts. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3124.0s)]
*  Did you bring graphs? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3126.0s)]
*  What's that first page? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3127.0s)]
*  Is that a photo of Israel? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3128.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3130.0s)]
*  You got a map. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3131.0s)]
*  You brought maps. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3132.0s)]
*  He brought maps for me. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3133.0s)]
*  This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen from you. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3136.0s)]
*  Look at the dot. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3139.0s)]
*  Look at the size of Israel. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3140.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very small. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3141.0s)]
*  Look at who they're surrounded by. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3142.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're surrounded by a bunch of Muslims. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3143.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3146.0s)]
*  Not a good spot to be if you're a Jew. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3147.0s)]
*  So they should have probably moved to a different spot. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3149.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, you know what I mean? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3153.0s)]
*  I got other better stuff. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3154.0s)]
*  I just start off with the weaker stuff. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3155.0s)]
*  If you're a black guy, you move into a KKK neighborhood. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3158.0s)]
*  You're going to have problems. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3162.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so it is crazy. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3163.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3165.0s)]
*  By any means necessary, they're going to do what they fucking have to do. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3167.0s)]
*  I just survive. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3171.0s)]
*  Yes, I told you I think they would. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3173.0s)]
*  And I understand that aspect of it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3175.0s)]
*  Is that your thought? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3177.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to turn it off. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3178.0s)]
*  Sorry, my wife. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3179.0s)]
*  I don't know how she got my number. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3181.0s)]
*  I'm going to start the car. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3183.0s)]
*  It is crazy when you look at the map. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3185.0s)]
*  It's not just that they're surrounded, but they're surrounded by everyone. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3187.0s)]
*  It's all enormous countries. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3192.0s)]
*  I mean, all the way up. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3194.0s)]
*  It's interesting that you go down Saudi Arabia, the end of it, you forget, oh, it's Ethiopia is right there. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3196.0s)]
*  And then I mean, Turkey hates Israel. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3200.0s)]
*  Fucking Iran, you know, they're being attacked by four or five different nations at once. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3203.0s)]
*  And everybody's going, well, you know, they're committing genocide. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3210.0s)]
*  First of all, those numbers are coming out of coming from Hamas. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3216.0s)]
*  Where do you think those numbers are coming from? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3221.0s)]
*  OK, but the drone footage isn't coming from the drone footage is real. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3223.0s)]
*  Like if you cover like Gaza with a drone, there's nothing left. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3227.0s)]
*  It's pretty nuts. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3231.0s)]
*  Well, I bet you if they released the hostages October 10th, none of this shit would have happened. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3233.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3240.0s)]
*  None of this shit would have happened. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3241.0s)]
*  During the Clinton administration, Arafat was in the White House probably six or seven times. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3242.0s)]
*  The head of the CIA during the Clinton administration visited the White House twice. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3250.0s)]
*  Arafat six or seven times. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3256.0s)]
*  And they offered a two state solution. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3259.0s)]
*  Clinton, that would have been Clinton's legacy to have peace and a two states. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3262.0s)]
*  But Arafat kept turning it down because Arafat's a terrorist. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3267.0s)]
*  And if he does that, what purpose does he serve? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3271.0s)]
*  What purpose? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3274.0s)]
*  Is it that simple? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3276.0s)]
*  Well, to me it is because I'm not the smartest. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3278.0s)]
*  Part of the problem. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3281.0s)]
*  Part of the problem with Israel and Palestine. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3283.0s)]
*  And I've sat down and thought about this conflict. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3286.0s)]
*  Not that I'm an expert either, but it's almost insurmountable. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3288.0s)]
*  And then now after October 7th with all the bombings and when they leveled Gaza, it's like, how do you fix this? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3292.0s)]
*  It's like there's no, you've created whatever the numbers are. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3300.0s)]
*  Whether it's 70,000 people or 20,000 people that have been killed that are innocents. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3307.0s)]
*  You've created so many more potential terrorists. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3312.0s)]
*  Because so many of the children of those people and the brothers and sisters and relatives of those people. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3316.0s)]
*  So it's like reinforced this desire to fight against Israel. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3321.0s)]
*  You know, and you could squash that. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3329.0s)]
*  You could just keep pounding them down until there's nothing left, which is what it seems that they're doing. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3332.0s)]
*  And I understand it from a tactical perspective, I guess. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3338.0s)]
*  Do we have that animosity and hatred from Japan towards us where we dropped, you know, and killed 350,000 people? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3343.0s)]
*  Well, they did for a while. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3354.0s)]
*  They certainly did for a long while. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3357.0s)]
*  I have friends who would go to Japan in the 70s and they said you could feel the hatred. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3359.0s)]
*  Yeah, but now it's 55 years later. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3363.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're not like that at all now. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3366.0s)]
*  But it's a totally completely different generation. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3368.0s)]
*  So you think future generations will think about Israel the same way we think about Japan? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3370.0s)]
*  Or Japan thinks about us? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3376.0s)]
*  No, because future generations in the Middle East, this has been going since day one, since the Six Day War. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3378.0s)]
*  Since the Yom Kippur War. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3385.0s)]
*  Since day one, they've been being attacked. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3387.0s)]
*  So there's never... [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3391.0s)]
*  Well, it's also before Israel was founded, you got to go back to how they were being persecuted in Europe. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3394.0s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3400.0s)]
*  There's this guy, Daryl Cooper, is a lightning rod for controversy, unfortunately. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3401.0s)]
*  But he's got an amazing podcast. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3406.0s)]
*  He's got this series called Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3408.0s)]
*  And it starts out with the Jews being persecuted in Europe. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3411.0s)]
*  And he takes you through what it would have been like for those people. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3416.0s)]
*  And the gangs of people roaming down the streets, raping women, beating men to death in the streets. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3419.0s)]
*  And it's so crazy because it's real. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3425.0s)]
*  It happened. And it was these people's neighbors. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3428.0s)]
*  And this was why they got so many people to move to Israel in the first place. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3431.0s)]
*  Because when they said, look, we're setting up a state just for Jews from all these Eastern European Jews, they're like, okay, we're in. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3438.0s)]
*  And they moved. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3447.0s)]
*  And they've also been there since Christ. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3448.0s)]
*  I mean, they've been in Israel. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3452.0s)]
*  Even before that, right? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3454.0s)]
*  A couple of weeks. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3455.0s)]
*  But I think it predates. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3458.0s)]
*  Doesn't it predate Jesus? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3462.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not his story and this isn't my whole life. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3463.0s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3466.0s)]
*  Let's find out since we can. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3467.0s)]
*  What is the earliest who are the what? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3469.0s)]
*  When did Jews first settle the land that's now known as Israel? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3472.0s)]
*  What it was? Judea back then. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3477.0s)]
*  Right. Like what it was. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3478.0s)]
*  It called wasn't initially called Miami. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3479.0s)]
*  But also, like, yeah, this is like, you know, this is one of the reasons why it's this area is so so contentious is because Christians really believe that when Jesus comes back, that's where he's going to go. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3482.0s)]
*  He's coming back to Jerusalem. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3495.0s)]
*  He's going to come back to Jerusalem like, are you sure? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3496.0s)]
*  Are you fucking sure? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3498.0s)]
*  But here's here's another thing to this. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3499.0s)]
*  And I'm not listen, I've worked. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3502.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be that guy. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3504.0s)]
*  Oh, I had a Muslim friend. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3505.0s)]
*  Jews have been a history in the land of Israel, the presence dating back to the second millennial B.C.E. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=3507.0s)]

*  You see what they did at the Porsche dealership. They glued themselves to the floor and the Porsche dealership they just shut the lights off and left them in there. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4179.0s)]
*  Really. Yeah. Fuck you. They came back the next day. They glued their hands to the floor like that. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4187.0s)]
*  They're going to stop everything and they were like OK good. We'll just shut the doors. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4192.0s)]
*  Or shut the doors leave them in there to shit themselves. Good. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4195.0s)]
*  Porches are nice cars. Why would they attack. They're only doing it because they know it'll get attention. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4198.0s)]
*  That's all it is. It's a bunch usually a bunch of very privileged rich kids white kids that come from a family that has a lot of wealth and to rebel against their parents or probably fucking investment bankers or something. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4204.0s)]
*  They decide they're going to fight climate change man. They don't even understand what they're fighting. They don't understand the science. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4216.0s)]
*  They don't. It's complex. It's multilayered and nuanced and there's a lot of propaganda that's attached to what they call the green agenda because the green agenda like all things that are big and public is profitable. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4224.0s)]
*  They have a bunch of companies that if they can get these laws pushed forward they can have industries that emerge and their industry can can benefit from all these laws. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4237.0s)]
*  And so they'll they'll fund protests. They'll get people to do things. But it's all for D chess. There's all these multiple layers of things happening. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4248.0s)]
*  And then there's the inconvenient actual climate data that the Washington Post printed that show that over the last 50 million years we're in a decline. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4257.0s)]
*  The earth is in a cooling period and the earth's never like you probably noticed but for people don't there's never been a static temperature on earth. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4266.0s)]
*  It's always gone up and down wildly. It's unpredictable. It has multiple multiple factors. Carbon is probably one of them but it's not the big one. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4275.0s)]
*  It's not all of it. There's solar activity that's you can't control at all. Solar flares happen and some of them happen. They've happened in the early 1800s. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4287.0s)]
*  They blew out all the fucking Morse code system. What was like though there was a big solar flare in the 1800s that see if you can find that. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4296.0s)]
*  But there's they could blow out the power grid easy kill all the satellites easy. What what carbon is is food for plants. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4307.0s)]
*  It's the dumbest fucking thing to protest against. Pollution is a giant issue. Yeah. Do do we have an impact on the weather. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4316.0s)]
*  I'm sure we do. We have an impact on fucking everything. But CO2 net zero all this shit. This is nonsense. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4324.0s)]
*  Carrington event most intense geomagnetic storm recorded history peaking on one to two September 1859 during a solar solar cycle 10 created strong or rural displays that reported be global that reported globally and caused sparking and even fires and telegraph stations. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4333.0s)]
*  The geomagnetic storm is most likely the result of a coronal mass ejection from the sun colliding with Earth's magnetosphere. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4352.0s)]
*  So if we have some of those in the future it could do anything. Let's see a geomagnetic storm of this magnitude occurring today has the potential to cause widespread electrical disruptions blackouts and damage to the electrical power grid. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4359.0s)]
*  We've got real problems real problems and you're not going to solve it with electric cars. You're just not you're not going to solve it with windmills. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4374.0s)]
*  No. Look if you drive up the Jersey Turnpike or anywhere and the factories and the lights and all the smoke and all that shit just everything. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4382.0s)]
*  All right. Me turning off my light bulb is not going to make a fucking difference. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4395.0s)]
*  Particularly when you look at the emissions that come from China. Yes China is an enormous enormous contributor to carbon emissions and not just carbon emissions but pollutants particulates. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4402.0s)]
*  They're not stopping. They built 200 new coal plants. You know they they're not going to stop no matter what we do. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4413.0s)]
*  They're going to do what's best for China financially period end of discussion all these conversations they're having about net zero go fuck yourself. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4421.0s)]
*  You're not going to stop that. OK. And this is what they're looking out for their best interests. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4430.0s)]
*  That's what they're doing just like every other fucking country is basically doing is survival. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4436.0s)]
*  And that's my point with Israel. They're looking out for what's going to keep us from being extinguished off this fucking planet. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4444.0s)]
*  Right. And you know whatever it takes. That's what the Jews and I'm getting back on this because you lost me on all that shit. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4453.0s)]
*  But what the Jews need is a Malcolm X of Jews. Oh boy. Somebody look at Malcolm X was great. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4461.0s)]
*  He didn't say hate. He didn't say go after the white man. He said do what we have to do. Why don't you do that. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4470.0s)]
*  Why don't you be the Malcolm X for the Jews. Maybe that's your calling. My vocabulary. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4478.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. There's no way to tighten that up a little bit. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4487.0s)]
*  I could a little a little with Bonnie's help. I fired my manager two weeks ago and I had her write it out for me because I knew I would have said something fucked up. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4490.0s)]
*  I mean that's smart. You know. And another thing I go hey listen you know seven years. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4499.0s)]
*  It's time to move on and I hope we still be friends. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4506.0s)]
*  And he went definitely not like are you sure. Maybe we could work this out. It's like when you fucking leave a girl. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4510.0s)]
*  She's like great. OK. Wait. Whoa. Come on. I added something to fight for me. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4517.0s)]
*  So no. So yeah I would love to speak in colleges or or or maybe that's right. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4523.0s)]
*  Let it cool down. Let it cool. Yeah. Give it a year. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4531.0s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be able to get to the auditorium. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4537.0s)]
*  Trump said the wildest shit about Gaza. We're going to turn into the Mediterranean the Middle East. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4540.0s)]
*  What. We're going to take it. But he keeps saying and I don't follow. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4546.0s)]
*  You know if you don't release the hostages just held to pay. Well what what has hell. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4554.0s)]
*  What has he done to help release the hostages. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4560.0s)]
*  I mean we're now they're being attacked by fucking Yemen. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4564.0s)]
*  Who you know I mean what. I don't know. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4568.0s)]
*  Release the fucking hostages and then maybe things are left now. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4573.0s)]
*  What is it 70 or. I don't know because they keep dropping it. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4577.0s)]
*  You know four hostages for a thousand prisoners or whatever. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4582.0s)]
*  You know I mean that's what they're doing. Whatever is a trade off. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4586.0s)]
*  How many prisoners they got to give them for a hostage. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4589.0s)]
*  And you know these this would have never went on in this. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4592.0s)]
*  We would not have put up for I mean we did with Carter with the two million hostages. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4596.0s)]
*  Yeah. Two hundred. They were there for what. Two years. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4603.0s)]
*  They kept them there until Reagan was in office. Yeah. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4607.0s)]
*  They kept him there until after the election. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4610.0s)]
*  That was part of the deal. Yeah. Part of the deal was you release these folks after Reagan takes over so that Carter can get credit for it. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4614.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm sure. Oh yeah. Yeah that was written that was. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4620.0s)]
*  Imagine you're a fucking you're in there and you're like Jesus Christ I'm going to be in here for four more months. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4624.0s)]
*  So this guy gets credit. This is fucking crazy. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4628.0s)]
*  Well did you hear. I didn't see it. I only read what. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4632.0s)]
*  These reporters and journalists what she said on 60 minutes. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4636.0s)]
*  Do you think the hostages didn't feed you because they ran out of food. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4641.0s)]
*  Oh that Hamas didn't feed the hostages. Yeah. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4646.0s)]
*  Leslie Stahl said that in an interview. Did she really say that. In an interview. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4648.0s)]
*  Look it up. She said that to one of the hostages. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4651.0s)]
*  Do you think they didn't. And don't quote me because this is what I read. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4653.0s)]
*  I don't want to get sued by Leslie whoever. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4657.0s)]
*  But I think she said what I read. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4660.0s)]
*  Do you think the captors didn't feed you because they ran out of food. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4662.0s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to say to someone who's a hostage. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4668.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean she's crazy. On fucking 60 minutes a journal. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4670.0s)]
*  How do you say something like that. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4674.0s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to say. But they're bad. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4676.0s)]
*  The problem with these 60 minutes journalists is the same problem with what they did with the Kamala Harris interview where they took a bumbling answer and edited out and put an answer to she gave to something else in its place to make it look like she gave succinct clear cut answers. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4678.0s)]
*  It's it's it's not really journalism. They're not. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4694.0s)]
*  They're not doing journal. That's not a question you say to a hostage. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4698.0s)]
*  When you're talking to a hostage you want to find out what the experience was like in as compassionate a way as you can to talk to this person who's been through hell. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4701.0s)]
*  You don't ask them do you ever think that maybe they didn't feed you because they didn't have any food themselves. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4714.0s)]
*  Well here you go. Look at what their face looks like and look at the sunken in faces as the starving to death hostages and well obviously they didn't they didn't give them any food. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4721.0s)]
*  So shut up. It's you can't watch the news. You can't because you're going to go. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4730.0s)]
*  It's not news anymore. It's not click bait and it's fucking. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4736.0s)]
*  It's a business and it's a shitty business. It's not good at doing what it does and it's all bought and paid for by pharmaceutical drug ads. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4740.0s)]
*  And it's just not the news. It's not. You get some information that you can learn but it's not like the unbiased. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4748.0s)]
*  This is what happened. This is what caused it. This is what's being done now. It's not that it's like halfway there. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4758.0s)]
*  They're kind of almost activists. I had an argument with somebody close to me because I go on gut felt I try to go on once a month like I said. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4764.0s)]
*  And she says oh oh you're you're pro Trump. I go I'm not pro anything or anti anything. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4775.0s)]
*  I go I go on. Where else is a comic going to sit for an hour. Try to be funny on TV. Yeah. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4786.0s)]
*  On TV for now. There's not much left. There's not. And it's definitely not going to be on the left because they're not going to let me say the things that I get away. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4792.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the gut felt show. And it's a great show. I mean it's if you say something funny they laugh. It's to me the closest to tough crowd. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4800.0s)]
*  Right. To me. I see what you're saying. And not quite. But I know it's not quite. But it's I mean it's fun. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4808.0s)]
*  And and and it gets whatever views. And I said to this person you work with the pharmaceutical companies for 30 years and you're going to tell them. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4814.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you're going to go on your high horse about me doing a show that's going to help my career and build numbers. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4825.0s)]
*  And well it's not the same. No it's worse. It's worse. It's way worse. It's a pharmaceutical drug companies are responsible for who knows how many deaths and injuries. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4833.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah they do good too. Absolutely. Some pharmaceutical drugs are great but you can't be on your high horse. You work for them. That's crazy. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4843.0s)]
*  In any other business they'd be in jail. They would be fucking jail. They lied about what your product does and it kills a bunch of people. You're in jail. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4851.0s)]
*  Can we talk about one of the reasons I'm here. I don't know if you remember this. I hope you do. I had this torn rotator cuff and you said come down. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4862.0s)]
*  Yeah we're gonna get you some stem cells. Now what's the BPC. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4873.0s)]
*  BPC 157. Is that better. Which is better for the stem cells or the BPC. There's no one better. They're all very good. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4878.0s)]
*  BPC 157 is called body protection compound 157. It's a peptide that helps heal soft tissue damage. So do stem cells. All these different things are good. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4886.0s)]
*  Because I'm not getting my shoulders operated on. It's like a six month. It's rough. And it doesn't always work. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4896.0s)]
*  So what exactly is wrong with your shoulder. Well this is a torn rotator cuff right here. I even brought the disc. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4905.0s)]
*  Oh great. Did you do any exercises for it. Did you do any rehabs for it. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4912.0s)]
*  Not yet because I was waiting to do this to see where this took me and how I would go from there. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4916.0s)]
*  But you know what I mean. Exercises are always good like bands like band work where you do these kind of things. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4923.0s)]
*  Where you keep your towel pressed to your body so you're holding it in place and do these rotations with bands. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4928.0s)]
*  All those things are good just to keep everything strong anyway. Do you do any of that stuff? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4935.0s)]
*  Not those yet. I tried. You ever hang from a chin up bar? You ever do this? No for a torn rotator cuff? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4940.0s)]
*  Yeah just to strengthen and to release the pressure in your shoulders. Oh really. No I could. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4947.0s)]
*  It's good for shoulder health in general to hang from a chin up bar. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4954.0s)]
*  If you can't hang what you do is like get on a box or something that brings you to the height of the bar and just hang a little. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4957.0s)]
*  Just get some weight on it until you can hang fully. I mean look I can still play golf. I could swing like this. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4965.0s)]
*  That's good. So this hurts. Totally fucked. Okay. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4972.0s)]
*  When I went to the doctor. There's a lot of things you can do. Rehabilitation things you can do that will help you. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4975.0s)]
*  Here's the only thing and I could be wrong you'll know. When they said you know rehab to build up the muscle. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4980.0s)]
*  But I'm 67. How much more muscle am I building up? If you're 167 you can build muscle. That's a silly way to look at it. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4989.0s)]
*  100% if you're alive that means your body's recovering. So that means your body's generating tissue. That means you can build muscle. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=4998.0s)]
*  If you can go play golf you can build muscle. 100%. If you're 80 fucking years old and a woman you can build muscle. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5006.0s)]
*  I mean I work out still. I just certain exercises I can't do. Yeah just you need to do exercises that rehabilitate your shoulder. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5013.0s)]
*  You can't just expect it to get better on its own. You're going to have to put it through some work to strengthen the muscles around it. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5021.0s)]
*  Well I'm going to like I said after I do this. When are you leaving? When are you flying out? Wednesday. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5026.0s)]
*  Okay great. So we'll get you in tomorrow morning. No worries. Cool. Get you into Waste Well and we'll set it up. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5031.0s)]
*  Did I bring the show to a dead halt with my map? No. I thought it was a good conversation. Yeah it's good. It's a good map. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5037.0s)]
*  You know I got more stuff I don't want to match it. Listen I bring out a bunch of stuff. I don't want to go back and have my fucking dumb zoo friends going hey you didn't bring anything up. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5043.0s)]
*  Oh is that what they do? Yes. We'll stop talking to them. Then my wife don't say anything stupid. Is that what she said? Yeah. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5053.0s)]
*  She goes. Sorry Bonnie. You know be funny. That's what you're going to comment. I was pretty funny. I got to say listen I'm a good interview. You're fine. You're doing fine. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5063.0s)]
*  You know what the best, not your best, what a great show would be? What? Me, Colin and Norton in here smashing each other. That would be phenomenal. Just like tough crowd. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5076.0s)]
*  You probably couldn't do it today unless you did it on the internet but you could still do it on the internet. Like Colin should really bring it back. I know. There's plenty of guys that could still do it. Like Norton would be fucking phenomenal at it. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5090.0s)]
*  We just did Norton's podcast. Me, Colin and Norton. Whatever podcast. He's got 12 of them. And it was one of the most funniest things when it comes out you'll ever hear. Us three together is like a fucking. You get back in the old groove again. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5101.0s)]
*  Yeah because we're just there to have fun. We're there to have fun. Tough crowd and Opie and Anthony were huge for comedy. Huge. Because Opie and Anthony one of the things that they did that was brilliant is they just let us just go wild. Just be ourselves. They didn't really try to control it at all. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5116.0s)]
*  You know Anthony would jump in with some funny shit but the whole show was like bring on a bunch of comics. Have them talk a bunch of shit. Give them the reins. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5136.0s)]
*  I was in there one day. Anthony was eating a piece of cake. I walked by him and smacked it out of his hand. He laughed as hard as anybody on the planet. Because the times we had in there. I was on there with. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5144.0s)]
*  Were you with me when they brought in Marion Perry? No. You weren't there? Marion Barry? Marion Barry the fucking. The mayor of Washington D.C. They got arrested for smoking crack. No you were in there with him? Yes. We grabbed him. We grabbed him. I thought you were in there. Norton was in there for sure. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5168.0s)]
*  He was next door doing something and doing another interview. He was in the hallway. I think Opie said Marion Barry is in the hallway right now. I'm like let's go get him. We got him and we brought him in. I started asking him about crack. He was like well nobody knows what was in that pipe. I'm like well you know. You fucking know. What were you smoking that wasn't crack? That's almost crazier. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5188.0s)]
*  You know. Oh really you smoke tobacco out of a glass pipe? One of my favorites is when he was running for reelection which he eventually won after he got out of jail. They asked these people do you have a problem with the fact that the mayor used to smoke crack? They interviewed this guy and he goes oh everybody smoked a little crack every now and then. I was like oh this conversation is over. This conversation is over. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5212.0s)]
*  I remember the times when I was in there one time. Pete Rose, Bobby Kelly, Ricky Gervais. Right. And fucking Pete Rose called me. He goes you look like some rat face soccer player. Whatever he said it was very funny. Whatever Pete Rose said was very fucking funny. So I walk over to Bobby. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5234.0s)]
*  Then I walk past Bobby and I walk past Pete Rose and I sit down and Pete Rose says why are you out of breath? I go because I had to walk around you two. You fat fucks. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5262.0s)]
*  But you could say anything you wanted on that show. Yeah. And it didn't. Yeah because I never went on it until it went to XM. I was never on it when they were on terrestrial radio. When they got kicked off terrestrial radio and then they got on XM. And when they were on XM it was wild. It was like the first time. It was like there was Howard when Howard got on XM or Sirius I guess. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5275.0s)]
*  Yeah. Before they merged. And then the ONA show was on XM. This is fucking crazy. This is basically green room talk. Green room talk for the whole world. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5302.0s)]
*  Well okay so I brought Patrice into ONA. Did you really? Yeah I brought him in. Wow. He fucking smashed me the day I walked him in. Because we went through the back. We went through this way. He goes what do you think this is good fellas? You walked me through the back. You couldn't take me through the front door. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5317.0s)]
*  So he became a fixture on it. So one day we're in fucking ONA and I'm driving this little Porsche Boxster. He's driving this big Escalade. Because he's a fucking Buffet molester. So he's saying he's trashing one of my Rolexes going you're a fucking selfish douche bag driving a Porsche to me. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5334.0s)]
*  So you can't have people. And I'm not thinking well maybe if you didn't eat fucking pound cake or whatever you wouldn't eat a big Escalade. But he's beating me down bad. I mean fucking killing me. I'm speechless. Speechless. He's fucking just pounding me. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5358.0s)]
*  And I walk out of there. So the next day or two days later I go online. And he's trashing my car. I look at the price of my car new and the price of his car. And I send it to him. I go look my shitty car cost more than your car new. And he calls me and goes you're still thinking about this? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5377.0s)]
*  He goes really? You're thinking about it right now. Still to this day you're arguing with him. I should have. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5399.0s)]
*  I would drive him home. One night I was driving him back to Jersey City. I go to the bathroom and we're walking up to his house. And he says oh man I don't have a manager. An agent. Nothing's going on. I go I can't get work. I don't have an agent either. Nothing. And we just both started cracking up and walking. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5409.0s)]
*  It was the funniest thing. We were reading for the head of a sitcom for ABC. Me and Patrice. We were going to be the leads of this sitcom. So we go into the head of casting at Marcy Phillips. And he doesn't want to be there and I can't act. So basically I'm not a good actor at the time. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5438.0s)]
*  So he won't take his face out of the fucking copy. And I'm trying to read with him the scene and he won't look at me. And Marcy Phillips is yelling at me going what are you doing? I go this fucking guy won't connect with me. How can I act with somebody that won't look at me? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5464.0s)]
*  And she goes can you two please leave? We laughed all the way down the hallway. We laughed. We just got kicked out of an audition as the leads of sitcom and we just cracked up all the way. Because to us it was the funniest. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5483.0s)]
*  Being funny in the moment. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5501.0s)]
*  The idea of you getting a sitcom was so unlikely. It was always so unlikely that when it failed, like if you went on an audition and it fucked up, you're like ehh. It wasn't going to happen anyway. You never thought this is going to be it. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5503.0s)]
*  Never once. Never. Never. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5515.0s)]
*  I walked out of an audition once. I just got back from Aspen. I had a lot of heat in Aspen. But this is when my anxiety, I've had anxiety my whole life. 21 I was hospitalized for anxiety when I was 21. And they didn't know what it was. They thought you were just nuts and gave you Thorazine and Haldol and you shuffled around like a crazy man. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5517.0s)]
*  So explain to me what it feels like. What is this anxiety? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5541.0s)]
*  Well, when I had it bad, I felt so disconnected that even when I talked it felt like an echo almost. Like I was outside of myself. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5544.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5558.0s)]
*  Like if I look in the mirror I'm going who am I looking at. It was just so disconnected. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5559.0s)]
*  And you were 21? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5564.0s)]
*  Yeah, 21. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5565.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5566.0s)]
*  Smoking pot and stuff. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5567.0s)]
*  Oh, well that's it. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5568.0s)]
*  Well, some of it was probably where am I going in life? What am I doing? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5569.0s)]
*  And you're getting high. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5574.0s)]
*  And I'm getting high. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5575.0s)]
*  Which is like, ooh. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5576.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5577.0s)]
*  If you're freaking out and you get high. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5578.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5579.0s)]
*  Do you have to pee right now? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5580.0s)]
*  No, why do you? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5581.0s)]
*  Because you said you have to go to the bathroom. You were talking about your story then. Okay. Because I was like preparing to like cut it off and let you go to the bathroom. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5582.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. This is the best day of my life. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5589.0s)]
*  You were talking. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5591.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5592.0s)]
*  Except for the fucking map. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5593.0s)]
*  The map was great. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5594.0s)]
*  The map turned out great. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5595.0s)]
*  The map turned out great. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5596.0s)]
*  It turned out a little conversation. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5597.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5598.0s)]
*  I had to talk fucking to listen. Thank God it's Monday. Thursday. The Thursday ones are so much better. I'm at Monday. So my anxiety. Wait, what was it? What did it feel like? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5599.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was like when you said overwhelmed you to the point you had to go to the hospital? Was your heart beating? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5616.0s)]
*  I was just I didn't know what was going on. It turned into panic or whatever. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5621.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5626.0s)]
*  Like I was so fucked up. My friends, you know, I was going. I was selling meat and seafood out of a car, out of a truck, some businesses back then. I went into a therapist. I go, help me. I'll give you some free steaks and seafood. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5627.0s)]
*  And I was just out of my fucking mind. And I get anxiety talking about it. It really gives you a little anxiety. So my friends go, let's take him to Florida. He needs a vacation. We drove to Florida. I was there for a day. I said, I got to get the fuck out of here. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5644.0s)]
*  Take me home. And we drove there and drove back. Then I checked into the hospital. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5658.0s)]
*  The fifth floor, basically for fucking cuckoos. Cuckoos. Because they really didn't know what anxiety was back then. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5663.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? Because that's not that long ago in human history. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5674.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it was 40 something years ago. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5677.0s)]
*  But isn't it nuts? Just like in the last 40 years, how much they've learned. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5680.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, but also too, it's easier to say that person's nuts. Give him Thorazine, Haldor, whatever, anti-psychotic drugs. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5684.0s)]
*  And I swear to God, my day was, and then I would shuffle. I would shuffle around the floor with this girl. I mean, this one girl. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5694.0s)]
*  We shuffled. My friends came up to see me and I'm like, I can't see you today. We're going for a walk. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5709.0s)]
*  You know, I was like one fluid a cuckoo. I was fucking out of my mind. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5716.0s)]
*  So that could have been you for the rest of your life. Jesus. So I know. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5720.0s)]
*  Well, because I did do acid in my day and people sometimes do that shit. Never come back. Never come back. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5726.0s)]
*  And I saw that on Dragnet. So it's in real life. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5733.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is real life. Sterns talked about that. Yeah. A big dose of acid once he was fucked up for a long time. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5737.0s)]
*  It'll fuck you up. There's a guy from Pink Floyd that disappeared. Oh, I hope it's fucking Roger Waters. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5742.0s)]
*  No, how dare you? How dare I? How dare you? What's his name again? Shine on you, crazy, crazy diamond. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5747.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean he did acid? Yeah. It's not just one person. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5757.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of people that had an acid trip and just never came back. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5761.0s)]
*  My brother did it when we were doing it. He was real young. He was having a bad trip and I had to babysit him the whole day. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5766.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking scary. Yeah. That's it. David Gilmore. So written by David Gilmore. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5773.0s)]
*  But it's not it's about who was it about? Syd Barrett. That's right. Syd Barrett did acid went crazy. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5781.0s)]
*  See right there. Departed from the band in 1968 after dealing with the mental health problems and substance abuse. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5788.0s)]
*  The story is he never came back. It's crazy. That's the most that drug is so uncontrollable. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5794.0s)]
*  Well, also, what's the dose of an effective dose is a droplet on your tongue, which is crazy. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5801.0s)]
*  Well, we were doing blotter or window pain, four way window pain. Who's making that? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5808.0s)]
*  They're not making in the same labs or they're making Tylenol. No, they're making it in some fucking basement. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5814.0s)]
*  Oh, too much goes into that. So I got out of the hospital and for years. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5820.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know how long it took. It passed. Life started getting better. Whatever. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5830.0s)]
*  OK, then and I would get anxiety or come and go. But back then, I didn't know what it was. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5836.0s)]
*  It turned into panic. And so then when I was 40, I would watch my kids after I got divorced. I would have my kids every day. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5844.0s)]
*  I would work nights and I watched my I guess four and six year old. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5854.0s)]
*  My wife would either drop them off or I would pick them up and drop them off. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5862.0s)]
*  I would have a minute days. My day was my kids. Whatever. Go to the park. Do this. Do that. Just watch my kid. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5867.0s)]
*  So then they went off to school full time, you know, nursery, first grade. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5874.0s)]
*  So now I'm at 40 years old living in some fucking third floor apartment, divorced from my first wife, bouncing off of fucking walls again. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5885.0s)]
*  I mean, fucking 40 years old. No, just I'm I'm going I got a quick comedy. I got to go into the psych ward. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5897.0s)]
*  I'm fucked up. This is fucked up. So I found this therapist who was also and I was already sober. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5905.0s)]
*  I found this therapist that was in recovery and he basically brought me back, you know, some medication through his partner who was a psychiatrist. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5913.0s)]
*  He was a therapist. Great. I could talk. I could say anything to him. Whatever. You know, and then it just got better. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5926.0s)]
*  And then I realized and worked knowing whatever anxiety I feel, it'll pass. Nothing lasts forever. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5937.0s)]
*  It'll pass. Like I had a little anxiety for the last week thinking about this. I go, what, you know, a little bit because and we're friends and I've done podcasts and what Bonnie goes, shut up and be funny. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5949.0s)]
*  Be whatever, you know, a million things went through my fucking head because I mean, shit, you've had fucking Trump on, you know what I mean? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5961.0s)]
*  And and that's my low self-esteem because of course I should be doing everything in my mind. Do you see what I'm saying? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5970.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? But even when I did Tough Crowd, I was on 30 times every episode. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5978.0s)]
*  I had anxiety till it started. Every special or everything I've ever done, anxiety for the first second, I walk out, boom, gone. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5986.0s)]
*  All right. It's just that's because you care. I mean, you're calling anxiety is just nerves. Yeah. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=5996.0s)]
*  It's whenever there's if you're doing something that's difficult or something that's important to you, you're going to have nerves. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6002.0s)]
*  That's normal. It's healthy. That shows you're challenging yourself, which is one of the most important things you can do in life to stay vibrant. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6009.0s)]
*  Yeah. You have to challenge yourself. When I did the Trump when we roasted Trump, this was a fryer's roast. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6019.0s)]
*  Right. It wasn't it's when they broke away from Commie Central. Right. They broke away. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6028.0s)]
*  So it's at Hilton in New York, 2000 people, anybody that meant anything in New York from club owners, agents, managers, celebrities, they were all there. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6034.0s)]
*  So the first act goes up, this guy Stewie Stone, old time Catskill Comm. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6049.0s)]
*  He kills like no one I've ever seen kill on a roast. Fuck you, Trump. Fuck your casinos. Fuck you. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6055.0s)]
*  Fuck this. Just fucking slaughtered. Right. And I'm sitting on the desk. I'm sitting next to Isaac Hayes, Opium Anthem there. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6062.0s)]
*  My father, his wife, Bonnie, before I married her. And and he I go, I'm going to end my career. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6071.0s)]
*  I go, I'm going to end my career. OK. Then Suzy Essman goes up. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6081.0s)]
*  Slaughter's slaughter's. I guess Amarose wrote her some funny jokes and she and she's great at roasts. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6088.0s)]
*  And I was ready to sneak off the fucking just leave. I go, it might be better if I leave. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6097.0s)]
*  Didn't go up. Well, then Bells are one up. So to go the wind out of the room took a little, you know. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6103.0s)]
*  So Regis Filman was the host. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6112.0s)]
*  It was three weeks after Ronnie Dangerfield died. Three weeks. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6117.0s)]
*  They introduced me. I go big hand for Regis. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6125.0s)]
*  Originally, they asked Rodney to host, but he said he'd rather be dead. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6130.0s)]
*  Right. Zero. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6136.0s)]
*  Almost zero. Really? Right. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6141.0s)]
*  But I got him. I go, don't fuck with me. I'll bring Bells are back. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6144.0s)]
*  I had and then Al Sharpton was sitting on the dais. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6149.0s)]
*  I can't believe I said this, but back then it was OK. He wasn't roasting, but he was on the dais. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6153.0s)]
*  And that's when he was running for president. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6160.0s)]
*  And I said the only way you'll get on the White House property is with a lantern in your hand. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6163.0s)]
*  I said, damn, so fuck him. I didn't care. And then I got him back. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6168.0s)]
*  Three of the jokes that I said were the ones that were printed in this in the newspapers. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6173.0s)]
*  You know, the one I did. I go Trump. The reason Trump puts his names on his buildings is so the banks know which ones to take back. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6179.0s)]
*  And that was 20 years ago. But it was the most terrifying moment. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6187.0s)]
*  One that next to doing Def Jam as the first white guy was one of the most terrifying moments in my. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6192.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm going I'm going to end my career. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6200.0s)]
*  But Def Jam, you know, Def Jam was on for five years. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6203.0s)]
*  The number one show in HBO. OK, we're going to use a white guy. It's me. Right. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6208.0s)]
*  So now I got white comics. You better be funny. I have black. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6214.0s)]
*  White comics are saying that to you. You got to represent us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6217.0s)]
*  Which ones? I want to know what you said. Yeah. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6221.0s)]
*  Twenty years ago, the white comics that were doing black rooms. Oh, I see. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6225.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Then there was black comics. Man, I'm doing it. And they're not. You know what I mean? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6229.0s)]
*  So they're taping in New York every five nights. This is funny. Five nights. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6235.0s)]
*  Was that when they were filming in Harlem? It was it could have been. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6242.0s)]
*  I don't know. It was in New York. Five nights at some theater. OK. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6246.0s)]
*  And it was the year I did it, the fifth year when they had a different guest host every night. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6250.0s)]
*  Like Martin Lawrence wasn't one night, one show, Chris Rock, Chappelle, Jamie Foxx and Steve Harvey was my host. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6255.0s)]
*  You know, so I'm going every night. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6266.0s)]
*  I mean, I went one night and it was just so funny. Like Guy Torrey would come out and do the warm up. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6271.0s)]
*  And he would say, listen, this is not the Apollo. There's no fucking booing here. This is HBO. We don't boo. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6279.0s)]
*  Right. This is this is a whole nother level that we don't want to hear any booing. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6287.0s)]
*  So this comic comes out. He walks out. And with a black audience, if you're wearing the wrong sneakers, you're in trouble. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6292.0s)]
*  Believe me, I used to do a lot of you know, he comes out like Reeboks. He's wearing an all gold suit. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6301.0s)]
*  And his first joke in New York is I just want to say I'm not from New York. I'm from Canada. Right. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6307.0s)]
*  He's bombing so bad. And when a black audience can boo you, all you heard in the room was, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6316.0s)]
*  Child, mmm. It was brutal. So I'm like now they're taped five nights, two shows a night. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6329.0s)]
*  I'm on the last night, second show, and I go second to last. Now, all the comics that were still in town that were the celebrity hosts, all the we're at the taping. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6341.0s)]
*  I'm going this is one of the scariest moments of my life. I mean, you know, no white guy. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6356.0s)]
*  Steve Harvey brings me out. He goes, well, our next act is something we haven't seen or special, whatever. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6362.0s)]
*  And Russell made me wear his clothing. I got fat farm on and these baggy pants, you know, and I look back on it because it was 25 years. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6369.0s)]
*  It would be different. I was I pandered a lot to some extent. You know what I mean? Right. I did grow up in that neighborhood. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6383.0s)]
*  But I'm out like this and all, you know, right. And it worked out, luckily. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6391.0s)]
*  But I look back and go, I would never do that now from 25 years ago. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6397.0s)]
*  The pandering and and you know, just just, you know, talking like I'm fucking from the hood and shit. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6404.0s)]
*  You know, and I had a good set. It worked out. But it was the second scariest moment in my career. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6412.0s)]
*  But listen to what you just said. Both scariest moments of your career worked out great. Yes, they always. Yeah. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6420.0s)]
*  So wouldn't that eventually build some confidence? Oh, I have confidence. OK. It doesn't sound like it. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6426.0s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm just having a scary moment. Listen, you you you always got to question yourself. Right. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6433.0s)]
*  In this business, because you want to get better. You want to. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6440.0s)]
*  And you just I don't know. I question myself. I go. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6446.0s)]
*  I have not again, not an ego. I have a reputation to live up to of the stuff I've done in this business. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6452.0s)]
*  Right. So I I come out and people are going. Look, Bobby, Bobby and Keith, we're at the cellar one night. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6461.0s)]
*  I go, I got a spot at the underground. They go, we're going to come over and watch you bomb. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6472.0s)]
*  That sounds like Keith. Keith and Bobby. Right. So. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6478.0s)]
*  So Nikki's Nikki Glazer's on killing, killing, not to clean this, but funny. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6484.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what somebody else. She's funny and she was killing. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6492.0s)]
*  So I went on and my first two jokes. I had they killed and I go, see, Bobby, see, Keith, I can follow anybody. Right. Right. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6496.0s)]
*  And then I didn't know this. They went into the back corners of the room. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6510.0s)]
*  And after every joke, they would go, oh, oh, and they had the whole audience turn on me going, what's going on? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6516.0s)]
*  I would say a joke that might have been a little edgy. And they would go, oh, real loud. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6529.0s)]
*  So the whole audience is gone. What's this guy doing up there? They're groaning. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6535.0s)]
*  One table goes, what's going on here? And I'm fucking bombing now because these two fucking jimokes are in the back room going, oh, my God. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6542.0s)]
*  It's so fucking funny. Bobby and Keith. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6557.0s)]
*  Well, that was the culture. The culture of comic goes like constant busting balls, constant busting balls. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6561.0s)]
*  Somebody would go on stage and we would all go downstairs and sit in like the front row. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6568.0s)]
*  There's nothing worse you could do for a comic. Your friends sit in the front row and stare at you. You're like, what are you doing, man? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6575.0s)]
*  When Kevin Hart was leaving New York to go to fucking L.A., he threw himself a little go away fucking show at Boston Comedy Club. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6583.0s)]
*  You remember Boston Comedy Club, right? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6591.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6593.0s)]
*  So he's on stage pontificating, doing whatever. And I don't know why, but me, Keith, and Patrice were in the back of the room. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6594.0s)]
*  And there was like 10 phone books back there. And he's up there. And we started throwing phone books at him. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6604.0s)]
*  Phone books? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6610.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were just in the club from I guess they were delivered there, all these phone books. And we're throwing phone books at Kevin Hart. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6611.0s)]
*  And he says, on interview, he goes, I knew I was accepted when they were throwing phone books at me. I knew I was part of the crew. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6619.0s)]
*  You know, but we were just heaving phone books at him like fucking three assholes in the back of the woods room, I mean. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6628.0s)]
*  And we would just, it was just fun. It was probably the most fun I've had in comedy when we would just stand out. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6637.0s)]
*  Me, Patrice, Keith, and Norton told three and four in the morning in front of Boston just trashing each other and laughing. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6649.0s)]
*  Just talking shit. Yeah. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6658.0s)]
*  You can't replicate that. It can't happen again. It was just so funny. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6660.0s)]
*  Keith is, he's fun if you see him around, you know, or Norton or Bobby, but it was so much fun. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6667.0s)]
*  I heard Keith is killing it now, even with his strokes. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6675.0s)]
*  His special, we were at the tape and the fact that he didn't win an Emmy, it was so fucking good, his special. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6679.0s)]
*  He painted a picture when he was talking. You could see everything he was saying. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6689.0s)]
*  Him in the hospital, him with a stroke, and it was so good. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6695.0s)]
*  I walked out of there going, this is the best thing I've ever seen. It was so good. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6699.0s)]
*  Wow. He was so good, you know. I don't know why he didn't. I mean, it's. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6705.0s)]
*  Who gives a fuck about the Emmys? Fuck off. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6712.0s)]
*  Everybody knows how good it was. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6715.0s)]
*  All those fucking award shows for art to me are some of the most ridiculous things. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6717.0s)]
*  Really? How many fucking albums? I don't even want to say her name, but they don't know. They don't know. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6721.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. You're right. It doesn't. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6728.0s)]
*  It's just an industry way that they can celebrate each other and then they put on a show and the show generates money. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6730.0s)]
*  And they make a bunch of money from the show and then it becomes a thing they hold over your head. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6737.0s)]
*  Maybe you can win a Grammy. Maybe you can win an Emmy. Maybe you can win this. You got to be a part of the club. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6740.0s)]
*  Like, look what happened to Chris. He wanted to be a part of that group doing the Oscars and he gets smacked by Will Smith. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6745.0s)]
*  They don't arrest him. And then 10 minutes later or whatever it was, Will Smith's on stage just receiving the Academy Award and they give him a standing ovation. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6751.0s)]
*  It's fucking insanity. That is Hollywood. That shows you what these people are. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6759.0s)]
*  To want their love and their respect is pointless. It's so true. They don't even know what they like. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6765.0s)]
*  They like what everybody everybody tells them to like. They don't understand what their support. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6772.0s)]
*  They don't. They it's just a bunch of people wanting to be a part of the group that's the in group. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6776.0s)]
*  Like, what do we have to do? What do I have to say? What do I have to agree with? That's all it is. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6782.0s)]
*  Years ago. And it's true. If that was Chappelle, he wouldn't have smacked Chappelle. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6786.0s)]
*  Chappelle's a little cut, a little bigger. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6791.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. The whole thing was crazy. That poor guy. Yes. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6794.0s)]
*  One move. He does one move. Now everybody remembers nothing but that forever. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6797.0s)]
*  But what fuck I am legend. Fuck Ali. All those different things he did that were awesome. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6802.0s)]
*  Nobody cares anymore. He's like, that's the guy that's. Yeah, but you're Chris. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6806.0s)]
*  Every day he's got to wake up in the morning and go fuck that one thing. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6809.0s)]
*  Fuck if he hadn't done that, if he just ate it. And by the way, not even bad jokes. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6814.0s)]
*  Nothing. GI Jane. Like this the most fucking. That was a powerful movie. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6819.0s)]
*  It was a great movie. Yeah. Strong woman. Like it's not even really an insult. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6823.0s)]
*  It was just silly to smack a guy like that. And then that's your thing forever. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6827.0s)]
*  People are going to remember that. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. Crazy blunders. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6832.0s)]
*  You know, and that probably comes from not having anxiety, by the way. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6837.0s)]
*  That comes from having too much confidence. Confidence. Too much. Too much. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6841.0s)]
*  Yeah. Too much of a belief in yourself. Too much of a ego. Yes. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6845.0s)]
*  And your own importance that you can interrupt this entire enormous award show, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6849.0s)]
*  the biggest award show in the industry, that you're set up to receive a fucking [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6854.0s)]
*  Academy Award in about an hour or whatever it was. You're going to go up there [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6858.0s)]
*  and smack a guy on TV. Why would you do that? Because he doesn't have that anxiety. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6862.0s)]
*  So your anxiety shields you from doing some stupid shit. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6867.0s)]
*  Yeah. The fear and the like the insecurity sometimes is good. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6871.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's good for you. Keep you like the lack of insecurity could be the worst thing. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6877.0s)]
*  If you're too cocky. Yeah. It's. Yeah, they say be humble. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6881.0s)]
*  Be humble, you know, and I thought Chris handled it as well as he what what can he do? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6887.0s)]
*  What can he do other than run off the stage? Yeah. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6895.0s)]
*  Which you probably should have just walked off after you got smacked because you try to keep going. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6898.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's. I worked with him on both Oscars he hosted and he is the nicest guy on the planet. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6903.0s)]
*  If you I guess if you're I don't know just from working with him, you know, he's a nice guy. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6911.0s)]
*  And also he's harmless. Like you can't smack a harmless person. That's crazy. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6918.0s)]
*  Yes. I'll tell you what, if that was Tony, there would have been a fight. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6923.0s)]
*  If that was Tony Rock, there would have been a fight. Oh, yeah. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6927.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, Tony went off on stage like right after. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6930.0s)]
*  Tony's a different dude. But Chris, like, is like almost if it was anybody but Chris, you know, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6935.0s)]
*  I mean, you can't do that to anybody else. It's great. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6941.0s)]
*  If you did to Kevin Hart, Kevin would crack him. The whole thing is crazy. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6944.0s)]
*  It was crazy. It didn't make any sense. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6947.0s)]
*  It's like the guys in some sort of a very bizarre relationship with his wife. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6950.0s)]
*  And, you know, whatever internal conflicts they have just manifested itself in a terrible decision that he made. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6956.0s)]
*  If if he would have if he would have said that about my wife, I would have smacked her and said, laugh. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6964.0s)]
*  It's funny. Come on. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6971.0s)]
*  But, you know, not being able to take a joke is one of the worst qualities that people can have. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6974.0s)]
*  Do you not want to do you take yourself so seriously when someone says something funny? [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6980.0s)]
*  You can't laugh as well. That's crazy. You're missing out on laughs. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6984.0s)]
*  You're missing out on you or your own joy. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6988.0s)]
*  Like you should have joy about someone making fun of you. And you're great at that. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6992.0s)]
*  You're great. That's one of the best things about you on ONA is that when they would crack on you, you would laugh. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=6996.0s)]
*  It's so important. Good jokes. Yeah. We're funny. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7002.0s)]
*  And if I was at times lucky enough to come back with something, then I would. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7006.0s)]
*  If not, then I sucked it. The last time I did Kill Tony a couple of weeks ago and I told a joke and Tony goes, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7010.0s)]
*  that's the oldest joke in history. And I go, yeah, I wrote it. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7018.0s)]
*  So shut the fuck up. But it was gone. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7022.0s)]
*  It was a great episode because he fucked with me. I took it. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7027.0s)]
*  Kill Tony is one of the only places left where that kind of fucking with people is openly encouraged. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7033.0s)]
*  That kind of fucking with people is like, I mean, and Tony's the best roaster on the fucking planet. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7039.0s)]
*  He's quick. He's like Norton. He's so quick. You think he just like Norton. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7044.0s)]
*  He's so quick. You think he wrote it in advance. Yeah, he's off the cuff. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7049.0s)]
*  He does it all the time. He does it in the green room. He does it everywhere he goes. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7053.0s)]
*  But here's the thing, too. He's done that show for 10 years. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7057.0s)]
*  Yes, he's built that muscle in his head. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7060.0s)]
*  Yeah. Boom. Yep. Yeah. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7063.0s)]
*  It's automatic. There's something's going to come back. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7065.0s)]
*  Well, when you host a show like that, too, you understand the rhythm of the show, the beats of it. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7070.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he's so good at letting other people shine. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7074.0s)]
*  You know, that's what he's really good at. Like, he wants you to do well. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7078.0s)]
*  He doesn't feel upstaged if Shane comes on as Trump or when Kyle was doing. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7082.0s)]
*  Kyle did RFK Jr. and he also did Elon Musk. And then who? Kyle Dunnigan? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7087.0s)]

*  Yeah. They love him. But he laughs and gives you your due, too. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7115.0s)]
*  Like, I've done radio with Gervais. Gervais is a big laugher. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7120.0s)]
*  If you say something funny, he'll laugh and crack up. You know what I mean? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7124.0s)]
*  You got to have that. Even if it's funny, you know, they don't get jealous or get mad and go, I'm going to outdo that. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7129.0s)]
*  They laugh. Well, the people that do suck. No one who does that is any good. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7138.0s)]
*  What's that? No one who does that is any good. No one is like, oh, I got to do better than him. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7142.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's stupid. You're missing out on the whole thing. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7146.0s)]
*  It's a show. It's a show. It's whatever. Hey, I got to piss. Let's come back. We'll come right back. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7149.0s)]

*  I don't tear it apart while it's building back up. That's the whole idea. Don't aggravate it while you. Does that hurt when you do that? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7187.0s)]
*  No, then don't worry about it. Not really. Fine. No, no. Well, you should be doing rehabilitation. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7193.0s)]
*  You should have already. I'm looking at your shoulders right now. They look like they fall apart on their own. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7199.0s)]
*  You got to you got to exercise. If you're having injuries with your shoulders and the muscles around them and people are telling you to strengthen them, you should listen to those people. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7202.0s)]
*  They're right. Well, no, I listen. I went to physical therapy for my back and it's working. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7209.0s)]
*  What I do when you do it for your shoulder, because I was waiting to do this shit first. That was helped. All of it would help. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7216.0s)]
*  Oh, the more muscle you have around your shoulder, the better it is. It was only two or three weeks ago. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7223.0s)]
*  He said go to physical therapy. I go. Well, he wanted to cut my shoulder. I said, I'm not cutting it. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7228.0s)]
*  I'm going to try the BPC and the stem cells. So you can definitely heal soft tissue injuries without surgery. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7234.0s)]
*  The real issue is when tendons are separated and they need to be put back in place and reconnected. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7240.0s)]
*  That's the real issue. Well, a lot of people tour rotator cups. Oh, yeah. Tear rotator. Yeah, I had a torn rotator cuff. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7247.0s)]

*  Obviously, you need some help. Nothing wrong with a little bit of help. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7271.0s)]
*  Look, do you want to get better or not? Yes. OK, you know, you're saying get a trainer for my shoulder or for my shoulder for everything for all of it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7275.0s)]
*  So someone show you how to do it right. So you're not hurting yourself. Well, I think I'm doing triceps and biceps, right? [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7286.0s)]
*  I know I am. I'm doing lats, right? Show me the guns. Well, they're not. Then how do you think you're doing them right? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7293.0s)]
*  They're not bad. It's ridiculous. What? Small? It's tiny. Oh, listen. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7299.0s)]

*  You want me to do my chest? You want to see my chest? No, I'm good. Take my chest down. No, no, no, no, there's no reason. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7310.0s)]
*  My lats and traps are good. OK. Look, for almost 68, I think I look better than most people I went to school with. That's good. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7316.0s)]
*  That's good. I think I think. Look, I work out all the time, but I maintain. OK, I maintain. I'm not. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7327.0s)]
*  I feel like a therapist. I feel like I'm helping you through your life. You are helping you got in here. You are. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7336.0s)]
*  I'm helping to guide you. No, get a fucking professional that knows how to work out and build yourself back up to the point where you don't not having these kind of injuries. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7341.0s)]
*  Yeah. And rehabilitate it like correctly. Like when they tell you to do physical therapy in your shoulder, fucking do it. I'm going to do it. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7350.0s)]
*  I want this. You waited three weeks. You're 68. You only have a few years left. What the fuck? Come on. We have a few years. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7357.0s)]
*  So well, do you want a few years left and fucking working order? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7364.0s)]
*  Fucking listen, Bonnie. I mean, you should listen to Bonnie. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7371.0s)]
*  You're right. I'm going to fucking. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7376.0s)]
*  Do you think? I'm never going to get my arms bigger than that. That's ridiculous. Of course you could at 68. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7381.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. Yeah. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7389.0s)]
*  The reason why your arms exist at all is because your tissues regenerating. Your tissue is your healing and you're getting better. Yeah, you 100% stronger. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7392.0s)]
*  100%. No if hands or butts about it. You get stronger. I have nice lats. You could be 87. Yeah, still get stronger. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7402.0s)]
*  As long as you're alive, you can get stronger because if your heart beats, if your hormones work, if you can move around, that means your body can repair itself. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7413.0s)]
*  Well, I won't do. What is it that gets you hard? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7422.0s)]
*  Violet girl? No, no. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7429.0s)]
*  Cialis? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7431.0s)]
*  No, not the drug that makes you. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7432.0s)]
*  Testosterone? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7437.0s)]
*  Yeah, testosterone. What's it called? Testosterone? [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7438.0s)]
*  You won't do that? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7442.0s)]
*  Well, because it's it makes it. It leads to prostate cancer. No, it doesn't. That's what my doctor. Your doctor's wrong. He died. It's incorrectly. Your doctor's an idiot. He died two years ago. He died. No, he doesn't know the real studies. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7443.0s)]
*  Like there's a guy named Brigham Bueller who runs ways too well, who could explain the flaws in that study that showed that it gave people prostate cancer. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7458.0s)]
*  Look, people get prostate cancer. Testosterone is not giving you prostate cancer. But it's like across the board, the same percentage of people that take testosterone or don't take testosterone get prostate cancer. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7467.0s)]
*  There's probably a ton of variables. A lot of it has to do with diet. A lot of cancer has to do with diet. Fuel of cancer is sugar. Do you eat a lot of sugar? [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7478.0s)]
*  I stopped for a year. I'm back. I'm going to get back on. I pretty fucking good for the last month and a half. I have it for the last for a year. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7488.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's environmental factors. There's genetic factors. There's a lot of different things. But, you know, if you want to take care of yourself, testosterone will actually make your body heal better. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7500.0s)]
*  You'll feel better. You'll have more energy. Your immune system will function better. Everything will work better. You should have your hormones balanced. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7510.0s)]
*  We live in a time where you can get a full blood panel and find out where your nutrient levels are. And if you do it with a good doctor, what they'll do is they'll adjust your diet and your nutrients first and then see in a couple months what your levels are then and then find out how much are you sleeping. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7517.0s)]
*  Are you sleeping right? Well, there's a problem there because then your body's not recovering. So you've got to figure out a way to adjust something in your life to make you sleep better. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7534.0s)]
*  And then after that, once they get everything all worked into its optimum rate, you're doing all the right things to go, what's what are your levels now? Okay, we'll add a little add a little bit of testosterone, peptides that will increase your body's ability to promote growth hormone. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7544.0s)]
*  There's stuff like some morelin that makes your body produce more growth hormone so like your body repairs itself better like when you're younger. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7559.0s)]
*  There's all rigorous science behind all this stuff. It's all this many. I'll get Brigham to explain it to you. He'll do a much better job than who's that you got tomorrow. He's the guy who owns waste. Well, yeah, he's been on the podcast. He's testified in front of Congress. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7566.0s)]
*  I'll bring the disk. Bring the maps too. Who love the maps? Let me tell you something about these maps. These maps. I printed this shit out. I see. Looks like your printer needs ink. Pretty dull. Listen to me. Fix your eyes. My eyes work pretty good. You want to see some other statistics? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7579.0s)]
*  I got all right. What else you got? No, I don't want to get. Please don't. Did you see those girls land today? The Blue Origin. They shot that metal dick up into space. People were mad. They wouldn't let the ladies drive Perry and someone else. Katy Perry, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, his wife. If that thing blew up and if Jeff Bezos, his wife blew up, Twitter thinks that the capsule is too clean. They don't think it was real. Obviously, of course, Twitter. Twitter doesn't think space is real. There's a whole [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7599.0s)]
*  community out there. Hashtag space is fake. Yes. Oh, yeah. There's really retarded people who think the earth is flat and that there's a firmament. Look at that. They think birds aren't real. Did they land? Is it over? Yeah, they did it. Yay. How they land in the ocean? On the desert. How do they land? Parachutes. They land with parachutes. So the thing lands with a parachute. Oh, yeah. Let me see. I want to see the video. Oh, that's them in the middle of the desert. Wow. That doesn't. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7628.96s)]
*  It's got it looks different than that. That has to be crazy. Would you do that, Rich? Would you go to space? Probably not. You think you'd get anxiety if you went to space? I don't even like Ferris wheels. Well, those things are very different. Is that it? You know what? Let's see the landing. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7658.96s)]
*  How long did they go for? Very soft, soft landing. Look at this. Here it is. Imagine from space. And the only thing we got to land you is a parachute, like one of the oldest technologies. Wow. You can hear them in there. Screaming. Wow. How long? How long were they up there? I don't know. Not long. Isn't it funny that they said they were going to land? Yeah, they were. I don't know. They were going to land. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7679.88s)]
*  Do you think the men would scream like that? Would you and I scream like that if we landed? Well, I don't know about you, but I know me. Look at that one. No. Look at that. Go back. The one below it. I'll tell you what I'll never do is clap when a pilot lands. You don't do that? That's his fucking job. It's true. What if it's a female pilot? You're like, whew. I wouldn't have got on the plane. No. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7709.88s)]
*  There was a bunch of them in a row where Jesus Christ, the Delta one in Canada where it flipped upside down. Yeah. Can you imagine? The lady just started landing planes recently. Like, yeah, take that one out in the icy runway. Here's 30,000. No, I'll wait for the lawsuit. Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid for it. Trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos to marry in Venice. Oh, they're going to marry in Venice in two months. Oh, they haven't married yet. Oh, OK. I thought they were married. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7737.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. They're going to do it in Venice. Oh, how beautiful and romantic. Wow. Yeah. You can't tell people how much it costs because then there's going to be retards like that money could have housed so many houseless. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7767.0s)]
*  So many unhoused could have benefited. How many poor people? These fucking retards like if Elon Musk gave a million dollars to everyone on earth, you'd have money left over. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7781.64s)]
*  There's all these mathematicians out there that are fucking constantly want to comment on other people's money. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7793.8s)]
*  And how convenient. And those people would fuck up that money, too. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7799.400000000001s)]

*  uber successful and telling them what they should do with their money [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7988.68s)]
*  is just the dumb shit. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7991.12s)]
*  And that's why I don't want to give out how much money it costs [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7992.68s)]
*  to fly this rocket ship into space. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7995.64s)]
*  Of course, it's frivolous and gratuitous. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=7997.56s)]
*  Of course, it's a publicity stunt. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8000.4800000000005s)]
*  They had a bunch of hot ladies. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8002.280000000001s)]
*  They flew them off into space and then they landed. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8003.72s)]
*  Yay. Now you've been to space. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8005.72s)]
*  But basically, you're in space for like 10 minutes. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8008.12s)]
*  That's what the fight was. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8010.4800000000005s)]
*  It probably cost a billion dollars to fly people in the space for 10 minutes. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8012.08s)]
*  Wow. Do you have any fucking clubs you could have bought me? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8015.32s)]
*  How many golf clubs? How many clubs? [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8020.599999999999s)]
*  That's your thing, right? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8022.44s)]
*  You're just a fucking inveterate golfer, right? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8023.28s)]
*  I love golf. Yeah. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8025.759999999999s)]
*  It's fun. Jamie, Jamie should show you a setup back there. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8027.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a driving computer with a big screen. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8030.5599999999995s)]
*  I have I was hitting in and in this morning into the screen. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8033.639999999999s)]
*  I bring the screen with you. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8037.36s)]
*  I just went to the hotel. Really? Yeah. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8039.96s)]
*  Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. To Thompson. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8042.2s)]
*  I went down, worked out twice. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8043.92s)]
*  Before you stay. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8045.52s)]
*  No, I'm not saying I went walked over there. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8046.68s)]
*  And used her screen. Really? Yeah. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8049.8s)]
*  No shit. Yeah. I bought my clubs. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8052.68s)]
*  Yeah. And plus, this isn't live. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8055.0s)]
*  You and Jamie should fucking have a little driving contest. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8057.52s)]
*  I think I played before. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8060.72s)]
*  Played with him and Tony before we played together. Yeah. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8062.32s)]
*  Oh, like two years ago. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8065.28s)]
*  Oh, with me, you and Tony, right? Yeah. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8066.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, you won. Yeah. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8069.52s)]
*  How good do you play? [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8072.04s)]
*  How good is Jamie? [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8073.04s)]
*  I don't recall. I mean, I'm not good either. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8074.08s)]
*  So it probably I shoot anywhere from 82 to I want to break a club. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8076.24s)]
*  I don't know what any of those numbers 82 is pretty good sometimes. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8082.0s)]
*  I've shot in the 70s. How is it? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8084.84s)]
*  Pretty good. Yeah, very good. Pretty good. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8086.68s)]
*  I shot. I played 18 holes. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8088.64s)]
*  Yeah. When I was a kid, the guys who golfed all the time [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8091.04s)]
*  were the guys who weren't paying as much attention to their career. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8094.2s)]
*  I remember thinking like a lot of these guys are kind of stagnant [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8097.28s)]
*  because they're golfing all day. Yeah. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8100.16s)]
*  They were in Boston. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8101.92s)]
*  Those guys were golf all fucking day long. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8103.4s)]
*  Get hammered. You go out with no guys. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8105.4800000000005s)]
*  That I started out with. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8108.4800000000005s)]
*  The golfers all wound up spending so much time playing golf. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8110.36s)]
*  I thought it was like, wow, it's a big distraction. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8115.28s)]
*  You should have some activities, but golf is like how many hours? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8118.32s)]
*  Four and a half. That's a lot of hours. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8122.36s)]
*  It's a lot of hours, but also, too. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8124.24s)]
*  It makes you disconnect from all the bullshit that's going on. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8126.76s)]
*  That's in life. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8130.8s)]
*  You know, you don't have to deal with whatever, you know. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8131.8s)]
*  You golf for comics, too. So you get some. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8135.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm going to golf. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8137.76s)]
*  If I can, after I get these shots Thursday with Aaron Berg, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8140.92s)]
*  I think I'm going to golf. Yeah, you definitely can. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8145.08s)]
*  You can golf on Thursday, for sure. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8146.96s)]
*  It's golfing is not going to fuck it up. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8149.240000000001s)]
*  It'll be sore for a day or two after you get the injections. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8151.16s)]
*  Yeah, you'll be fine. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8153.4800000000005s)]

*  Not in the least. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8242.199999999999s)]
*  I can do I can. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8244.08s)]
*  I do 500 crunches. That's amazing. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8245.52s)]
*  I do zero. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8248.320000000002s)]

*  So do I. They're uncomfortable. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8258.44s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8260.400000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8261.320000000002s)]
*  But I think in terms of an exercise for your core, it's kind of nonsense. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8262.24s)]
*  I think you should do things. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8266.2s)]
*  First of all, you should almost always do things that have a range of motion. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8268.640000000001s)]
*  Like when you're you're I like to do things that make my body work as a unit. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8272.44s)]
*  So all the ab exercises that I do, I do a lot of different things for abs. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8277.44s)]
*  I do reverse squats. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8281.960000000001s)]
*  You know what those are? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8283.48s)]
*  You put your ankles strap your ankles to a cable machine. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8284.92s)]
*  You lay on your back and you pull towards you. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8288.24s)]
*  Oh, I know. I do those. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8291.04s)]
*  Well, I got one of those machines where. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8292.32s)]
*  I put my knees in it and I pull up to get the bottom. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8296.08s)]
*  OK, yeah, that's good. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8300.12s)]
*  Those are good. Sure. Yeah, those are good. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8301.28s)]
*  Anything where you work your whole core [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8303.64s)]
*  and then you got to also do the opposite side back extensions. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8305.56s)]
*  You should do that. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8308.519999999999s)]
*  I do it on that thing I showed you show me. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8309.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do back because. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8312.16s)]
*  And I got to lose another 10 pounds again. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8316.4s)]
*  I gained it back. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8318.72s)]

*  Late night, late night poutine. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8623.52s)]
*  Just it's just pure heart attack. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8625.4s)]
*  Yeah, they have different delis in Canada. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8627.84s)]
*  Like we used to go to Montreal, those they call it smoked meat. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8629.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's basically like going to Cantor's, right? [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8633.68s)]
*  Or going to Kat's. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8636.4s)]
*  I've been to a couple of those smoked meat. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8637.84s)]
*  Oh, phenomenal. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8639.84s)]
*  But, you know, if you I heard and I know it's true and I [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8641.04s)]
*  if you eat too much smoked meat, [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8644.880000000001s)]
*  you can get stomach cancer from that, from all that smoked meat. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8647.960000000001s)]
*  Who fucking told you that? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8651.16s)]
*  This guy with stomach cancer. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8652.72s)]
*  No, not true. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8655.0s)]
*  Smoked meat is not what it is. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8656.56s)]
*  There is some connection between burnt meat, [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8658.64s)]
*  like the carbon in burnt meat and cancer. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8661.92s)]
*  I think it's colorectal cancer, [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8665.279999999999s)]
*  but I do not know how robust those studies are. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8667.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, people have been cooking over fire forever. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8670.88s)]
*  I just don't I don't buy it. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8674.88s)]
*  There's a lot of bullshit involved in these studies [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8676.359999999999s)]
*  that tell you that this causes cancer, that causes cancer. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8679.199999999999s)]
*  Here's what 100 percent causes cancer herbicides, pesticides, [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8682.36s)]
*  chemicals, forever chemicals that are in your fucking food. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8686.92s)]
*  That that paper cup that you're drinking out of when you drink hot liquids [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8690.04s)]
*  out of a paper cup. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8693.28s)]
*  We got to throw those fucking paper cups we have. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8695.0s)]
*  Have you seen what Paul Saladino did when he dissolved a Starbucks cup [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8696.92s)]
*  and shows you what's really at the base of it? [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8700.68s)]
*  It's basically a condom. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8702.720000000001s)]
*  And see if you can find Paul Saladino. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8704.560000000001s)]
*  You got all those paper cups. I'll take them. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8706.52s)]
*  I know I saw them today. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8708.400000000001s)]
*  I poured my copy in this. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8710.0s)]
*  We're going to get rid of all our paper cups. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8711.6s)]
*  I'll take them. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8713.04s)]
*  Paper cups for hot liquids are fucking stupid. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8713.720000000001s)]
*  Really? The the lining of those paper cups is plastic. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8715.880000000001s)]
*  So you're basically pouring hot liquid into plastic, which is the worst. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8719.32s)]
*  OK, like, look at see he shows he's dissolving the paper cup. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8723.28s)]
*  And that's what's inside of it. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8727.32s)]
*  So you think you're drinking out of a paper cup, but it's not really paper. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8729.0s)]
*  It's plastic. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8733.800000000001s)]
*  It's there's a plastic lining. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8735.36s)]
*  And that's the only reason why those coffee cups from Starbucks hold paper. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8737.36s)]
*  So hot water to plastic. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8741.76s)]
*  Give me some volume on this. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8744.0s)]
*  Chemicals, PFAs, anything in that plastic is leaching. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8746.08s)]
*  Yeah, my wife. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8749.52s)]
*  To your drink and leaching into your coffee drink. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8750.16s)]
*  So do not think you're getting a paper cup. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8752.56s)]
*  You are getting a plastic cup and you are putting hot water into it. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8754.32s)]
*  That's a horrible, horrible idea. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8757.6s)]
*  Look at that. Looks like a condom. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8758.960000000001s)]
*  What's the solution? [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8760.4s)]
*  Glass jar. Get your coffee in a glass jar or stainless steel mug. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8761.800000000001s)]
*  Simple solution. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8765.08s)]
*  Don't expose hot liquids to plastic like this. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8765.960000000001s)]
*  Horrible idea for your hormones. Horrible for your body. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8767.880000000001s)]
*  Send this to somebody you know who drinks hot coffee out of paper cups like this [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8770.04s)]
*  and needs to get them out of glass or stainless steel. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8774.04s)]
*  You think this is. Yeah, there you go. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8776.2s)]
*  My wife, she won't drink out. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8778.04s)]
*  She knows all the shit. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8779.52s)]

*  So I got my I was so scared. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8939.44s)]
*  OK, this is true. My doctor, whenever I went to my doctor and took any test, [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8941.52s)]
*  he would call me and say, everything's fine. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8947.04s)]
*  They were called. Everything's fine. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8950.560000000001s)]
*  So I took an AIDS test. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8952.84s)]
*  The doctor didn't call. And I get a call from the doctor. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8955.04s)]
*  And he said, can you come in tomorrow? [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8958.16s)]
*  I'm going, what do you mean, come in tomorrow? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8961.08s)]
*  My heart dropped because he would have said everything's fine. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8963.16s)]
*  I go, what do you mean? Why do you want me to come in tomorrow? [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8966.0s)]
*  He goes, your tooth came in and we want to put your tooth. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8968.24s)]
*  It was my dentist. But I heard doctor. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8972.8s)]
*  I thought it was my real doctor telling me I have fucking AIDS. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8975.44s)]
*  You know, because everybody took that test in the 80s. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8979.16s)]
*  And when I first got insurance, I had to get a AIDS test in the 90s. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8982.56s)]
*  And I remember the doctor. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8986.119999999999s)]
*  I said, boy, I'm fucking real nervous about this. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8987.56s)]
*  And the doctor said, are you gay? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8989.96s)]
*  I said, no. He goes, do you do drugs? [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8991.56s)]
*  I don't know. He goes, don't worry about it. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8993.24s)]
*  You don't have it. I go, really? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8995.08s)]
*  He goes, yeah. I go, what about the fucking news? Yeah. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=8997.2s)]
*  The news is freaking me out where I'm scared to touch fucking doorknobs. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9000.720000000001s)]
*  Like, how come? [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9004.76s)]
*  How come the news is saying that everybody's going to get AIDS? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9005.76s)]
*  Listen, no one's getting it other than gay people [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9007.92s)]
*  and people who are interviewed, intervening drug users. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9011.640000000001s)]
*  Well, people on my block were dropping. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9014.12s)]
*  We went to see Peewee in the hospital and all the nurses were wearing masks. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9016.04s)]
*  So we go, I think he has that thing. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9022.28s)]
*  Nobody even knew what the fuck to, you know. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9024.12s)]
*  Yeah, they thought it was contagious. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9026.28s)]
*  By the way, that was Fauci, too. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9027.76s)]
*  Back then? Yeah. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9030.2s)]
*  Who's responsible for all that? [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9031.720000000001s)]
*  Fauci was responsible for people freaking out about AIDS. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9033.560000000001s)]
*  Fauci was on TV back in the 80s telling people [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9036.04s)]
*  that children could possibly catch it from people. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9038.52s)]
*  Yes. Wow. Yeah. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9041.84s)]
*  Do you know the Dallas Buyers Club, where they were limiting [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9043.320000000002s)]
*  the medication that gay people could take? [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9046.320000000002s)]
*  That was about Fauci. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9048.640000000001s)]
*  He was responsible for that. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9051.12s)]
*  He was the one who pushed AZT on people back then. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9052.480000000001s)]
*  AZT was that chemotherapy medication that was killing people quicker [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9055.279999999999s)]
*  than the cancer was. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9059.599999999999s)]
*  They stopped using it on cancer and they repurposed it [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9060.519999999999s)]
*  and started using it on people that had AIDS. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9063.24s)]
*  And it kills you dead. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9065.279999999999s)]
*  They were giving it to people that didn't even have any fucking symptoms. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9067.439999999999s)]
*  They had HIV, they had no symptoms. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9070.72s)]
*  They'd given them AZT. They were dying in months. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9072.4s)]
*  It was the only time ever in medical history [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9075.599999999999s)]
*  where they were telling you to take a chemotherapy drug indefinitely. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9077.72s)]
*  Every time you take chemotherapy, the idea is that [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9082.0s)]
*  it gets your body close to death, but kills off the cancer. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9084.64s)]
*  They were telling you to keep taking it. Just keep taking it. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9089.8s)]
*  It's nuts. What they did is madness. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9092.279999999999s)]
*  If you read Robert Kennedy's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9094.68s)]
*  it's all about that. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9098.119999999999s)]
*  And the beginning of it is all about the AIDS crisis [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9098.92s)]
*  and all the different things that they did that mirrors [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9100.76s)]
*  exactly what they did during the COVID crisis. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9102.84s)]
*  So what drugs are they using now? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9105.16s)]
*  They started using protease inhibitors, and that really helped. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9107.72s)]
*  Like the whole AIDS thing is very complex. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9110.279999999999s)]
*  It's very complex because the vast majority of the people [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9113.2s)]
*  that got AIDS were heavy drug users, heavy drug users, [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9115.68s)]
*  or gay guys who were experiencing, you know, a lot of different sexual partners. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9119.68s)]
*  But it was because of blood being transferred. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9124.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's part of it. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9126.76s)]
*  But it's also part of it. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9127.6s)]
*  You're destroying your immune system with fucking drugs. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9128.52s)]
*  These guys were taking amyl nitrate and crystal meth and partying [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9131.28s)]
*  and not sleeping, just crushing their immune system. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9135.52s)]
*  Plus sharing needles with the blood going from. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9138.36s)]
*  Yep, that too. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9140.84s)]
*  And then they would get them on medication. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9141.76s)]
*  It would definitely kill them. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9143.32s)]
*  And then it was a crisis. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9144.439999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, everybody was running around scared. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9145.76s)]
*  And I was scared, too, until I talked to my doctor. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9147.72s)]
*  He just looked me in the eyes. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9151.199999999999s)]
*  But no one could say that back then. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9152.72s)]
*  So this is like 90. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9154.24s)]
*  Maybe one, maybe maybe 91, 92 when I went away. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9158.439999999999s)]
*  And when I got in, my doctor was like, don't worry about it. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9162.599999999999s)]
*  I was like, what about the news, man? [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9164.76s)]
*  Like, I remember talking to this guy was a young guy. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9167.4s)]
*  I was like, why is the news telling me I could get he goes, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9169.64s)]
*  heterosexuals aren't getting this. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9172.68s)]
*  Well, unless you're an intervist drug user, don't worry about it. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9174.199999999999s)]
*  I only check this. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9176.76s)]
*  I shot dope like maybe three times. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9178.24s)]
*  What was it like? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9181.56s)]
*  I didn't like it. It's just not it. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9183.0s)]
*  You know, I was more of a up, you know, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9184.68s)]
*  we're not shooting dope to feel like. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9187.84s)]
*  What did it feel like? Just down. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9189.64s)]
*  And I can't. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9191.56s)]
*  It wasn't I did it with Bastille and he was a major drug. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9193.599999999999s)]
*  He was a major one. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9197.279999999999s)]
*  He was funny, though. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9198.76s)]
*  Frankie was funny. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9200.64s)]
*  I remember seeing him for the first time when I was an open mic'er in 88. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9201.76s)]
*  Yeah. And he was just a wild dude. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9205.48s)]
*  He was like one of the first guys I ever saw with tattoos, all these tattoos. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9208.12s)]
*  And he does heroin. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9210.880000000001s)]
*  Everybody. Yeah. Oh, really? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9212.28s)]
*  It was heroin. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9214.12s)]
*  When someone did heroin back there and it was crazy. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9215.24s)]
*  Like, what? He does heroin. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9217.64s)]
*  Now think about how many people are hooked on opiates. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9219.52s)]
*  Well, back then, it was super rare. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9222.76s)]
*  Well, the difference between heroin and like free base. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9224.24s)]
*  You can function on heroin. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9227.36s)]
*  There's functioning heroin heroin addicts for years. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9229.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do it. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9232.480000000001s)]
*  You can't function on free base or coke. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9234.36s)]
*  You got to keep having it. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9236.76s)]
*  I had a buddy of mine who was a longshoreman, [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9238.240000000002s)]
*  and he would tell me that this guy he would work with and not just one guy, [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9240.320000000002s)]
*  but one guy that he was work with, that he was a friend on his lunch break, [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9243.2s)]
*  get a bag of heroin, shoot it up in his car, [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9246.160000000002s)]
*  sit there for a half an hour and then go back to work. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9248.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Crazy. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9250.880000000001s)]
*  You can't do that with free base. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9252.720000000001s)]
*  It's nonstop. You got to keep. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9254.160000000002s)]
*  So does that your thing? Free base? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9256.560000000001s)]
*  And yeah, free base, free. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9258.48s)]
*  What was it? How old were you when you first free based? [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9260.0s)]

*  Coke. And then so snorting coke. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9270.08s)]
*  I snorted coke probably when I was started, when I was 18 or 19. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9273.36s)]
*  Right. And then when you were. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9277.960000000001s)]
*  Crack, probably 25 to 28. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9280.68s)]
*  Do you remember the first time you did it? [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9283.12s)]
*  I think it was with my cousin. Yeah, it was like, I go, this is good. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9285.68s)]
*  I mean, I guess there was one here. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9291.28s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I guess so many of them. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9292.92s)]
*  So my friend. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9295.68s)]
*  I was on the road. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9299.720000000001s)]
*  I came back, he goes, look, I'm going to buy an eighth of coke, [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9301.08s)]
*  cut it into five halves, five half grams. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9304.76s)]
*  OK. And we'll do two half grams and I'll sell [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9308.0s)]
*  the other three. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9314.32s)]
*  I know where this is going. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9316.32s)]
*  Well, we did one or two. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9317.960000000001s)]
*  And then he went to sleep. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9321.2s)]
*  And so this is fucked up. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9323.84s)]
*  I find I found where he hid it. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9328.8s)]
*  Oh, so he didn't hide it as good as you hide your money. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9331.36s)]
*  No, I went in and I steal one at a time. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9334.32s)]
*  I drove to the convenience store. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9339.48s)]
*  I cooked it with ammonia, right? [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9342.240000000002s)]
*  Ammonia. Yeah, clear ammonia. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9344.36s)]
*  Wait a minute. You actually cooked the coke and turned it into crack. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9346.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Why? [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9349.16s)]
*  Why would you do that? Is it better that way? [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9350.68s)]
*  Oh, that's how you get free base crack. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9352.640000000001s)]
*  You got to you got a process. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9354.76s)]
*  You could do it with baking soda. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9356.480000000001s)]
*  You could do it in a boil it. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9358.2s)]
*  Now, who taught you how to do this? [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9360.560000000001s)]
*  Are you a chemist? [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9362.560000000001s)]
*  I was a crack addict. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9363.92s)]
*  So like other crack addicts were like giving you the recipe. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9365.400000000001s)]
*  No, I learned just three ways to do it. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9368.2s)]
*  So I did it with order for with ether, which you could blow up your house. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9371.6s)]
*  So I would steal a half a gram from them. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9375.720000000001s)]
*  I would go to the convenience store. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9379.76s)]
*  I'd cook it, smoke it and pour out the ammonia. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9382.0s)]
*  I said, I can't. Well, how do you do it? [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9385.4s)]
*  I don't want to help. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9388.880000000001s)]
*  You put it in. It's the Internet. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9390.56s)]
*  Chat GBT. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9392.52s)]
*  Yeah, make it as chat GBT right now. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9393.48s)]
*  I'll tell you how do you take cocaine and turn it into free base? [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9396.04s)]
*  You put in a teaspoon and you light it. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9399.0s)]
*  And it turns into a rock. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9401.720000000001s)]
*  OK. And then you squeeze it. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9403.56s)]
*  You squeeze and try to get the ammonia out as much as you can in the rock. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9406.720000000001s)]
*  So I would pull I would. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9411.08s)]
*  Get the ammonia, steal a half a gram from him. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9413.880000000001s)]
*  Go to the bright early in the morning. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9417.4s)]
*  Come back, cook it, pour the ammonia out. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9420.880000000001s)]
*  Well, now I was. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9424.0s)]
*  Chats GBT, the chemistry behind how it's made for educational purposes only, [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9426.16s)]
*  not intended to encourage illegal activity. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9429.96s)]
*  Baking soda, I said you could do a cocaine hydrochloride powder [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9431.839999999998s)]
*  with baking soda and water. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9436.24s)]
*  Sometimes ammonia is used instead of baking soda, [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9437.439999999999s)]
*  but baking soda is more common for crack. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9439.4s)]
*  Heat the mixture as it's heated. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9441.48s)]
*  The cocaine bases separate from the hydrochloride and form solid rocks [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9443.439999999999s)]
*  that float to the top, cool and dry. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9447.279999999999s)]
*  This is like a recipe. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9449.839999999998s)]
*  Solid pieces. The crack rocks are cooled and hardened, then dried. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9451.08s)]
*  So they go. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9455.88s)]
*  I emptied out the first bottle. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9457.199999999999s)]
*  Then there was two or three more, half grams. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9459.48s)]
*  I went and stole another one. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9462.68s)]
*  Went back to the convenience store, bought more ammonia. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9464.76s)]
*  After the fourth trip to the convenience store, I go, hey, listen, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9468.439999999999s)]
*  I got to clean in business. We need a lot of ammonia. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9471.439999999999s)]
*  Well, I smoked all his coke. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9475.32s)]
*  And all of a sudden I hear somebody yell, fuck. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9477.359999999999s)]
*  He woke up and saw his coke was gone. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9481.08s)]
*  How many hours had passed? [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9483.439999999999s)]
*  Probably four. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9485.0s)]
*  How many trips to the convenience store? Four. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9486.199999999999s)]

*  I mean, call it a career. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9504.16s)]
*  It was a crack career. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9505.72s)]
*  Well, I think I told this story years ago, but I'll tell it. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9507.56s)]
*  And he doesn't care because he told it in his book. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9511.279999999999s)]

*  they would wear a handkerchief and go rob a bank. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9715.72s)]
*  Well, I want to be the outlaw of Vanchulikos, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9719.88s)]
*  where I go up a little dummy and put a handkerchief this way. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9722.359999999999s)]

*  of being a ventriloquist. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz1S-GyYB0U&t=9741.72s)]
