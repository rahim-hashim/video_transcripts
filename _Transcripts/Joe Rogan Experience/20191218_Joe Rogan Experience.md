# JRE MMA Show #85 with Max Holloway
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 18, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N2FjjLAS6E)
*  Took yoga, hung out with my dog, and now we're here.
*  Alright, we're live. What's up Max? How are you brother? Good to see you.
*  I'm good. How you doing?
*  I'm good.
*  Finally here. I've been asking for about, I think, what, 17? 17 fights straight.
*  When am I getting on the ocean?
*  We tried to organize it a couple of times, but Mayman, you live on an island in the middle of the ocean.
*  I know.
*  It's a little, it's a different thing, you know, logistically.
*  I know, I know, but you finally made it happen.
*  Yes, we finally made it happen.
*  You're the man, I can't wait.
*  So how you doing man? Everything alright?
*  Everything good.
*  Walking good.
*  I'm walking great.
*  Yeah, you look totally fine.
*  Oh yeah, I told you guys, I had an affa party after the fight. I was boogin'.
*  Were you really?
*  Yeah, chain smokers, they were actually at Excess.
*  They had their concert thing at Excess and they brought me up into their booth and I was trying to get him to let me jump on and off the stage with him because he looked like he was having fun.
*  That's amazing man because your left leg, it looked like, at least during the fight, it was getting busted up.
*  Yeah, yeah, you know, it's, yeah, it is what it is, you know.
*  I heard, I saw, I got to watch the fight a little bit over, you know, and you're not talking about the fight.
*  A lot of people, actually about the press conference, when I said I thought I won, I think so people, people is taking it the wrong way.
*  A lot of his fans is taking it the wrong way.
*  It's like when I was in there, in my mind, I thought I won because I, when you think about it, I thought I was landing more damaging shots to the head and body, you know.
*  I know leg kicks, he was landing here and there, but I didn't think it was too much until after I saw whatever happened, you know.
*  But at the end of the day, you know, it's like, it's what I said, I just, my legs went fire, went to the after party, I danced and if I put it in this way, you know, out of all my title fights,
*  this is the least damage I took in a title fight and I lost my belt.
*  You mean like to the face and to the body.
*  Yeah, to the face and to the body, you know, and he hit me with, I know he was landing some leg kicks and some was power,
*  but then a bunch of other ones I thought so was like, you know, I didn't know that it was landing that much to that extent and then again, this is not a street fight, you know.
*  It's not a street fight. It's a game and he helped pointing me in the game, so you know, good for him.
*  Yeah, it's an interesting game when it comes to scoring, right, because like what should be scored more, punches or leg kicks, like, you know, it's hard.
*  Like leg kicks are damaging. They mean a lot. Fights have been stopped on leg kicks, you know, but Barboza, I think, stopped two people with leg kicks.
*  Yeah, two people, yeah.
*  Yeah, but it's just, it's, I think the system sucks. The 10-point must system, it's boxing system. It's not our system.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We shouldn't have that system.
*  Yeah.
*  We should have a more comprehensive system that recognizes everything.
*  And then sometimes it's weird too, you know, especially like, not technically my fight, but like other fights, like people, you see people who stick and move nice and this and that.
*  And just because the guy is walking forward, he's winning the fight.
*  Right, right.
*  And then like you see them get into, you see people get into scuffles and then one guy bounced back. It looks like he's retreating, but he's actually not.
*  He landed more in the scuffle and since he bounced back, they're like, oh, I think that guy that was staying there was actually winning the fight.
*  So it's just, it's what you said. Is this super like, you know, some guys like they favor a little bit more thing than another thing.
*  And I think there's a real problem with judges not even being martial artists.
*  That's why Bert Watson say, don't be a judge.
*  But that's easier said than done.
*  It is, especially when you find the best guys in the world too.
*  You can't expose it. It's not smart. It's not a smart way to fight. You know, the way you're fighting is the best way to fight.
*  But the judges should at least have some martial arts experience.
*  And I know there's a bunch of them that have never even fucking trained.
*  I just took some courses.
*  I was talking to some people was talking to that was behind the scenes just talking to they came from the DC was the DC event in front of Arizona.
*  And some of the commission there at the DC event was like, I heard was crazy.
*  Like some people was just not like they didn't know anything.
*  Yeah. Not supposed to be there.
*  I was like, what is going on? And like, to put it in perspective for people out there, it's like, you know, like, it's all I do for a living.
*  Right. It's all I do.
*  So like to me, I got to put the trust in someone that doesn't know what they're doing when I'm over here sacrificing my time.
*  It's kind of hard. You know, I'm not talking about my fight again.
*  I'm just talking about other people.
*  Yeah. Anytime there's a bad decision.
*  You know, it's just it's just tough.
*  You know, it's horrible. It's horrible.
*  And they don't do anything about it.
*  And there's people that have put in bad decision after bad decision.
*  And then you see them still being listed as judges.
*  And you're like, this is crazy.
*  Like, I want to ask them questions.
*  I want to show them a video.
*  I heard that last time I was inside right before I did my press conference and stuff.
*  I heard you go, who is judging this?
*  We need to fire everyone.
*  They do need to fire everyone.
*  You know what they should do, man?
*  They should hire ex fighters.
*  They should. They should.
*  I was I talked to Frank Trigg before he moved off of Hawaii.
*  And he was trying to become a become a he's ref.
*  He's reffing. And now he finally got to Bellator and UFC.
*  I think he just did UFC for the first time a couple of weeks ago, a couple of months ago.
*  And I was telling him, like, why would they not just let you put in there?
*  There's like, oh, there's a time system. You need to do this.
*  I was like, you fought for a championship belt in the highest organization.
*  What?
*  Who in their right mind is being like, yeah, this guy's not qualified.
*  I would I would want you sitting or judging my fight.
*  You know what I mean?
*  100 percent.
*  Like, just because someone OK, maybe they did take a class, but it's like it's like license.
*  You know, just because you drive it like a passage license test doesn't mean you should be allowed to drive on the road.
*  You know what it's like? It's like passing a written test, but never having driven a car.
*  Exactly. That's what it's like.
*  Here's your driver's license. You don't even know how to fucking hit the gas.
*  You don't know how much brake you should apply.
*  When you see some of these people that are judging, you know they've never done anything.
*  They've never done anything. They don't.
*  They don't have any idea what's going on.
*  They just have a cursory understanding of fighting.
*  And that's not acceptable for the highest level of the game.
*  There's so many ex fighters that would make amazing referees or judges.
*  And there's so well, I don't have much of a problem with referees.
*  There's a lot of great referees.
*  But there's so many people that could be great judges.
*  There's so many super fans out there that have been training their whole life that just they're really,
*  they're really, really into the sport.
*  A lot of these judges, they're not even fans.
*  They're just people that are doing it for a job. They're getting a paycheck.
*  And then getting to watch the fights for free live, you know, front row.
*  And they don't even care. They're not even fans. It's ridiculous.
*  Yeah, it's crazy. It's funny.
*  Yeah, like you said, the fans, I actually think of, what is his name? I'm brain farting right now.
*  Joe, the old matchmaker.
*  Joe Silver.
*  Joe Silver.
*  Yeah, I actually think, have you ever heard his story of how he got to work for USC?
*  Yes.
*  That's when you were saying like they're super fans. Like he's one of the guys.
*  He was a super fan.
*  He shot, hey, Joe Silver was the guys, shout out to Joe Silver.
*  Shout out to Joe Silver.
*  He was the first guy that actually like shot his shot.
*  He told me how, I heard his story. He told me his story in person.
*  Like he wrote down, he told me what he did. He wrote a letter to USC, this and that.
*  And like what he think he should change, this and that.
*  And then they called him up and be like, hey, would you like to come up? We like your ideas.
*  And then the dude got set up, you know?
*  Like wow, Joe Silver is the first shot shooter, guys.
*  Yeah, well he's a legit fan. I mean, still is to this day.
*  He made enough money, he retired, he's a smart man. He just said, fuck this, I'm out.
*  I don't want to work like this anymore.
*  Why? You just got, you just, you were a part of a business when they got bought out.
*  You might as well chill with your family, you know?
*  Yeah, he just decided to just lay back, build himself a nice house.
*  I know, even that, like what his story is so mean, like there's like saying, like oh yeah, you got to move here, this and that.
*  He's like, nope, I can do it from home.
*  I was like, Joe, you are a boss.
*  Joseph is a boss. When he started, they're like, my gosh, Joe, you're a boss.
*  It's a hard gig, it's a hard gig setting up fights.
*  Well, MMA fights in particular because guys get injured so much more than in boxing.
*  In anything.
*  That's one thing that I like talking to people or telling people, they're like, oh, there's so different with this and that and blah blah blah.
*  I'm like, guys, boxers, MLB, NBA, NFL, they have the set schedule.
*  They have a set schedule.
*  Like I can sit down, Lebron can sit down before the year, right when they announced their first regular season, he knew exactly where he was going to be the whole year.
*  Boxers do the same thing. They know exactly where we're going to fight this month and this month.
*  They don't know what the opponent's name, but after a fight, they already kind of know who they're fighting.
*  You know, MMA fighters, they're like, don't you know what's going on?
*  I was like, I have no clue.
*  Right.
*  I have no clue.
*  You almost fought Khabib for the title on super short notice.
*  Yeah, for six days.
*  How much did you weigh when you were trying to get down to 55 and they stopped you?
*  When they stopped me?
*  What did you weigh when you started?
*  I was, I was, when we got the call, when I got there, when I checked in, I was already, the day before weight check, I'll tell you what I was the day of the weight cut.
*  I was 170.
*  170, the day of the weight cut.
*  And I, and I tell you, I'm not going to tell you exact number, I was before they stopped me, but I was like in reach.
*  Like I was right there.
*  But why did they stop you?
*  They came in the room, they looked at me.
*  They said, they said, oh yeah, you don't look good.
*  Yeah, we're cutting it.
*  I was like, what?
*  I was like, I feel good.
*  Let's do it.
*  You know, it was right there.
*  And then that's just what they said, you know, and it is what it is.
*  They had a real problem with New York in the beginning.
*  I mean, especially there's a lot of people that just weren't prepared for MMA.
*  I mean, I mean, like, I mean the New York cards period don't have a lot of luck at all.
*  Every time you see one, something happened.
*  And I told, and then I heard them, they're going back to Brooklyn or whatever.
*  Where is Tony fighting?
*  Tony is fighting.
*  Brooklyn.
*  Why?
*  What?
*  I think they're just fighting Vegas or something.
*  They had a Brooklyn card already scheduled and that was a good fight.
*  And so they put it in there.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  But God, you got to keep Tony away from cables the day before the fight.
*  Tony just, someone needs to just be around him all the time, just ready to catch him.
*  Just please make this.
*  This is the fifth fucking time.
*  It's scheduled this fight.
*  Hey, you know what they say, right?
*  Fifth time's the charm.
*  It's a great fight though.
*  I love the fight.
*  I can't wait.
*  I'm excited.
*  Dialistically, I think he's the best guy that Khabib's ever faced because he can fight off his back.
*  He's a guy that doesn't survive off his back.
*  He attacks off his back.
*  And he's a guy who just, he just, he throws a lot of weird things from weird places.
*  It's just hard.
*  People don't understand it.
*  It's very hard when you fight someone weird and awkward, even Spartan, because you try to get something and then he's just like, bang, hits you with an elbow.
*  But his head is by the ground.
*  What are you doing, Tony?
*  How did I get hit by an elbow?
*  I thought your head is over here.
*  He's the most unorthodox high level guy ever.
*  Yeah, he's good. He's real good.
*  He's real good.
*  At his level though, because I consider him a world championship caliber fighter.
*  For sure.
*  And at his level, I don't know of anybody that's more unorthodox than him.
*  For sure.
*  And his fucking cardio, man.
*  His cardio is crazy.
*  Off the chain.
*  Off the charts.
*  I've never seen anybody with cardio like that.
*  I don't know what the fuck it is.
*  Do you think that's genetic to some extent?
*  To some extent?
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I think you gotta have it.
*  Everybody keeps telling me, oh, you gotta...
*  It's just like knockout power.
*  You can't build it.
*  Right.
*  But some people just have it.
*  I was talking to my friends.
*  I got a little Japanese friend.
*  He's with me on my corner all the time.
*  My wrestling coach.
*  He helped me a lot, Michael Nakagawa.
*  And I tell him all the time, this dude is a little 125 pound, 115 pound guy.
*  Pretty much a little girl, I tell him all the time.
*  I'm like, you're a little girl.
*  But if anything, there was this one time we was out and about, and this guy was just acting crazy.
*  This is like a couple years back.
*  I was at the UFC, but we was at one of the UFC events.
*  I forget what event we was at.
*  But we was doing something.
*  There was a big thing, and we was at a party.
*  And then this one Asian dude was just getting all crazy in people's faces.
*  Like crazy drunk.
*  And blah, blah, getting in his face.
*  And I told...
*  This is how hard my friend punches.
*  I tell him, I tell him, guy, I would crack him, but I'm scared I'm not going to put him to sleep.
*  I know if you punch him, he's going to go knock out.
*  So you go hit him.
*  And he wouldn't hit him, though.
*  He wouldn't hit him.
*  But he punches so hard.
*  He's the smallest guy in our group.
*  Even one time we was at home in Waikiki walking.
*  And there's this drunk guy.
*  And there's five of us.
*  And he's the smallest guy in the back.
*  And we're all walking in almost a line.
*  And this big guy, he slips everybody.
*  Little guy last, he bumps them hard.
*  And I look at him, I'm like, what are you...
*  And then he goes to the little guy.
*  He turns to my friend and he's like, what?
*  And my friend goes, what?
*  And then he's like, oh, okay, nothing.
*  And he walks away.
*  And I told him, and I told...
*  We was hanging out with this new guy.
*  This guy was just hanging out with us.
*  I told him, that is the wrong guy to bump into.
*  Because out of everyone here, he'd probably one punch, knock you out.
*  He's the smallest guy.
*  This is it.
*  I think it's just genetics.
*  It's punching powers in you.
*  It's definitely a genetic thing.
*  Look at Deontay Wilder.
*  There's no way you can teach that kind of power.
*  200, what is it?
*  215?
*  215.
*  And he's cracking.
*  Flatlining people.
*  On the forehead.
*  Yeah, but he's killing people.
*  This is not guys who's getting flash KOs.
*  No.
*  Wilder is different.
*  That he could wake up.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But everybody else he hits, they're like...
*  They go flying.
*  Did you not see that video they made of his last fight?
*  The Soul Keeper?
*  Yes.
*  But that's what it's like, man.
*  That's what it's like when he hit Ortiz on the fucking forehead, man.
*  You hit him on the forehead.
*  You hit him in the chin.
*  That's how you know you hit hard.
*  You just hit different.
*  Yeah, but he does it to everybody.
*  When you look at his record, he's got 40 knockouts in 42 fights.
*  One decision and one draw.
*  40 knockouts in 42 fights.
*  Fucking crazy.
*  And then when you look at it, he's huge.
*  He's skinny.
*  He's ripped.
*  But he's very thin.
*  You would be like, he's a skinny dude.
*  Right.
*  And...
*  Like if you looked at Anthony Joshua...
*  You would think he would knock out people.
*  He would knock out everybody.
*  Especially before he fought Ruiz the first time.
*  He was super...
*  He got a little more lean after the first fight.
*  But yeah, he's big.
*  Do you remember Frank Bruno?
*  Frank Bruno.
*  Frank Bruno was a boxer from England.
*  That was like one of the biggest guys ever.
*  And Mike Tyson fucked him up.
*  He was this big, giant dude though.
*  He was so big.
*  He built like a bodybuilder.
*  You thought he would just flatline people.
*  And Mike Tyson just smushed him.
*  Mike Tyson, Mike is genetic.
*  Yes, genetic.
*  We're talking about genetics.
*  Did you not see the video of Mike Tyson showing...
*  Nogano?
*  Yes.
*  How to slip.
*  Woo woo woo.
*  In his 50s.
*  Come on, guy.
*  Why are you moving like this?
*  Teddy Atmos told me that when he was 13 years old, Tyson weighed 190 pounds.
*  What?
*  He brought him to smokers.
*  Yeah, it was true.
*  He brought him to smokers.
*  And they would go, how old is this kid?
*  He goes, 13.
*  He goes, get the fuck out of here.
*  He's 16.
*  He's like, I'm telling you, he's 13.
*  They would put him in with 16 year olds.
*  Because they wouldn't believe him.
*  They didn't believe he was 13.
*  You sure they didn't do that from...
*  What is that called?
*  What is that one movie?
*  That one movie, that baseball movie.
*  I remember when he was like, on 13.
*  Oh, right, right.
*  No, Tyson, it's real.
*  Yeah, man, genetics are real.
*  There's him with Nogano.
*  Look at that.
*  Watch this.
*  Watch this move.
*  He looks like such an elder statesman too, you know, with his beard.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and then watch when he does his slip thing.
*  Where is his slip one?
*  Oh, I think that was a different one.
*  That was him...
*  Oh, here it is.
*  Here it is.
*  Here it is.
*  Bring it from the beginning.
*  Put it from the beginning, Jamie.
*  Whoop.
*  Whoop.
*  Whoop.
*  Yeah, he's showing them angles.
*  This guy is a beast.
*  Well, you know, Nogano is thinking about fighting in boxing.
*  For real?
*  Yes.
*  And I think that's not a bad idea because the boxing heavyweight division is like, it's
*  very good at the very top.
*  There's like four or five really, really good guys.
*  But I think he could merc motherfuckers on the way up and he'd probably make a shitload
*  of money.
*  I mean...
*  Oh, yeah, definitely.
*  100%.
*  Now that UFC is getting involved in boxing, I don't think it's a bad idea.
*  Yeah.
*  You've got to get past Rosenstrike.
*  Rosenstrike is a scary fucking dude.
*  That thing he did to Alistair's lip, I've never seen a cut that bad before.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The one with five seconds left?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  That just shows you how nuts the sport is, right?
*  Alistair is winning the fight on points.
*  He's scoring.
*  He's fighting smart.
*  And he just has a mental lapse.
*  Gains inches, seconds, millimeters.
*  You know, just...
*  You just cannot, you know?
*  That's the hardest thing of being in a fight.
*  You just got to be on.
*  You got to just keep...
*  Because there's sometimes like, oh, I'm just going to just do, do, do.
*  Boom.
*  Five seconds left.
*  Winning the whole fight on the scoreboard.
*  He's winning.
*  They showed it.
*  How sick is that to watch after going that far, you're five seconds away from the final
*  bell, and then you're going home with a fat cut.
*  You probably need like 400 stitches on that lip.
*  Yeah.
*  Your lip not to ever look the same.
*  Look at that lip.
*  Look at that picture.
*  That is...
*  I am crazy.
*  That is without a doubt the nastiest fucking injury I've ever seen in this world.
*  I mean, I almost rather get a broken leg than that.
*  Oh, no, no.
*  Definitely not.
*  Almost.
*  Like Anderson's broken leg.
*  Oh, no, no.
*  Look at that though.
*  Look at him.
*  He's smiling.
*  That motherfucker...
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Alistair takes a loss.
*  You take a loss better than anybody.
*  But Alistair's right up there.
*  It is what it is.
*  It's living.
*  It's life.
*  I love that saying though.
*  It is what it is.
*  It is what it is.
*  It's life.
*  It is life.
*  Yeah.
*  After the fight, we were walking around with me and my son the next day on...
*  Oh, not the next day.
*  Oh yeah, it is the next day.
*  Sunday.
*  I'm walking into New York.
*  New York.
*  There's a Hawaiian.
*  I love Hawaiians.
*  I love my Hawaiians.
*  They're the greatest fans in the world.
*  She comes up to me and she rubs my back and she's like, oh, I'm so sorry, boy.
*  Blah, blah.
*  I'm like, for what?
*  She's like, you lost your fight?
*  I'm like, Andy, I'm alive.
*  I didn't die.
*  It's okay.
*  You know, we're going to get the belt back.
*  It's just a fight.
*  It's one fight.
*  We'll be back.
*  But yeah, a lot of people talking to me like it's my funeral or something.
*  I'm like, guys, I'm okay.
*  I'm going to be back.
*  I didn't take no real damage.
*  I'm just happy that I'm not injured and out for a long time and I can get back to do what
*  I love and that's punching people in the face.
*  At the end of the day, I'm happy.
*  Like I said, I didn't need the belt to be a champion.
*  I know I'm a champion.
*  The belt was just to let people know that, look, I'm one of the greatest guys to ever
*  do it.
*  You know, and my plan is to still be one of the greatest of all time.
*  And whoever you guys think it is, let me know.
*  I'll go knock on the front door right now and be like, hey, let's set something up.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you just need to make some adjustments for a rematch.
*  Exactly.
*  The whole thing was him attacking your legs.
*  Yeah.
*  He was getting close.
*  It was a smart strategy.
*  Yeah.
*  It was real good.
*  Game of inches, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  He did what he did.
*  Like we said, it's not a street fight.
*  He did the points.
*  He's nice.
*  You switch better than anybody.
*  You're really good at switching while you're fighting.
*  You switch stances.
*  You switch orthodox.
*  But you were forced at certain times in the fight to fight Southpaw because of the leg
*  damage, right?
*  Not really because of the leg damage, because I just felt when I was going Southpaw against
*  him, I just felt more like he was just, he was waiting a lot more.
*  Like as soon as I went regular, it was funny because like I was like, I could hear, I could
*  hear his teammates style, I could hear his coach.
*  As soon as I go with Southpaw, they're not really saying anything.
*  And then as soon as I switch back to regular, I hear the word, dragon, dragon.
*  And dragon was leg kick.
*  I was like, oh, leg kick's coming.
*  Like dragon tails?
*  I don't know what they were calling, but they were saying dragon.
*  It was like leg kick.
*  So I could hear it in there and I was like, okay, well, let's go Southpaw and see what
*  they start calling here.
*  And they wasn't really calling anything.
*  They were just like, you need to punch now or you need to move now and attack.
*  So I guess so they wasn't really ready for a Southpaw, Max, more than a regular.
*  Cause as soon as I went back regular, they was screaming dragon, like it was religious
*  or something.
*  So it was crazy.
*  It was crazy.
*  What did you think he was going to fight like?
*  What did you think his strategy was going to be coming into the fight?
*  I, you know, I thought so.
*  I thought so he was going to, I knew he was going to do that.
*  A lot of faints for sure.
*  You know, I thought he was going to do like how he did although maybe live in more, get
*  me against the fence, but I think so he's kind of tripping out when he, when he got
*  me there and I was able to get off and some, some of them, I think so he's tripping out
*  that he couldn't take, like he, he was going to, I thought so they was playing a narrative
*  like there's going to take me down and ground and pound me and stuff, you know?
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know what we did.
*  I think so we did good.
*  And then he just did better in one aspect with the late kicks and it all added up.
*  Yeah.
*  When I have to watch the fight again, but I don't remember him landing a real significant
*  punch that had you hurt.
*  Nah, nah, not really.
*  It was good punches, but it was just his leg kick work was excellent though.
*  I mean, he, he, he did a lot of great work.
*  Some of the first ones in the first round, some of the first ones was great.
*  It was, it was good in the early rounds, but some of the other ones was just like, we was
*  super close and then he just throw it like, you know, like I'll just, we'd end up getting
*  into a tango and he would just end with a leg kick just for, just to even touch me,
*  you know?
*  So at the end there, I was like, Oh, I guess that was the game plan was to leg kick him.
*  Well, you got to get a rematch.
*  I mean, you are without a doubt the most accomplished featherweight champion of all time.
*  I mean, if you, you look at your career, you beat Aldo twice, you beat basically everybody.
*  You beat everybody in the division, Ortega, you beat all the up and comers, you beat all
*  the veterans, you beat everybody was there.
*  And so in my eyes, like a rematch makes sense and it's a very exciting fight.
*  It would be a great rematch.
*  Yeah.
*  It would sell.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to sell for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, you know, there's no, it's not like, you know, you lost the title, Volkonovsky
*  beat you, but there's another guy who's been like begging and pleading and right there with
*  everybody wants to see fight for the title.
*  Yeah, Volkonovsky was that guy.
*  Volkonovsky was that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's good guys in the division, but you've beaten most of the guys.
*  Like Ortega was the big guy, right?
*  Yeah.
*  He was the one that everybody wanted to see you fight because he was undefeated and he
*  would win in such spectacular ways.
*  But you, you know, you've, you deserve a rematch.
*  Yeah.
*  I really feel like.
*  Yeah.
*  We see what happens.
*  You know, I heard a little bit, they didn't hit me up yet, but I heard Dana saying something
*  in Australia or whatever, but.
*  Yeah.
*  That would be fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Australia would be the move.
*  And we see what happens.
*  You know, I'm just, you know how it is.
*  I got this never backed down attitude.
*  Do you believe that little motherfucker used to be 240 pounds?
*  How crazy is that?
*  That, that is crazy.
*  You know, he was a tank when he was playing rugby.
*  He was just like a bulldozer.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know how someone that tall is that heavy.
*  You know, good for him.
*  Like a, like an Andy release on her hands for a little bit.
*  Well, he was, yeah.
*  Well, he wasn't that fat though.
*  He was just huge.
*  Yeah.
*  He's just jacked.
*  He's just huge.
*  You still see it in his legs.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a big boy.
*  He's a tough fucking guy, man.
*  It's, it's interesting to see this city kickboxing gym, you know, from style Bender and Dan hang,
*  hang man, hooker, hooker.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like a big motherfucker.
*  Yeah.
*  I was a big hooker fan for a while.
*  Yeah.
*  For a while.
*  I've been watching him since he was four.
*  When he was in 45, I was watching him.
*  I was like, I was like, we're probably going to end up fighting each other when he was at
*  45 and he went to 55.
*  And everybody was like saying, he's a big 45 and I mean, 55, he make these 55 guys look
*  small.
*  He's pretty jacked.
*  He's huge.
*  Yeah.
*  He's good.
*  I love watching their style.
*  Yeah.
*  He's had one, one bad fight where it didn't go his way.
*  That was the fight against Barboza, but he just, he stood with Barboza, which is just a fucking
*  terrible idea for most people.
*  Barboza kicks so goddamn good.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the fastest switch kicker I've ever seen in my life.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never seen anybody throw a switch kick class.
*  I never did.
*  I always try to, I always try, like I watch his fights and then I always try to go to
*  the gym and mimic it.
*  I'm like, yeah, I can't be doing this.
*  I don't even know how he can balance that fast.
*  It's a, it's a, he kicks so fast.
*  And then when he, like even sometimes when he like leg kick people and like, just even
*  switch kick people to the body and just hit their foot, land.
*  I'm like, yeah, that can't be that hurtful.
*  But when he lands only his foot, I'm like, God, this sucks.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It hurts.
*  It doesn't matter if it's shin or his foot.
*  He could fuck you up with just his foot.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's got the first wheel kick knockout ever in the UFC.
*  Yeah.
*  Against Terry Adam.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on.
*  Nobody going to forget that.
*  That was crazy.
*  That was the first ever.
*  First ever wheel kick knockout.
*  Yeah.
*  All those fights, imagine.
*  And in Brazil.
*  And then the statue after.
*  That was crazy.
*  The way he.
*  He's a beast, man.
*  It's just, it's interesting.
*  He's the most kick oriented fighter, I think, in the sport.
*  Because you don't see him beating guys down with his hands.
*  No, no.
*  He, all his, all his hands is touches.
*  Yeah.
*  Touch touch.
*  Range range.
*  Touch whack.
*  Range.
*  Touch whack.
*  Yeah.
*  And leg kicks.
*  And sometimes he chose like two leg kicks.
*  He chose so fast his kicks.
*  His kicks is like his jabs.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  But then they, it's like jabs, but they hurt like shirt racks.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he stopped Dan Hooker with a punch to the body, but that was because his body
*  was brutalized by his kicks.
*  That was the left body kick, right?
*  He wasn't.
*  He was switch kicking him.
*  He was switch kicking him.
*  He hit him with spinning back kicks to the body.
*  Then he make, then he make a Felder too, like P blood or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Felder said.
*  Him and Felder had two wars.
*  Two wars, yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  They were crazy.
*  He's, yeah, he's a really interesting guy.
*  It's so, so many different styles.
*  That's one of the cool things about the sport is that there's so many different ways to
*  do it.
*  Yeah, genetics, you know, especially like look at him, Mariah, Jose Aldo, look all Brazilians,
*  guys.
*  I'm going to switch stupid muscle.
*  Unfair.
*  Like why you guys so fast for?
*  What did you think?
*  Did you watch the Mariah's Aldo fight?
*  I was kind, I was warming up during it.
*  So I kind of got to see, kind of, I kind of didn't.
*  So I never really watched it.
*  Most people are pretty salty on the decision.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you feel?
*  I didn't like it.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought Aldo was pressuring him.
*  I thought he, look, he opened up with a switch kick to the head and had Aldo staggering a
*  little bit, but Aldo covered up and weathered the storm.
*  And then Aldo started putting the pressure on him and Aldo started hitting him with big
*  punches and really was controlling the center of the octagon and really pressuring him and
*  being very aggressive.
*  And then he got taken down the last couple of seconds of the first round, but nothing
*  happened.
*  He just took him down and hold him.
*  In my mind, that shouldn't mean much.
*  That don't mean nothing.
*  That doesn't mean anything.
*  I get mad about take down period in MMA because like, I don't understand how I can beat somebody
*  out for four minutes and 50 seconds and you take the last 10 seconds, you take me down
*  for the last 10 seconds and you win the round.
*  It's crazy.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  I think so you have to take me down and if you're not going to advance, you at least
*  got to ground and pound me for 30 seconds, 40 seconds to make that a legitimately take
*  down.
*  I agree.
*  There should be something happens when you go to the ground.
*  For 100%.
*  You got to brutalize the guy or threaten with a submission.
*  It's got to be something.
*  But with Marlon and Jose Aldo, if they gave that first round to Marlon, it's on the basis
*  of that high kick.
*  Some strikes landed, but I thought Aldo did more.
*  I thought Aldo did more in the second round and I thought Aldo won the fight.
*  I thought it was close, but I thought Aldo won the fight.
*  I think he was more aggressive.
*  Everybody's tripping on his weight cut and be like, oh you see how he looks.
*  I was like, he looked good.
*  Aldo just have high cheekbones and then he was leaving his facial hair for all five weeks.
*  So people's like, oh my God, he looks scary.
*  I'm like guys, this is how he looks.
*  This is his face.
*  He's bald too.
*  That doesn't help when you have bald hair.
*  People just think you look crazy already.
*  Well, that was the first fight that he ever had a nutritionist for his whole career.
*  That's what I heard.
*  That is crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  I told him, man, that's what I heard.
*  I heard his meals when he was at 45 was just whatever he wanted to eat.
*  He felt like eating whatever he wanted to eat.
*  He did it.
*  I'm like, yeah, that's why this dude is one of the greatest on time.
*  He's an animal.
*  Well, he ate whatever he wanted and then he just drained the shit out of himself.
*  But he had some times during his career where people didn't think he was going to be able
*  to make 45 anymore.
*  He's going to have to go up to 55.
*  So then to see him down at 35 was crazy.
*  But what I saw when I saw him when he was posing and getting ready, I saw muscles.
*  It wasn't like he was like drawn out.
*  You see some guys when they're just, they're making a bad weight cut and they just look
*  like shit.
*  They just look ripped.
*  No, he looked good.
*  He looked real good.
*  Even when I, because I saw him, what did I see him?
*  Ultimate media day or whatever, early in the week.
*  I even worked out, me and him had the same workout room for one of the nights and we
*  worked out together.
*  And when I shook them, I shake hands, you put it in a hug.
*  First thing I go back to my class, like, guy hard as a rock.
*  He's going to make weight.
*  When you got hard and you have muscle, it's much easy to cut water.
*  When you touch someone they soft is like, yeah, my man, I don't know how you going
*  to do this weight cut.
*  But good, you know, may peace be with you.
*  People don't think that right.
*  I mean, we had a, it's, it's, it's a, we had a conversation about that with the fuck
*  is his name.
*  That it wasn't Dolce.
*  It was the other guy.
*  I'll remember his name in a minute.
*  Lockhart.
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  George Lockhart.
*  Sorry, George.
*  It's the weed.
*  Lockhart was saying that big muscular guys, it's easier.
*  It's easier to, you can suck, you can suck water out of someone who's muscular because
*  his muscle muscles going to let go, let go to water.
*  But if you got fat, fat is going to hold onto everything.
*  That's why you fat.
*  Yeah, you're holding on to whatever goes by that.
*  Holy shit.
*  What is this?
*  Let's just hold onto it.
*  Muscle is like, once something bad, like muscles won't even hold on, hold on to something
*  bad.
*  If you eat sugar and you're so muscular, you feel sick.
*  It's funny how different guys look on the scale versus the next day.
*  Like Lombard was a good example.
*  Like when he would make 170, he will, he looked so much smaller on the scale and the next
*  day he'd be like, fuck, is this the same guy?
*  Muscle.
*  Yeah.
*  And then muscle wants water.
*  So when you put water into that day, that bad boy, my gosh, you look like a balloon.
*  Yeah.
*  Carb up, swells up.
*  Yeah.
*  You know Lombard's fighting bare knuckle boxing now?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know who he fighting.
*  I don't.
*  I think he's fighting Joe Riggs.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  I think he's fighting Joe Riggs and a bare knuckle.
*  Bare knuckle boxing is weird.
*  It's gangster.
*  It is gangster, but it's weird how popular it's become.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  And it's nuts to me.
*  Like, I think MMA fighters is going to, they do much, we do much more and better than professional
*  boxers inside of it.
*  Because professional boxers, they, like, MMA fighters, we're so used to the small four
*  ounce gloves that like the certain slips we know don't work already.
*  Like when you watch and you see a professional X-boxer go to that bare knuckle thing and
*  they try to do their, they try to do like their shoulder rolls and stuff.
*  Don't work because no more glove, you know, like the glove, the little half inch of the
*  glove would like bounce off and work.
*  Yeah.
*  But now it's just coming straight to you and, oh man, you just see people's, people's eyes
*  is gold, you know?
*  It's crazy.
*  There's certain techniques like Floyd Mayweather would employ that just would never work with
*  little gloves.
*  No, no.
*  It would never work.
*  And you can kind of fight in the clinch too, right?
*  With bare knuckles, so yeah.
*  Yeah, you can clinch.
*  You can clinch.
*  You can clinch and punch from inside the clinch.
*  You know, other things, kickboxers, the same deal.
*  You know, you watch a lot of the top level kickboxers, they're fighting like this all
*  the time.
*  They're like completely covering up.
*  Yeah.
*  Because we can, you can, even when you go around, like, you might not get the full glove,
*  you know what I mean?
*  That extra pad is not there anymore.
*  So you think you're going to block it, it's just coming right through.
*  Yep, yep, yep.
*  It's interesting.
*  What would you think if MMA had no gloves?
*  Would you like that?
*  Ah man, I got, I got little small tiny hands, so I don't know.
*  I think it'd probably screw up my knuckles.
*  I hurt my tons almost every fight.
*  So I don't know.
*  You've heard this fight?
*  Before the fight, every fight is just a nagging injury, you know?
*  So we always take care of it, this and that, but...
*  Do you have to tape it any differently?
*  Not really, but I love taping my, I love taping my thumb like a boxer.
*  Like, that's the best feeling when you just got something holding.
*  Because like, when you do, when we do train, we're in boxing gloves anyway.
*  So you always feel something there anyway.
*  So when we go to the fight night, it's just kind of weird if I don't tape my thumb.
*  Like, if I don't, I tried not to tape it one time, I was like, yeah, no, I got to tape it.
*  Do most guys tape their thumbs or no?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's just preference.
*  Personal preference.
*  Did you watch Kobe Usman fight?
*  Yeah, I watched a little bit of it, a little bit, not the whole thing.
*  Oh, what'd you think?
*  I thought it was crazy.
*  Crazy fight, right?
*  I thought it was crazy.
*  That was a wild fight.
*  I like what you said, you know, even though like...
*  Even though Kobe talked like that, most guys that talk like that, act like him, can't fight,
*  he can't fight.
*  He can fight, he tricks you.
*  He does.
*  He tricks you into thinking he sucks.
*  He's wearing a cheap suit, he's carrying around Donald Trump Jr.'s book, he's wearing a MAGA
*  hat.
*  His suit cost $3.
*  He's on the same page.
*  He's not reading.
*  He's not reading that fucking book.
*  I mean, he's...
*  Look, I give up, I give it up to that guy for a lot of reasons.
*  First of all, he was... his back was against the wall.
*  The UFC was telling him they're gonna cut him after this fight with Damian Maia, they
*  don't like his style, they think he's boring.
*  They literally told that to him.
*  So he goes in the ring after the fight, calls Brazilians a bunch of filthy animals, says
*  a bunch of crazy shit, and the next thing you know, he's got this fucking character.
*  Oh yeah, for Joe Rogan.
*  We were making fun of his suit.
*  And next thing you know, he's one of the most popular guys in the fucking sport, from talking
*  shit.
*  And that was only three fights ago, man.
*  It was a massive adjustment.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Smart.
*  Yeah, it is, you know.
*  And at the end of the day, you know, if people ask me, oh, how do you feel that he came out
*  and said that it was like a stick, you know, it was like a show or whatever it is, I just
*  told people, like, it's him.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Not me.
*  Why am I bothered?
*  Why are you guys getting bothered by it?
*  Like, let him do it.
*  Let the guy water his own, like, he's digging his own grave.
*  Let him go dig it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He got to live in it now, you know?
*  Like, now he got to live in it.
*  Like, I think that the fighter plan, they asked, oh, well, dude, why did you laugh when
*  you found out that he outed himself?
*  I was like, because it's a storyline.
*  You don't see these WWE guys going around and be like, yeah, this is just fake.
*  No, they keep their storyline until they go out and then they change it.
*  Well, we kind of outed it first.
*  We outed it first.
*  Me and Brendan Chob outed it first.
*  Yeah, but then you lied to you.
*  Lied to you died, brother.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I would text you and be like, behind the scenes, like, Joe Rogan, guess what?
*  I hate you.
*  And that's it.
*  That's all I was leaving at.
*  That's it.
*  And then when it comes back, I'm like, I don't know about Joe Rogan.
*  Joe Rogan is a liar.
*  I was starting to make a lot of jokes.
*  Joe Rogan don't even smoke weed.
*  That's fake.
*  He's smoking just regular grass, guys.
*  You heard it here first on JRU from Max Holley.
*  He's just smoking regular grass, guys.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Look, man, we haven't had a guy that put on a character like that before.
*  He's the first.
*  Yeah.
*  Really.
*  Yeah, he is.
*  Chael Sonnen a little bit.
*  Chael Sonnen a little bit.
*  You know, he kind of put on a little bit of an act like that, but Colby took it to a
*  whole new level.
*  I mean, the suits and he's adjusted it over the years.
*  Because if you go back and look at the beginning of it, he used to wear nice suits.
*  He was wearing like a sweet, a very nice tailored suit, like really expensive.
*  Now he's wearing the cheapest shit that he could buy, like blue and orange.
*  He's wearing, he's on purpose.
*  You know he's doing it on purpose.
*  He's wearing cheap suits.
*  It's fucking hilarious, man.
*  It's hilarious.
*  It's terrible.
*  And it was a good goddamn fight.
*  It was a good fight.
*  It was a real close fight.
*  Got 50K.
*  It was three and three on three judges scorecards or on two judges scorecards.
*  They had it three and one.
*  So three rounds to Usman on one judges score, three rounds to Colby on another judges scorecard.
*  Yeah, it was that goddamn close.
*  And two and two with the last judge.
*  This is another example.
*  That would have been crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  But this is another example why we should have more judges.
*  We should have more than three judges.
*  How much judges do the Olympic do?
*  Olympic do the boxing?
*  I don't know.
*  I think they have eight.
*  That would be perfect.
*  And then they take the top, they take whatever scores match, like the top five.
*  Then they bounce it.
*  That makes sense.
*  That makes sense.
*  Eight's a good number.
*  Nine would be a good number because nine would be like a tiebreaker.
*  You know, like if you had five one or four one way, four another way.
*  I feel like three's ridiculous.
*  Like why do you only have three?
*  You know the judges suck already.
*  So why do you only have three people that suck?
*  If anybody can change the sport, you can.
*  I've tried, man.
*  I've tried to eliminate weight cutting.
*  I've tried to, I've talked to these guys.
*  I've talked to Ari.
*  I've talked to Lorenzo.
*  I said, let's get rid of weight cutting.
*  Get rid of it.
*  Do what one FC is doing.
*  Use hydration tests.
*  Make everybody fight their natural weight.
*  Open up weight classes.
*  Make a bunch more.
*  Having two weight classes between 185 and 205 is fucking bananas.
*  You got a 20 pound jump.
*  Yeah, we could.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  We need to open weight.
*  Yeah.
*  And then even like one of the most weight things that I hate is like, I don't understand
*  why the champion and the challenger of the champion need to make 45 and then everybody
*  else get the pound allowance.
*  I'm like, that's backwards.
*  The champion and the challenger should have the pound allowance and everybody else need
*  to make the weight.
*  Right, right.
*  Right?
*  Am I not right?
*  Or you just be like, and if you want to give the champion more love, you just be like,
*  look, champion needs to come in at 46 and the challenger come at 45.
*  That's just how it should be.
*  If you're going to cut all that weight, we know you're going to fight for five rounds.
*  Give them an extra pound.
*  Yeah.
*  But I feel like hydration tests are the way.
*  Hydration tests are cool.
*  I think it's cool.
*  I know a couple of guys that are in the 1FC and stuff and they do that way.
*  I think that's super dope.
*  I bet you could feel better.
*  I bet you would feel better.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And you just walk around and fight.
*  But it's crazy because if we do do that, you know, people are just going to try and find
*  a way to finesse it anyway.
*  I wonder what they do in 1FC to prevent that.
*  I mean, apparently they haven't had an issue with that.
*  They test people.
*  They make sure that you're not dehydrated.
*  Yeah.
*  So I don't know.
*  I have no idea.
*  They find them what you weigh.
*  They find what you weigh in camp.
*  That's what they should do.
*  Just show up like one day.
*  Hey Max, what's up?
*  Hey, get on the scale, bro.
*  You're like, oh, just saying cake.
*  I mean, I just said ice cream.
*  I ain't Max.
*  I'm his brother.
*  What are you talking about?
*  He's like, oh my thing.
*  What's the heaviest you've ever gotten?
*  The heaviest I ever gotten?
*  I don't know.
*  We in Hollywood.
*  I can't be telling you my weight right now.
*  We're not in Hollywood.
*  This is Hollywood.
*  No, this is Chatsworth.
*  We're pretty damn close.
*  Where's the valley, bro?
*  We're pretty close.
*  If you had to guess.
*  If I had to guess.
*  80?
*  180?
*  Probably 180.
*  Yeah.
*  80, 85 probably.
*  85, 90.
*  That means 90.
*  That means it might mean 200 pounds.
*  Maybe 210.
*  Who knows?
*  You guys really think I over here?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  You really think I over here putting on an act, calling out DC?
*  DC, you are eating everything I want to eat.
*  You know who the real money fight is, DC?
*  It's me.
*  I'll fight your ass and then eat you and then battle you to an all you can eat buffet.
*  You let me know.
*  That is man on the planet right here.
*  The dad is man on the planet.
*  That is hilarious.
*  That is hilarious.
*  There's never been a batter motherfucker on the planet with a body like DC.
*  Never.
*  Never ever.
*  Because usually those guys are journeymen.
*  Usually there's a lot of good fighters that are built like that, but they never really
*  get to be world class world championship.
*  And that did what he did and continued to do what he's doing.
*  When he fought Stipe, he had a big old belly.
*  He still cracked in the first round.
*  I tease him all the time.
*  DC, you can't be using the tights bro.
*  You gotta bring your shorts up.
*  Come on.
*  Use some board shorts.
*  You can't be using these tights.
*  I love that guy.
*  I love that guy too.
*  What do you think is going to happen with them?
*  I wonder if Stipe is going to be...
*  Stipe apparently is injured and he's having a hard time recovering.
*  They're trying to do a rematch, but he's got an injury.
*  Even if it's not a rematch, are they going to move on from Stipe or no?
*  Listen, everybody's scared of Francis.
*  Nobody wants a piece of that dude.
*  They're like, fuck that.
*  Fuck that noise.
*  Yeah.
*  DC told me.
*  Yeah.
*  They offered him Francis like, fuck that.
*  I don't want nothing to do with Francis and Gano.
*  No thank you, sir.
*  He was like, I'm here for Stipe and that's it.
*  He goes, I'm in the end of this.
*  I got like one or two fights left in me.
*  They gotta make sense.
*  And he's not interested in that.
*  If I was in his corner, I'd be like, thank God you're thinking this way.
*  Fuck that.
*  That guy's too scary.
*  He scares the fuck out of me.
*  He's fast.
*  He's fast as fuck.
*  He's super fast for how big he is.
*  Super fast as fuck.
*  He nukes dudes.
*  When he hit Alistair with that left hook.
*  That was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That was in Detroit.
*  I remember that when I was watching that.
*  You see how his head wiggles in the air before he even hits the ground?
*  My gosh.
*  How many times has Alistair been knocked out?
*  I think a lot.
*  A lot.
*  It's been a lot.
*  But it doesn't help that you come from the K-1 background.
*  You just get punched so much.
*  K-1 and pride.
*  He was always at 185.
*  He was always 185, 205 and heavyweight.
*  Come on.
*  He had a real hard time making 205.
*  Back when he fought Chuck Liddell, he was real skinny.
*  He was smaller.
*  Once you get past 185 and up, everybody can knock out everybody there.
*  Once you get knocked out, your brain is going to keep saving you early and earlier.
*  Once you get hit, your brain is going to shut off because it's trying to save itself.
*  There's nothing you can do.
*  That is crazy.
*  There's no fix for that.
*  No fix at all.
*  Because your brain is just trying to protect yourself.
*  I know people who get choked out to sleep.
*  Now you can choke them out easier because the brain is just like, no, yeah.
*  I've never seen that with chokes.
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah.
*  I know a couple of people.
*  Wow.
*  Damn.
*  That's not good.
*  I used to think chokes were a free ride.
*  I used to think, no big deal.
*  You just got choked out.
*  But now they're saying, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Chokes give you brain damage.
*  For sure.
*  You're forcing your body to do something that it doesn't want to do.
*  You're shutting your brain off.
*  It's telling yourself, look, I'm going to turn everything off before you die.
*  And this is it.
*  Because if you keep holding it when you're knocked out, you're going to kill someone.
*  Yeah, you're going to kill someone.
*  Your body will just be like, OK, look, I'm turning it off now.
*  So let's just hope you recover.
*  But they're finding CTE in jujitsu players.
*  They're finding it in high-level jujitsu guys.
*  I don't think that it's from choke exactly.
*  I hit my head all the time.
*  I hit my head when I'm grappling and stuff.
*  Justin Muses is getting punched sometimes.
*  Sometimes I don't even get punched in the head when we're moving and stuff.
*  When you're doing jujitsu and stuff, someone tries to take you back or snap you down or
*  you're rolling or collide heads.
*  Yeah, collide heads or you stay on the top in their bunking.
*  You got a wild child under you and you hit your head.
*  Or you get their back and they kick you.
*  Some people are wild.
*  When they do something, I'm like, when I got a wild child, I was like, boom, OK, this is
*  how it's going to end.
*  And then we do it.
*  I'm like, look, after you tap him on, you gotta relax, guy.
*  Take it easy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's not like...
*  That's all they have though.
*  If you look at it, this is a cool thing about my team.
*  My coach, he will never ever let me do a jujitsu tournament.
*  I keep begging him, I want to do a jujitsu tournament.
*  He's like, no.
*  He's like, I'll let you go do a boxing match but do a jujitsu tournament.
*  I was like, why?
*  He's like, because you see all these top MMA fighters, they go to the knees, the gi, the
*  jujitsu, whatever the tournament is, they tear their ACL, they tear their shoulder.
*  Cubs-Swanson this weekend.
*  They get choked out, they hit their head, they get cut.
*  Luke cut his eye in a fight.
*  A wrestling match.
*  Yeah, in a grappling match.
*  Like, how?
*  You know, like, does this freak stuff happen when you're grappling?
*  Well, Cub blew his knee out just this weekend.
*  Yeah, I heard, yeah.
*  I mean, he's on a real high note right now.
*  Just beat Krohn, great race.
*  And he's also 36 with a family, you know?
*  So it's like, this guy can't afford to take a fucking year off.
*  That's why he wanted to do it.
*  Locked up in a leg lock with Jake Shields, who's at least 30 pounds bigger than him.
*  Jake is a big fella.
*  And you know, they're doing that quintet thing where different weights will compete against
*  different guys.
*  Shout out to Sean O'Malley.
*  I saw him putting on for the UFC team.
*  To see Krause, James Krause, caught King Mo in a standing guillotine.
*  No!
*  Dude, Krause is really underrated, man.
*  Really underrated.
*  Yeah, Krause is a beast.
*  I like Krause.
*  I like him a lot.
*  Very, very smart guy.
*  Really nice guy, too.
*  Yeah, real nice guy.
*  I like him.
*  I was like, I thought he was fighting, but no, he's just doing the grappling.
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah, so Jake Shields tapped out Mark Munoz, and then he got him in an arm triangle, and
*  then a head and arm choke.
*  And then he was in the middle of the scramble with Cub, and he had Cub's leg laced up, like
*  with a heel hook position, but not, didn't apply heel hook.
*  They were just in the middle of the transition moving, and Cub just like, aah!
*  And he just rolls over on his back.
*  You know better than everybody that once you get there and you go the wrong way, your leg
*  stays there.
*  Yeah, that's Krause tapping King Mo with a standing guillotine.
*  This guy is a beast.
*  Yeah, grappling is not a safe bet.
*  I can't believe that these guys who are fighting in the UFC for a career would be willing to
*  risk that, because you really can get fucked up, man.
*  You really can get really badly hurt.
*  Like jam your finger.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know how many times I hurt my, doing, with my role with Jiu Jitsu and my role with
*  kickboxing, I have way more injuries than doing straight Jiu Jitsu and kickboxing training.
*  Really?
*  100%.
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  100%.
*  Well, I feel like it's easier to go light when you kickboxing.
*  Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, because you can control it, you know?
*  And nobody wants to get knocked out.
*  Like in Jiu Jitsu and stuff, it's like, oh, you can probably put someone to sleep or break
*  their arm, but like, you got to be pretty good with your partner.
*  Like some guys, like, you know, certain guys like, yeah, when they get, if they get this
*  arm, they're going to fucking take it home.
*  I'm not going to give it to you.
*  Oh, there's always guys like that that I would hate rolling with.
*  Some guys just fucking, they go so hard and they hurt people.
*  Some guys are hurting, they hurt people.
*  Some guys are always hurting.
*  You always hear, ah, you look over, oh, it's Mike, motherfucker, getting people in arm
*  bars.
*  Yeah, it's a, you know, combat sports are, it's so hard.
*  It's so hard to train correctly.
*  You know, like if everything was great, you would, you would have full control.
*  Your opponent would have full control.
*  You guys would spar correctly.
*  You'd have great training, but it's so hard to find a good training.
*  And it's an eagle.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the kind of, I love my, that's the kind of, I love, uh, love my teammates when
*  I'm getting ready for fights.
*  Whenever we got to mimic guys, like even though like sometimes it's horrible.
*  Sometimes like some guys like you got to train a certain way and spar me and give me this
*  certain look and they're getting it and they know if they just go back to their normal
*  style, they give me more competitive sparring.
*  Right.
*  They still do it.
*  I'm like, and I tell them after every practice, I'm like, guy, thank you.
*  Don't worry.
*  When it's your fight, I'm going to take my husband for two.
*  So I'm going to pay you back, my friend.
*  What's like the weirdest style you ever had to prepare for?
*  What fighter do you think was like the more, most difficult to prepare for in terms of
*  getting ready for their style?
*  I think so it was, uh, um, what is his name?
*  Um, Will Chope, the one that I started the win streak on.
*  Yeah.
*  He was so tall.
*  It was like 6'4".
*  Like who did he get ready for?
*  Like everybody I know that was 6'4 or something is like already 200 pounds.
*  Right.
*  190 pounds, 200 pounds, you know, these guys like stuff.
*  So like 6'4", 145 is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was crazy.
*  And then like, I remember like going in there and I was like trying to hit him and he's
*  just like jabbing me.
*  I'm like, what is going on?
*  Like how is this guy so tall right now?
*  Like what is he doing?
*  Like how is he hitting me from this far?
*  You know, and uh, yeah, that probably was the weirdest one I think.
*  Well it's, it's, it's interesting.
*  You see long tall guys and the use of distance.
*  If someone's really good and they're long and tall, that is such a giant advantage.
*  Like John Jones is the best at it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He's the best at it.
*  Super, super smart.
*  He's so good at using that length though.
*  Oh yeah, he knows how to.
*  He keeps everybody out there.
*  Yeah.
*  And then boom, when he wants he hits you.
*  Boom, boom, boom.
*  And then he does the, he does the Jiu-Jitsu way.
*  He's either all the way in or all the way out.
*  Yup, yup.
*  He's either on you or he's off of you.
*  He's never ever put himself in like stupid positions where you might get a shot on him.
*  I'm really interested to see what Dominic Reyes can do with him.
*  Very interested to see.
*  He's got to rise to the occasion because you know, he had some rough moments with OSP,
*  you know, who also had a real good fight with John Jones.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't, you know, OSP's a beast.
*  Big strong guy.
*  Very powerful.
*  Genetics.
*  Yeah, and very powerful.
*  He has excellent striking power, especially with his left leg and his left hand.
*  He fucks people up with, you know, he's got a nasty power left kick, man.
*  But you know, he struggled with OSP a little bit, particularly in like the middle of the
*  fight.
*  OSP hit him with a good shot and then he knocked OSP out.
*  He should have got credited for a knockout in that fight because Dominic knocked him
*  out like with like two seconds to go and he walked off.
*  I mean, the referee didn't stop the fight and he's like, no, you got to get up.
*  You got to get up.
*  He's like, wait, he's out, man.
*  And then the buzzer rang and then they just called it a decision.
*  They gave it to him by decision.
*  But the fight should have been stopped.
*  I mean, it was a knockout.
*  That's crazy.
*  He knocked him out.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  Well, it's just one of those things.
*  It's like, you know, the referee's call was just.
*  Yeah, and we see what happens, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  We all know John Jones is different, you know.
*  Yeah, he's a different animal.
*  Yeah, just different.
*  He's the even though when you see him and you see him looking kind of normal and stuff,
*  he just always finds a way.
*  Yeah, he just finds a way.
*  That looking normal is a trick.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when he takes pictures of himself looking skinny fat.
*  Don't let that shit fool you.
*  That's John Jones.
*  Even skinny fat will fuck you up.
*  He's so strong, too.
*  I bet.
*  You know, and that you want to talk to genetics.
*  His whole family is super athletes.
*  All of his brothers are super athletes.
*  All of them.
*  Imagine that.
*  One guy is the greatest light heavyweight champion of all time, the youngest ever to
*  win a world title in the UFC.
*  The other two brothers are NFL superstars.
*  What the fuck is in the water at the Jones house?
*  I don't know.
*  That's some serious fucking genetics over there.
*  And also, I think like when you grow up with two bad motherfuckers as brothers.
*  You know, you're beating the shit out of each other all the time.
*  Especially when you're youngest.
*  Yeah, you're the youngest.
*  You know he was getting it.
*  Yeah, they're all beating the fuck out of each other all the time.
*  Yeah, you guys will do this shit.
*  I'm gonna get you guys back.
*  Yeah.
*  And they talk shit about each other.
*  And then when they do it and then when they come, if I was John, I'll just tell them to
*  tackle me.
*  That shit ain't gonna work.
*  Well, his brother's training MMA too.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  They train in between.
*  Well, his brother Arthur is fucking gigantic.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  That dude's so big.
*  Yeah.
*  Chandler is huge, too.
*  Chandler is huge, too.
*  Chandler's talking shit about John.
*  It's like if I fought in MMA, I'd fuck him up.
*  And they're like, oh shit.
*  They talk shit to each other like that.
*  Yeah, they're brothers.
*  They're supposed to.
*  That's what they're supposed to do.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But then when they go home, I bet you John will be like, yeah, okay Chandler.
*  But I'm that contract.
*  I see how much you're making.
*  I'll fight your ass right here.
*  Let's go to JRE to get a fight.
*  It really is a crazy successful athletic family.
*  I don't know of any other family that has NFL superstars and a world champion combat
*  sports athlete.
*  And I can't think of another family like that.
*  No.
*  That's great.
*  Life's not fair when it comes to things like that.
*  When it comes to genetics, life is not fair.
*  You just got to work with it.
*  You got to work with what you got.
*  When you had that situation happen where they were running a bunch of tests on you, they
*  couldn't figure out what was wrong with you, what do you think was going on?
*  You know, what was funny was that July fight when we was getting ready.
*  It was in Vegas, right?
*  I had to fly to New York to do my media day.
*  From Hawaii to New York.
*  12 hours.
*  We did a 12 hour media.
*  Then we went to Vegas.
*  I think I got to Vegas on Thursday.
*  Then I just felt out of it.
*  You were cutting weight at the time, too?
*  Not really cutting weight.
*  It was dieting and stuff.
*  Even the water thing.
*  I drink the Lotto water fight week.
*  Even before the fight.
*  We drink the Lotto water.
*  At the end of the day, a couple of days passed and it just wasn't going away.
*  How did you feel?
*  I can tell you exactly what it was.
*  It was something we consumed.
*  Right now, not that much people know that I left my old management.
*  I'm with new management now.
*  My manager now, he's like a behavioral science guy.
*  He's probably watching this stream and I'm squirming when I'm talking about it.
*  We got stuff going on.
*  We got a bunch of...
*  I'm looking to work with lawyers and stuff and we plan on suing somebody.
*  There's a bunch of stuff that I really can't talk about.
*  That's why he's squirming back there.
*  I probably shouldn't be talking about it too much.
*  It was something I consumed.
*  Like a supplement?
*  I don't even know if I can tell you.
*  It'll come out on the wash.
*  For sure.
*  I will.
*  When is this all supposed to be settled out?
*  We'll see.
*  I just left that to him.
*  One of the great things that I love with the team is that
*  for me, I'm all about keeping the main thing the main thing.
*  The main thing for me is fighting and making sure
*  whoever's in front of me, whatever cupcake it is,
*  I can enjoy that cupcake while they go do everything else for me.
*  You don't have to think about anything else.
*  Nothing else.
*  That's beautiful.
*  That's the way to do it.
*  If you can have a good team,
*  people that train themselves,
*  I'm like, you can't do that.
*  I talk to them, I talk to my team.
*  I love the chaos.
*  I love chaos around me a little bit.
*  But then they make it so simple.
*  It's great, but I kind of like to put myself like,
*  I like when things ain't in order.
*  When you come to my house,
*  I love that my room is messy.
*  People might trip up,
*  like, your messy room.
*  I'm like, yeah, but
*  I have somebody come clean it later on.
*  But I just love the chaos.
*  You like being messy?
*  You got to be a little bit messy.
*  Just to keep me sane.
*  If I'm too clean, I'm like,
*  things are going too well.
*  Things are going too good.
*  It's like a fight week thing.
*  If something doesn't go wrong in fight week,
*  I'm like, nope.
*  This shit ain't happening to me.
*  I'm going to screw something up right now
*  just so we got it.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, you can.
*  Do you like things going perfect?
*  Don't it feel weird when everything goes perfect?
*  I guess I'm just different.
*  That is a different way of looking at things.
*  I like a little bit of chaos.
*  Exactly.
*  I feel like I'm a very, very, very fortunate person.
*  I like to know that things are crazy and random
*  so I can appreciate my fortune.
*  Yeah.
*  100%. Exactly.
*  That I'm lucky.
*  I love that life is so unpredictable and strange.
*  Life is like MMA.
*  MMA is unpredictable.
*  That's why I love it.
*  That's why it's so comparable.
*  That's why a lot of people can kind of compare.
*  They kind of get it, but they don't.
*  Fighting is in their DNA.
*  Once they're like,
*  I can't watch this fight, this and that.
*  I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about
*  because this is like a combat.
*  We're licensed.
*  It's not the gladiator day where people are cutting a child's head off.
*  No, take his life.
*  No, it's not.
*  It's a sport.
*  Yeah, we're past these days.
*  At the end of the day,
*  a bunch of my fans are old people,
*  even moms.
*  Moms always shit about it.
*  They come to the gym, they see me work out.
*  They actually talk to me.
*  They're like, oh wow, I didn't think so.
*  You like this or whatever.
*  I thought you were like this guy, this asshole.
*  Because I was a fighter.
*  I was like, no, we're human beings.
*  What are you talking about?
*  I'm just like you.
*  People think of cage fighters.
*  They think of the most aggressive,
*  the meanest, nastiest people in the world.
*  They're the nicest people.
*  Cowboy Serrani is one of the nicest people I know.
*  He hugs everybody.
*  He's a sweetheart.
*  He's fucking nice to everybody.
*  He's one of the baddest motherfuckers ever.
*  And Gano's a really nice guy.
*  He's super cool.
*  Big, giant, scary motherfucker.
*  Super nice.
*  Cain Velasquez, real nice guy.
*  If you saw him and Gano in a dark alley,
*  they'd come to you.
*  They'd come to you.
*  Hey, what you doing?
*  You wouldn't think they're not going to help you.
*  But they'd be like, hey, what's up?
*  Fighters don't have anything to prove.
*  Most men that run around in society,
*  especially men that don't train or know how to fight,
*  they feel like they have a lot to prove.
*  They're always puffing their chest out and talking loud.
*  There's a lot of that with men.
*  Particularly with men who don't know how to fight.
*  But fighters,
*  if you're a UFC fighter,
*  you've proved it.
*  You don't need to impress people.
*  And also, you're fucking tired from
*  training all the time too.
*  Oh yeah, 100%.
*  I know exactly what you mean.
*  Everybody who always tells me,
*  all my friends,
*  whenever they bring new guys around or new friends
*  hanging out, they're asking me
*  about fighting and this and that.
*  They're so cool. They're like, oh, what about this?
*  I'm like,
*  guy, what do you do for work? It's like construction.
*  I'm like, well, how's your job site going
*  right now? How's the fork?
*  How's the concrete prices
*  going up? I don't know.
*  They're like, I don't want to talk about that.
*  Exactly. I don't want to talk about
*  fighting, guy. Please. Please don't talk
*  about fighting to me.
*  I know, but you've got to understand that someone's a fan of yours.
*  They're running to you like, it's Max Hallway.
*  Oh shit, Max.
*  They just laugh and they find out,
*  look, we actually have a lot more in common than fighting.
*  Let's go race
*  some cars or something.
*  Yeah. What do you do
*  when you're not in camp?
*  Now that the fight's over, you get a chance to
*  unwind for a while.
*  What's a typical Max Hallway day like?
*  I just lounge around,
*  wait for MiniBless.
*  If he's playing sports, take him to sports.
*  He's been liking K1 Speed lately,
*  so we've been going racing.
*  We just got a roller rink in Hawaii.
*  Oh really? Yeah, like a roller rink.
*  Not the ice skating. We had ice skating for
*  every day. We got a roller rink.
*  Yeah, in there.
*  It's in Pro City in Oahu.
*  Now we got a roller rink.
*  Me and Mini and a bunch of my friends,
*  we'd be going every day. We'd try to get our
*  roll-bounce on and just turn it around.
*  And things to this stuff.
*  In camp, I really can't do it because I don't want to
*  fall down and break my butt or something or
*  finger. So now we can
*  play around more. Just do
*  fun stuff. Just stuff that like,
*  I don't have to go to the gym too much.
*  I don't feel bad too if I do
*  miss the gym. My coaches kind of know.
*  They kind of let me off for like one or two weeks
*  or so and then we just hang out.
*  Nice to just unwind
*  and relax. Oh yeah, go to the beach, just chill.
*  And just being able to just go to
*  the nearest 7-Eleven and just get on a slurpee
*  and drink whatever I want. Drink whatever you want,
*  right? Yeah. And then
*  a couple weeks after the fight, then you start batting down
*  the hatches again. Oh yeah, getting right
*  back into it, training.
*  And then you start talking to your manager
*  like, what's next? Yeah, exactly.
*  I call him, I let him know.
*  I tell him we plan and kind of
*  have an idea. We kind of have an idea now
*  because ever since we heard
*  Dana talking about it, but he didn't hit us up yet.
*  What did Dana say? He said at the press conference
*  that he wanted
*  me and Alex
*  in, what is that called? In
*  Australia. I just don't know when. Beautiful.
*  Yeah, beautiful. Down under, I never
*  went, so that'd be cool. Yeah, Australia
*  is great. I love it there. I've never been
*  to New Zealand. I want to go to New Zealand, but fuck
*  Australia. I love Australia. People are so cool.
*  It's great.
*  You know, it's relaxed, man. There's only
*  20 million people and it's a place
*  the size of the entire United States.
*  For real? Yeah. I didn't know that.
*  There's less people in the whole of Australia
*  than in LA.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy. That is crazy. Yeah. California
*  as a whole has way more people than Australia.
*  That's crazy. Way more.
*  But LA has more people
*  than Australia. And if
*  you have a census, those fucking people that have a census
*  oh, the census says there's only 20 million people.
*  Bitch, you're not counting Mexicans.
*  You are not counting Mexicans. You're never
*  going to count them. They come over here,
*  they're sneaking around, they're doing whatever they want to do.
*  I'm happy they're here,
*  but you don't know how many there are.
*  I'm happy they're here. Stop. I'm happy they're here.
*  You know where we're going after this.
*  Dollar Tocos, baby.
*  Dude, there's a great place over here. I'll show you a place.
*  Yeah, tell us. There's this
*  burrito spot, legit as fuck.
*  There's all those Mexican soap operas playing.
*  Nobody speaks English.
*  Fucking Mexican food. Totally, you know what sounds good right now.
*  Off the charts. So good.
*  Look, I'm a giant fan.
*  Mexican food is probably my favorite food.
*  But my point is, they don't know how many are here.
*  There could be another 10 million.
*  There might be 30 million people here.
*  They have no idea. Either way, it's more than the whole of Australia.
*  Definitely.
*  That's heavy.
*  But that's why Australia's so cool.
*  They're not all stressed out.
*  There's too many people together in one spot.
*  I was driving here today and some dude cut me off.
*  Just like...
*  Oh, when we were driving here,
*  someone just like...
*  The hair just...cut us off.
*  I was like, whoa, welcome to LA, baby.
*  They're tense.
*  They did a study once
*  where they set cameras up on one side of the street
*  and then on another side of the street.
*  And they measured
*  the distance between
*  the two cameras.
*  They measured how fast people were walking
*  from one camera to the next.
*  And through the speed of their walking,
*  they could determine
*  accurately how many people live in the city.
*  So it's a direct response
*  to too many people.
*  People start moving faster and more aggressive
*  and more tense.
*  And they walk faster.
*  You could literally set a camera up
*  on a block.
*  And within a couple of hours, they could tell you how many people live in that city
*  just by how fast they walk.
*  That's crazy. Technology is nuts.
*  Also how fast they talk.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  Technology is insane.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  Do you need to blow your nose?
*  Nah, after.
*  Oh, okay. What happened?
*  You saw me.
*  Smart.
*  Yeah, no, technology is amazing.
*  You live in Oahu?
*  There's a lot of people in Honolulu, right?
*  That's like a million people, right?
*  I live in Waianae.
*  So if you put
*  that camera you're talking about in Waianae,
*  people are less stressful.
*  We would just be chilling.
*  People would be walking slowly.
*  They'd be like, oh my gosh, people are living it over here.
*  They're loving it.
*  That video of you that they play
*  where you were a really young kid,
*  where you were just getting into fighting.
*  I was 15 years old.
*  I was 11th grade.
*  We shot that when I was 11th grade.
*  That's when MySpace was popping.
*  Did you have a MySpace?
*  I had a MySpace.
*  Who was in your top 8?
*  My old trainer at the time.
*  The guy who
*  my boy who got me into fighting,
*  Josh Keanu.
*  One of my friends, Birdie Bird.
*  This guy named Shaisin Lopola.
*  My older brother, my younger brother.
*  One of my cousins.
*  And then another cousin.
*  I remember my whole top 8.
*  Top 16 and 24.
*  People were getting mad.
*  Who was 1?
*  Who was 2?
*  I made the 16th one.
*  You should just be happy you're on there.
*  People get mad.
*  Everybody wanted to be number 1.
*  What's funny
*  about that video,
*  in the countdown,
*  they showed me saying,
*  if you're a loser,
*  if you try, at least you win your book.
*  That loser quote.
*  That quote was on people's bios.
*  The bio, you could put a quote
*  or whatever, a status.
*  I was like, yeah, your boy made it.
*  They did it for
*  that was a national,
*  it won nationally.
*  It was for the STN awards.
*  When the schools come up and they do stuff.
*  It's here in California,
*  whenever they do.
*  I was supposed to go.
*  That was my 11th grade year.
*  Get it, but
*  it was just cool.
*  It's got to be weird looking at yourself
*  when you're 15, talking
*  about, you know.
*  Oh yeah, sup brudda.
*  It's terrible.
*  My accent was like,
*  I still have an accent, but
*  I still talk moat a lot, but like
*  now that I try to...
*  You said what? What did you say?
*  Moat.
*  Moat is like, or pigeon.
*  Actually, I can talk two languages.
*  Pigeon is actually a language now.
*  They made a language.
*  Yeah, google it.
*  How much different is it, like if you were going to say
*  something to Jamie, like if you were going to say
*  Jamie, hey Jamie, my car is coming soon.
*  I got to get the fuck out of here.
*  I'd be like, oh sup you fucker, where's my car?
*  Oh, that's normal. What's up you fucker?
*  That sounds like you're from here.
*  Hawaii is a strange place, because
*  I feel like it should be its own country. I really do.
*  But I like the fact that it's protected by the United States.
*  You know, Dana
*  had to approve me walking out
*  with my flag. Really?
*  They wasn't going to let me walk out with the Hawaiian flag.
*  Why?
*  In Vegas?
*  When I first started doing it.
*  What?
*  Because that's when the Reebok came out.
*  I couldn't put a Hawaiian flag on my shorts or anything, so I was like
*  I'm going to walk out with the flag, and then
*  Reebok was stopping it. They were like, you can't, because it's a state flag.
*  What does that have to do with anything?
*  Yeah, and then I was like, what?
*  I was like, no, no, no, we can talk to Dana.
*  So you can come out, like if you're from Nigeria
*  you can come out with a country flag?
*  Only country flag. Yeah, no state flag.
*  And then Dana White,
*  talked to Dana, and they told me
*  Dana texted me
*  and he said, yeah
*  that's stupid as shit kid, just walk with it.
*  It was like, come on,
*  let this kid represent Hawaii.
*  Like how you said, because he said, Hawaii is like their own people.
*  It's their own people.
*  Just let him represent, and then they did it.
*  It's five hours
*  in a plane across the ocean.
*  That shit is
*  barely America. Hawaii is amazing,
*  I love it. It's one of my favorite
*  places to visit. I go there three, four times a year.
*  I love Hawaii, but that is
*  not America. I love that they're protected
*  by America. I love that
*  they have all the rights.
*  I love all that, but
*  I feel very strongly
*  that they should have their own, it should be
*  sovereign. It's, you know,
*  it's their own thing, man.
*  How the fuck are you going to claim something
*  that it takes five hours to get to on a plane
*  that's not even attached?
*  Fuck it. I don't know.
*  It's crazy. It's crazy.
*  But again,
*  I love that it's protected by America.
*  I love that we're considered
*  to be from the same country. I love all that.
*  But every time I go to Hawaii, I'm like, come on
*  man, this is their own place.
*  They're Hawaiians.
*  Like if you go to North Dakota, you can't look
*  at someone and go, oh, that's a North Dakotan.
*  Right? You go to Hawaii
*  like, oh, that dude's Hawaiian.
*  That's a Hawaiian guy. You know, Polynesian.
*  I mean, there's so many
*  people in Hawaii
*  that they're clearly
*  Hawaiian.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's, there's no
*  state like that. There's no other state.
*  One on one.
*  Like even Alaska.
*  Alaska, you don't look at someone.
*  I mean, they have to have a full beard, flannel coat,
*  a fucking moose leg over their shoulder.
*  Maybe that's in Alaska.
*  But you're guessing.
*  He might have moved there.
*  He might just be a mountain man and move there.
*  100%.
*  It's a great place though. There's a thing about
*  Hawaiians that they have like a
*  when you're on an island
*  and you're surrounded by ocean,
*  there's like a reverence for nature
*  that Hawaiians have that I really like.
*  Yeah, you never see my Hiker Holloway?
*  What is that?
*  Hiker Holloway. Hiker Holloway?
*  Yeah, I got a YouTube. We got a guy named Hiker Holloway.
*  Who's Hiker Holloway?
*  You're looking at the man. You?
*  You have a YouTube video where you just hike?
*  Hiker Holloway. Oh, look at this.
*  There it is. Hiker Holloway.
*  Surviving in the middle of this. What the fuck is this?
*  Oh, this is the shit you did recently.
*  Yeah, yeah. You did this in Vegas, right?
*  Yeah, yeah. It's Red Rock Canyon.
*  Like just outside of Vegas, it's like a whole
*  another world. Like you might as well be on Mars.
*  Yeah, yeah, it is. It looks like Mars.
*  It's crazy. I just give you
*  survival tips. You know what I'm talking about?
*  Go to YouTube, guys.
*  I break down plants.
*  There's a plant that you probably see in there.
*  What plant? You can't make that joke.
*  It's called a ladder tree.
*  But you need to go and
*  see stuff. Like you actually know what you're talking about?
*  You're just talking shit.
*  You gotta go see it for yourself.
*  Hiker Holloway. Surviving in the wilderness.
*  All Maxis.
*  All Maxis is coming to you live in the rec, my friend.
*  I like it. All Maxis.
*  Do you surf?
*  A little bit. A little bit? You have to surf.
*  You're from Hawaii, right? Yeah, a little bit.
*  They get mad at you if you don't.
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, the countdown people came.
*  They shot.
*  They didn't get me on the best waves. I was like, wow.
*  I was like, guys, I caught at least
*  20 waves and you guys put like the four
*  waves that I sucked on?
*  What are we doing?
*  They're doing that on purpose. What are we doing here?
*  They're doing that on purpose. They're trying to say, he's not great at everything.
*  Or I could have actually
*  only caught that four waves and I could be lying.
*  So we don't know what you're doing.
*  I'm gonna keep you guys up to you guys
*  and keep you guessing.
*  Surfing is an interesting thing, right?
*  Because you're in their world.
*  You're in the water world. Oh yeah.
*  So like, I know like
*  all the big wave surfers and like
*  cool, Rothman, them.
*  And they always tell me, or even when I see my friends
*  at surfing, see Klaue, Kyaunula Singh,
*  and they come up to me
*  and they tell me, man, fighting is so crazy.
*  I'm like, guy, surfing
*  is crazy. And they're like, no,
*  fighting is crazy. I was like, guy, I'm fighting
*  with a human being and I kind of control
*  what they do at certain times and what I do
*  and this and that. Like when you're
*  surfing, you're fighting by the nature
*  of my guy. Like you fall off your board.
*  And if by the nature of your guy, you feel like,
*  throw you three times, you're going to get
*  thrown three times. Did you see that video that Dana
*  put up on his Instagram recently?
*  That was on Maui, I think.
*  That was a big wave surf contest.
*  That's like a 50 foot wave that
*  dude got smashed by. Is that guy alright?
*  I think he's fine. Yeah, I didn't
*  know. I just saw that. I saw it because Dana
*  posted. I saw a bunch of my surfing friends
*  posted. That is the
*  number one nightmare. This guy gets on the board
*  and right away he's slipping and just
*  goes down immediately. Watch this.
*  Here he goes.
*  Boom.
*  Look how small the board
*  looked to that wave.
*  The weight of that water.
*  He's got one of those vests on where you pop up.
*  See, that's the next thing I was going to bring up.
*  You got to pop up this. I talked to my
*  friend and stuff that does some of this.
*  You don't know if it's going to
*  pop. When you go under the water,
*  what if it, you trust it.
*  Look at him wiping
*  there. Boom.
*  Look how small his board looked to the wall.
*  It looks like nothing.
*  That is probably a 50 foot wave.
*  That is fucking crazy.
*  That is terrible.
*  I'm so scared.
*  And that's a real surfer.
*  That's a real professional.
*  That was at a contest.
*  Fuck.
*  My buddy Kenny, he just went to
*  Texas. In Waco, Texas.
*  They got one of those
*  indoor wave things.
*  Waco, Texas.
*  He said it was amazing.
*  He's flying into Texas. He gets off the airplane.
*  He's got fucking surfboards. Him and his buddies.
*  Everybody's going, looking at them.
*  You're at the wrong place, man.
*  You took the wrong flight.
*  Before this fight, I was harassing
*  Kelly.
*  Kelly was at Pipe. He was hitting me up.
*  He was doing something.
*  He was calling me, seeing what I was doing.
*  I was in camp, so I couldn't meet him.
*  I told him I was harassing him. I was like, I'm going
*  to surf. He's like, let me know.
*  We're going to the surf front. I want to go to his surf front.
*  That's up here, right?
*  That's a couple hours from here.
*  His one is in California.
*  Where's his near? It's near Fresno?
*  Central Valley.
*  Central Valley?
*  That's like two hours from here or so?
*  Maybe three or four.
*  That looks amazing, man.
*  That's a way to learn how to surf.
*  I can't even wakeboard.
*  Wakeboarding is harder.
*  You've got to get your ass up on the thing.
*  This one you can paddle and stand up.
*  Wakeboarding is kind of hard.
*  But you're an athlete.
*  You can do everything.
*  With time.
*  I don't have time to get into surfing.
*  My fear of surfing...
*  This is the machine.
*  This is him surfing with this thing.
*  How crazy is that?
*  You can learn how to surf so much quicker this way.
*  You don't have to
*  fuck with all the things that everybody else has to
*  fuck with.
*  Look at that.
*  That's so crazy.
*  No sharks.
*  Very good point, Jamie.
*  No turtles.
*  It's all about the balance.
*  Learning the balance.
*  They say riding that wave is a little bit different.
*  It's a little bit different from a normal wave.
*  It feels a little bit different.
*  Running on a treadmill versus running on the street?
*  I think the power of the wave
*  is a little bit more different than how it
*  would actually feel.
*  A little more predictable.
*  That's what it is.
*  It seems like a good hack though.
*  It is a good hack.
*  If you're a guy like Kelly
*  or Shane Dorian, someone who really knows how to surf,
*  this is probably good practice.
*  Just stay on it.
*  How much do you think it costs to make one of those things?
*  That's got to be expensive.
*  It's a bunch.
*  You need the motor or whatever.
*  That thing looks like a train is pushing.
*  You see the side of it?
*  The one they have in Waco is supposed to be bigger than that even.
*  The one they have in Waco is supposed to be gigantic.
*  What are you laughing at, Jamie?
*  It's not cheap to visit.
*  How much does it cost?
*  It says customers pay $10,000 to surf for an hour.
*  Oh, gosh.
*  What?
*  That is expensive.
*  This is the ESPN video they made about it.
*  It says you can surf 100 miles inland for $10,000.
*  Kelly Slater trying to get...
*  Kelly Slater getting his money back.
*  Kelly Slater getting his money back real quick.
*  It's not cheap to have a lake in the middle of the desert
*  that's clean and safe.
*  Right, but $10,000 for an hour?
*  You can suck all the dicks.
*  Well, there's employees you gotta pay for.
*  Yeah, you can suck all the dicks.
*  Maybe you gotta heat it so it's not cold.
*  I got some cash.
*  I ain't spending $10,000 to surf for an hour.
*  But if I was a professional surfer, look at the stars
*  who have done it.
*  Eddie Vedder, Tony Hawk, Chris Hemsworth.
*  Thor.
*  I think Thor paid $10,000.
*  I think Thor just used his hammer.
*  He's like, nah, you keep hitting the water.
*  He's like, boom.
*  I'm here to surf.
*  Yeah, that's a lot of money, man.
*  Is it really that much?
*  That can't be right. $10,000 for an hour?
*  It was a YouTube, so maybe clickbait.
*  ESPN is not really clickbait.
*  ESPN is not really clickbait.
*  100% legit source, but it's pretty good.
*  Well, it must be expensive as shit to run.
*  But it makes sense.
*  It's probably got a crazy motor that powers that fucking thing.
*  I feel like when he was here, though, he said it's private too.
*  So maybe you have to call someone to turn it on.
*  That makes more sense.
*  Well, that's probably how they keep people out.
*  Listen, bitch, $10,000 an hour.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I gotta go. Thank you.
*  I'll call my friends. Who would surf?
*  Let me check my... You see the way my account is set up right now?
*  All right.
*  I just Googled this just so we know.
*  General admission tickets are $99 a day.
*  Or $190 for a three-person.
*  That's a big deal.
*  That must have been for the private stars.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  So if you want to use the whole thing just for yourself.
*  That's probably what's going on.
*  That makes a lot more sense.
*  Sorry, Kelly.
*  He's probably going, what the fuck?
*  We're friends.
*  $10,000.
*  But that makes sense if you want to rent the whole thing.
*  Shit, man, if you want to rent out the roller place.
*  If you want to roller skate for a whole day, it probably costs you $10,000.
*  No way!
*  I'd be like, no!
*  If you want it all for yourself for a party?
*  How much do you think, if you said, listen, nobody can come here, it's just me.
*  I bet they would want a lot of money.
*  You think so?
*  Yes, man. I've rented out places for my kids.
*  It's not cheap, man.
*  You want to rent out a place like a bouncy house place?
*  Yeah, we're in Hawaii.
*  You and I live in Hawaii too.
*  Things are expensive in Hawaii, man.
*  You might be right.
*  I just be like, come on, I know a guy.
*  I'll shout you out the next time we go.
*  I'll shout you out.
*  I'll shout you out, man.
*  We were there, we saw strawberries that were like $7.00.
*  For a little package of strawberries.
*  I was like, woah.
*  But it makes sense.
*  You see how much milk is there?
*  I don't drink milk anymore, but it's probably like $15.00.
*  The folks that live on the Lanai are telling me Amazon Prime is the shit.
*  They don't have to shop.
*  Everything is flown into them.
*  I'm like, oh, that makes sense.
*  The planes are coming there every day.
*  Just load up some of your stuff on planes.
*  Otherwise, they have to go to Maui or somewhere.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  100%.
*  Do you think you can live on one of them little islands like that?
*  Because you live where a lot of people live.
*  You're in Hawaii.
*  Yeah, we live a far off one.
*  No.
*  Hiker Halloween is only a couple hours kind of thing.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm going to keep it real for the boys.
*  Hiker Halloween is a 10 minute video log for you.
*  After that, I'm right back to Gadget Holloway.
*  Gadget Holloway?
*  Are you into gadgets?
*  I'm into technology.
*  Are you really?
*  What are you into?
*  Whatever.
*  If it's cool.
*  Phones, computers.
*  Video games.
*  That's my kryptonite video games.
*  What game are you playing?
*  We were playing Quake Champions, but I got a real problem.
*  What's the matter?
*  I wanted to get back in yesterday.
*  I was thinking about it yesterday.
*  I have a very addictive personality.
*  You're a PCer?
*  Yeah, mouse keyboard.
*  I tried to do it for me,
*  and I was like, man, because I wanted to get into it.
*  But it's too hard for me.
*  And then I get frustrated
*  when people like...
*  Fuck you up?
*  Yeah, I'm like, guy, come on.
*  Send me location.
*  Send me location.
*  Send me location.
*  That might be one of the greatest things that anyone's ever said
*  when someone said they want to fight them.
*  Send me location.
*  Those little things,
*  Xbox and Playstation controllers,
*  they're not as accurate.
*  You can tell.
*  So I was playing,
*  when I was playing Fortnite, I was playing PC
*  before they had crossplay.
*  Now you can play with everybody
*  on your Playstation 4, but I would just put
*  my controller in.
*  When I was playing with the mouse and stuff,
*  you could tell the accuracy was way different.
*  Now you use your controller and stuff,
*  the delay is very small,
*  but you can feel the delay.
*  I'm like, I turned around already.
*  It's just not accurate enough.
*  And even with your movements,
*  like the movements with the keyboard,
*  especially a mechanical keyboard,
*  I feel like I can really calculate
*  what I'm doing within inches, centimeters.
*  That's dope.
*  I didn't know you were a gamer.
*  I was addicted.
*  I used to play 8 hours a day.
*  I had a T1 line installed in my house.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I lived in the wilderness,
*  and there was no fucking good internet.
*  So I had a T1 line installed in my house.
*  They had to dig into the ground,
*  took forever, laid pipes and shit
*  so that I could get a good gaming line.
*  That's so dope.
*  You were a gamer.
*  That's so dope. You were a legend.
*  I'm a moron.
*  No bro, I was playing 8 hours a day.
*  You are a legend of morons.
*  I appreciate that.
*  That's accurate.
*  And I got to a point where I was like, I gotta stop.
*  I quit for a long time.
*  I had to stop playing games,
*  because that's what I do.
*  I train, be gone all day, get home,
*  play for another 4 hours,
*  screwing up my sleep,
*  and whatever.
*  I was playing during this fight camp.
*  The new one I was playing,
*  and I was loving it.
*  The last 3 weeks of camp,
*  or the last 4 weeks,
*  I was like, I gotta stop playing.
*  There's no way.
*  You just get lost track of time.
*  I don't play story mode.
*  I'm a guy that I just want to get.
*  I love Fortnite,
*  and then Call of Duty,
*  because you pretty much have all the same guns,
*  and you just get in there,
*  and it's competitive.
*  That's what I liked, just being competitive.
*  I was like, man.
*  I didn't play for 10 plus years.
*  We had a land room in there,
*  in the back.
*  Yeah, dude, it was a real problem.
*  Once we started playing,
*  I was playing every fucking day,
*  hours and hours and hours.
*  Jamie, you had it for like, what,
*  2 years, and Jeff and I logged in
*  more hours?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  We logged in more hours, and how long?
*  2 months? 3 months?
*  More than 2 years of him playing.
*  60 days, basically.
*  Playing 4 hours a day.
*  That was just because I only had 4 hours a day.
*  If I didn't have to go somewhere,
*  I would've been there all night.
*  I'd come here on days off.
*  I'd come here, work out, hit the bag,
*  do some rounds on the bag,
*  and then I'd want to play 4 or 5 hours online.
*  I was like, fuck, I gotta stop doing this.
*  I'm busy, I wanna play some games.
*  Jen Tech's Jamie would be like, come on, bro,
*  let's go do this.
*  It's the best, though.
*  It's too crazy.
*  It is crazy. It's super addictive.
*  But you see what the kids are making now?
*  Oh yeah, they're making real money.
*  Oh my gosh! Millions.
*  Millions. Playing video games.
*  Fit place. No leg kicks.
*  Did you see what's his name?
*  Sean O'Miley, he came 15th place,
*  and he made more, whatever.
*  They did a comparison of how much he made,
*  like 27,000, 27,500,000.
*  Versus his fights?
*  Yeah, versus his fights. They did it. They compared it to his fights.
*  I was like, what?
*  That's crazy. He could be a professional Fortnite-er.
*  Fortnite-er! He's good, too.
*  I saw a couple of his streams.
*  Wow. Well, he had to do something right.
*  Didn't he get fucked over by a band supplement?
*  Sean O'Miley says he makes around
*  $4,500 a month through gaming.
*  Gaming.
*  He's over a year ago, so he could be more.
*  He just won, I think it was,
*  $27,500. He gave it all to a charity.
*  Really?
*  He came 14th place or 8th place, something like that.
*  But he gave it all to a charity. Yeah, he's the man.
*  I like that kid a lot. He's a legend, yeah.
*  I like him a lot.
*  I think the thing that he got caught with was
*  I think it was marijuana or something.
*  Was it? No.
*  I think that's what it was.
*  I thought it was a tainted supplement.
*  Oh, was it a supplement?
*  Jamie was saying that they're going to not test baseball players anymore for pot.
*  I saw that.
*  Good!
*  That's what we want.
*  Bunch of stone people out there trying to catch a ball.
*  Perfect.
*  Maybe better.
*  They took marijuana off their list,
*  but they added opioids, which is
*  a good thing.
*  Also, opioids weren't on the list before?
*  That's crazy.
*  People are like, hold on, what?
*  That's crazy, because that's a real problem, man.
*  That's a real problem.
*  Opioids is the real problem, not marijuana.
*  That's crazy.
*  Hawaii has a lot of drug issues, right?
*  Oh, 100%.
*  How did you avoid that chick growing up?
*  You know, like,
*  I saw it.
*  I remember being like,
*  I think,
*  eight?
*  No, we had to be younger.
*  Maybe I was six, seven.
*  Six or seven, my brother was younger than me.
*  I remember
*  my uncle coming into the bathroom and my mom was showering me and my brother.
*  And just fighting with my mom.
*  They were fighting.
*  Fist fighting.
*  This is normal, though.
*  ICE is crazy in Hawaii.
*  ICE is meth, right?
*  Yeah, meth.
*  I was like, holy shit, this is nuts.
*  I see my friends and family,
*  their parents, or whatever,
*  or even growing to high school.
*  My friends doing this and that,
*  I'm like, guys, this is not for me.
*  I ain't gonna do this shit.
*  I see what it did to my family,
*  and some of the people I love,
*  his friends and stuff, families,
*  and I was like, I ain't gonna do this.
*  And then that's just why I just stayed away.
*  I never did anything.
*  I never did no type of drugs.
*  Not even marijuana, never tried it.
*  Never did nothing.
*  No, I'm good.
*  You seem like you have, though.
*  That's what's funny.
*  You're a laughing dude.
*  I'm high on life.
*  I don't need it.
*  I just saw what a lot of people...
*  And then I stayed away from marijuana
*  for the wrong reason.
*  Because when you're in high school,
*  this always sticks out to me whenever you talk about it.
*  It's when you bang up the dog commercial.
*  But marijuana is like,
*  what are you doing?
*  No, you're not.
*  You're not on marijuana if you're talking to a dog.
*  That would stick with me for the rest of my life, Joe.
*  You got me all messed up for that commercial.
*  But...
*  That's a bit from my, I think that's from 2009.
*  That's from my 2009 special.
*  That's from a long time ago.
*  And...
*  I really wish you wouldn't smoke pot.
*  That's when I was graduating.
*  Play that shit.
*  Play it, let me hear it.
*  But go back, rewind it a little bit.
*  Go back, rewind it a little bit so I can hear the whole thing.
*  I wish you didn't smoke weed.
*  You're not the same when you smoke.
*  And I miss my friend.
*  I'll be outside.
*  What the fuck were they thinking when they made that commercial?
*  You are not on...
*  I remember he saying, you're not on marijuana.
*  I know that girl's on cocaine and sleeping pills.
*  Her fucking dog is talking to her.
*  Not only that, she's not even reacting.
*  If your dog was talking to you when you were high,
*  you'd be like, fuck, you can talk?
*  How long have you been able to talk?
*  If my dog was talking to me, I was like, wait.
*  Wait. This whole time, you used the damn bathtub outside.
*  What are you doing?
*  Why are you barking at me?
*  If you want food, tell me you want to eat.
*  I'd go crazy with my dog.
*  She doesn't even react.
*  She's like, huh? She's not freaking out.
*  You would freak the fuck out if Marshall started talking to you.
*  What? Hold on. Do that again.
*  Get my phone out.
*  That was a stupid commercial.
*  I just saw a lot of people...
*  I remember we got a lot of talented kids from our side.
*  I saw guys supposed to be in...
*  I think, personally, they're supposed to be in the NFL and MLB.
*  They're supposed to be greater things.
*  Just drugs and other stuff.
*  Most of them are still at home.
*  I still see them around town when I'm around town.
*  Working a job they don't like.
*  Talking about the days when they were in high school and they did certain stuff.
*  I always told myself, that's not going to be me.
*  The older people that was older than me.
*  And with drugs too. I was like, this ain't going to stop me.
*  I was like, I ain't going to let this be it.
*  This ain't it for me.
*  Where did you develop...
*  Did you always have this mindset that you were going to be great at something?
*  Oh, 100%.
*  When I was in 9th grade...
*  I remember going from 8th grade to 9th grade.
*  I was going to 9th grade.
*  One of my cousins, my older cousin, he was with me at this last fight.
*  I thought he was supposed to be in MLB.
*  He wanted to be an MLB player.
*  I was like, I want to be an MLB player.
*  I go home.
*  I tell my grandma, grandma, I'm going to be an MLB player.
*  She's like, okay, good.
*  But you know he got out of college, right?
*  I was like, yeah, and what's the problem?
*  She's like, I'm going to be a MLB player.
*  I'm going to be a MLB player.
*  She's like, we don't have money for college.
*  So you need to go get a scholarship.
*  So I'm like, okay, dope.
*  So I made school.
*  I graduated cum laude and stuff.
*  Because I thought I was going to play MLB.
*  I wanted to go college and get a scholarship.
*  But anyway, 10th grade came.
*  And then it was after the ending of baseball, I fell in fighting.
*  And when I was fighting...
*  There was only a week left in school.
*  And I was fighting for the first time.
*  And I was fighting for the first time.
*  And I was fighting for the first time.
*  And then a week left in school.
*  And then I fought.
*  We came to school.
*  I trained. First I trained.
*  Did you start with MMA?
*  No, I started with kickboxing.
*  I only trained for three days.
*  Baseball season just done.
*  I went to train with him.
*  I trained for three days.
*  And then on the second day...
*  I went there Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
*  Four days.
*  So Wednesday I went to train.
*  My friend was fighting on Saturday.
*  He said, oh, Max.
*  The coach told us, Max, someone dropped out.
*  You want to fight?
*  You got away 135.
*  I was like, bet.
*  I'll fight.
*  I would have to ask my...
*  My story was, I had to ask my grandma for $35.
*  To get into the fight.
*  To ask my friend kickbox.
*  I get to fight and I get it for free?
*  I get it for free?
*  This is bet.
*  I don't have to ask for $35.
*  You trained for two days and they asked you that.
*  What kind of coach were you going to
*  that asked you if you want to fight on your second day?
*  He saw it out.
*  We were sparring already.
*  I was sparring the first day.
*  Second day came back.
*  It was technical sparring but then we were doing.
*  The first time I ever sparring when I went with them
*  I got punched in the face.
*  The first thing that went in my mind,
*  I got to punch this guy back.
*  I don't know how I'm going to do it but I'm going to punch you right back in your face.
*  That's what we did.
*  I ended up fighting. I ended up winning the fight.
*  I remember going to school that following Monday.
*  I was telling everybody
*  that's when K-1 was huge.
*  This was 2007. I was like
*  I'm going to be a K-1 fighter guys.
*  Watch.
*  When did you start training?
*  I already had a fight and I won.
*  That sounds like a lie.
*  If you didn't know you.
*  If someone told you that, hey man
*  I was old at the gym for two days.
*  I started fighting that weekend and I won.
*  That's how crazy my mom was.
*  I was only 16.
*  I had to get approval from her.
*  She had to tell the coach that I could do it.
*  She was like
*  I told my mom
*  that it's actually a fight.
*  My mom asked me, are you ready?
*  I was like, I don't know.
*  I don't know but I want to fight.
*  She's like, okay just don't get hurt.
*  That's how crazy my mom is.
*  That's my mother.
*  She let me fight and the rest is history.
*  Two years later
*  that's when BJ Penn was the BJ Penn era
*  in the UFC. BJ was fighting George.
*  BJ went on that 55 streak.
*  Then I saw how much he made after
*  one of his fights. It was like 30K.
*  I was like, this is done.
*  I was telling everybody when I was
*  graduating, I was like I'm going to be a UFC champion.
*  I told them I'm going to be
*  a UFC fighter.
*  I was like I'm going to be a UFC fighter. 100%.
*  Then my
*  older brother graduated
*  from college.
*  He came home
*  from California.
*  He went to California
*  Artstitute.
*  He came home
*  and I was graduating high school that day.
*  I was on his computer playing games.
*  He was like,
*  graduate. What are you going to do now?
*  I looked at him.
*  I'm going to be a UFC fighter.
*  He did this laugh that I'm not
*  going to ever forget.
*  It's ingrained in my brain.
*  He's like ha!
*  He said, yeah, I don't know how
*  that's going to work for you.
*  You better go figure it out.
*  That was on 9.
*  Then three years later,
*  January 4,
*  I was at the hospital.
*  I was waiting on the arrival of my son.
*  I remember the exact time.
*  It was 10.03 AM.
*  I get my phone
*  rang and be like, hey, check your email.
*  I go check my email.
*  It's a UFC
*  contract to fight
*  for February 4.
*  First, I hang up the phone.
*  First person I call,
*  my older brother.
*  He knew I was there for my son
*  that was being born.
*  He picks up the phone.
*  He's like, what's up, Max?
*  He's my nephew here?
*  He's like, then what?
*  He's big into Vizalis.
*  Vizalis saying was, I told you so.
*  There's this thing, I told you so.
*  I told him, oh,
*  no, guess who you talking to?
*  Who am I talking to?
*  He's talking to a UFC fighter.
*  He's like, ha!
*  He did the same laugh.
*  He goes, go ahead.
*  You can tell me.
*  I'm glad. Tell you what?
*  He's like, tell me I told you so.
*  I called you when my son's here.
*  I hung up the phone.
*  My son is there.
*  January 4 was one of the best days of my life.
*  That's crazy.
*  You fought Conor when you were 20 or 21?
*  I think he's 23 or whatever.
*  I think he's 2 or 3 years older than me.
*  If he was 24,
*  I was 22 or something.
*  That was your last loss.
*  You went on a crazy streak.
*  You went on a crazy winning streak.
*  Yeah.
*  It was crazy.
*  When you see Conor doing stuff.
*  I'm a big believer in things happen for a reason.
*  Before that, I actually remember talking to you
*  after my first fight.
*  It was Bermudas when I fought Bermudas.
*  It was a tough fight.
*  I remember I ran into you at MGM.
*  You was leaving.
*  You was going back home to LA
*  or wherever you were going.
*  I saw you at the elevators.
*  He's like, keep your head up, kid.
*  I was like, yeah, this is what it is.
*  He's like, yeah, you'll be back though for sure.
*  After that, we fought Conor.
*  Those two fights really meant a lot at that time in my career.
*  It just made me realize
*  how much I really got to buckle down.
*  I really had to do something.
*  I really had to find something.
*  I didn't have a striking coach.
*  My first coach that I started with
*  when I got into the UFC
*  was no longer.
*  I ended up doing Jiu Jitsu
*  with Ryland Azarez.
*  I had a striking coach.
*  He's been ever since the UFC.
*  A little bit before my UFC fights too.
*  I never had a striking coach for Dustin.
*  Then we went on four and then we went on two.
*  Whatever the one, five, six, seven.
*  My first seven fights in the UFC.
*  What did you do for striking?
*  You really want to know what I did?
*  The UFC game,
*  I would use Henen Barral
*  and Jose Aldo.
*  I would do stuff with them.
*  I'd be like, oh yeah, this works in the game.
*  I would be like, look, I tried this in the game
*  and it was working. Let's try it.
*  And we did it.
*  I figured it out from the regular UFC game.
*  The first ever UFC game.
*  What?
*  You would watch the video game?
*  I would play the video game and be like, oh, look at this.
*  I would try the combination.
*  I'd be like, oh yeah, this kind of works.
*  So let's try it.
*  Why not?
*  It got me that far.
*  That is so ridiculous.
*  Wow.
*  So then you realized you had to do something different after the Bermuda's loss?
*  Not the Bermuda's loss.
*  The Bermuda's loss, we were trying to find
*  a striking coach and this and that.
*  And then the Conor loss, we were like, yeah,
*  we got to get this shit going.
*  My coach did,
*  Ryland. Ryland was like, man, I'm going to pull somebody in.
*  And then he brought in the guy
*  that I work with now, Ivan Flores.
*  My striking coach.
*  And he lives on the island as well?
*  Yeah, he lives on the island. We're all in one gym now.
*  Oh, that's great. Yeah, so it's like super easy now.
*  What made a giant difference?
*  Humang is different.
*  Like big, big difference.
*  What does your brother say now?
*  All that ha ha ha ha.
*  What does he say now?
*  You're the greatest featherweight of all time.
*  What does he say now? Nothing.
*  He can't say shit. Yeah, let it go.
*  Do you ever say, hey man, you remember?
*  Yeah, I always, all the time.
*  I'm not going to let you forget that. Come on.
*  I'm not going to let you forget that.
*  It's hilarious, right? It's funny.
*  You're younger brother telling you he's going to be a UFC fighter.
*  Yeah. And he turns out to be one of the all time greats.
*  And you're mocking him.
*  You're like, yeah, you're going to be a fighter, bro.
*  Yeah, he's like, good luck.
*  Yeah, he said, this is the exact way he said it.
*  He said, yeah, good luck with that.
*  You should start looking into colleges
*  or some type of state job.
*  I was like, nah, you just watch.
*  You just wait.
*  Wow. Talk about like calling it.
*  But that's one of those things
*  that someone tells it to you.
*  I'm going to be a UFC champion.
*  What are the odds?
*  Yeah, one of my friends, Michael Nakagawa,
*  he used to train with alpha male
*  because he went to UC Davis.
*  He got picked up from
*  URI favorite because of UC Davis
*  and stuff. Is he a wrestler?
*  Yeah, he's a wrestler. Big guy wrestler.
*  I remember the first time wrestling,
*  going with him, and I was in the UFC
*  already.
*  I was in the UFC already.
*  Chad was one of the top guys.
*  I remember
*  my friend told me,
*  Dustin Kimura, he trained with alpha male
*  and blah, blah, blah. I walked up straight to him.
*  I shook his hand. I told him,
*  you know how I whooped Chad Mendes' ass, right?
*  And he was like,
*  wait, what? I was like, yeah,
*  I probably whooped Chad Mendes' ass.
*  And he's like, okay. And this is after he
*  just taking my ass down like a hundred times in practice.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Or right before he did that.
*  And then we practiced and he took me down
*  like a hundred times in practice. You know, I don't know
*  wrestling too good. And then I still told
*  him, and I still told him, I still whooped
*  Chad Mendes' ass. I'm going to beat him.
*  This is how life goes.
*  I told him,
*  I'm going to beat Jose Aldo. I'm going to be the champ.
*  I was like, these guys, they're not
*  going to touch me. And you can ask him about the story.
*  And he always told me, when it
*  actually happened, he finally told me, he's like, yeah, Max,
*  I was never going to tell you, but
*  I thought you was fucking insane.
*  I was like, no, this is a different
*  confidence. You just got to put it out in the world.
*  You know, if you think you're going to do something, go do it.
*  And go work hard. I wasn't scared of hard work.
*  You've always had this attitude, though.
*  Do you know where you got it from?
*  I don't,
*  like, my grandpa, you know, I guess
*  it has to be from my grandpa. You know, my grandpa,
*  he'd probably be mad, you know, he passed away when
*  I was eight grade.
*  But he'd probably be mad that I'm a fighter because he didn't want us.
*  He's an electrician, so he
*  just wanted us to get a good job, a great job,
*  a family, a house, and all that stuff.
*  But it's just him, hard work, you know, like,
*  I remember coming home from
*  practices or school.
*  Before you go out, we had
*  to do all the chores, whatever.
*  Every Saturday, Sunday, we wake up at
*  six o'clock, he had breakfast
*  made for us, and we'd go out, clean the yard
*  before we could go do anything else.
*  He just had structure, you know, and hard work.
*  And he was like, if you want to, we had to pull weeds.
*  And he was just one of those guys that would
*  find work out of nothing.
*  Like, we'd be doing one thing, we'd be done,
*  and it'd be done ahead of schedule. He's like,
*  okay, perfect, I need you guys to do this. He's like, no!
*  No, this is not it!
*  We couldn't say nothing, but we could ask
*  if we did. But, yeah, I think
*  it was just my grandpa, you know, like,
*  and it was just like sacrifices.
*  In high school, what I did when I was
*  playing baseball and stuff, I gave up all
*  my recesses,
*  my recess and my
*  lunches, or my lunch.
*  We had 30 minute lunch and 50 minute recess
*  to do my homework. Because all I wanted to do
*  was be an MLB player, so
*  when I went out to practice right after baseball,
*  right after school
*  was finished, I remember just
*  going on the field and not thinking about going
*  home, I gotta do homework. Or I gotta do a
*  project. A lot of teachers would
*  help me out in school and stuff
*  and this and that. That's how I got cum laude. Like, I'm not
*  the smartest kid. Like, I figured
*  out, I hacked a lot of things going to
*  Kenning in life. I hacked a
*  lot of things. Like, one of the things in school,
*  I realized that you sit by
*  one of the smartest kids. I used to sit by the
*  smartest kids. Every time I was in class,
*  I'd sit by the smartest kid, ask them for help.
*  They'd help
*  me willingly. Like, okay, yeah, help me,
*  help me, help me. And if I really
*  got stuck, they'd be like, ah, give me that.
*  Take my work, do my work for me. I'm like,
*  oh, perfect.
*  Perfect, you know what I mean? Like, okay, cool.
*  And I just had to get like Cs on top of
*  my testes to get the grades
*  and I was doing good. You know,
*  I was in the money, so.
*  This is about hacking life, I guess.
*  So you just learned hard work from your grandfather?
*  100%. So what he made you do
*  and then he put it in your head that
*  you could do whatever you wanted to. Yeah, he said
*  if you want anything, everything,
*  anything or everything ever comes
*  from hard work. You're not going to ever get
*  gifted anything. And if you are gifted
*  something, don't take it. Say thank you,
*  smile or whatever, but
*  go out and work for it or earn it, you know?
*  He was one of those guys that
*  if you gave him something, he always made sure he
*  gave you back something. He didn't want to feel like he owed you, you know?
*  Maybe he would be upset that you
*  were a fighter, but damn, he'd be proud of you.
*  Yeah, but I know this
*  is the number one thing, like, so every time
*  he was already like, he was
*  out of work, he was retired and stuff,
*  and every morning, 6 o'clock in the morning,
*  we had a gazebo
*  drinking his Miller Lite. Every
*  morning, school day, week
*  day, every morning, come home from
*  school at 3 o'clock, he stood there
*  drinking his Miller Lite, you know?
*  Like drinking a Miller Lite. So,
*  I know he's up there wherever he is, whatever you believe in,
*  I know he's looking down on me and just being like
*  he always just a stupid
*  kid. And I know he's just looking at me
*  and just, I know he's proud and stuff, but I know he's
*  just like, you're a dumbass kid.
*  And it's cool,
*  that's him though. Well,
*  you know, it's just amazing what
*  you've accomplished. It's amazing when
*  you stop and think that you're still only 28
*  too. You know, you've got a long way to go, man.
*  28, we got to choke, that's why, that's why
*  it's funny, you know, like a lot of people is like
*  yeah, this guy's the future of the division
*  or this is the future of that. He's older than you.
*  Yeah! I'm like, I'm a
*  I'm a
*  time traveler, guys!
*  Cause I'm 28, you know?
*  The boy is time traveling
*  right now, with each time I'm the future, I'm like
*  so that means I'm from the, you know?
*  Yeah, most guys your age are not even
*  fighting for a title. Yeah,
*  I got in, I got in like,
*  it's cool to have stuff on this card.
*  Hooper, that Hooper kid. Yes!
*  Cause he's 20! Yeah!
*  I was just like him when I came in.
*  I remember
*  I told him what's up, I saw him, I said hi, and
*  I was talking to him and then
*  people was telling me, yeah, you know how old he is, 20.
*  I was like, yeah, that's why I went to shake his hand!
*  Cause I was that kid!
*  It was only 8 years ago. Yeah, and I was that kid.
*  I shook his hand, I was like, what's up man?
*  Nice to meet you, you know?
*  It's crazy cause like, when I was that
*  age, I remember fighting in Vegas,
*  the first fight, poor year, I remember I was standing,
*  I was watching people gamble.
*  And then they were like, hey,
*  can I get your ID? I was like, oh yeah, sure.
*  I showed my ID to a card, they gave me
*  back, they was like, yeah, you need to get the hell off
*  the floor. I was like, why?
*  They're like, it's a casino, you're not
*  21, you can just only walk through. I was like,
*  wow, this is some bullshit!
*  I didn't even know, you know? So I had to keep walking,
*  I was mad! Yeah,
*  that's hilarious. You're old enough
*  to fight, but you're not old enough to gamble.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the biggest gamble you could ever do with your life.
*  And I'm fighting grown men!
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like I'm fighting grown men, come on.
*  And it's a gamble! That's the
*  real gamble, fuck money, man.
*  You're throwing knuckles and shins
*  at people, trying to choke them,
*  they're trying to choke you, that's the biggest gamble
*  a person can take. In life, yeah.
*  That's wild.
*  You have crazy fucking cardio, man.
*  Yeah. Your cardio is very impressive.
*  Genetics. Is it genetics?
*  It's gotta be a lot of hard work, too, man.
*  Hard work. I've seen you run with the sail,
*  what kind of shit do you do for
*  strength and conditioning? You have a separate
*  strength and conditioning coach? Yeah, yeah,
*  I got this guy named Darren Yap,
*  taught the coach strength and conditioning,
*  out in Oahu, and he's one of the
*  best guys out there.
*  A lot of coaches, they say, like,
*  people don't know my coaches,
*  because they don't really like me talking
*  about them. Really? Yeah, every time they hear
*  me talking about them, they're like, come on, guys,
*  stop saying that. They just want everything
*  to me, that's how this team is. That's crazy.
*  They just want everything on me, they don't
*  want people to know, they don't want...
*  You're very lucky. Yeah. You're very lucky.
*  Blessed. Yeah, very blessed. There you go.
*  I'm blessed. You're the best Nick. Yeah, I got
*  some of the best guys
*  behind. They don't want to know, but
*  yeah, it is hard work, you know,
*  and then... How often do you do it?
*  Like, when you're in camp, how many days?
*  I do strength and conditioning at least four times.
*  Four times a week? At least four times. Really?
*  And what kind of shit are you doing?
*  I lift weights for sure, and then
*  we do cardio stuff, and we try to balance it,
*  you know, like, you gotta have...
*  One of our favorite things is you gotta have
*  goal muscle, not show muscle.
*  You know, you see some of these guys, that's like how you said,
*  like, they just rip and look amazing,
*  this and that, but they're like, tired
*  in like 30 seconds, you know,
*  that's show muscle, you know, we gotta have goal muscle, so...
*  I do a bunch of... Some days
*  heavy lifting, some days circuits, some days sprints,
*  different type of sprints, different type of
*  running, I like running, I like jogging, but...
*  Do you run on the beach?
*  I like running on the beach, you know,
*  the beach is pretty fun,
*  but it's just... It's kinda irritating, I like swimming,
*  I do swimming here and there, but it's all
*  different type of muscles, you know, we make sure we
*  all sit down,
*  we do, and we talk about
*  the goal at hand, and then
*  we make the training around it.
*  So, when you're doing four days a week, he's scheduling
*  all this stuff for you, like figuring out what you're gonna do?
*  Oh, so I have...
*  The boy got it easy.
*  The boy got it so easy, like
*  my manager, him,
*  a couple coaches, I got a couple
*  PT guys and a couple doctors,
*  they're all in a group text,
*  they all got my
*  calendar,
*  and they put everything in there for me.
*  So you just gotta listen to them when they tell you what to do.
*  I just look at my calendar, the night before,
*  and I know where I need to be.
*  With addresses, times, and everything.
*  Wow.
*  So, life be good, you know,
*  life be really good, they're spoiling me a little bit.
*  That's beautiful.
*  So, four days a week you're doing that, are you
*  doing that in the morning?
*  I like working, I like doing that before,
*  I like, if I
*  am doing it on that day, or whatever day I do
*  training condition, that's my first workout day.
*  I like, I hate when I
*  see people do
*  Jiu Jitsu training before,
*  and then they go, and then they go
*  and try to do stuff, like that's not gonna happen,
*  like it's backwards. Why is that?
*  Cause I believe you're getting tired and stuff
*  and then you go straight into conditioning, you're not gonna be able to give
*  you food, like, I can't, you can't
*  you cannot push on a weight thing.
*  Like if you gotta lift heavy or
*  do cardio stuff, you can't push when you're already
*  tired. Right. But, cause you gotta
*  like, it's a cardio thing, or there's
*  weights involved, or whatever, treadmill, but
*  when I'm in Jiu Jitsu, I can mentally
*  push myself, to
*  to break, you know what I mean? Like I can go
*  without getting hurt, without really getting
*  hurt. But then if I go to
*  do Jiu Jitsu, I gotta lift, I can't
*  like, what I could do before if I'm
*  fresh, versus what I can't do now, it's
*  totally different, you're not getting stronger, you're not getting anything, but you can get
*  mentally stronger, or whatever,
*  or smarter, and you can
*  figure things out when you apply it, like
*  I'd rather be tired going to
*  any type of Jiu Jitsu training,
*  wrestling training, or kickboxing
*  training, versus going to
*  versus the other way around. Yeah, there's a lot of
*  Jiu Jitsu gyms like Carlson Gracie's, they used to
*  do that, they used to have a real hard workout
*  before you would train. Before you would train
*  you'd do bear claw, bear crawl,
*  Yeah, the warm up, yeah, yeah. All kinds of
*  push ups, sit ups, different kinds
*  of drills that you would do, like
*  strength and conditioning routines, and
*  you would do that before you would ever get a chance to train, so
*  you'd be exhausted by the time you trained.
*  Cause you gotta figure it out. Cause
*  this is like, if I, like,
*  I like to, like the,
*  I don't know, it's just me, you know, like, with this
*  point system, this and that, I always try to
*  finish fights, no matter what, even if you're the best guy in the world,
*  I'm gonna try to finish you, and you're always gonna
*  see me in your face, I'm not gonna go away,
*  because that's just it, you know, like,
*  if I,
*  if we fought to death,
*  like, if there's no time limit, I'm
*  gonna kill you. Like,
*  this is my mindset, like, there's no
*  way, I'm gonna figure out a way to make
*  you tired, and make you quit.
*  And when you quit,
*  you know, may peace be with you,
*  till the next one, but at the end of the
*  day, that's what it is, that's why you should be
*  in that moment, because if you're
*  fresh in stuff, everybody can be the greatest
*  fresh, but there's the special ones
*  that know how to figure
*  it out when they're not there. Like,
*  when you're tired and you're dead tired, you gotta
*  go that one more round, the extra minute,
*  you figure things out, and
*  that's what, that's what separates
*  the great from the greatest,
*  you know? That's just the difference,
*  I think. Well, that's always been a
*  real signature of your fighting style,
*  is your endurance, and your
*  confidence in your endurance, so you could push
*  through, like, I'll never forget the
*  rematch with Aldo, right before
*  the second round, he came over to us,
*  and you went, the man's tired!
*  I'll never forget that.
*  But you were hyped up, you felt it.
*  It was funny, because I felt him going
*  already, and when I came down,
*  when I came by you, and I was like,
*  the man's tired, cause I knew, I was like,
*  this guy's done, he's done. And he came out,
*  I remember he came out fast,
*  he came out fast with like a straight right, left hook,
*  and I was like, oof, I was like,
*  maybe he might not be, but we,
*  but we're gonna find out right now,
*  and then I pushed a little bit more, and I was like, okay,
*  yeah, yeah, that was a little smoke screen,
*  that's what he had left from the little
*  minute he got to rest, you know?
*  He couldn't fight, that's, his style
*  is so explosive,
*  he couldn't fight that way with you.
*  I mean, that was a perfect example of
*  styles make fights. I like what you said,
*  I like what you said, like, I went
*  in a dog fight knowing that I'm gonna come out
*  in a dog fight, like that, I'm gonna bring the fight
*  to him, and that's what, that's what, that's what we knew,
*  you know, I knew that I had
*  You forced him into a wild fight. I had said, yeah, I knew
*  that if I got into a couple of slugs
*  with him, every time I went, every
*  time I came out, my battery'd probably
*  drop 2%, but he's dropping like 30.
*  Why is that? I just,
*  the dude is genetically
*  gifted with power.
*  With power, you know, and I knew,
*  I knew that I was in, I was
*  in here for a long game, and if you watch
*  his last, a lot of his fights,
*  I got to, that's the cool thing about
*  him, like, I got to watch, I got to watch him when I was 16.
*  I'd been watching him 16
*  and now I got to face this guy, like, I always
*  told myself, like, even before I was in MMA,
*  I was like, I wanna kickbox this guy. If I
*  could fight him for 5 rounds, I
*  could beat him in a kickboxing match.
*  That's just what I told myself, you know?
*  That's just the belief you need to be
*  great, you know, and keep pushing.
*  Because you just watch him, you can just
*  see him get tired over time, you know? After
*  he win the first 3 rounds, 4th, 5th,
*  he just coasted. Yeah.
*  They're gifted with powers,
*  so true, because those guys who are
*  gifted with power rarely have the
*  kind of same power. Power, cardio, yeah.
*  Like, there's a lot of guys
*  that I just think, like,
*  gosh, I wish I had your power.
*  If I could just have,
*  give me 2% of your power,
*  I would love that, you know?
*  And we work, you know, I'm working for it,
*  I'm trying to get it, but
*  just, like, just God give it,
*  like, this is different. Like, there's some guys
*  that's God given power, they just touch your chin, boom!
*  People's blood is floating. Yeah, but there's something to be said
*  for the kind of endurance and the style
*  that you have, that style of constant
*  pressure, but... I like this,
*  my style and stuff, like, I like it
*  because, like,
*  when you do knock out someone,
*  they can always be like, oh, he just caught me.
*  You know, like, with the all doing stuff, the first one,
*  that's what they were saying, they was like, yeah,
*  Max, you were losing the first couple rounds, but you just caught him.
*  So the second time we did it back,
*  we ran it back, and I had
*  to do what I had to do, you know, I wanted to show everybody,
*  look, I'm here for real. But that's why
*  I like my style, everybody's like, yeah, you do
*  good, but I'm like,
*  and what, like, if you knock out somebody,
*  like, catch them early in the round, stay 5 seconds in,
*  knock them out, you can be like, yeah, you just caught a lucky punch.
*  Even if it was the most calculated
*  punch in the world, you know, even like with the corner thing,
*  like, that's just a lucky punch, it's not a lucky punch, you know,
*  Conor's in the back practicing it, you know what I mean?
*  Like, you see, it wasn't a lucky punch,
*  but people are gonna keep telling them, no,
*  Atlanta's lucky, blah, blah, blah. So it's
*  always gonna be whatever, you know, over your head, whatever,
*  but the way I fight and stuff,
*  I just wanna just outclass you in every single
*  way that I possibly can and show
*  the world, like, look, you wanna
*  wrestle? Yeah, try and get
*  me there. You wanna do jiu-jitsu? Yeah, take me down,
*  let's see if you can get me there first,
*  and then if you wanna do the striking
*  thing, yeah, let's do it, you know, I just wanna
*  show the world that, look, I'm better than you
*  in every aspect, so like mentally,
*  that just screws with someone, you know?
*  Do you think that a guy that has the kind of power
*  that Aldo has can ever have the kind of endurance
*  that you have? For sure, you know,
*  but they have to fight different. Yeah, for sure,
*  you know, but in their back
*  pocket, it's just tough because sometimes
*  when those guys' mindsets,
*  I feel like with the guys who get knockout,
*  who has knockout power, their mindsets, they turn
*  to like, they turn to like, I just
*  gotta land this. Yep. So,
*  that's why, and then you get tired
*  in there, like, because then you mentally
*  fatiguing yourself, because you're thinking about like,
*  oh shit, I'm having bad,
*  now I just change it, I gotta turn
*  and then, now you start thinking, you start getting
*  tense, you start looking for that one shot, you start missing
*  that shot, and like even
*  when I fought Aldo, you was calling a lot of
*  look, he's like, he's whiffing, like
*  when you miss a punch and your body
*  goes with it, it's tough, it's tough
*  to recover, it's like, oh my gosh,
*  and then, you don't put in the
*  extra 5% that might get you more tired
*  because you're thinking like, why?
*  Like, I just missed, where is this kid?
*  Like, what is he doing? And then I'm back right on
*  you, you know, so, or anybody,
*  like they're back in your face, like, I'm here,
*  you know, knock knock, hello,
*  you thought I left, no, I'm right here.
*  That's like, Colby Covington's style is very
*  similar in the sense that he has a
*  crazy volume, you know, he doesn't, he's not
*  hitting you 100%. No. Like, I talked
*  to him after the Robbie Lawler fight, I go,
*  I go, how hard are you hitting? Are you hitting
*  like 60%, 70%? He goes,
*  yeah, somewhere around there, 60, 70%,
*  he goes, I'm just putting it on him,
*  just putting it on him, just keeping it on him, just staying on him.
*  That Robbie Lawler fight was a perfect example.
*  He just kept that pressure going,
*  kept that pressure going. Super smart, yeah.
*  Robbie never got a chance,
*  never had a chance to unload, never had a chance
*  to fire back. And he, and Robbie's
*  on the power punches, they look for it. Yep.
*  So when you get that stuff, they're looking for it,
*  and it never comes. And it misses,
*  because they're in their minds like, I can't, no, don't worry,
*  it's not this one, the next shuffle.
*  And then the next shuffle comes, and no, no, no,
*  I got the next shuffle, you know, like,
*  they keep saying the next one, but it never,
*  the opening was never there for him,
*  the opening was never there for him. That was
*  why it was so interesting to watch him versus Usman,
*  because Usman has a crazy gas tank too.
*  Yeah. Usman's weird, right? It was crazy,
*  the both was just, you know, pretty much
*  punching each other, right? Yeah.
*  I mean, right in front of each other, it was basically
*  a kickboxing match. Man, I don't think there was any
*  takedown attempts, if I remember.
*  I don't remember really much.
*  I don't remember any takedown attempts.
*  Very few low kicks,
*  you know, Usman threw a lot of
*  kicks to the body, a lot of front kicks to the body
*  in particular. His bodywork paid off, big time.
*  Yep. You can see Kobe really faded
*  in that bodywork, baby.
*  Yeah, I mean, the front kick
*  to the body too, that was money for him,
*  and that left hook to the body too.
*  He was digging,
*  I was actually right hand to the body, right?
*  Because he was fighting Orthodox, and Kobe was fighting Southpaw.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it was a
*  that's a wild fight.
*  That was a wild fight, because Usman's
*  got power, and he's got
*  cardio. He's got both things. Yeah.
*  Just smart use of his
*  energy. Yeah, when you
*  got that, like I
*  said, it's a mental thing. A lot of
*  guys that have the power is just
*  they just kind of cut it off sometimes,
*  you know, they don't rely on the other,
*  like, let's get back to work, and do this, you know?
*  But Kobe, yeah,
*  Usman is like a wrestler, so he's in his mind
*  he's like, I can wrestle too, or I can, so let's
*  just do this wrestler pressure thing, which is
*  punches. Yeah, I want to, I wouldn't
*  see a rematch of that fight too. That
*  fight would be very interesting to see a rematch, because
*  that fight was super fucking close and competitive.
*  Particularly on the judges' score cards.
*  Once you get fight of the night, you know it's competitive.
*  That's what I hate, everybody's like, oh,
*  yeah, let's get fight of the night. I was like, no!
*  Let's not get fight of the night. I don't want to look
*  competitive. I want the fight to be
*  like, what is going on, you know?
*  That's my thing, you know? Like the second
*  Aldo fight. Yeah, I want people to be
*  like, wow, this guy,
*  what's next? Yeah, he's never going
*  to beat him. You want that. Yeah. You want
*  that feeling. Exactly. Well, I remember thinking
*  that too, because Aldo was a late minute, last
*  minute replacement. Yeah. In the second
*  fight in particular, and you were like, it is what it
*  is. And I was like, do you know how crazy it is
*  that this guy is talking about the
*  greatest featherweight of all time? He's
*  talking about fighting him again, he's like,
*  it is what it is. It is what it is. I'm like, that is
*  hilarious. If this is the guy, if this is
*  the guy you guys think is the greatest, let me fight him.
*  Like I said, like everybody keeps asking me about,
*  oh, you really, do you want to do it?
*  Can he fight after seeing what he's doing? I'm like,
*  can he be a human?
*  He's human. He's human just like me and you.
*  If you put me in octagon, I'm going to fight
*  him. I'm a fighter. And
*  that's just it, you know? At the end of the day,
*  I just want to be the greatest of all time.
*  And he's the guy there, you know? He's one of the
*  guys there. He's one of the guys that stood
*  undefeated in MMA. It's impossible to do.
*  So why would you not
*  want to fight someone like that? That's the thing that blew
*  my mind. Even when people are like, oh, you're taking so short notice.
*  I'm like, guy, like,
*  this is what, this is how
*  legends are made. This is why people
*  remember your name, you know? And they're like,
*  oh, why are you doing this?
*  I wouldn't. It's like,
*  champions in MMA is, John
*  Jones is not defeated. Yeah, he's not.
*  He's got this one bullshit loss,
*  you know, that was one of the dumbest
*  crazy things. I remember you saying that too,
*  because like, he was already
*  finished. The fight was done. Yeah, he stopped
*  him. Yeah, yeah, the fight was already done
*  before the elbows even came into it.
*  Because his, like, when he dropped him,
*  that's when the guy's shoulder popped out.
*  And Matt Hamill was just staying
*  still already, right? He's getting crushed.
*  He was getting crushed in that fight. It wasn't a competitive
*  fight at all. John was smashing him.
*  And then the fact that they gave that as a
*  win to Matt Hamill is just bananas.
*  Doesn't make any sense. At the very
*  least, it should be a no contest. He should be
*  undefeated. He should be undefeated.
*  It should be a win. I think it should be a
*  win. Yeah, exactly. Like, he
*  already, the fight was done
*  when he did the trip. He popped the shoulder,
*  went to the mouth. Well, and then he was smashing him.
*  Look, this fucking rule is dumb.
*  This 12 to 6 elbow rule is dumb.
*  I don't understand how I can 12 to 6
*  you for standing up, like, jump.
*  If I jump in the air and I, like,
*  what is that, Tony Jai you?
*  Yeah, that's legal. It's legal, but then once we
*  go to the ground, it's like, I don't understand.
*  I don't see what is the difference
*  of both of it, you know? It's an
*  old rule, and it was brought together
*  because John McCarthy said that they were talking
*  to the commissioners
*  when they were first starting to establish rules. Yeah, you
*  said they broke ice, right? Yeah, they had seen one of those
*  ESPN things. You don't see people break ice with
*  punching fists down. Right, they do that too. You know what I mean? Kicking.
*  They use their head. They hit butt, you know?
*  It's dumb. Some guys
*  do it like this. Yeah, it's a
*  dumb, dumb, dumb rule.
*  But anyway, the bottom line is John is undefeated.
*  Yeah, 100%. And then Khabib is undefeated.
*  And who else? What other champion
*  is undefeated? I don't think there's another one.
*  So, Hudo's been beat.
*  Who else?
*  It's Khabib. Khabib's the only
*  one as a champion.
*  Usman lost in one of his early
*  fights. Wait, in Bender style?
*  Is he undefeated? No.
*  Well, he's undefeated in MMA.
*  Yes. Yeah. Oh, Ben Nien,
*  keep watching. Yeah, he lost to
*  Alex Pereira, that fucking
*  demon. He's listed as undefeated
*  for MMA. Yeah, style bender. Yeah, style bender.
*  So, it's style bender,
*  John Jones, and Khabib.
*  Yeah, so he's
*  undefeated in MMA. I think he's only got one
*  or two losses. Oh, the China. Is the China girl?
*  The China champ?
*  Wei Li Zhang. She got one.
*  Zhang Wei Li. You have to
*  say it backwards now. Zhang Wei Li.
*  Does she have a loss? She's not on
*  this list. She's not?
*  It's like a list of all undefeated
*  fighters. Oh, yeah, okay.
*  So she probably has a loss early in her
*  career. She's a monster, man. Woo! Yeah.
*  That's big, too, for a girl like that
*  to be that good and represent China.
*  You know, China has so many people.
*  It's huge for the UFC.
*  Huge. She's a, when she
*  fought that girl, Jessica Andrade, too,
*  when Jessica Andrade was a beast.
*  You know, for her to start her like that in the first round.
*  Very, very impressive.
*  That was crazy. It's a crazy time for the sport, right?
*  What a time
*  to be alive. It's awesome.
*  So how do you feel like
*  right now? Like what happens now? You relax
*  for a couple weeks and then you
*  concentrate on a rematch. Is that what happens?
*  We'll see what happens. Whatever. I don't
*  I don't know. You know, I cannot
*  say, oh, yeah, the rematch
*  blah blah, this and that. It has to be
*  a rematch.
*  Let me talk for you. If the UFC
*  wants, yeah, if the fans want, we
*  see what happens. I love that. You know, I'm a competitor.
*  Everybody's like,
*  I don't want a rematch, this and that.
*  I'm like, are you stupid?
*  Is he dumb?
*  I want to fight.
