# Joe Rogan Experience #2114 - Zack Snyder
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD1--GoDzkA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  We're up. What's going on, man? How are you?
*  I'm good, I'm good.
*  Welcome aboard. Thank you for being here.
*  No, thanks for having me.
*  My pleasure. You made two of my all-time favorite movies.
*  The Watchmen, which I fucking love, and 300.
*  Okay, awesome.
*  I have a top 20 list. I've never formally put together a top 20 list, but those are in there.
*  That's cool. First of all, I appreciate that, because 300 was a complete labor of love and an insane...
*  300 was... I was a Frank Miller fan for a long time.
*  I thought I would do another... I thought I would do Dark Knight Returns, frankly.
*  That was the movie I wanted. I still want to do it.
*  I always tell everyone, Dark Knight Returns, if I could do Dark Knight Returns, I'd be done with comic book movies.
*  Really?
*  Well, because if you've done Watchmen... Oh, sorry, I'm banging the mic.
*  If you do Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns, for me, your legacy is set.
*  So, Batman vs. Superman literally steals a lot of Dark Knight Returns. I'm not going to say it didn't. It did.
*  But it's still not Dark Knight Returns, so I think that's still out there.
*  But I always... For a long time, I had 300 on my coffee table at my house when I was making TV commercials.
*  I'd have my friends over and be like, I'm going to make this one day. It's going to look exactly like this comic book.
*  They'd be like, yeah, yeah, sure it is.
*  I was having a general meeting with Gianni Nunari, who was one of the producers, and he was asking me about what I like.
*  And he had that graphic novel in his office, like on his table.
*  And I went, well, OK, you know what? If I could do anything, that book right there, I would make that.
*  And he goes, well, what do you mean? How would you make it?
*  And I literally just opened it up and I go, we'd make... we'd film this. We'd film these pictures. It would look like this.
*  And he goes, OK, that's cool.
*  So you're saying you would just shoot the movie and it would look like this graphic novel. I go, that's what I'm saying.
*  And I think and that's what. But but at the time we couldn't sell it. We tried. We went around town with it.
*  We tried to literally we went to all the studios.
*  You know, they were all kind of kind of like, yeah, sword and sandals.
*  Wasn't it the same time that Troy was being made?
*  It was exactly the same time as Troy. And when we went to Warner Brothers originally with it, they they literally were like, we have we have Troy.
*  So why would we want this? We have Brad Pitt. Like literally Brad Pitt is in our movie.
*  What do you I go, we're going to do something crazy. We're not even going to shoot it outside.
*  And they were like, well, OK, you're not. And I go, yeah, we're not going to go for one shot outside.
*  We ended up going for one shot outside for this when the Persian messengers are coming, that super high speed shot where the horses are kind of coming over the hill.
*  We shot that outside because we just couldn't get the horses going fast enough in the shot right before this, I think.
*  Oh, no, it's this one. That's it. It's that shot.
*  So that shot was the the horses. That was a high speed shot we do with photos on its outside.
*  But that was it. That's like the only shot outside. Everything else is on stage.
*  Because we couldn't get the horses passing up inside. Yeah.
*  And we and it was too expensive. That was a low budget movie.
*  You know, we couldn't get 300 was a low budget movie. Yeah.
*  Because we I mean, we shot it all on stage. 60 days like that's like why there's no director's cut of of watch of 300 is because we every frame of film is like,
*  every frame of film we shot is in the movie in 60 days. 60 days. Yeah.
*  Wow. It's crazy. That's insane. It was we were just we almost killed us. But it was it was it was fun.
*  But yeah. So when we took it to Warner Brothers, they were like, you know, finally.
*  Well, what happened was I did Dawn of the Dead. And then from Dawn of the Dead, I was supposed to do I Am Legend.
*  Right. And I Am Legend was this movie that was at Warner Brothers that they were like, what do you think?
*  And then for some there was some kind of crazy mix up and they ended up giving that movie to someone else.
*  And then I think they felt bad or whatever. And they said, well, what do you want to do?
*  And I said, well, I really still want to do 300. And so we said we shot that test shot.
*  There's I think it's on the DVD. There's a test shot we did. And they said, OK, if you can make the movie look like that, go, go, go, go do it.
*  Was that one of the first movies that was ever shot in front of a green screen?
*  Basically most of the movie except that one scene. Sorry. Yeah.
*  I don't think it was like, look, green screen photography was like a well-known way to make a movie.
*  Visual effects and all that movie. Yeah. I don't know about a whole movie.
*  That that that was weird. I always say like, they go like, well, what innovations?
*  Like what? And I always go like, it's basically the same technology that the weatherman uses.
*  You know, like, you know, when he stands in front of the green screen and says like, oh, the front's coming in from the north.
*  You know, it's literally, yeah, it's literally the same.
*  It's literally the same technology, you know, as as a because look, like easily you could put like the weather behind that guy right there and be the same.
*  That's well, that's Eli. That's my son. Oh, wow.
*  He's now making movies. He was the second director on Rebel Moon. Oh, that's so cool.
*  He's he also plays the young Rorschach in in Watchmen.
*  Yeah. Like the baby Rorschach. Yeah.
*  Because like you put your kid in the movie and I always was like, oh, let's have Eli do that because it's easier.
*  You know, like he has to like beat the other kid up.
*  This Eli's better because like I don't have to talk to like some, you know, other because like actually there's a scene in Watchmen, you know, where he bites the kid's face and he pulls the flesh off the face.
*  And I go, you know what? Let's just get you to do it.
*  Because then I could just be like, OK, you bite this now pull it like rip it off. Right.
*  The only troubling part of that is that there was a scene that we did in that movie where the you know, because Rorschach's mom was a prostitute.
*  Right. So there's that scene where Rorschach's mom in the flashbacks like I should have had that abortion.
*  Right. And she slaps him in the face. Right. Because because he hears mom, is he hurting you?
*  Like because she's having sex with some some John in there and then she opens the door and she's like, you know, he's like, is he hurting you?
*  I should have had that abortion slapped him. And I had wanted the mother to be topless in that scene.
*  And they were like, no, like you can't have.
*  And it's cool because his mother was visiting set that day and his mom was there and she was like, oh, you're putting our son in a movie like we weren't together at the time.
*  His mom and I, but we're really close friends.
*  But she was an actress. And I said, and they were the only way that the woman could be topless is if it was actually his mom.
*  And I was like, oh, I go, Denise.
*  She was like, no chance.
*  Imagine to ask your ex-wife to play a terrible prostitute who slaps their son and says, I wish I had an abortion.
*  Holy shit. I go, come on, it's for the drama. It's not like, oh, my God.
*  She was like, you're insane. I was like, come on. It would have been awesome.
*  It's at least slightly insane. But that would be the only way to do it.
*  Yeah. Could you see the boobs on her? Yeah, that's cool.
*  At the time, probably now I think we could. Now I could have. Yeah, I think we could have.
*  If I if I'd wanted to do it now, I think that's how you would do it.
*  You do it like with like some sort of chest rig and they would paint them out and then redo the boobs.
*  That'd be that's a good idea, actually. How much go back in?
*  How much of any CGI was used on their bodies in 300?
*  Zero CGI on the body. Really? We didn't have the money.
*  So many people talk so much shit. I swear to God.
*  I'm like, you know, you get you did Mark Twight on this show and then Mark will tell you, you know, Mark is Mark.
*  Train the guys. Mark's like this amazing.
*  He's like I've known Mark for years and he was he's an incredible alpine climber.
*  He's like this. He's just like this insane.
*  He can shoot. He can fucking he could do anything that anyone can do.
*  And like when I asked him to train the guys, he's like, this sounds like Hollywood bullshit, like train actors for a movie.
*  Like they're all fakers. They're all liars.
*  And I'm like, look, you you will make them honest.
*  And so he's like, all right. So he started training everybody. Yeah, there's Mark right there.
*  And his gym was called Jim Jones. Right.
*  Like just as an example of like how hard he is.
*  But yeah. And so like, you know, he had trained all these seals and, you know, basically it was basically the same thing that he was doing with the seals he did with these actors.
*  And so a prerequisite had you can imagine it had to be in some form of some shape, some teeny bit of shape.
*  A couple of guys came to us that were, you know, pure actors, but 90 percent, you know, had had some had some shape.
*  How much time did you have to work with them?
*  I'm trying to remember. Normally what I like is at least five weeks.
*  I like five weeks and I'll take more if you'll give it to me.
*  Sure. For a film. But I mean, prepare physically.
*  I'm talking about before the film starts at two months or three months.
*  I like before the film starts of training.
*  That's enough time to get them into that. It's not.
*  It never is. These guys trained doubly as hard and they knew a lot of them were athletes anyway.
*  So they came in with like Jerry had had more time and Jerry trained with his own guy.
*  Jerry didn't train with Mark. But like, yeah.
*  But like, yeah. So, you know, it depends.
*  Like, you know, Henry Cavill, Mark trained Henry for for Superman.
*  And that was a that was a real that was longer.
*  I think that was three months or four months.
*  But yeah, it's not it's never enough time because you just can't get it.
*  Like actors, you know, they just ideally, you know, you'd have, you know, half a year.
*  Six months would be perfect, really. At least. Yeah.
*  I mean, just to get you, you know, visibly, you know, I always say the one thing is like I always say the one thing about movies is that.
*  And the thing about Mark that I love was that he he went to psychological war with the actors in the best possible way.
*  You know, like he what he is looking for.
*  He would always say, I'm going to put you in your pain cave and you're going to find out a lot about yourself when you're in there.
*  Right. And then when you come out of the workout, you know, you're going to you're going to grow.
*  You know, I'm going to grow you here.
*  And some people, some people just don't they don't like that.
*  Especially people who are like, you know, this isn't like a lifestyle that they've chosen.
*  No, that's a journey that you have to be really dedicated to go down.
*  If you're just a kind of a casual and someone comes along and says, I want to put you in the pain cave.
*  I'm not interested in that.
*  I think it works with actors because he makes it part of the crucible of the performance.
*  You know, and I think if you can connect it to the performance, it makes the training mean something.
*  You know, I was always I've always been like a sort of bodybuilding fan, like in the 80s.
*  I trained with this guy in the 80s who was just like a teacher that lived, you know, this guy, Jim Martin, who lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, where I grew up.
*  He was a teacher at this school called Greenwich Country Day, which was near the boarding school that I went to.
*  And I was like, you know, everyone expected me to be like I played soccer.
*  I was like an athlete. I was really.
*  But then I sort of got into like weight training. I was like, that's what I want to do.
*  Everyone thought I was insane.
*  But like, you know, I think it was it was my meeting Jim and Jim being like because Jim had this in the basement of Greenwich Country Day.
*  There was like this weirdo Jim and like, you know, Chris Dickerson and like, you know, Mike Katz, all these like crazy 80s bodybuilders would show up and train with him.
*  And it was like this weird I'd be like, this is awesome.
*  And like we went to the Olympia like he took us to the Olympia in New York City.
*  I don't know what year was that, like 82 or three.
*  I forget what year. But anyway, it was just really cool.
*  And I was just in this. And then, of course, I was like, you know, Schwarzenegger.
*  I read his like book, Education of a Bodybuilder.
*  You know, it's a weirdo book.
*  Did you get involved in bodybuilding yourself?
*  I mean, I trained with Jim because I thought like, OK, yeah, maybe I'll be a bodybuilder one day.
*  That'd be cool. Like, you know, but of course, like I was also painting.
*  And I remember when I when I was a senior in high school after I graduated, I went to London for a year to art school to paint.
*  And I lost like 40 pounds of muscle in that year.
*  Just like literally I was in like the best shape of my life.
*  Went to England to be a painter and like literally just ate baked beans on toast for a year and like starved to death.
*  Oh, wow. But I was like, this is amazing.
*  You know, like I'm an artist, you know, but it was it was definitely it definitely put a put a.
*  But I always had the like but I always had that aesthetic, you know, bug in my head.
*  And now I have my trainer now is this guy, Alessandro.
*  He trained everyone for Rebel Moon.
*  And he's like this he's like six in his early 60s.
*  Italian was a bodybuilder, was a powerlifter, became a bodybuilder.
*  And he's like, you know, he's just like this.
*  He's a hard Italian, no bullshit.
*  Like, you know, it was cool because during the during the training for Rebel Moon, one of the actors was like, I have an idea for a workout.
*  Do you want to hear it? He's like, I have an idea for a movie.
*  Stay in your lane. Exactly.
*  He's like or like the guys at the gym, like because, you know, he used to like judge bodybuilding competitions and, you know, has his pro card and everything was like a real bodybuilder.
*  And they'd say like, hey, can you come and look at me?
*  You know, I have a contest coming up in the bathroom and they go in there and the guy take his shirt off and he'd be like, how long to the competition?
*  Oh, you'd be like, I got two months to the competition.
*  And I was going to be like, I think next year for you is going to be better.
*  You know, it's like, oh, no, he has no problem saying, you know, like, I think I need to lose like 40 pounds, more like 80.
*  Jesus, he's like, he's hard, but he's but he's awesome.
*  He's like, no bullshit.
*  Like, he's I think he's and like, you know, he trained the guys for all moon and he's like a pure aesthetic trainer, like pure aesthetic.
*  You know, he's just going for a look.
*  He's seen everything, you know, and he just like, okay, you know, your abs could be sharper.
*  Yeah, that's a weird thing.
*  Yeah, it's like a whole thing.
*  You know, it's just like it is a whole thing.
*  Yeah, I had Ronnie Coleman on.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Exactly. You know, Ronnie Coleman at one point in time was the freak of all.
*  Oh, he is hands down like no one's ever going to be better.
*  Like he's the freak of all freaks.
*  Yeah, like just like the way his muscles attach is like crazy.
*  Like you can't.
*  Well, he was probably one of the strongest bodybuilders ever.
*  Unbelievably strong.
*  And that's part of the reason why he looked the way he looked.
*  He didn't look just big.
*  He looked super powerful.
*  Just think about Ronnie Coleman like, you know, he you see like guys that are just incredibly swole where they can't like their muscle bound like they can't.
*  And he could like always just like he could just like touch his like back of his head.
*  Look at him.
*  Unbelievable.
*  That picture.
*  Yeah. So insane.
*  Yes.
*  Alessandro was in a competition with him.
*  Night of the Champions, I think in San Francisco.
*  And he said like he goes, I come from Italy.
*  I like I'm in my first competition.
*  I like pull a card and I'm like realize like I'm next to Ronnie Coleman and me.
*  I'm like, he's like, great.
*  This is fucking perfect.
*  He goes like the guy, you know, like how bodybuilders like the whole thing is about your skin being super thin.
*  So everything like shows he goes, he goes, I saw him backstage and I thought, you know what?
*  The skin's like not there.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  He goes.
*  But then like, you know, he like so much muscle.
*  He's like pulls and he's just like, he's like, oh my God.
*  Like where how is it possible that the skin just can't muscle so thick just like pushes all the stretches.
*  You see all the striations and everything that you do with him just relaxing like backstage.
*  You thought, ah, you know, I'm more ripped than him.
*  But then like he's like, no way.
*  It's such a weird sport because they're literally on death's door.
*  Oh, literally.
*  They dehydrate themselves to the point where they have kidney failure almost.
*  Yeah.
*  The only thing that's the thing that we can all learn from the bodybuilders is like I think that just now in sort of everything that's happening like with longevity and like all this like the bodybuilders will do stuff to their bodies that nobody else would dare.
*  They'll do dosages that no one will do.
*  And so like it's cool to to say like, OK, if you want to know what quadruple the dose of anything does, just ask those guys.
*  I'll tell you because I think you'd be like, OK, you could.
*  This is the most you could take.
*  And then it's toxic. Oh, cool.
*  I'll take triple that and see what happens, you know, because they just they're all searching for like the magic bullet.
*  It's kind of amazing how few of them have died.
*  Well, and also they do die all the time.
*  So it's not they do die.
*  But it's not like you'd expect to kill all of them.
*  I think every single one of them.
*  Dorian Yates is in great shape.
*  Yeah. And how can you have been on the edge of it for so long?
*  Yeah. How could you?
*  The body is incredible.
*  That's what you learn.
*  He's really suffered, unfortunately, Ronnie.
*  But I think he suffered from surgery.
*  Yeah. I think the surgery got him.
*  You know, there's so many guys who get back surgery.
*  And back then, stem cells weren't available and people weren't aware that there's other ways to fix your back.
*  The doctors just want to go in there and start fusing discs and scares the shit out of me.
*  Everybody that I know that's had that done has had real problems afterwards.
*  It puts extra pressure on the above and below discs as well, because it's an it's an unnatural sort of unit now.
*  Instead of having three pieces, you now have one.
*  Sure. You know, it's crazy.
*  It can be a real problem. It can be a real problem.
*  Yeah. And I think that healing, the science behind healing is, you know, it's changed so much.
*  Leaps and bounds.
*  Leaps and bounds. And I think that really that's where the future is.
*  In my opinion, like how we learn to heal is really how we learn to like really stay, you know, active and like getting stuff done for longer, because like recovery is the whole thing.
*  One hundred percent recovery and also being cognizant of what your little issues are and not letting them get chronic.
*  When I was young, I was just too much of a meathead.
*  Ignore, ignore.
*  Work through pain. And also when you're doing jujitsu, you're always in pain.
*  So I was just like, just work through the pain.
*  But then I started developing some like real chronic problems.
*  And it wasn't until I started doing stem cells and then starting to understand like you can't you can, but it's not wise to just go and only do jujitsu.
*  You really should be doing maintenance weightlifting that's designed to strengthen your joints.
*  So I really started doing that and that made a giant difference, too.
*  And instead of just thinking of it as a workout, it's always like, OK, is your car ready to get on the track?
*  No, it's not. You need to change your tires. No, it's not.
*  Your suspension's off. No, it's not. You need more gas.
*  Whatever the fuck it is. Absolutely.
*  Treat your body like that.
*  Don't just say, oh, fuck it, tough. I'm going to show up with the flu and I'm going to go seven rounds.
*  No, don't do that. That's stupid. That's stupid.
*  Every time I've ever done that, it's set me way back.
*  It's never helped me.
*  Never one time that I was like pushed through the pain.
*  Has it ever been good? Not a single fucking time.
*  So now at 56, now I'm smart enough to go, OK, don't do chin ups.
*  You're getting tendonitis in your left elbow. Stop.
*  You know where this goes. It's right here.
*  You get at the same spot every time. Every time.
*  Let's start doing some wrist curls. Let's start to let's work the legs.
*  Let's do a bunch of other shit. Let's do heavy bag rounds.
*  Stop. Stop doing the pull down, too. By the way, it's fine.
*  Yeah, there's different stuff you could do that doesn't pull on that very specific tendon.
*  But, you know, overuse injuries, those kind of things.
*  So when you're doing a film like 300 and you're getting these guys prepped for this,
*  are you telling them what to eat? Are you? Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's just it's awesome.
*  If I ever put you in a movie, the cool thing is, is you you show up, you work out, they hand you food.
*  They like massage you. It's like the greatest. Oh, that's great.
*  It's like pro athletes. Yeah, like pro athletes.
*  You're just a pro athlete. You're like in training camp, you know.
*  Dude, I just watched 300 again this summer because my family and I went to went to Greece. Oh, cool.
*  And so we watched 300. Yeah. My 13 year old never seen Greek 300 before.
*  She was like, holy shit. Yeah, that's a fucking movie.
*  We were just in Greece this summer, too.
*  And it was cool because we were like in Athens and we were walking up to the Parthenon.
*  And I noticed like all the gift shops, they have like Spartan shit in them.
*  And I go, I said to the guy, I'm sorry about that.
*  And she goes, what are you talking about?
*  And I go, I apologize for all this Spartan stuff in here.
*  And she goes, yes, a fucking movie 300.
*  Did she know you made it? No, no.
*  I said, I go, yeah, that's why I said, I'm sorry.
*  I made that movie. She goes, what do you mean? You made it.
*  And I was like, yeah, I, I, that's my movie. That's my movie.
*  And she goes, no.
*  And I go, yeah. And then she was like, that's awesome.
*  Now she likes you. Yeah, it was cool. It was a cool swing.
*  But it was a fucking awesome movie.
*  If you don't like 300, you can go eat shit.
*  Anybody who didn't enjoy that.
*  What do you hate? Fun? Do you hate?
*  Well, the thing is, like, also, I met a lot of like a lot of seals, a lot of like first responders,
*  as you can imagine, really, really, you know, I've seen a lot of Spartan tattoos, you know, because of that, you know, and I'm, and I'm proud that, you know, that they find some sort of like inspiration.
*  Dude, Leonidas is what every man wants to be.
*  Yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, he was perfect.
*  He knew where, like, look, you know, he knew where his, he knew who to look to, to, to find out whether to burn the whole thing down.
*  Yeah. And, you know, she gave him the okay.
*  And it was also the movie was brutally representative of all of both.
*  It was it was both like mythical and beautiful and magical, but also very tied into the ethics of the Spartans and how absolutely brutal their world was and how they just accepted things in a way that just like, wow.
*  Yeah, that's the thing that people are always like, you know, with me, and they ask me like, what about the morality of the movie? What do you think of it? And I go like, Sparta is also another planet.
*  Like, if you like, we can't, we would not make it right to say like, Oh, yeah, I'm cool. Like with the Spartans, I mean, they would have chucked me off the cliff like day one, you know, it's not like it's hard for us to imagine.
*  Like you want to like say, yeah, I'm with the Spartans in this, but like, you know, they, they were, they were brutal people from the tool.
*  They were a tool. Yes. Like we have democracy, maybe because they existed, but they weren't necessarily democratic. They didn't.
*  There was no voting on whether or not we would like go in and die. Like that was just like what they wanted. You know, that was in their, like, you know, in their basic genetic makeup or in their philosophy, philosophical makeup was like, okay, a beautiful death.
*  If I can get one of those, I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. And I won't give it to you. You got to take it. Right. Yeah, that's that.
*  I love that like Fassbender when he's like looking down and he says that whole thing about like, you know, what's awesome is that with all the world's armies, you know, there's got to be one guy down that fucking place that can kill me and do it right.
*  You know, and they're like, are you serious? Like that's what's turning you on. You're excited about the fact that the guy that kills me might be down there. Like that's, that's crazy.
*  But it's also I think when we look at things like that and we put ourselves in the mindset of someone who lives so many years ago like that, there's this there's this understanding that human beings are capable of fitting into a bunch of different bizarre groups.
*  A bunch of different strange cultures can rise. And when you have a particularly barbaric time in history, and you have this group of people in Athens that are literally changing the world through democracy and through the illucinean mysteries and all the shit that they were doing,
*  where people are traveling from all over the globe to come to this one spot. And then you got these fucking savages. These people are the savages of savages, the Spartans. Yeah, they're like, if you think about it, if someone says like, what kind of a warrior would you want to be? Right? If you're a little kid, I want to be a Spartan.
*  Yeah, of course. It's why all these sports teams have Spartans as their like mascots. Yeah. And to imagine that there was a group of people that existed, a culture that existed that was completely warlike, and had these tenants that were just unbendable. And from the time you were a child, they tested you.
*  Yeah, that's it. And if you do, if you fucked up, if you failed, if you fell apart, if you quit, you were chucked out. Yeah, the Krypteia, like they, you know, the whole thing, like where they, they would send you like around seven, you'd go on the agogia, you'd go like into the wilderness. And you're basically living among other kids that were between like seven and 13. And you just were like wild. And the, and the, and the, the, the sort of elite of those groups were called the Krypteia. And the Krypteia would come down and just kill hellots whenever they wanted. Like, they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And they would just kill you. And
*  they were encouraged. The hellots were that slave, the slave class that the Spartans sort of maintained Spartan society. And these guys, these kids, imagine like, if you lived, you know, and like in the hills, you knew there was just like this 13 year old gang of 13 year olds that were going to just come down and murder you at any moment.
*  And they were encouraged to murder you.
*  And they were encouraged to do it because they like, and also the hellots were fine. If the hellots killed them, that was fine. Because that meant they, they weren't good enough anyway. And then they would have this like, they did this ritual with this like table of
*  cheese, where like all these Spartan warriors would stand around the table, and all the 13 year olds who were ready to like transition to becoming true Spartans, you'd have to like try and get and pull a piece of cheese off this stone table. And the and the Spartan warriors who guarded the table could do anything to stop you. And it was just like just beating the crap out of these 13 year olds. And finally, like, you know, if you got it, then you were you were given to a Spartan soldier who raised you. And basically,
*  the idea was that you he was your lover, he was your teacher, he was everything to you, because the Spartans believe that, you know, really, they believe that you, you, you would die for your, your brother, if you were also lovers, you know, they thought they thought that like, if you were confused about why we're fighting, fight for that guy, who's not only your best buddy, but like, there's like a story, I guess, where they were like, the spark when the Persians first came, they sent a scout over, and that and they let
*  look down at the Spartans right the night before the big battle. And he goes, he went back and he goes, they were all like having sex with each other was like a weird like, we're like, it's work, we're gonna be good. And there was this one of the Spartans kings was the old Spartan king was now working with the Persians and said, like, Oh, no, we're fucked. They're saying goodbye to each other. Do you know, like, you know what that means? Like, we're completely screwed. Like, they're gonna, like, we're gonna get murdered tomorrow, you know, like, and they were like, you're, you're nuts. You don't know what you're talking about. Like,
*  they're a bunch of softies. Like, let's go get them. What if that's the key to the to being the absolute greatest army have to be gay? Yeah, I have to be gay. There's precedent. So I don't know. There is precedent. Yeah, right. Like, imagine if that was applied today. Yeah, it could be amazing. Yeah, but we'll do be a real problem. We'll see. We'll see the family structure. Yeah, well, by the way, in the end, the Spartans had a real problem because they couldn't we talk there's this really crazy thing like we're on their wedding night. They would have
*  to shave the head of your bride and dress her like a man. And she would fight you because there's no that was the only way they got hard. That's the only way they could get it. Yeah, I get it. Oh, my God. Unless they got like, unless they got like a bloody lip, you know, they were like, not it wasn't gonna happen. So it's isn't that crazy. That's so insane. So like, you can imagine that it was hard to like, keep the, you know, generate enough offspring, you know, with that, like you had an awesome army, right? They were fucking the best.
*  But like you, you're as far as your procreation was going, wasn't it? God, imagine being a woman back then, too. Well, they had to run the whole show because basically, the guys were just training. So they all the commerce and like, the deals they were making to like, you know, okay, we're going to make a trade deal with this. That was all done by the women because like the guys were like, no, we're gonna we gotta fucking work out. It's kind of awesome in some ways. It's kind of awesome. But it's kind of crazy. And it's kind of crazy that it requires
*  you to be gay, to be the greatest army, because that's the one element. How much do you love this person beside you? Yeah, you got to love them with. Yeah, imagine the difference between you being with some random stranger on the street and a bunch of thugs attack the random stranger, how you would treat it versus if they
*  attacked your wife. Yeah, yeah. Do anything. It's different. It's totally different. I did that in Rebel Moon. There's a bit where I put that there's a part where Sophia's character says, like that, they basically say, they encouraged me to find a lover in the military academy. Because when the politics of war became too abstract, like, okay, take that beach, or like climb that mountain. A lot of times, you know, soldiers like what, what
*  why? Like, there's no why. But like, if you're, but if you have a lover who's next to you, who's your life, and if they get killed, or they're in danger, you're you get, you know, yeah, you're gonna be back on it. You're back on it. Yeah. And I think that it's an interesting we don't, of course, in our modern society, we don't play with that aspect of, you know, in war, we try not to anyway, we seem not to, you know, like with using the relationship to
*  get a bond. So it's an interesting I mean, like, there's, there's, there's camaraderie, brotherhood, or of course, but they've replaced that aspect of it with technology. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. Which is interesting. And maybe that's maybe that's good. But maybe it is good. But I mean, I could imagine a world in the future where things go totally sideways, where we go back to that. Yeah, absolutely. We'll make a movie about it. I mean, that's, that is a possible future dystopian movie. Yeah, a new spartan is the spartan is of the, you know, 2059. Well,
*  as soon as like, you know, what is that Einstein thing, you know, for World War Three is fought with nuclear weapons, World War Four be fought with rocks. Yeah, sticks in rocks, you know, so it's like, yeah, well, if it's World War that does it, it's probably gonna wipe out the whole race. But if it's something else, there could be like everyone thinks of dystopia as being something man created, which is real possible. But it's also possible we get hit by an asteroid. Oh, yeah, absolutely. That's more possible. I think that's that's more likely. I think I think we could fuck up and nuke each other, but it's probably not going to happen.
*  Because people have been really good about it since 1947. Nice. Thank you. I guess. Good work. But there's a there's a giant difference between things that you can control and things you can't control it through diplomacy and people aging out. It's possible that we could never have a nuclear war. It's not possible. We're not gonna get hit. Oh, yeah, no. That's why I mean, like, I'm very, I very much encourage any NASA programs that are, you know, with their
*  they got their telescopes pointed into the stars and like, oh, here comes one. Let's see if we can go get it. You know, yeah, nudge it, nudge it. They're close. They're close to be able to do that Neil deGrasse Tyson. So they're about a decade away from being able to deflect asteroids. Yeah, that'll be a big deal. Yeah. But the hope is in that decade that we don't we don't get it. We don't miss one because some of them come in from behind the sun. Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, they're like, oh, yeah, we don't. Yeah, yeah. That's not cool. Like, there's so much weirdness in space anyway. There's solar flares that could take
*  out our whole grid and kill all our communication systems. And they just ran. And also the thing is like, we don't know, like, say you say we had one of those like 300 years ago, which in cosmic time is not that long ago. Nothing. It's nothing. And we didn't have the infrastructure to know that it would happen. Like, we were just a bunch of guys hanging out. So like, we were just like, Whoa, that's a weird like the aurora borealis is pretty strong today. Yeah, that's cool. But now we're like, oh, shit, our computers are fried. So it's like a whole different. Yeah, it's also now. Stakes are different. We have the
*  ability to go and look at the data that they had from a couple hundred years ago, and say it appears that there was an event. And the event if it happened today, we would be fucked. Right. And we did not prepare for this event. We were constructing all this equipment. Yeah, we didn't. Well, because we, we, because also the equipment got built. It didn't get it got built over time. It was like a slow, you know, this made this and this made that and we relied on this. So now we may have this. Yeah, we like we don't we built like our house of cards.
*  Like pretty, pretty, pretty quickly too. And the foundations the weakest part doesn't exist. I don't think there is a foundation. I really don't think there is a foundation. Well, the foundation is what powers it. And it's all dependent upon a grid. And the grid is very vulnerable, physically vulnerable. It's vulnerable to cyber attacks. I like that. Also, we were like, we thought we were geniuses by putting all that online. Yeah, like, oh, yeah, we'll make the grid automated. No, don't do that. It's much better when there was just a guy throwing swivels.
*  Yeah, way better. He's not gonna you can't do anything to him. Just guard that guy. Yeah, guard that guy. Give him a lot of money. I love that expression in the cloud. Bitch, where's this cloud? That cloud is in fucking Cleveland. What are you talking about? There's no cloud. Cloud is not. That's such a lie. Stop calling it the cloud. That's a dirty lie. Oh, it's in the cloud. Just go get it. How do you say that? Why don't you say it's in the stars? Why don't you just lie to me and say it's in heaven? Tell me it's in heaven. Say it died. All my photos of my baby. We can resurrect that. Yeah, we can resurrect it.
*  My family, my dog, they're all in heaven. Print everything. I say print everything. That's my philosophy. Even the print everything thing. The real problem with us is all of our data is on hard drives. All of it. Yeah. There's just paper books, hard drives, and that's it. So if something big happens, everything's useless and we start from scratch. Yeah, paper books are still kind of work. But yeah, a lot of the modern innovations aren't probably even in paper books. A lot of them. Yeah, a lot of them. Well, it's funny because like the movies
*  for instance, one of the things is I always archive a film print of all my movies because the digital storage of movies, if you ask anybody, even in the business, they don't know whether in 10 years you'll be able to play a movie that you have now.
*  Like whether you physically or what or how it degrades all those things, they don't know. That's crazy. And so I'm like, that's why I make film prints because I'm like, I know that we keep the film prints in the locker and you can at least pry them out and always have it. But like, I just think it's crazy that we don't know whether the movies will exist. It's a crazy thing.
*  Don't worry about it, Zach. It's in the cloud.
*  Yeah, it's no fucking cloud.
*  Cheers.
*  Cheers, brother.
*  Thanks for doing this, man.
*  Yeah, no, it's my pleasure. That's hilarious. It's in the cloud. Why are you worried?
*  Yeah, that's a dirty expression that they should ban that expression.
*  They love that expression, though.
*  I know, but it's a dirty lie. There's no cloud.
*  But it makes people feel safe because it makes them feel good because it's like the cloud is so reliable and so like and also a thing you don't need to worry about or understand.
*  It's also beautiful. It's fluffy. It's in a blue sky.
*  And all your info is safe in there.
*  Yay.
*  Nothing can hurt it except for everything.
*  It's just horseshit. It's total horseshit.
*  It's so crazy.
*  It's on hard drives.
*  It's so crazy.
*  And if you had to start from scratch, if you know, imagine stumbling upon some ancient Egyptian hard drives and go, OK, where do we even begin?
*  You can't play it.
*  Yeah. What is this?
*  You might be looking at it and you don't know.
*  Yeah. How is it encoded?
*  What is the equipment I need to connect it to in order to does it play out loud?
*  Do I see it?
*  What is this?
*  Do I experience it in my head?
*  It's like when you show your kid a vinyl record, right?
*  Right.
*  I show my kids a vinyl record and they're like, this is incredible.
*  How does it work?
*  I'm like, well, the needle kind of bounces up and down on that on those grooves and makes sound.
*  Sounds like sounds like a song.
*  And they're like, that's how that's an insane technology.
*  I'm like, no, that's not insane technology.
*  Your iPod or your fucking phone.
*  That's insane technology.
*  That's that's a thing you can't that doesn't even you can't explain this to me.
*  OK, I can I just explained that to you.
*  I love the fact that I'm in my car and like like my daughter loves Melanie Martinez.
*  So she I have no idea what the song is.
*  Tell me what the song is.
*  And she'll tell me what the song is.
*  And I could say play Melanie Martinez, whatever the song is.
*  And it just plays it instantly plays.
*  Unbelievable instantly.
*  And it's coming through the speakers and it sounds amazing.
*  There's all this sound.
*  That is incredible.
*  It is bananas.
*  Or you could say like play Johnny Cash instantly, instantly play hurt.
*  Yeah, play hurt right now.
*  Instantly instantly.
*  It just starts playing.
*  And you're like, oh, God, why do I say that?
*  Yeah. Why do I say play hurt?
*  Play God's going to cut you down.
*  What a world that we live in.
*  Instantly.
*  By the way, I was just listening to that the other day.
*  This is going to get us in trouble with YouTube.
*  Is it? Oh, sorry.
*  I did want to show you this picture of all of us.
*  If you hum it too well.
*  We were so much better off when we were trapped in our world walled garden.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  We got out and now it's now it's over.
*  Yes. It's fucking nuts, man.
*  It's nuts. I think it's beautiful because I love the fact that you can tell me about
*  something and I can get it instantly.
*  Like someone could say, oh, my God, you have to see that.
*  Sandra's legs. Oh, my God.
*  That's insane. He looks like he's going to die.
*  Yeah. And he loves that.
*  That's that's particularly ridiculous.
*  Isn't that crazy? Yeah, that's awesome.
*  That guy has no body fat. Zero body fat.
*  What does this guy said to him?
*  The guy at the gym said, are you 8 percent body fat?
*  He goes, if I was 8 percent body fat, I'd kill myself.
*  That's so ridiculous.
*  But that's his thing, though.
*  He literally is like, I'm in space.
*  I'm like a space. You know, like we get stuff from the space program.
*  You know, like they make we figure out how a razor works or get shaving cream
*  that keeps the hairs from flying.
*  That's what he is to me.
*  Like he's like, I'm I'm up here on the ragged edge so I can come.
*  I could give you this information back.
*  Like, oh, that's an interesting way of looking at it. Right.
*  Like you do learn health and wellness things from people that are on the fringes
*  in the bodybuilding world. Yeah.
*  And he's in his 60s. So it's like, you know, you're like, OK,
*  this guy can have legs like that in his 60s. So
*  give me some. Give me a little, you know, of the give me a little of the knowledge.
*  He's funny, too, because he's like, look, I don't have a family.
*  I don't have kids. This is what I do.
*  You know, this is what I do.
*  I just get jacked and I like research.
*  I test my body constantly.
*  He's like on the ragged edge with every single like, you know,
*  like he's always making these small adjustments.
*  He goes, I ate a sesame seed and I saw that I was a little less ripped.
*  You know what?
*  You know, so ridiculous, you know, because it's like, oh, he's constantly like,
*  you know, like it's like he's on a razor's edge, which I love.
*  You know, people like that are extreme, super beneficial to any sort of extreme sport.
*  That's what I'm saying is that like you can the little that that
*  those little pieces of information they tell you about, like, oh,
*  you know, like whatever I'm taking this or like I thought about this.
*  And I experimented with that and you're like, OK, like, thanks.
*  Thanks for that. Thanks. Thanks for being out there. Right.
*  You know, thanks for being the oxygen mask like up and on the stratosphere.
*  Yeah. The possessed mad genius. Yeah.
*  It's they by the way, the world's made of that. Oh, yeah.
*  There's a guy out here in Austin, Texas.
*  His name is John Donahue.
*  He's widely considered to be the greatest jujitsu coach ever.
*  Oh, really? He's here. He's a professor.
*  He was a professor of philosophy at Columbia. That's cool.
*  And was spending time as a bouncer, wanted to learn martial arts,
*  got into jujitsu and became a jujitsu fanatic to the point where he's teaching it
*  and sleeping on the floor.
*  Did he have an actual gift for it anyway? Like it was like a.
*  Well, he's a very strong, double double.
*  He's very strong. He played rugby, but rugby destroyed his knee.
*  Fucked his body up, but which kept him from ultimately competing.
*  But he's just a crazy, mad genius.
*  It doesn't give a fuck about anything but fighting.
*  So all he's doing is like teaching people how to strangle people during the day
*  and then watching tape and review reviewing techniques and creating the next
*  the next workout schedule.
*  And they work out three hundred and sixty five days a year,
*  three hundred sixty five days a year.
*  And his number one student is Gordon Ryan, who's widely considered
*  to be the greatest jujitsu athlete of all time without question.
*  That's his belt up there.
*  The Abu Dhabi belt when he won Abu Dhabi.
*  But he's his number one student and they just train three hundred
*  and sixty five days a year.
*  They take no days off Christmas.
*  Fuck you. The birthday. Fuck you.
*  That's cool. And it's just you've got days where you don't train as hard.
*  Are you worn out?
*  Well, you're not going to train as hard today.
*  Yeah. It looks like you're saying like, yeah, like you understand the bit.
*  Like at that point, you're in a rhythm.
*  You understand your body. You know, like, OK, I'm hurt today.
*  I know how to do this, but we're always learning.
*  We're always going to we're not going to stop learning.
*  We're not going to stop. Understand.
*  That's the one thing that's crazy about YouTube, too, is that this idea
*  that there's a resource, you know, like it used to be to find a technique
*  or to learn something, you have to go to the guy's house,
*  fucking sleep on his porch.
*  He's not going to fucking train you.
*  He's going to slap you around like whatever.
*  We're now like these kids today, they get like a lot of their shit,
*  the basic shit they they they can.
*  They're like, I'm learning this.
*  I can learn something that I had no access to.
*  Absolutely. Zero access.
*  I think it's incredible.
*  I have a folder on my phone that's all jujitsu moves that I didn't know existed.
*  And I just watched the jujitsu moves.
*  How is he how is he doing that left leg in?
*  Oh, he went with the right arm.
*  Wow. And then I'll send it to my friend Eddie Bravo, who's a jujitsu instructor.
*  I'll go, is this legit?
*  And he goes, I'm going to try this tonight.
*  And then we'll text each other back and forth.
*  So like it's a constant new thing. Sure.
*  There's the basics in the workshop.
*  And let's see what happens.
*  A kid could be just all you need is a computer that connects to the Internet
*  and a friend and you can get good at jujitsu.
*  Yeah, it's better to have private instruction.
*  Of course, it's better to have a coach who, you know, when you're teaching a class
*  is you've got to make sure this arm is protected and keep this here.
*  And you have to have the defense.
*  You have to put your hand on the hip.
*  If you don't have something like that, it's going to take you longer to figure it out.
*  But if you are diligent and you're really dedicated
*  and you have a fucking YouTube connection, you can get good at jujitsu.
*  Yeah, no, I think that's to go to the mountain.
*  Well, that's what I mean.
*  Like and that's true of a lot.
*  That's true of a lot of things now.
*  Like I look, I just I had this like recently I had this crazy
*  Fortnite addiction right now.
*  I know. Yeah, I started playing.
*  Get it. I started playing Fortnite with my son, who's 10.
*  And he was like, now he tapped out immediately.
*  And I was like, well, you should come back because I'm just this is kind of cool.
*  So I'm playing. And then like, you know, three months later, I'm like,
*  what the fuck is the matter with me?
*  My wife is like, you've got to stop.
*  I am done with this.
*  I am done. You and I are the same thing.
*  I go, I'm so she's like, I'm so done.
*  You need another fucking hobby.
*  And so she's like, I bought you some clay. Right.
*  And so I started doing some pottery. Right.
*  And that's where I was like, oh, YouTube is insane.
*  Like because I just in like three weeks I had done like all.
*  So now she's like every every search engine is like hand
*  build pottery, like glazing, firing kilns. Oh, that's cool.
*  So, yeah. So I have much more productive as much.
*  Well, by the way, I get something at the end.
*  Like you feel better. I feel so much better feeling.
*  You get when you play video games for 12 hours in a row.
*  You feel terrible when you're sick to your stomach.
*  It's literally too like you have something good happen.
*  You're like, yeah, like I'm like, fuck, yes.
*  And my wife, I look over and my wife is like in the doorway going like,
*  what's wrong? Are you serious?
*  You're a grown ass man.
*  You not be making a movie right now or like writing something or doing something?
*  Well, it's important for people to know that even people who are successful
*  movie makers are still going to get addicted to those goddamn things.
*  They're heroin. They're too good. They're so good.
*  They're so well made.
*  We had a giant quake problem and I had a giant quake problem for years
*  and I quit and I quit cold turkey when I realized it was like just
*  I was playing eight, 10 hours a day.
*  You can't see the hours. That's what does it when you see the hours,
*  when you see like a total number of hours that you've played, you're like, OK,
*  I yeah, what I could have written a novel.
*  I could have done so much.
*  I could have done so much.
*  So I stopped.
*  But then when we had a new studio in Los Angeles, we had a big warehouse
*  and we said, let's put a fucking LAN in here.
*  So we put a local area network and bought some gaming computers
*  and set it up for quake and instantly I was a junkie again.
*  Scratch in my face.
*  I was fucking every day.
*  We were playing three, four hours a day. It was nuts.
*  It was nuts. It's see, it just gets right into your.
*  It's too good. It's too good.
*  They're good at it. Well, I saw the better like your racing simulators.
*  I haven't even hopped on that.
*  You know, we've had it for over a week.
*  The problem with it is it's too it's like racing.
*  Yeah, it's like the one thing I did like I saw this the other day
*  where they had the one of the F1 guys
*  went against like some some kid
*  and he beat him.
*  And I was like, that makes me happy on the racing simulators.
*  Yeah. And I was like, that made me happy.
*  Well, only just because, you know, you want that skill.
*  You want in your mind that skill set to translate.
*  Like you're like, see, I was watching this thing.
*  No matter when drivers like all the different things that they have to be able to do.
*  Their response time is so much faster than anybody else's.
*  They had this thing where they had the lights and the lights go off.
*  You have to touch the light when it goes on.
*  And the Formula One race car drivers were like off the charts.
*  Oh, really? And they all have crazy thick necks.
*  Oh, yeah. From because it's just
*  and also the helmet's not light.
*  You know, it's like a serious,
*  fucking serious piece of weight up.
*  Yeah. Bouncing your head around.
*  No, it's crazy. Whipping around.
*  I'm sure you've seen the comparison between a GT3 car
*  and then a Formula One car on the same track.
*  No, no, it's wild.
*  What is the GT3 car looks amazing?
*  And then the Formula One car like, no way.
*  That's not real. This is real time.
*  Oh, as far as like it being able to stick to the track where like
*  it's so much faster, so much faster.
*  It's so much faster.
*  And you're the time that you have. Watch this.
*  So on the left side, you have the GT3 cars.
*  These are the so these are just GT3 cars.
*  That's that's the other.
*  The right is the GT3 car.
*  The left is the Formula One car.
*  Look how much faster it's gone. Yeah.
*  The fucking insane.
*  I mean, they're so fast and the way they hug.
*  I went to the COTA, the Formula One race out here.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's insane to see it live.
*  Yeah. I see it live. You really appreciate it.
*  She's like, oh, my God.
*  My daughter will is addicted to Formula One.
*  She's like I sent her down two years ago to it.
*  And it was like, you know, look at that.
*  That sound is amazing.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like the GT3, they're not even moving in comparison.
*  Yeah, it's not even close.
*  Yeah. She I sent it out because at the time, Formula One was wanting me to
*  we were going to do a film.
*  I was going to do like a commercial for them, you know, that I was in the middle
*  of pitching them and they were like, oh, can we send you down to Austin to the race?
*  And I said, you know, I can't because I'm in the middle of this thing.
*  But you can send my daughter.
*  And Will was like, she had like pit access.
*  She was like losing her mind.
*  She's calling me every five minutes.
*  But like, are you insane?
*  Look at there's there's like, you know, Hamilton, I can't believe it right there.
*  And I was like, OK, calm down. Don't be a groupie.
*  I like I want you to like she has like a tattoo of like Formula One, like a like a car.
*  Yeah, she's really into it.
*  Well, I know that Netflix series out here in America made it way more popular.
*  And I blew it out because it didn't make any sense that it was so popular worldwide,
*  but not popular in a place that's most obsessed with cars.
*  Yeah. It makes no sense.
*  I feel like we would just be like drinking the Kool-Aid of that so hard.
*  Well, our thing is just going around a circle real quick.
*  Like our thing is so silly in comparison, like NASCAR.
*  Yeah. No, NASCAR is so silly.
*  It's crazy. And you think that like we would dig like this kind of all the turns
*  and like the insane technology.
*  It's like feels like it's right on our wheelhouse.
*  And maybe and I think it can be.
*  Well, it turns out it is.
*  It's just got to take, you know, it's something like it has something like a Netflix
*  special has to happen for it.
*  It's like what happened with the UFC, with the Ultimate Fighter.
*  The UFC was always like crazy exciting.
*  But then the Ultimate Fighter put it on television.
*  Everybody's like, wow, that's cool.
*  And you get to like invest in a personality.
*  Yeah. You know, that's I think that's in the end.
*  Americans love that they want that they want to hook on to someone and ride them,
*  you know, through the whole thing. Yes. Yes.
*  Yeah, that's that's the fun.
*  They want to get connected to that person and root for them and feel the journey,
*  especially the Ultimate Fighter was such a brilliant idea because you get these
*  guys to live in a house together and then they're going to beat the fuck out of each other.
*  And they know they know they're going to have to fight.
*  So there's all the psychological warfare going on.
*  There's like chest puffing and there's so much weird shit happening.
*  Yeah, it's by the way, it's a great it's a great show.
*  And also because like the drama, if you have fighting and drama together,
*  it's kind of it's kind of like an amazing combination.
*  You can't you can't look away.
*  And it's real fighting.
*  And it's absolutely real. Yeah.
*  Like, you know, it's not like fucking around.
*  And these guys are fighters.
*  You know what I mean? Like, that's the thing.
*  It's not like you got a bunch of schmucks and said, OK, you guys get in a ring and sort of
*  see what you can see what happens.
*  These guys suddenly are like, and guys have gone from that show to become world champions.
*  Absolutely. Which is wild. That's cool.
*  Yeah, very. And you're like, oh, yeah, I saw them when they were
*  when they were just like scrapping around the house.
*  You know, it's cool to see them like rise like that.
*  It's a it's it's it's it's an amazing show.
*  It's cool.
*  Well, there's a few things like that, like Formula One racing and fighting that
*  it just has to get in front of enough eyes.
*  It's just we have these things that we've always like baseball.
*  That's always been around. If you brought baseball out today, no chance.
*  It doesn't have a chance at all.
*  No chance. It's golf.
*  No chance. I think golf would still make it.
*  Well, also because it's a ludicrous concept golf.
*  That's what I love about it.
*  It's like and I, you know, I'm an OK golfer.
*  I've done a lot of golf commercials.
*  My dad's a scratch golfer. He's an amazing golfer.
*  I got commercials.
*  Yeah, back in the day, you know, like when I got out of college,
*  I did like 10 years of of TV commercials, you know,
*  and every day like all I did all I've done every all the brands,
*  every like I've done a bunch of Super Bowl spots.
*  I did the they like Clydesdale 9-11 Tribute spot.
*  Like there's a lot of all these kind of for me that were all these
*  like kind of touchstones. But along the way, I did like,
*  you know, PGA, I did Titleist.
*  I did like all these like, you know, I have a tour bag,
*  like in storage that says like Zack Daddy Snyder on it, like on my tour bag.
*  Yeah. So but but like the guys like you see these like
*  I mean, they are like Phil Mickelson is like an insane
*  like he he does this trick where you stand with your hands like this,
*  you know, and then he's behind you with this pitching wedge
*  and he takes a full swing and cuts it.
*  If he skulls it, it's going to crack you in the back of the skull.
*  But it goes over your head and lands in your hands. Right.
*  Why is it standing right in front of you?
*  I haven't seen the landing in hands, but this kind of video.
*  Yeah. It's literally this watch.
*  Right. He's going to do it. Right. He's going to do it.
*  Oh, my God. See, like, yeah, it's like that's the I did a spot with Phil.
*  Fuck that. I did a spot with him where he I did a spot for him.
*  I think it was it was for it was with David Robinson
*  for the PGA Tour.
*  And he he was sick.
*  He had like 100 degree temperature.
*  And like what it was, was basically we did these these guys are good.
*  It was was the name of the campaign and was like all these football players.
*  And like golf would be it was it was a ludicrous idea.
*  Golf would be in these scenarios.
*  And this was basketball.
*  It was like one second left.
*  You know, up Phil Mickelson comes in to play this basketball game.
*  They're going to play with a golf ball and they throw in the ball.
*  The ref throws the golf ball to him and he's he.
*  Catches the ball on his on his on the on the on the on the blade of his
*  pitching wedge, traps it on the ground and then hits, picks it off the the
*  the the the gym floor, you know, and the ball flies up
*  and then David Robinson dunks it.
*  That was the commercial.
*  So he's sick and he's like, Zach, I don't know, man.
*  Oh, also, we did a version of it where we had made the floor
*  about a balsa wood so he could take a divot.
*  Oh, and then the PGA was like, well, we don't want to look like it's
*  they were kind of mad because they were like, we don't want to look like
*  we're destroying property.
*  I was like, come on, guys.
*  It's like, cool.
*  It's cool that he digs the floor up.
*  Right. They can fix wood.
*  Yeah. It's also not real.
*  You know, like you can't you can't actually do that.
*  That's funny.
*  But yeah, it was cool. They were that sensitive.
*  But like Phil comes out and he's like, Zach, I'm sorry, man, I'm sick.
*  Like, I don't know.
*  Like, I go, well, let's just try, you know, do what you can.
*  And like, it'll only be a couple of shots.
*  And so he's like, I'll do the best I can.
*  So, you know, I throw him the ball and he just like cuts it in the air.
*  And, you know, like he he like cuts it in the air and he traps it with his club.
*  I'm like, holy shit.
*  And he's like, how's that? I'm like, how's that?
*  Fucking unbelievable.
*  He was like, I'm sorry.
*  I'm like, I don't know what you would do different.
*  Like, it's so crazy. So it's interesting when you see wizardry at that level.
*  Like the technique and the perfection of it at that level.
*  It's so incredible. You're like, I don't even play golf and I can appreciate it.
*  Yeah. Like John Daly, too.
*  Like we had I did a spot with John Daly, too.
*  And he was like, he's he's like comes out, you know, and I guess
*  the tournament before the one we had done before the shoot that we did, we
*  we were doing it in in Kaminsky Park in Chicago. Right.
*  And he was the idea.
*  And that one was like, he's, you know, top of the ninth two outs down by three bases
*  loaded, whatever, whatever, you know, and pitcher.
*  Here comes John Daly. Right.
*  And so what we did was so the idea was like we had this like minor league pitcher
*  was supposed to throw a pitch and he's, you know, we did it with visual effects.
*  He takes the ball of the air.
*  So what we did was we got this super long tee.
*  Right. And we put the ball on it.
*  And I was like, John, do you think you can
*  can you hit a drive with a two foot tee?
*  Like, that sounds crazy. He's like, I fucking no problem.
*  But like when he came out, he was mad because he had picked up his ball.
*  Like, you know, he got fined by the PGA.
*  If you pick up your ball halfway through the tournament, you can't just leave.
*  They don't like that.
*  And I guess he was having a bad round.
*  And so he just said, fuck it.
*  And he just picked up his ball and walked off.
*  And they were like, so they find him.
*  And he was super mad that he got fined.
*  And so he goes, he goes, I'm going to fuck up that Jumbotron.
*  And I was like, I was like, John, I go, that's me.
*  I'll have to pay for it.
*  It's not the PGA.
*  And then he was like, he's like, oh, man, I'm so sorry.
*  Like, OK, I won't hit it. I didn't know.
*  Like I thought, you know, he's like the sweetest guy.
*  And then he just like.
*  He just cranks this.
*  You he's like our Babe Ruth, like he literally I've done a bunch of spots with him.
*  You know, like on his white, like on his backswing,
*  the club head is pointing down at the ground because he's so twisted.
*  And then he just uncoils.
*  And it's just unbelievable, the amount of power that the guy.
*  And he hits the ball out of the stadium.
*  And it goes literally we had PAs in the parking lot.
*  And they're like the ball just goes over their heads and into the freeway.
*  You know, he's just a frickin Jamie.
*  Do you have that video that I sent you recently of that guy?
*  This there's this fucking guy who does this step in.
*  Oh, right. Sure. Like that, that the happy Gilroy.
*  It's not quite not quite not quite that, but with technique.
*  And it's perfect.
*  And the drive is insane.
*  And the torque is insane.
*  Again, this is coming from someone who doesn't know jack shit about golf.
*  Look at this kid.
*  Jesus.
*  She he says, I mean, she.
*  That is fucking insane.
*  The fact that he can actually with that amount of backswing,
*  the fact that he can actually hit the ball cleanly is unbelievable.
*  Is he from is that Chinese?
*  I don't know.
*  It looks like Japanese to me.
*  Is it Japanese writing is Japanese.
*  So he's Japanese, isn't it?
*  There's a lot of I mean, it's very popular in Japan.
*  Yeah. His name is Japanese.
*  Yeah, but that's unbelievable.
*  Technique is mad.
*  Let me hear that again.
*  Because the sound is awesome.
*  That's where that could be.
*  There's balls that do that.
*  But I don't give a fuck what does that.
*  Look at where it ends.
*  The club ends in front of his face.
*  Past his face.
*  There's so much whip on the.
*  It's amazing. That's crazy.
*  But yeah, it's fun.
*  That's why it was fun, actually.
*  That time in my life, traveling around and doing all those TV
*  commercials all over the world, like I had a crew of guys.
*  It was like me and my boys.
*  And we would just like literally go one job,
*  Papua New Guinea, one job, Germany, one job,
*  Mexico, one job, Iceland, like over.
*  And we were just on the road completely out of our minds.
*  And it was just, you know, and like whatever product we'd be like, OK,
*  I'd be pitching the guys be like, what are we doing next?
*  I'm like, I got to get on a call.
*  Like I have an agency and I get on the call in the hotel room and I pitch him
*  and I'd be out of my mind.
*  I don't know what I'm saying.
*  And I'd come out and they'd be like, how'd it go?
*  And I think I got it.
*  And they were like, did you nail it?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  I told them it's going to be like low angles and slow motion and it's fucking cool.
*  And they were like, OK, cool, let's go.
*  And it was just this we were just in this machine.
*  And frankly, I learned everything like I spent ten years,
*  you know, like the ten thousand hours thing.
*  It literally I spent ten years with every production problem
*  because I was a director of photography.
*  I was the DP and the director.
*  And, you know, we were a pretty small show, you know,
*  but we had giant clients, anything you can think of.
*  So then when I went to make a movie, it wasn't like there was no
*  there was no thing I hadn't seen, you know, wasn't like I stepped on a set like
*  I'm a first time director.
*  Everyone's like, oh, this guy's a first time director.
*  Like, what's his you know, what's he going to say?
*  And I'll be like there.
*  There was like the tools were my tools.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I was very comfortable with the tool set that I had in front of me,
*  like more so than I probably should have been.
*  You know, I remember
*  Matt Leonetti, who was the DP of Dawn of the Dead.
*  That was my first movie was like halfway through the thing.
*  He's like. You know, you know what you're doing,
*  like, you know, you know what I mean, like, you know, you're doing like
*  he goes, they can't fire you now because like we were halfway through
*  because like I was so diligent, like on my first movie, so scared, you know,
*  Scott Stuber, who
*  was the executive at Netflix, who was my executive on Army of the Dead.
*  He was the one that hired me to do Dawn.
*  And I was so I wanted to do such a like I wanted to be so conscientious.
*  And I was so scared of like going over budget and not nailing it
*  and making sure it was cool and all that.
*  That like Matt Leonetti at one point was like, look, man,
*  like you got to just fuck it, you know, you're it's your make it cool now.
*  Don't give a fuck.
*  Just make it do what you think.
*  And it was such great advice because I think the movie's edge
*  and all the coolness in the movie and the man comes around and all that
*  like weirdness, the whole like montage with the Richard Cheese song in the middle.
*  That was all just me going, all right, good.
*  Thanks, Matt. I'm going to just go.
*  And he goes, good, because like, you know, because otherwise he goes,
*  you're just going to make a movie that this zombie movie is going to disappear.
*  You know, unless you fucking add your sauce.
*  Yeah, go. You got to add your sauce.
*  Because he goes otherwise, it's like, look, another zombie movie.
*  Like, who cares? Right.
*  Like he goes, you he goes, I know, you know, what's cool.
*  Well, you made it fun.
*  I think that that was the whole thing for me was like,
*  how do you make a B movie
*  that's self aware that it's a B movie? Right.
*  And in that self awareness, it lets you off the hook to enjoy it
*  because you can still be smart like you deconstructed the genre.
*  You because like I've always been fascinated with genre
*  and the deconstruction of genre.
*  Like I'm a genre filmmaker.
*  I always say to everybody, like people like what kind of film
*  a genre filmmaker like, and that is to say that like in genre,
*  though, you can explore like philosophy.
*  You can explore mythology, especially, which is like myth is like my main
*  like we make myth, modern myth.
*  Movies are modern myth.
*  Superhero movies are modern myth.
*  Like, is it not the same when you say
*  like we have Superman, right, and Batman or whatever.
*  Are they not the mythic answer to the modern?
*  A lot of modern questions about like how we should live, you know,
*  like you say, Superman, is he not like an invention,
*  a 20th century invention that says to us like all the fucking shit
*  that we run up against, whether it be war or like class struggle
*  or whether it be, you know, you know, inter
*  relationships between different countries.
*  Does Superman not appear in answer to us,
*  primitive brains trying to figure out where we are like you make a guy like Superman
*  so he can answer some of those questions, he can represent a point of view
*  that is not helpless in the face of the insanity that is like, you know,
*  the problems of the 20th century.
*  And I think Batman in the same way, he's an answer to like urban.
*  What is urban?
*  The urban jungle needs a myth, you know, just like the ancient jungle
*  needed a myth or the ancient, you know, those all like in those days,
*  we'd say like, why is the volcano erupting? Right.
*  But now we say because we didn't know, you know, we're just like,
*  I guess it's the gods are mad, you know. Right.
*  And but now we have now the problem is like, why am I?
*  Why do I feel helpless in the face of technology or whatever? Right.
*  You know, so we need an answer.
*  We need an additional answer.
*  And I think that's what and that's what I've always and I feel like genre
*  has allowed me to make those comments, you know.
*  And I think, you know, look, the funny thing about, you know,
*  what I always find interesting, you know, the thing that I always find
*  fascinating about sort of the movies I've made and how they've
*  landed on pop culture is that like I remember like in the last article
*  was like it said Zack Snyder love him or hate him. Right.
*  Like and I'm like, hate him.
*  Like what? I don't understand.
*  Like what? It's just it's a movie.
*  You know, like it's not I mean, you look at Rebel Moon.
*  You're like, OK, well, there's not a lot. It's not it's not.
*  It's not it's not weird enough.
*  It's not offensive enough to hate him for. Right.
*  In my opinion, find a reason to hate today.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  And 99 percent of those people also hate themselves.
*  That's exactly what's going on.
*  And when people are very hateful over art, you can like it.
*  You don't like it. I don't. There's a lot of stuff I don't like.
*  I have no issue with you not liking the movie.
*  That's not that's not the question. Who cares?
*  The thing is, like, you you would personalize, you'd hate me
*  because I don't understand that.
*  Like, I don't because you're unreasonably successful.
*  That's what that how they feel.
*  And that's what what happens with people.
*  You've done so many hit movies like fuck this guy.
*  Like people compare themselves to someone like yourself
*  that's been so successful and they get angry.
*  That's why you can't read comments.
*  Yeah, no, that's why you cannot read comments.
*  Never comments are, you know, they're essentially long form comments
*  or what a lot of articles are.
*  Yeah, it's the same thing.
*  Exactly. They are.
*  It's these people that are film snobs that get, you know, very pretentious
*  about certain aspects of moviemaking and decide that their way is the only way.
*  Like, listen, I like the Barbie movie. OK.
*  I found it enjoyable. Awesome.
*  I went with my daughters and I had a good mindset.
*  I said, let me just enjoy this movie. Sure.
*  Just not be like, what the fuck is this?
*  Men didn't talk this out.
*  I just said, this is a fun movie. Yeah.
*  It didn't offend me.
*  It I laughed a bunch of times.
*  I thought it was fun.
*  And I went online and saw so many people angry about that fucking movie.
*  And it was all men. Yeah.
*  And as it would be, listen, first, you're out of your fucking mind.
*  If you go to a Taylor Swift concert and expect to see ACDC,
*  you're out of your fucking mind.
*  You're going to a Taylor Swift concert.
*  You know what it is.
*  So if you go to see the Barbie movie, you know what it is.
*  Why are you mad?
*  Yeah, you know, like, were you were you shocked?
*  Like it's literally Barbie girls doll.
*  Yeah. What did you think was going to happen in it?
*  Also, and I, by the way, I love the movie and I'm actually
*  lampooned in that film.
*  There's a line in the movie that says, I feel like I'm like,
*  I feel like I was in a dream where all I cared about was the Zack Snyder
*  cut of Justice League. That is a line in that movie.
*  It's literally and I'm like, that's awesome.
*  Like, I know I think that I was like, OK, my wife was like, she goes,
*  that's cool. Right.
*  Like, that's cool that that they came after you.
*  I was like, it's 100 percent cool. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah.
*  It's it was it was it's but it's interesting to see when there's
*  like such a strong reaction to certain things.
*  And especially amongst like really wild, hardcore fans,
*  because there's hardcore like a pretty.
*  I know. Yeah.
*  Well, you also face it because you you cover these.
*  Genres, you cover these subjects that are iconic.
*  Superman, Batman.
*  I mean, just those alone.
*  No, no. And by the way, that's a lifestyle choice for a lot of people.
*  It's not a movie. Right. Right.
*  It's not a movie. It's like it's not like if I made a romantic comedy,
*  you'd be like, OK, that was fun. Right. Like I.
*  The people who love and by the way, I love that they feel this passionately.
*  I'm not in no way would I criticize that because I feel I live the same life.
*  Right. Because like it's for me, it's morning, noon and night.
*  But so for those guys, it's not just a movie.
*  And so you have to on some on some level, you have to acknowledge that
*  the they this is their religion, you know, and they feel strongly about it.
*  And by the way, the truth is, it's my religion, too.
*  You know, so it's a it's a it's a I I tend to get in trouble
*  because of my I do take a deconstructivist point of view
*  because of Dark Knight Returns, because of Watchmen.
*  Those if you've read those two comics, it's hard to go back.
*  You know, to like you, you want to.
*  And it's because I care that I want to take them apart.
*  Like I want Batman like people are always like, well, Batman.
*  Batman can't kill. Right.
*  So Batman can't kill his cannon.
*  And I'm like, OK, well, the first thing I want to do when you say that
*  is I want to see what happens.
*  And they go like, well, don't put him in a situation where he has to kill someone.
*  I'm like, well, that's just like you're protecting your God in a weird way.
*  Right. You're making your God irrelevant.
*  If he can't be in that situation, he has to now deal with that.
*  You know, if he does do that, what does that mean?
*  What does it what does it what does it tell you?
*  But does he stand up to it?
*  Can he survive that? Right.
*  As a as a God, as your God, can Batman survive that?
*  I never thought that that was canon that Batman can't kill.
*  But well, for a lot of people, it is.
*  That seems ridiculous given the circumstances in which he operates.
*  Well, and all the weapons don't read the comments right now.
*  Don't read the comments. Yeah.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  Well, I mean, and, you know, there's this huge like there's.
*  So in Dark Knight Returns, there's a scene where and I copied it
*  kind of in Batman versus Superman, where he grabs the M60.
*  He busts through the wall and he grabs the M60.
*  And he's like the guys like in the comic book, he's like got this kid.
*  The the mutant has this kid with a gun to his head.
*  And he's like, I'll kill him. I swear I'll do it.
*  And Batman says, I believe you.
*  And he shoots him straight in the head because it's like a no win scenario.
*  It's like the Kobayashi Maru of you know, the Kobayashi Maru is that
*  in Star Trek, it's that test they put Kirk through where there's a no win.
*  Right. Because they want to see how you react.
*  Right. So they say, OK, we're going to make a we're going to make a scenario,
*  a test scenario where you don't win, where there's no way to win.
*  And in that situation, we find out what you would do in a no win situation,
*  because if you're going to be the commander of this spaceship, you have to
*  you're going to be in situations where, you know, it's life or death.
*  And especially when there's no tricking it.
*  Right. There's no tricking death in this case.
*  And the famous thing with Captain Kirk is he he went and hacked the machine
*  and made it so there was a a solution.
*  And so that was his response to the no win situation was create a scenario
*  where he wins, which is cool, which is a cool character.
*  You know, that's a cool character move.
*  But that's kind of how I felt.
*  That's what they would say.
*  Don't do that to Batman.
*  Don't put him in a no win situation because we don't want to see him lose.
*  Like we can't see him lose.
*  He has to maintain this godlike status.
*  And that's what the cool thing about Frank Miller.
*  Frank Miller said, fuck it.
*  I'm going to like I'm going to I want to see who this guy.
*  Like if a guy.
*  So you're saying to me that I've got a gun to this kid's head.
*  You're Batman. I'm going to.
*  There's no move. There's no trick.
*  There's no throwing the batarang.
*  There's no dust ball to distract me.
*  Like I've I've just got to pull the trigger and I kill this kid.
*  So you're saying in that scenario, Batman, what Batman supposed to do?
*  Right. Right. Yeah.
*  He's going to lay down his gun.
*  What's he going to do?
*  Like it's the guy says to him, I'll do it.
*  I swear it. I believe you is perfect.
*  Yeah, I believe you.
*  And then it. Yeah.
*  You know, so I'm just like, that's where like Frank Deakins takes Batman
*  and just tears him in half.
*  And you've got to now come out the other side of that.
*  And Batman is still the hero.
*  Batman still does the right thing.
*  He maintains his code, his he doesn't change.
*  But like our perception of him changes.
*  And I think that's like that's the I and I have run afoul of.
*  But but a lot of the fandom who have I feel like who have like
*  gotten to the same place I have with the characters where they need to test them
*  to like and I feel like the characters, it's been my experience
*  that the characters have not let us down.
*  Like these myths have not let us down.
*  They have they've made they they you put them to the ragged edge
*  into that scenario and they come out the other side and you're like, fuck yeah.
*  There's a reason why Superman is Superman.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  There's a really like he can handle it.
*  He can fucking take it because he's so iconic.
*  Like you see like the red ass you go anywhere in the world.
*  With that Superman t shirt on anywhere.
*  And you say to any kid like, what's this?
*  Oh, that's Superman. Yeah, exactly.
*  Like, you know, that means something.
*  That's like fucking cool.
*  Well, not only that, it's one of our first ever superheroes.
*  Literally. Yeah.
*  I mean, just think of the name.
*  It's so unoriginal. Superman.
*  It's the most you couldn't think of that today.
*  That's not it. You can't do that.
*  I know if you tried to come up with a Superman today, everybody shut up.
*  Superman. That's horrible.
*  That's your guy. Yeah.
*  You know, come on, man.
*  We've got so many different interesting characters.
*  That's why the Trinity Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman are so powerful
*  because they're literally obviously the origin.
*  Concept. Right. Wonder Woman. Literally. Yeah.
*  Batman. Batman is the only anomaly because he's like a Batman.
*  What does that mean? Right.
*  What does he does? He doesn't even have powers.
*  Yeah. He's just like a he's half bad.
*  Like, what is that? Just got a lot of money.
*  Yeah, he's got a lot of money. Yeah.
*  That was like my favorite thing we did in in in Justice League,
*  where Bruce says that line about like when when Flash says, like,
*  what's your power? And he's like, I'm rich.
*  I thought that was cool.
*  Kind of crazy that no one decided to genetically experiment on a Batman.
*  Like make make a bat. Yeah.
*  For another another version of Batman.
*  Like take a guy and hit him with some Wolverine juice or whatever the fuck.
*  No other animals.
*  Just turn him into a superhero.
*  Yeah. Instead of have him just be a rich guy, give him some crazy genetic
*  mutation, some thing that they do to him that turns him into something.
*  But I think that and that is the thing.
*  I mean, not to that extent, but that's the thing that Frank does.
*  And that's the reason why I wanted Affleck,
*  because to me, Batman's a big dude, right?
*  That's like six, four.
*  He's like a legit big dude.
*  And, you know, like in the shoes, the shoes, the boots are like two inches.
*  So like he's literally almost like, you know, six, six in the in the costume.
*  Like when he comes out in the costume with a little bit of I mean,
*  we put some muscle on him and then there's a muscle suit under the suit.
*  And he's like, it's he's like legitimately a scary looking thing.
*  You know, he's just like standing there and you're like, holy shit.
*  Like, dude, the chin is so insane in that cowl.
*  You know, he I mean, look at him.
*  He's like, you know, he's I took that picture, by the way.
*  You know, he's like legitimately like that's Batman to me.
*  I mean, I don't know like what you know, because Christian Bale was a great Batman.
*  He's a great Batman, but he's still like, you know, you know, five, ten.
*  You know, it's it's it's cool.
*  I mean, not to be. I'm not I'm not mean I'm not being rude about that.
*  And giant in the comic book in some of the like in in Dark Knight Returns
*  and in Frank's comics and like, you know, in the classics, he's pretty big dude.
*  You know, he's always been pretty good in Dark Knight Returns.
*  If you look at Dark Knight Returns, you know, like he's there's a line
*  like where he's trying to hold someone's gun and his finger
*  can't get in the trigger guard because he's so big.
*  You know, like like where he's like, you know, I like things like that.
*  Like, you know, you're just like he's like he has this.
*  This genetic like gift of just being this big fucking dude.
*  And other than that, you know, his parents were murdered in front of him.
*  And he's also like a billionaire.
*  So like that that weird like you, you want it to not be just one of those things.
*  Right. Right.
*  It needs to be all of them in order for him to really
*  to do what he can do.
*  But if somebody really wanted to fuck around with the genre today,
*  if he had all that money, wouldn't he invest in some wild genetic
*  engineering that turns him into an actual superhero?
*  Yes. It's I think that that.
*  That's the real that's the fun of it.
*  They're pulling their hair.
*  Yeah, like they don't like that.
*  They're saying you can't kill.
*  Not just steroids.
*  Not just steroids. You wish it was steroids.
*  I'm talking something way crazy.
*  Well, it's funny because like I did that scene like there's that scene.
*  I think it's I don't think it's in the it might be in the theatrical.
*  But it's definitely in the director's cut where like he's wakes up
*  and there's some chick in the bed with him that from the night before.
*  Because like I always say, like, you know, Batman fucks to forget for sure.
*  You know, Batman's a drunk for sure.
*  You know, because like he has huge trauma. Right.
*  Like and I think that like, you know, you wonder why it's a playboy.
*  It's because like, you know, like anybody like that's a common,
*  you know, fucking forget is a common.
*  That's a real thing. That's a way to deal with trauma.
*  You know, and I think that like I have that there's that bit.
*  He wakes up and there's like just painkillers on his bedside table
*  and he's just like, pops him and drink some wine.
*  I'm just like, you know, to me, that's that's like that's like that's Batman.
*  Yeah. Like he's you know, he's got he's got a maple
*  tharp above the bed.
*  He's got his glass house.
*  And he's just like he has a he has an aesthetic that's like clean.
*  But like, that's all he does.
*  That's like his life.
*  You know, like he the thing about Batman, the modern versions of Batman,
*  the Miller Batman, your Batman's.
*  What what what's interesting is that now superheroes are these flawed,
*  like very, very distressed characters.
*  Sure, sure, sure.
*  Like the Watchmen is the best example.
*  They're all Watchmen is all trauma.
*  It's all trauma and it's they're all crazy.
*  They're completely crazy.
*  And it's it's such a good movie.
*  Why the fuck was there never a Watchmen two?
*  Well, because, you know, frankly, the comic book doesn't exist for me.
*  That's why there wasn't.
*  I just was like the thing that's awesome about also that
*  it's one of those things like when you start to really,
*  you know, look at like Night Owl not being able to get it up
*  because he's not he's not in his costume.
*  Like, that's just a cool to me.
*  That's just like a that's like pure.
*  That's like that's boiling down superhero to its fucking purest thing.
*  I don't get turned on unless I like I got to go out,
*  fucking save some people, do some crime fighting.
*  And now I'm fucking ready to go.
*  You know, like that that to me was like that's that's that was like
*  that that that as a superhero movie, as a concept,
*  took a long time to like like Land with the Boys or like these other kind of
*  superheroes with now it's cool to deconstruct superheroes.
*  It's kind of fun.
*  Everyone's having a good time with it.
*  And I was doing it whatever almost, you know, 15 years ago.
*  And, you know, it just I just don't think superheroes were as
*  deep in the culture as they are now, where like all those things would land,
*  you know, like all that deconstructive kind of work that we were doing at the time
*  was really in reference to comic books, not comic book movies,
*  because Watchmen was written, you know,
*  in response to the comic book industry, not necessarily
*  comic book movies didn't exist when the when the book was written. Right.
*  You know, so it's a very much, you know, Alan Moore was very much obsessed
*  with the morality of comic book heroes within comic books.
*  And so and he just took an adult look at it.
*  You know, he's a smart genius.
*  He's a fucking pure genius.
*  Well, that was the thing that people figured out along the way with graphic
*  novels as well was that comic books aren't just a thing that children like.
*  You know, I was a giant comic book fanatic when I was a kid
*  and I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.
*  That's what I want to do.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  I had one bad high school art teacher and it ruined it for me.
*  Fucking guy. Fucking guy.
*  He ruined it for my friend John DeVore, who was the most talented guy in the class.
*  When I found out that he gave him an F, I was like, are you out of your fucking mind?
*  This guy was so talented. Wow.
*  And he was like, I was pretty good.
*  And he was quite a bit better than me.
*  And then there was this other guy named Kevin, who was in our class,
*  was also like really good.
*  And all of us wanted to be comic book artists.
*  And I was really into the more adult versions of it.
*  Like there was some amazing, like horror genre comic books back in the day,
*  like Creepy and Eerie that have these incredible like Frazetta covers.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Have you ever seen Creepy and Eerie?
*  Sure, of course.
*  Yeah, God, I love those things.
*  I'll tell you my sorry.
*  Go ahead. Finish your.
*  No, no, go ahead.
*  But you want. Oh, so what I was going to say was that like
*  I was obsessed with growing up this comic book called Heavy Metal.
*  Yes.
*  Which and Heavy Metal is like my thing.
*  Basically, what happened was my mom, I had bought I was like 13 or whatever.
*  And I maybe 12 even.
*  I bought a copy of Heavy Metal, whoever sold it to me,
*  because, you know, it says Adult Illustrated Fantasy magazine right underneath.
*  Like in kind of small letters, but it's there.
*  Right.
*  I would cover it with my thumb when my mom was around.
*  But she won Christmas, like got me a subscription to Heavy Metal.
*  Did she know? She didn't know.
*  She just thought it was a cool comic book.
*  Right. And I didn't say anything, of course.
*  And that really that comic book.
*  And I and when you see the R rated version of Rebel Moon when it comes out,
*  because basically the deal I made with Netflix was they said,
*  I wrote the script and I said, this is the script I want to make.
*  And they said, that is insane.
*  And I said, yeah, but it's like it's a heavy it's like Heavy Metal,
*  but like but like in live action.
*  Yeah. And they were like, yeah.
*  Is there any way it could be PG-13?
*  And I was like, well, if it's PG-13, it kind of misses the whole point a little bit.
*  But I can imagine that, you know, for a mass audience and for like, you know, viewership.
*  That seems like the smart way to go.
*  I go, what about this?
*  What if we make if I make take this script, I make you a PG-13 version.
*  That you can just blast into the world and hopefully many people see it as possible.
*  And then you let me as a bonus, you just let me make this version exactly as I think.
*  And they were like, OK, that sounds cool.
*  So coming at the end of the summer, you'll see my two three hour versions of Rebel Moon
*  that are like hard R rated, the hardest, which you wanted to do, which I exactly wanted to do.
*  So they said, yeah, go do that.
*  And so they they were able because normally when I do this.
*  Director's cuts, you know, which is a thing now I'm weirdly famous for.
*  The director's cuts were always an answer to a thing that the studio made me do.
*  Right. Like, here's my movie.
*  They're like, yeah, we really want you to cut these parts out because they're not cool.
*  They're like, the movie's too long or the movie's too violent or whatever.
*  And I would be like, wow, really?
*  Because I really think that's kind of the why of the movie.
*  And they'd be like, no, it's really important.
*  The focus groups told us that they don't like that.
*  So take it out.
*  So I take it out.
*  But then I'd go like, you know, I'd go over to home video right across the street.
*  And I'd be like, hey, guys, you want another movie to release?
*  Because I got the shit.
*  And they'd be like, absolutely.
*  Whatever you say.
*  Because, you know, at that time, there was a huge market for directors.
*  It gave them a second kick at the can in home video.
*  So they would be like, that's so cool.
*  We get a whole other movie to market that like never before seen footage.
*  You know, it just feels like a cool thing.
*  And so that was how I've always done my directors, because always as a response
*  to what the studio was telling me couldn't be in the movie, because I never planned.
*  I would always go into it like bright eyed, like, oh, everyone's going to love this.
*  It's clearly, you know, the studio.
*  When you see my cut, you're going to think it's amazing.
*  And they would like look at it and go like, bro, like that's no, like this too much.
*  And so that's what that's where my director's cuts kind of as a, just as a practice were born.
*  You know, it was born out of that.
*  Me needing to show the world what I intended originally.
*  And so, you know, by the time now that I've got to Netflix with this Rebel Moon movie.
*  And my sort of the mythology around my director's cuts was kind of a thing, especially
*  with Justice League, as you can imagine.
*  They were like, you know what?
*  Why don't we do a director's cut as part of the process rather than as a response to it?
*  And I was like, that's really smart.
*  Like that's really cool because in a lot of ways I totally get the economics of making
*  a PG-13 version of this insane genre movie, because what I'm asking, you know, from a
*  budgetary standpoint is high for like a boutiquey space movie that's like, you know, a heavy
*  metal comic, you know, that's like a people who love that will love it more than anything
*  else. Right.
*  If I, if I can land that, they'll think it's the coolest thing ever.
*  But like for a mass audience, it might not be exactly what you would imagine.
*  So I'm like, I can do both.
*  And that's kind of what and that's kind of where I and that's why when you see the R
*  rated version of of Rebel Moon, you're like, fuck, this is this is heavy metal.
*  I come to life is really what it is.
*  And that's kind of what I really wanted to do.
*  That's that was the thesis of my whole like me get being turned on by the sci fi because
*  like the thing you can do, I feel like the thing that you can do with them with that
*  format was you could really deconstruct sci fi.
*  Like we always talk about like I said this at the directors because I was like when Luke
*  Skywalker walks into the cantina and like is confronted by Walrus man, like is that
*  sexual? Like is that is he like he's fucking with Luke looks like some farm boy in this
*  bar in this rough bar.
*  Like what's going to happen to Luke?
*  Right. Like that's a conversation you cannot have.
*  Right. In star in the context of Star Wars.
*  Right. Right. There's no chance.
*  That's not going to be like in heavy metal.
*  That's real. Yeah.
*  That that threat is real.
*  Yeah. You know, and it's not and it's not anything other than like a naive farm boy
*  walking into like a gritty city bar that he doesn't know what the fuck he has no he's
*  out of his element other than that he's our hero.
*  Right. And he's got to go through a crucible and he's got to learn.
*  You know, he's got to like these are the like Joseph Campbell Ian parts of his journey.
*  So anyway, but that and that's kind of what it's cool because, you know, I've always been
*  like the hugest fan of heavy metal.
*  I think it's like the fucking cool.
*  It was the coolest thing.
*  Heavy metal is amazing.
*  It's like it always like made me it kind of broke me for comics a little bit because,
*  you know, it was always like super sexy and super violent.
*  And so you'd get a normal comic and be like, when are they going to start fucking?
*  Because, you know, it's.
*  Yeah, it was always sexual.
*  And there was one that I remember that I remember was like very stunning to me.
*  Very shocking when I was a kid and it was a pretty sure it was heavy metal.
*  But it was a it was one of those genres where it was a guy and his wife started a
*  relationship with a robot.
*  Oh, yeah, cool.
*  And he tried to like fight off the robot and the robot broke his arm with his big dick
*  hanging out like the robot had like this big giant flaccid dick and he broke the guy's
*  arm was like smiling at him.
*  And it was just like, Jesus Christ.
*  Sounds amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  But it was also indicative of that that genre that those days like this is the 70s,
*  right?
*  70s when they first started publishing that all that was on the ragged edge, which was
*  so it was so underground and so cult and so weird.
*  That's what I loved about it.
*  And that's what I wanted to do with the movies.
*  I say, what is the cult underground?
*  Raw sci fi movie look like?
*  You know, so is it hard to do the PG 13 version?
*  Very, very hard.
*  It was really conflicted.
*  Like it was super complicated.
*  Although the only thing I will say is that I was liberated by the fact that I knew the
*  R rated version exists.
*  So there was in the other versions of of this work in the other directors cuts, there was
*  a version where that directors cut never was seen.
*  There's a very good chance that that movie never got saw the light of day because where
*  would you show it in the old world?
*  In the movie days?
*  Right.
*  All you had was DVD as your option.
*  And if DVD said, yeah, we're good with like just the normal version, then that would have
*  been it.
*  And it would just die a death.
*  And you would whatever you intended for the movie would just never be seen.
*  And that's just how it was.
*  And so this in this scenario, I was like super grateful to Netflix because I was like, you
*  guys have like done a thing that I've never been able to do my entire career.
*  And that is like, know that this version of the movie exists and it's going to be seen.
*  So I'm happy to do whatever we whatever you guys think is right for the PG-13.
*  I'm like, I'm a good soldier and I'm proud of it and I love it.
*  But yes, it is different from like what I, you know, was.
*  What if the R version is it NC-17 or R?
*  Is it?
*  Do they do NC-17 anymore?
*  It's I won't say the exact rating.
*  We're waiting to see.
*  We're still like up against it, but we're trying to get it.
*  It's TVMA right now.
*  What does that mean?
*  I don't know.
*  No one does.
*  Mature audiences?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like any TV show that's not because like in TV, the cool thing about TV is they
*  have TV14 and then it goes to TVMA.
*  TVMA literally has no top on it.
*  You know, like you're going to, I think it's like almost like porn is TVMA.
*  Is there?
*  I don't know what I, I, I look, no one understands the ratings.
*  No one does.
*  It's an alchemy that is impossible to know.
*  It's all subjective.
*  It's all subjective and bizarre.
*  And so, you know, and they also, it's genre related.
*  Right.
*  So like, say for instance, the ratings board might say something like, um, well, this is
*  a sci-fi movie, so it's, it's, it's too much, but if it was a horror movie, you'd be fine.
*  But it's a sci-fi movie.
*  So it's not fine.
*  Or it's a superhero movie.
*  That was the whole thing with Batman versus Superman.
*  I remember the ratings board said, we just don't like the idea of Batman fighting Superman.
*  I was like, what is that?
*  Like, but how is that your opinion?
*  Like, how is that?
*  That has nothing to do with the rating.
*  The ratings didn't like that.
*  Yeah.
*  They kept saying like, we want it.
*  They kept making it an R.
*  They kept coming back with an R for us.
*  And we were like, we really, what do you want us to cut out?
*  And they were like, well, we just don't like the idea of Batman fighting Superman.
*  I'm like, I can't take that out.
*  That's the movie.
*  That's so ridiculous.
*  They would have that kind of power.
*  So it was crazy.
*  So we really had to trim it super.
*  It, it's.
*  Do you think that affected the final version?
*  I mean, if you see the director's cut of Batman versus Superman, it's much better.
*  It's a much better movie.
*  I, in my opinion, it's much better movie.
*  Well, it's representative of what you actually wanted to create.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that that that's, that's true of all the director's cuts that I've done
*  is that it's just a glimpse into the why that you get to see better.
*  The why of the movie, the why of its origin, what it, how it, cause like, obviously
*  something kept me awake for two years writing.
*  Something kept me jazzed about like, fuck yeah.
*  I can't wait to do this.
*  I'm drawing.
*  I draw for rebel moon.
*  Like I drew 3000 storyboards for that movie.
*  Like that is like a lot of work, you know, to like, you know, to you got to care.
*  That's five months of drawing after I've written the script.
*  Wow.
*  So I've written the script for a year and a half, and then I draw the
*  movie for like another five months.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  Oh my God.
*  You must've been going nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so missing Fortnite.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was before Fortnite.
*  By the way, it's a good thing I didn't have Fortnite cause I would have like,
*  it ruined everything.
*  The problem with writing and with for me drawing is if I have one
*  procrastination I can do one.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll take it.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause like, if I look at that blank pad and I look at the video controller,
*  video game controller, I'm like, oh yeah, this is way more satisfying.
*  Yeah.
*  That thing was wants to fuck me up.
*  That pad is trying to fuck me up.
*  The thing about the delayed satisfaction though, is that if you could force
*  yourself to get to the pad when you're done, you'll feel good.
*  And if you play the video game, you'll feel last night, I started
*  fucking around in my office.
*  I was just watching YouTube videos and looking at pool cues.
*  And then I said, all right, go to work.
*  And I snapped and I went to work and I worked for a couple hours.
*  And when it was done, when I went to bed, I felt great.
*  Awesome.
*  No, I felt like I did it.
*  I did something.
*  The feeling of doing something is so much better than the feeling that you have
*  to carry for hours of fucking off when you knew you were supposed to do something.
*  A hundred percent.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  And then by the way, and in the end I did it.
*  I did that work and I'd show like when, you know, it, when we went to film the
*  movie and I've always drawn the storyboards for my movies, it's like, it's,
*  it's, it's a problem, but it's, it's, it's a thing that I do.
*  It's my only process.
*  It's funny because when I made soccer punch, I remember we were talking about
*  it and I think it was my script supervisor.
*  She said, one day you're going to like not need to draw these drawings and you're
*  just going to, you know, you're not going to need to spend that time.
*  And it's just funny that like in retrospect, it's like, obviously I have to
*  draw the drawings, like it it's like, let like, that's my process.
*  Now I realize there's no way around it.
*  There's no, like you want to cheat, you know, like I wish I had a cheat where I
*  didn't have to draw the drawings where I'd be like, Oh no, it's going to be fine.
*  I think I can make it up on the day and it'll be good.
*  And I do make it up on the day, but the truth is that process of drawing is the
*  process that I, I vet a lot of the ideas in that drawing.
*  Right.
*  It's not just drawing, it's writing as well.
*  I'll change the script.
*  I'll do whatever.
*  I'll be like, no, no, cause that doesn't make sense.
*  But when I see it physically, I'm like, no, you can't, that doesn't work.
*  So that the re sort of construct it in the drawings a little bit sometimes.
*  When did you start doing that?
*  I started doing it.
*  Um, I did it throughout.
*  I did it 300.
*  Um, did you learn it from someone?
*  I, no, I had always drawn, like I draw and like, you know, I'd gone to school
*  as for fine arts, so I was always drawing shots and so it's also a thing like in
*  film school or when you're trying to think of something movies take so much
*  resource, right?
*  You need like to make a movie.
*  You're like basically an architect and you have to convince someone to build a
*  building, right?
*  And it's so much work to convince people, like to invest, to dig the, get all the
*  cranes and the steel.
*  It's like impossible.
*  So drawing is like a little taste of it.
*  Right.
*  So like, I can make, these are the shots I want to make.
*  Right.
*  So in a weird way, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's drawing that
*  beautiful sketch of the building in a lot of ways.
*  That's what it's going to be, you know, so you can get a feeling for it.
*  And I think that's what it does for me.
*  It's, it satisfies the, the impossible group activity that's going to require me
*  to like convince people.
*  Maybe that's why I love fountainhead.
*  You know, like it's a, it's like that, it's that process of like getting people to
*  like believe in this thing that it's going to take resources and like so much
*  crew and building and designing and all that other work that's down the road.
*  It's the, it's the drawing that I think is a little bit of a, it's, it's
*  satiates that desire a little bit for me.
*  It gives them a framework too.
*  There's like, there's something.
*  Oh, it's hugely beneficial in the production process.
*  Once they have that, everyone knows exactly what to do.
*  You know, it's incredible tool.
*  Once I have it, did you do it for watchmen?
*  A hundred percent.
*  My watchmen books are insane.
*  Did you draw Dr. Manhattan's Dick?
*  Oh, of course.
*  That's the question.
*  Yeah.
*  Here's the question.
*  Got you.
*  Could you make that movie today?
*  I don't know.
*  Would they allow, I mean, that like, someone once gave me a statistic of how much time
*  Dr. Manhattan's cock is in the movie, like just full frontally in the film.
*  And I think it's a fair amount.
*  Like I think it's the, I think it's the only studio film.
*  It holds the record for most frontal nudity, male frontal nudity of any, you know,
*  And it's kind of important.
*  It's super important.
*  Like he doesn't give a fuck.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  Obviously.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he walks around like that.
*  He's a God.
*  He's a God.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  You can't deal with it?
*  Get the fuck out.
*  Fucking vaporize you.
*  Or I don't even care what you think.
*  You're a, you're a, you're a cockroach.
*  It's like, what does he say?
*  He goes, he goes, the world's smartest man is no more.
*  Dangerous to me than it's smartest termite.
*  It's like such a cool thing to say.
*  Like, you know, like he's, he doesn't like, you know what I mean?
*  It's like, you really realize in the face of a God, like he does.
*  I've walked across the surface of the sun.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he's like, I don't know.
*  He was the coolest.
*  He's the fact.
*  He's the coolest.
*  And the transformation scene is fucking amazing.
*  By the way, that one of my, we were just talking about the other day, like one of
*  my favorite sequences in any movie I've made is his, the birth sequence of Dr.
*  Manhattan, the whole thing with the film.
*  Cause we it's Philip Glass did the music, right?
*  We borrowed the music.
*  Cause I had heard that music and I was like, it's gotta be this music.
*  And we tried to like Tyler Bates, who's an amazing composer.
*  He tried, we try, I go, write me something that's better than this.
*  And we just couldn't do it.
*  So we just had to license it from, and I had to send Philip Glass the sequence.
*  And he watched it and he said, okay, it's cool.
*  You can have the music.
*  That's so cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's like, you know, it's just so, it's just so, it's just so right.
*  I love this fucking scene here.
*  Hear this.
*  That's still classes music when he knows he's fucked.
*  We built this giant oversized watch for those shots.
*  That's good.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that Philip Glass.
*  So good.
*  That music is fucking birth scene.
*  It's insane.
*  So good.
*  It's so insane.
*  It's so good.
*  The skeleton in the hallway with the muscles screaming.
*  Oh my God.
*  I remember shooting that exactly like as if it was yesterday.
*  Yeah.
*  We had this air cannon.
*  We had to fire at that guy with the mop.
*  Because he, when he, he like gets hit with it.
*  He was like overacting.
*  I think we did like three takes.
*  I was like, guys, just the first time he like flew on the ground.
*  I was like, okay, it's too much.
*  It's good fun.
*  Yeah.
*  That's really cool.
*  It's interesting because like, you know, we, I think one of the things that we,
*  after justice league, I think one of the things that we, we really, as a, as a
*  group, as a family anyway, you know, cause I lost my daughter over that.
*  You know, she wants my, well, you know, and the, at the post side of justice
*  league, my, I lost my daughter to suicide and, you know, I left the movie famously
*  and then the movie went on and then later we were able to like, you know, finish
*  the movie sort of in the way that we, we had always hoped.
*  Um, and I think the thing is that like, the thing that I kind of sort of come
*  back to when I look at that and when I look at the movies is like, you know, we,
*  there are these markers, you know, the movies are really these markers of time
*  that we, even though they sort of transcend time weirdly, you know, they,
*  they exist beyond the time they were recorded, you know, at these weird, like
*  they, they're in the computer as sort of these singular, like little, you press
*  it, but then it runs and it's real and it's time and it takes time to enjoy it
*  and time to like, you can't just say it, you have to watch it and feel it again.
*  You know, it's like a cool, it's a weird thing in that way.
*  And I, and I think that like, it just, the thing that you hope is that in the end,
*  you know, the markers meant something to people, you know, and I think that that's
*  we've really fought around because a lot of these mental health has been a big
*  thing for my wife and I, you know, since losing my daughter.
*  And we've always tried, we've tried the best we can to like, support the fans
*  have done incredibly, the fans have raised like millions, over a million dollars,
*  just to support, you know, AFSP, which is, you know, the suicide, you know, against
*  suicide in America foundation.
*  And we've been like, just, it's been cool that the movies, these moments have like
*  now in retrospect have like a purpose, you know, and that they have like, that
*  the fans have gotten this opportunity to kind of like, you know, join with us and
*  kind of like be with us to like, you know, and you know, this, cause it's a huge
*  stigma, you know, like people, nobody wants to talk about like, that they're
*  having trouble, you know, that they're, you know, that they're not okay.
*  And I think that what we've been trying to do lately, as much as we can is like,
*  say like, no, it's good.
*  Like, you know, it just, it's okay.
*  You know, like it's not a sign of weakness.
*  It's nothing.
*  It's just, it's real, you know, it's kind of a hundred percent part of being human.
*  And I think that it was a, you know, we've all, it's an easy thing to kind of say
*  that, you know, it's just stress or I just like, I'm, you know, I'm good.
*  I'm not depressed.
*  I'm fine.
*  And it's an easy thing to just try and muscle through where like, you know, I
*  think that, you know, it's my hope anyway, that like, as a family, that, you
*  know, the movies and our connection to the fans and our connection to like that
*  cause has been really, really deep.
*  And I, I'm just watching this actually just started to be thinking about like
*  what the movies mean, you know, like how they're, what is their legacy, you know,
*  what are they, and if they can do on one, on one hand, they are the moments you see
*  for me, Dr. Manhattan, Leonidas, whatever it is, you know, but then on the other
*  hand, there, they can be, they, there's this other narrative outside of the
*  stories, you know, like the, what was, what I was experiencing and what made me think
*  of it was just like what I was going through at that, on that day, when we
*  filmed it, like what I was struggling with, what I was trying to deal with, you
*  know, is real.
*  That's hard stuff.
*  You know, that's just, that was just life being lumpy for us, you know, just
*  trying to make a movie living in Canada, being away from the kids, just all that,
*  all that struggle.
*  And, and then it's cool when, you know, it's been cool for me that when the
*  fandom and the movie, like in the case of Justice League, they lined up, you know,
*  where these, these, these people were like, no, we're not going to, we, we want,
*  we, there's a movie out there that we want to see.
*  And it's, it's, it's around a struggle that we had as a family.
*  And all of it sort of came together.
*  I always say like, you know, people are like, you know, the fandom was toxic or
*  whatever they were like, they were so angry to get the cut that they were like,
*  I go, also, also they literally people's lives were saved by the money that those
*  kids raised, like literal, like lives, real tangible lives were saved by that
*  money, that those kids that you call, that you would say are these toxic fans,
*  they're also responsible for the saving of lives.
*  And that's just real.
*  You have to acknowledge it because if you don't, like you, you, you, in some
*  ways, the legacy that they were able to create is like dismissed.
*  And I just, I, I won't, I can't.
*  Well, that's just a reductionist view of things that people always like to apply
*  to things that are controversial, especially when they're talking about your fans
*  and saying something like they're toxic.
*  That's such a dismissive thing.
*  No, there's going to be some elements of any passionate rabid fans that are going
*  to be toxic because it means so much to them.
*  And that's what you have to understand.
*  The reason why they're behaving the way they're behaving and the reason why
*  they're screaming is first of all, they don't think they're being heard.
*  And second of all, it means everything to them.
*  These people that are like deeply invested in your films and in particular,
*  like things that have like this sort of iconic history, like the watchmen or like
*  Batman, I mean, these are very important things to 100%.
*  It's like the same way people are fanatical about sports teams, the same
*  way they're fanatical about, you know, music.
*  It's tribal, you know, it's tribal.
*  100%.
*  Very, very tribal.
*  So for you, when you have vision and you have these storyboards and you have all
*  this stuff that you and then you see something like, in my opinion, that birth
*  scene is one of the great masterpieces of that genre.
*  It's a masterpiece.
*  It's like watching him be born and become Dr.
*  Manhattan is fucking amazing.
*  It's like, I remember being in the movie theater watching going, Oh shit.
*  It was the perfect feeling is like what you want from these fantasy escapism,
*  graphic novel turned films.
*  It was perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  It's cool.
*  And even just like watching it and like, you know, the comment, like I never said
*  that, that, that, that the Superman was real and he's American.
*  I said that God was real and he's American.
*  And if that doesn't give you like religious, like fear, then like you're not,
*  then you're just not human.
*  Like you gotta like, it's okay.
*  It's okay to be scared.
*  Right.
*  Cause it's fucking scary.
*  Yeah.
*  He's real.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a scary thing.
*  It's very scary thing, but it's, it's cool.
*  But when you have these ideas and you have all this work and then it comes
*  together, I mean, that's gotta be insanely satisfying to watching a scene like that.
*  It is.
*  It's a cool, like I guess for me, you know, like that, the process of like putting
*  it together and then like when you, when it literally lands and you, and it's what
*  you drew and it's what you thought and the music and everything like lands, it
*  really, it is, there is a like, I mean, I'm sure it's like anything.
*  It's probably like the same thing, like doing standup or whatever.
*  Like when you, when like it all, when you're grooving, when you're in the groove
*  with it and it's just happening, you're kind of surfing it and you're like, God,
*  this is the, this is the feeling right here.
*  Right.
*  Like you can't acknowledge it in the moment, but you can feel it.
*  It can push you, you know, like it's like a wave, you know, and you can feel it.
*  It's the, that's how it is.
*  You know, for me, it's, it's such a long process, you know, it's, it's not
*  instant gratification, you know, it's a very, it's like, you really have to have
*  like a head down mentality to get it to that position because, you know, but I do,
*  when I watch it that first time and it comes back and I'm like, yeah, that's,
*  that's like fucking, that's, that's what we, that's the why of it right there.
*  You know, and I think that that keeps me going, frankly, you know, that little,
*  that little high is, is really, it's really fun.
*  Well, that's the goal, right?
*  The goal is to create that.
*  And that high people leave a film like that.
*  That's like, there's, you'll do things that you wouldn't have ordinarily do.
*  Like you'll, you'll maybe you'll be inspired.
*  Maybe you'll start working on something.
*  Maybe there's certain things.
*  And I've that, I think that's the beauty of creation in a lot of ways.
*  This is not just escapism, but it gives you, it's like a drug.
*  It gives you this like boost of excitement that often leads to inspiration.
*  It inspires you to action.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  I feel like that, that if you can do that, then your movie's like, yeah,
*  yeah, it's a huge success.
*  If one guy comes up to me, like the thing about Man of Steel that I, that I've always,
*  that I felt like is that Man of Steel is the movie that the people will come up to
*  me and say, like that movie changed my life.
*  Like that movie, like, you know, like I thought it was about me, you know, like
*  I'm an immigrant, like I just saw myself in, in Superman.
*  It's like really like, you know, I was struggling at the time.
*  And when I saw it, I like, and I'm not just be like, man, that's so cool.
*  Like I'm, I'm so grateful that like, you know, you felt that way about the movie.
*  Cause I don't, you know, like for me, it's like, I send it off into the world.
*  You think about like Netflix, for instance, where like you push a button and like,
*  you know, rebel moon, right.
*  The zeitgeist is crazy because like rebel moon.
*  So say right now there's like, it's like almost 90 million views, right?
*  80, 90 million people, 90 million starts.
*  So, or 90 million accounts said, turned it on.
*  Okay.
*  Give or take.
*  They assume two viewers per screening, right?
*  That's the kind of math.
*  Right.
*  Math.
*  So you think if that movie was in the theater as a distribution model, so that's a
*  hundred and 60 million account or people supposedly watching based on that math.
*  So 160 million people at $10 a ticket would be what, what is that math?
*  I don't know.
*  160, 160 million times 10.
*  That's 1.6 billion.
*  You know, so like you look at the view numbers,
*  you sort of, you can use that rough, you know, so more people probably saw rebel
*  moon than saw Barbie in the theater, right?
*  That's how crazy Netflix, that's how, that's how that's the distribution
*  model that they've set up.
*  You know, I was like, I was at this thing the other day and we were talking about
*  rebel moon two and I said, and they were like, well, talk about rebel moon one.
*  I'm like, no, like go and watch it.
*  I know you have it at your house.
*  Like don't like, it's not like a theater situation.
*  You could like turn it on your phone right now and watch it like right here if you
*  wanted, like that's how crazy it is.
*  I'm like, you know, like that it's so this model, this machine they built is
*  really something else is really crazy.
*  If you think about it, just like we were saying about the formula one, like they're
*  able to like insert something into popular culture that's so like a deep cut,
*  like a documentary about formula one.
*  How else do you get that to the people?
*  Right.
*  No way.
*  No way.
*  No way.
*  You, you released that in the theater.
*  Five people go, you know, literally five people go.
*  Yeah.
*  But like put it on TV and like a hundred million people see it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's strange.
*  It's interesting because it shows that there was an audience there.
*  It's just like to get someone to go out of their house and buy a ticket.
*  That's just too much of a tough sell.
*  It's a different model.
*  It's a different model.
*  And it's weird how they think about it.
*  When you think about it in those terms that you give the audience a, a, an
*  alternative, like you give them a chance to like go on this, you know, like rebel
*  moon's like, okay, that's new IP, right?
*  No one knows what the fuck that is.
*  What's a rebel moon?
*  Some space thing, I guess.
*  Like, okay, well let's watch it.
*  You know, it's that the barrier for entry is so low that it allows, I think what's
*  cool is it allows a lot more original and weirdo stuff to exist because, you
*  know, especially like you think about the director's cut of rebel moon, which will
*  be, if it was in theaters, a very boutiquey concept, right?
*  Very singular.
*  It's like the animated version of heavy metal.
*  Like, you know, I, the movie I'm like, you know, I'm a huge fan, but like not a
*  lot of people have seen it where I feel like this is a chance where like, when
*  this movie is released, the amount of people that can lay eyes on it is crazy
*  compared to what it would be, you know, in another, if I was releasing it, say
*  theatrically or whatever, you know, it's a three hour movie, both of them are
*  three hours.
*  So it's much different.
*  Like both the PG 13s are two hours, right?
*  That was one of the things that we talked about also.
*  Like I want the movie short PG, right?
*  That's the, that's kind of the prerequisite where I'm like on the, on the
*  R rated version, it's like, there's no rules.
*  Like it's, it's like, no, no, there's no, there's no expectations, no rules, no
*  nothing like you get that's that experience is a completely different
*  experience.
*  And when does that one come out?
*  It comes at the end of summer.
*  The end of summer.
*  I wanted, I want enough time.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably right in there.
*  I want, we don't have an exact date, but like some, somewhere I wanted enough time
*  so that I didn't want to be, I don't want them to be too attached to the PG version.
*  Cause I love them.
*  By the way, like I said, I'm proud of the PG version.
*  I think it's fun.
*  I think when you see rebel moon two on April 19th, you will see a very, a war
*  movie.
*  It's a fucking war movie is what it is.
*  Like, cause like the first thing is like gather the team.
*  Second movie is a war movie.
*  The, the R rated version is just a different journey.
*  Like you just get there in a different way and it's just more, like I said,
*  it's just more weird.
*  It's more boutiquey and more bizarre and more like the original, more like heavy
*  metal.
*  Heavy metal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The original genre.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  More like a genre you could, you can't really pitch a studio, a live action,
*  heavy metal movie right now.
*  It's just not a, I don't know how to do that.
*  I don't know how you'd make that, you know, unless you are willing to do some sort
*  of song and dance, you know, which is, which I'm, I, I think that as a product,
*  like I said, I'm proud of it.
*  And I think it works for what they've generated because like basically for the
*  same price as two movies, right.
*  They get four movies, which is pretty, that's pretty crazy, you know, because
*  the director's cuts for what, for the hour, additional hour and extra stuff that
*  we did inside of each of those movies.
*  Each of the movies is an hour longer.
*  What we did inside those movies with tone and with gore and sex and all that
*  stuff within the same framework, you're getting two entirely different movies.
*  It's not like extended version, you know, like that, I, that'd be like, okay,
*  whatever, you know, like, oh, you did an extra like weird little, here's the
*  thing you cut out that you thought was too long.
*  It's not like that at all.
*  Like, you know, it's just a lot more, I don't know.
*  It's just true to the vision.
*  Yeah.
*  It's got balls.
*  It's got a lot of balls.
*  And is that, I mean, that's gotta be this thing where you're waiting, like
*  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I want you to see the real thing.
*  I don't think, you know, it's a weird thing.
*  Cause I, I don't think, I mean, look, it's a, it's a, it's an, it's up to the
*  viewers, you know, in a lot of ways.
*  I don't want to like, by no means am I saying that you can't watch both.
*  For sure.
*  You can.
*  It's a, it's really, it's really how you do it.
*  I feel like if you've seen PG 13 rebel moon part one, you should see PG 13 part
*  two, because they're really closely related.
*  I mean, they're like, it's a direct, you know, like you it's, it could be one movie.
*  You could cut them together literally and just keep going where it's chapter two.
*  It's part two.
*  It's like a, where I feel like that in the R rated experience, it's just like a
*  different, they're both going to release on the same day so you can just fucking
*  binge it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the way to do it too.
*  With Netflix.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things I love about Netflix is when I don't find out about something
*  until like two or three seasons in.
*  I'm like, yes, 100%.
*  Like I can, yes, it's.
*  17 episodes.
*  It's the same muscle that made me play Fortnite for like six months.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you, if you have the time and a good series is bingeable, God, so satisfying.
*  It's so satisfying.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we could do another.
*  That's what I always say to my wife.
*  I'm like, how do you feel?
*  And she's like, I feel good.
*  Are you sleepy?
*  No, let's go.
*  Have you ever thought about doing like a Netflix series, like something that's so
*  big that you couldn't do in one or two films?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We've talked about it a lot.
*  Like, um, I mean, nobody wants fountainhead, but that's what I wanted to do.
*  You know, I pitched him fountainhead cause like, I'm a, you know, I'm a, I've
*  written this super adaptation of the, of that book and, um, I just think it's.
*  I think it would be amazing, but you know, no one wants to make it cause they
*  think it's like, you know, it's, it's taboo.
*  I and ran is taboo.
*  Well, why is she taboo?
*  I don't know.
*  She's taboo among the intelligentsia because like they think she's a fascist
*  and they think the books of fascist propaganda piece of fascist propaganda.
*  I, I, that's not why I liked the book.
*  I I'm like, look, you know, I happen to just like it because it, it's, to me,
*  it's a direct comment on making a movie, right?
*  It's a movie about an architect who won't make the buildings that
*  everyone wants him to make.
*  And like what the struggle he goes through to get the buildings made
*  the way he wants to make them.
*  It, of course I like that, you know, like no movie director.
*  I I'm sure there's plenty of movie directors that don't like fountainhead,
*  but I just think that it just has, it says so much.
*  I and ran wrote fountainhead in direct response to being noted on a script
*  that she had written and she, she had been studying, um, this movie about
*  skyscrapers and they told her she kept submitting versions of the script and
*  they kept noting her noting her until it was unrecognizable.
*  And then she was like, this is what happens to a Pete, to like, you know,
*  to work, you know, it gets noted too.
*  Into like, till it's disintegrates into the spheres.
*  And so, yeah, so that was, that's one thing I had that I, that I've always
*  wanted to do, but I don't know that I'm ever, I don't know that there
*  were the world will allow that.
*  I don't know why it's, it's one of those weird things where iron brand is,
*  she's connected to like in cells or, you know, like angry white guys or like
*  finance people that are cruel.
*  It's this very strange jobs.
*  His favorite book, by the way.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  That is interesting.
*  But it's one of those things where it's like, if you hear that, like, I'm, I'm
*  an iron ran fan, you're like, oh, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  You're one of those guys.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Bitcoin too.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You know, it's true.
*  But it's funny because look, and I get, by the way, Alice shrugged.
*  Fair.
*  You know, you can play with that.
*  That's a game that I, I mean, I, I'm pretty exclusively a Fountainhead
*  fanatic and for that also because it's, it's melodrama too.
*  Like it's the most melodramatic thing ever.
*  I mean, as far as just like, why won't Netflix let you do that?
*  I feel like they should.
*  I just, I feel like I think it would have a huge, well, again, I think I
*  know it would work.
*  I know it would work.
*  I know it would work too.
*  Yeah.
*  Why don't fuck come on Netflix.
*  Let's go.
*  Well, I'm a fan of letting artists like yourself do what is their vision, you
*  know, and I think people are often wrong about whether or not something is going
*  to be successful commercially or whether or not it's going to resonate with a
*  lot of other people.
*  But that's the thing that no one knows.
*  Like that's the awesome thing about movies is like, and, and why, you know,
*  I'm not that worried about the AI influence over motion picture because
*  there's obviously no formula.
*  No one can predict what's going to be successful or they would have gotten rid
*  of the directors and writers a long time ago, you know, like it's still, there's
*  alchemy, there's still magic.
*  There's still like an impossible, like, you know, all these elements come
*  together and you're like, you feel something and you're like, what?
*  That was cool.
*  Fuck, you know, and it's the thing like, who knows, you know, it's like, you
*  know, anything, you know, that, that you see that maybe if someone described it
*  to you in an abstract, you'd be like, that sounds dumb.
*  Like, I know.
*  And then you sit and you watch it and you experience it moment by moment and you
*  feel it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's fucking cool.
*  Well, it's also, I think there's always going to be a thing that people resonate
*  with where they know it's made by a person.
*  They know that artists thoughts were involved in the creation of this
*  thing. This is the vision.
*  They work tirelessly to produce this and they put it out and they're proud of it.
*  Here it is.
*  And there's something about that that you're, you're getting to take in another
*  human beings, a group of human beings creation.
*  And that, that means something to us.
*  And I think it's always going to mean something to us.
*  I think there's going to be AI songs and AI movies and AI art and it's going to
*  be cool, but it's not going to be as cool because it's not going to be from a
*  human.
*  Correct.
*  From human beings.
*  And I do feel like the, the fingerprints, the squishy fingerprints on the thing
*  are the thing that make it like unbelievably cool.
*  Chisel marks.
*  Yeah.
*  I want the chisel marks.
*  I love them.
*  I live for them.
*  Like to me, that's the bit, like the best movies, my favorite movies, the best
*  movies are where you can feel the hand of the filmmaker.
*  Yes.
*  Like I want that.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't want, I do not want the movie made by committee.
*  Right.
*  You know, you vote.
*  You, when you, when you go to a movie that, that is, that feels like it was made
*  in the boardroom, like I feel dirty when I watch that.
*  I don't like it.
*  I'm like, I don't want the cold hand of marketing on me like that.
*  You know, I want to like, that's why I love the, you know, like the weirdness,
*  you know, like I feel like in the end, all my movies are just a little bit weird
*  in, in, in a good way.
*  Like, you know, 300 for whatever it's like all the like, you know, kind of like
*  coolness of it as far as like, yeah, let's go fight.
*  It's still a weirdo movie.
*  You know, like the way it's made.
*  You're putting a bunch of gay stuff in there.
*  Well, you know, I just, it's Frank's book.
*  You know, I wrote it.
*  I wrote, I made what Frank wrote now in retrospect.
*  Um, and we, we've been talking about doing a series where I really wanted to
*  like introduce those concepts a lot more because I just feel like it's important
*  in, in, if we go forward and do like more in the 300 universe, I would want to
*  bring that part in and let people, which I think just shakes it up again.
*  Like, you're like, what?
*  Like right when you thought you knew, like how to feel like I'm going to
*  make you feel like another way.
*  People have always said like, you know, 300, you know, people have accused me
*  of being like homophobic or whatever.
*  And I'm like, I don't know.
*  They just somehow they feel like that.
*  Because the Spartans weren't doing gay stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Or because they, you know, there's that one line where he says, you know, um, uh,
*  philosophers and boy lovers, but like, I, I think that that he's clearly being
*  cheeky Leonidas because like I, I of course, I was hyper aware at the time
*  that the reality of Spartan culture was the, was like, he's obviously out.
*  He, he means philosophies and boy lovers, not like he, he's using that maybe as a
*  derogatory comment, but when in reality he's a lover of men, probably, you know?
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  And so like, I just think that like, as we talked about, like, as, as we go
*  forward, I would love to like, just kind of stress and just like I said, like,
*  look, 300, you know, in some ways is like one of the gayest movies ever made.
*  You know, like it's, it, it, it is incredibly male centric, male obsessed,
*  you know, like you really feel like very strong male energy from the movie, even
*  though there's a strong lead, you know, Gorgos, an incredibly strong female
*  character and we wrote her and made her like, he doesn't decide to kick the person
*  messenger into the well without getting approval from, from Gorgos because, you
*  know, he's like, I'm going to burn it down.
*  Is that cool?
*  And she's like, go do it, you know?
*  And he's like, all right, here we go.
*  And, you know, he, he, this is Sparta is that guy and that's like, uh, that was
*  that, that, and I, and I just think, but I just think that like, you know, and
*  maybe that was just me understanding, doing the research and understanding the
*  reality of Spartan culture, that I really, that energy was in there because I just
*  felt like it was important, you know, to, to make sure that it was, you know, that
*  there was this kind of visceral sexuality to the way the men actually
*  interacted, you know, that was there.
*  I mean, regardless of whether you acknowledge it, it's there, you know,
*  that would be, but, but it wasn't acknowledged really in the film.
*  Like if anybody didn't know the history of the Spartans, they wouldn't know.
*  No, no, I, I, but I just feel, I just mean from sort of an iconic standpoint, as
*  far as like the, the, the, the, there's just sort of indulgence in the male form,
*  you know, it's very, it's very, it's not, it's not casual.
*  Right.
*  If you have to be fascinating to see if you did do a series and you had them
*  behave the way Spartans actually did the reaction.
*  Yeah, it'd be interesting.
*  I think that hopefully we'll find out one day and that'd be fun.
*  Yeah, that would be fun.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, I mean, like, look, in the end, it's a, it's a weirdo.
*  It's a weirdo show, you know, like it just, it's fun to enjoy it.
*  It's fun to fuck with it.
*  You know, like that's what we do.
*  Like that's, you got to tear it apart a little bit to like, take a look at it.
*  You got to know, you know,
*  When you choose things to do today, how do you go about doing it?
*  Do you, do you just sit with an idea and bring it to studios?
*  Do they come to you?
*  Do you, how do you choose what you?
*  I don't develop.
*  I kind of have a bunch of stuff.
*  I've always had a bunch of stuff that I work on and I just go, I want to do this.
*  And then whoever wants to do it, then they, they, we do it.
*  And I mean, it is, it's an awesome position and I appreciate it.
*  And I don't, I don't take it for granted.
*  You know, there's a few things like I've always been obsessed with.
*  Richard Bach, I don't know if you know, like there's a, he has this book called
*  illusions that I've owned for a long time and I've always wanted to do.
*  You know, I grew up as a Christian scientist and I, you know, I.
*  Isn't that a book about like channeling?
*  Well, illusions is about this.
*  It's a book about this guy flying his spy plane around in the 1970s.
*  And he lands in a, in a, in a pasture.
*  Cause like in the seventies you, well, he was part of this sort of, he would fly
*  his biplane around, land in a pasture and then sell rides for $3, like for 10
*  minutes, and that's how he lived.
*  Right.
*  He's just a gypsy pilot flying around the Midwest.
*  And he happens to come across this guy who also is flying a biplane, who happens
*  to be like a Messiah, who happens to be like this super spiritually advanced dude
*  who's on the run from, he doesn't want to be the Messiah.
*  He's like, he's like, it's a, it's called illusions.
*  The adventures of a reluctant Messiah.
*  And it's about the two of them spending a summer together.
*  Just the one guy teaching him about like, it's a shit job being the Messiah.
*  Like don't, don't do it.
*  Cause you know what happens to the Messiah is in the end.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  He goes, do you always have to die a violent death?
*  And he goes, yeah, I don't think always.
*  And he's like, really?
*  He goes, yeah, you know what?
*  It's cool for like, he goes, what about just a quiet little ascension, you know,
*  just on the side and he's like, yeah, I don't think that I don't think the
*  universe will let that happen.
*  You know, so it's a cool, so it's this really cool.
*  Again, it's like this sort of, it's again, like a spiritual deconstructivist,
*  like Messiah story.
*  And I just like, I've always, it was like this book when I was growing up.
*  I just, in a lot of ways it's, it's religious philosophy is similar to Christian
*  science.
*  So I superimposed my religious beliefs onto this book and I felt like it kind
*  of spoke to my doubts and my questions about my religious upbringing and like
*  what I thought for real, like my brother.
*  So my brother passed away when I was 13, he got in a car accident and he was like
*  this incredibly spiritual dude.
*  Everyone, like anyone who knew my brother was like, that guy was the guy.
*  He was the man.
*  Like, you know, Sam Snyder was like among his peer group was like, he was like,
*  you know, in retrospect, like he was in a Tai Chi and like just like super
*  cool seventies dude, right?
*  Like just kind of looked like Billy Crudup, right?
*  Like Billy Crudup from like, you know, almost famous, right?
*  Imagine that guy, like, but just like the coolest guys, you know, smoking dope,
*  just being cool as hell.
*  So when he passed away, I always thought like, okay, my brother just like tired
*  of this world and went looking for another one, you know, like he was just
*  like on a spiritual journey.
*  But then like when you see, when you're 13 and you see like what that event
*  though does to your family, your mother and father, you know, your sister, all
*  of their friends, like the devastation that they feel.
*  And these are people that I believed, believed in the religion that I believed
*  in and the pain, like it made me really go like, what the fuck?
*  Like, is this what's real?
*  Like what, like what are we supposed to believe?
*  You know, it really tested me.
*  And I think that illusions that book in retrospect, and I won't spoil or alert.
*  I won't tell you what happens on the last page of the book, but it, it kind
*  of speaks to where I was and I, and I think, so it's always resonated with me.
*  And I'm friends with Richard Bach.
*  I became friends with him and his wife is constantly texting me like, when
*  are we making illusions?
*  And I was like, soon, soon.
*  She's like, I found the planes, you know, so it's, it's cool.
*  Like we have the planes, we can make it anytime.
*  So yeah, standing.
*  So those are kind of, that's how we develop.
*  Like it's all these things that I have, you know, that are kind of close to me
*  that I am always constantly saying, what about that?
*  We should, maybe it's time.
*  That's awesome, dude.
*  Well, listen, it's been great to talk to you.
*  I really appreciate what you've done.
*  I love how excited you are about filmmaking.
*  And you've done some awesome shit, man.
*  You should be proud.
*  I appreciate it.
*  I'd appreciate it.
*  I look, man, I'm a fan of the show and, you know, it's a, it's an honor to come on and talk to you.
*  Thank you.
*  It's an honor to have you.
*  Cheers.
*  All right.
*  Bye everybody.
*  Thanks.
