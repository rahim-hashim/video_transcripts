# Joe Rogan Experience #1958 - Andrew Huberman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5.8s)]
*  Every now and then, pizza is good for you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=12.4s)]
*  What is your schedule as far as like, do you allow yourself bad food every now and then? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=14.92s)]
*  My vices in the food department are croissants. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=22.92s)]
*  The thing is, that hits the dopamine button and it's all about more. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=26.200000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I can sink five of those things. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Chocolate croissants are my jam. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=34.08s)]
*  Oh really? I don't adulterate my croissants. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=36.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=38.64s)]
*  No, maybe extra butter. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  For me, it's all the savory stuff. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=40.6s)]
*  Savory salty, so it's croissants every once in a while. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  Have you had a chocolate croissant? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=45.2s)]
*  I have. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=47.72s)]
*  Pretty goddamn good. You like them? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=48.72s)]
*  I'm gonna say I'm all butter. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  Really? Butter's nice. Butter's nice. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  I think the all butter for me justifies having three or four. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=54.16s)]
*  When I lived in New York, I used to love buttered bagels or buttered rolls. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  They do not have that out here for some strange reason. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  It's like a common thing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  If you go to like a deli in New York, they always had buttered rolls. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  It was like just a roll with a lot of butter on it and people would eat that with coffee. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=72.36s)]
*  Out here, they don't have that for some strange reason. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  Or in LA, they don't have it either. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=79.52s)]
*  I like how in New York, when you get a soda, even at a little 7-Eleven type place, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=81.12s)]
*  they offer you a straw. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  It's one of the last civilized things in life to be offered a straw. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=87.48s)]
*  You know what I saw? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  There's a chart. See if you could find this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=92.92s)]
*  You know how we're supposed to be not using plastic straws anymore because turtles are dying? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  You know that people give you paper straws? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=102.12s)]
*  I remember the six pack container, those plastic things, and you see the soup bowl thing around. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=105.44s)]
*  Like the turtle where it constricted his shell. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=109.92s)]
*  Have you ever seen that one? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=112.72s)]
*  Like it got around a turtle when he was little and as he grew, the shell became like an hourglass. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=114.08s)]
*  It was really gross. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  But there was this chart of the countries in the world that pollute the ocean the most. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=121.12s)]
*  And it's fucking stunning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=128.16s)]
*  And if we stop using plastic straws, we're not going to put a fucking dent in it unless they do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=132.2s)]
*  Like we're not even close to number one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=137.52s)]
*  We're not even close to number six. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=139.36s)]
*  Like the leading countries that pollute the ocean, I think number one was Philippines. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  I was going to say Southeast. Why would Southeast Asia have that issue? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  I would imagine that when people are very poor, the last thing they're concerned about is not polluting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=152.28s)]
*  I would think that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  I've seen those images of those giant icebergs of plastic junk. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  And I always hope that's not real. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=165.96s)]
*  Oh, it's real. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Boyon Slott is a gentleman who's been on the podcast before, has developed this device for... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=169.04s)]
*  It's like it sifts the ocean. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  It floats over the top of the ocean and it has this collector that sucks up plastic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=178.6s)]
*  And then they take that plastic and use it and recycle it and make like eyeglasses out of it and all sorts of other different things. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  OK. So number one is China. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=193.64s)]
*  By a wide margin. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=195.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=198.84s)]
*  Countries polluting the oceans the most, annual metric tons of mismanaged plastic waste and total amount ending up in global waters. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=199.44s)]
*  This is fucking insane. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=207.96s)]
*  So China is 8.80 metric tons. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=209.88s)]
*  Indonesia is number two with 3.2. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=215.64s)]
*  Philippines is number three with 1.9. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  You go all the way down, the United States is 0.30. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=221.68s)]
*  Well, China's got no excuse because their GDP is way up there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=225.48s)]
*  They could actually manage it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  But some of these other countries, as you mentioned, are definitely lower GDP relative to the United States and China. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=229.56s)]
*  Right. For sure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  Like, yeah, definitely like Malaysia and Nigeria. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=236.04s)]
*  But China's got no excuse. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=241.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Some of that them buying our stuff, though, don't we sell our trash? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  We buy it from them, bro. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, oh, trash. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. They take it and then we're like, here, you deal with it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=250.32s)]
*  I've heard of that happening. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=253.48s)]
*  Not to a gigantic extent like that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=254.72s)]
*  I don't know about. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=256.36s)]
*  Right. For waste management, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=257.24s)]
*  Yeah. Like they might have a company that handles that, perhaps. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=259.48s)]
*  I mean, but also they produce so many plastic things. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=263.08s)]
*  I mean, think about the amount of things that are plastic that are produced in China. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=266.04s)]
*  That's pretty extraordinary. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=269.2s)]
*  I remember for a while there was a discussion about kids toys with the coloring and the toxins in plastics. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=270.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=277.56s)]
*  You know, I guess I don't know if we're going to go there because we might as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=279.8s)]
*  Right. OK. Well, you know, it's interesting for starting 2019. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=284.24s)]
*  I started posting things on Instagram. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=287.6s)]
*  That's how I got my stuff out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=289.12s)]
*  Then I was going on podcasts. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=290.12s)]
*  Now we have the podcast. Right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=291.04s)]
*  But I stayed off Twitter largely until this last year when I started putting a lot of stuff there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=292.52s)]
*  So you put stuff there, you start reading stuff there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=296.88s)]
*  Oh, no. And then well, what's been really interesting to me is I followed this whole lab leak thing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=299.04s)]
*  Right. Because early in the pandemic, people in my field started chattering about that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=303.72s)]
*  I was very I love exotic animals not to own them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=310.32s)]
*  Right. But I'm really interested in animal conservation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=313.24s)]
*  And so the Pangolin is an amazing animal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  They pinned it on the Pangolin early on. Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=318.32s)]
*  And there were articles published in good journals, several of which I'm on the editorial board for. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=320.44s)]
*  So early in the pandemic, there were papers coming out really fast about, you know, the sequence of the virus in Pangolins, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=324.76s)]
*  which were being sold in the Wuhan market, et cetera. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  And I was pretty disturbed by this mostly because of the pictures of the Wuhan market. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=334.04s)]
*  The exotic animal trade is just it's it's horrible. Right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=338.6s)]
*  Yeah. OK. Close confinement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=341.96s)]
*  You know, these are beautiful animals that there's no justification for this stuff. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=344.6s)]
*  But Pangolin meat is sold at I forget what it is per pound, but it's sold. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=348.04s)]
*  It's a delicacy and it's considered very lucrative. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=351.36s)]
*  And to get Pangolin meat of all things, there's actually a female Pangolin meat [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=354.0s)]
*  influencer on YouTube and oh, yeah, no, it's like it's it starts to look like Pangolin meat ASMR. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=360.52s)]
*  It's crazy and disgusting. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=367.8s)]
*  So they're kind of mixing, you know, sexy women with exotic meats from these rare animals. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=369.68s)]
*  It's just awful. So I was going deep down this rabbit hole of trying to understand this exotic animal trade. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=375.44s)]
*  And then and then there was chatter in my field about the fact that one of the members of the laboratory in Wuhan [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=380.68s)]
*  that was working with these very high restriction viruses had done her training in the United States, which is true, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=388.08s)]
*  had had has a master's degree but was running a laboratory, which is unusual. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=395.8s)]
*  Right. Typically, the head of a laboratory is someone with a PhD, MD or both. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  Very rare for a so-called PI, a principal investigator like like me or, you know, another [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=404.76s)]
*  Matt Walker, for instance, principal investigator to have less than a PhD. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=411.28s)]
*  The fact that she ran a lab or was important in running this lab as a masters with only a masters is unusual. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  And then there was a lot of chatter in my field about the the idea that it might have something to do with the fact that her significant other was a member of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=423.88s)]
*  And so, you know, that laboratory had deep ties to government and vice versa. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's true of all laboratories in China, all laboratories. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  So the whole notion of the lab leak hypothesis was not foreign to scientists like me. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you know, my laboratory works with rabies viruses, adenoviruses, sinbis viruses. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=447.24s)]
*  None of these are are as biohazardous as something like the coronavirus. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=452.76s)]
*  But you work with these viruses and you have to use lab coats, gloves, bleach sterilization. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=458.08s)]
*  You're careful, you know, hoods of prop. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=462.76s)]
*  But human error happens. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=465.4s)]
*  So I'm not at all convinced one way or the other that it was a deliberate leak. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=467.12s)]
*  But the idea that it would leak from a laboratory to a scientist like me who has what's called a wet lab where you, you know, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  with solutions and beakers and things that sort things happen all the time, not in my laboratory. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=476.4s)]
*  We're very careful and everyone's checked up on often. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=481.4s)]
*  The idea that human error could cause this is like it was an of course to all scientists. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=484.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, they have been cited in 2018 for violating safety protocols. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, all it takes is, you know, people might not be familiar with the pipetting is, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=493.67999999999995s)]
*  but it's basically taking a little straw that sucks up, you know, press a button. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=497.12s)]
*  It sucks up some fluid. You move things, you know, between little little tiny vials can be done by robots, too. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=500.67999999999995s)]
*  But typically it's done by humans. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=506.12s)]
*  And that's how they put in a center for you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=507.56s)]
*  Spin it, take off a little piece of that or take the pellet out of the bottom that spun down this kind of thing. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=509.08s)]
*  All it takes is one loose thumb and it's on a lab coat. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=513.76s)]
*  All it takes is that lab coat going on a rack. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=517.84s)]
*  All it takes is somebody leaving work, putting their lab coat on there and touching that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=519.52s)]
*  It's out in the world. Like, it's not that complicated. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  So it doesn't have to be that somebody had a plan to let this out. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=527.28s)]
*  It could be. I don't have any knowledge of that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=531.64s)]
*  But the idea that it would come from a lab to me is far more plausible than the idea that it came from some [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=533.7199999999999s)]
*  Pangolin sequence in the Wuhan market. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=538.56s)]
*  So I think we were going down the wrong path on this for a long time. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=541.04s)]
*  And I thought this is kind of bananas. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=544.76s)]
*  And now everyone's so shocked. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=546.92s)]
*  It's like, I think to people who work in biomedical research, of course, this sort of thing could happen. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  Of course, because human error is the cause of most of these kinds of things. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=553.64s)]
*  Well, it was very clear that there was a concerted effort to dismiss the idea that it came from a lab. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't logical and it wasn't scientific. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=562.24s)]
*  And they ignored all the evidence that seemed to point that it originated from that lab, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=564.72s)]
*  including the people that worked in that lab who got sick. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=572.0s)]
*  And now there's some new stupid story in The New York Times about a raccoon dog. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  They're saying it might have come from a raccoon dog. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=580.2s)]
*  The civet? Is that the... [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=582.24s)]
*  No, no, no. So it's some sort of a raccoon dog. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=584.6s)]
*  A civet is actually a cat. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=587.84s)]
*  It's like a ferret type thing, right? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=589.2s)]
*  A civet is like in the cat family, I believe. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=590.88s)]
*  And that's where you get Kopi Luwak coffee from. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, from the poop of the civet. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=596.76s)]
*  Have you ever had it? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=598.68s)]
*  Oh, it's the Luwak coffee. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=599.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's actually very good. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=600.8s)]
*  Yeah, when I was a postdoc, there was... [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=602.28s)]
*  So this is it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=604.24s)]
*  That's the raccoon dog. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=605.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=606.28s)]
*  That one doesn't eat coffee beans. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=606.72s)]
*  I don't think so. Maybe it does. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=609.08s)]
*  It's a member of the canid family. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=610.96s)]
*  It's also... [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=612.8s)]
*  It's a beautiful animal. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=613.96s)]
*  Let's go back to where you were. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=614.64s)]
*  A group that also includes domestic dogs [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  and the only member that hibernates. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=619.52s)]
*  Oh wow, they hibernate. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=620.92s)]
*  Interesting. But here's the problem. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=623.16s)]
*  Sager and Jetty was actually explaining this to me [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=625.4799999999999s)]
*  on Saturday night. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=628.28s)]
*  He was like, there's direct evidence of people [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  being infected that predates this establishment [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=634.4s)]
*  of this animal testing positive in that wet market. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=640.0s)]
*  So I guess people were eating that animal. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=644.64s)]
*  Is that the idea? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=646.52s)]
*  But many months before that, people were sick from this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=648.16s)]
*  Like this is... [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=651.88s)]
*  What was this in? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=652.72s)]
*  I believe it was in December of 2019. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=653.72s)]
*  Is that what they're saying? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=656.28s)]
*  November or December of 2019. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  And it was March 2020 when everything kind of blasted, right? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=660.4s)]
*  Yeah, but it was September or August of 2019 [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=663.92s)]
*  when the first people were infected. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=668.24s)]
*  So it predates it by a considerable amount. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=669.8s)]
*  I think the Lab Leak hypothesis is far more plausible. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=672.92s)]
*  Well, the Furman cleavage site, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=675.88s)]
*  this thing that they've established [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=677.36s)]
*  that it seems to indicate that this virus was manipulated. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=679.56s)]
*  Like this is the Furan cleavage site, excuse me. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=682.48s)]
*  Yeah, there are two, you know, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=686.16s)]
*  we hear about gain of function research [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=687.12s)]
*  and now everyone associates gain of function [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=688.64s)]
*  with gain of function of this particular virus. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=690.32s)]
*  But gain of function research happens all the time [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=692.84s)]
*  in essentially every laboratory in the US and abroad [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=695.72s)]
*  that does mouse genetics. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=698.6s)]
*  You knock out a gene and you ask what happens to this animal [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=700.44s)]
*  in the absence of a gene. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=704.28s)]
*  And then you knock it in and you see if it replaces that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=705.48s)]
*  Because in humans, human genetics is only loss of function. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=708.4s)]
*  You don't have the option yet. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=710.96s)]
*  CRISPR will allow this to put things back in [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=712.6s)]
*  that are missing. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=716.0s)]
*  And so gain of function research is extremely common. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=717.04s)]
*  But we do it in my... [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=719.8000000000001s)]
*  We're no longer working on animals to be clear. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=721.16s)]
*  We only do human studies now, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=722.88s)]
*  but this is something that you're trained to do [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=724.96s)]
*  as a postdoc. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=727.48s)]
*  Everyone learns loss of function, gain of function. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=728.32s)]
*  You need to do both. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=729.88s)]
*  You know, the gain of function, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=731.08s)]
*  actually there is that one CRISPR experiments [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=732.44s)]
*  beginning of interesting science out of China. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=734.32s)]
*  A guy, he actually was a postdoc at Stanford, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=736.36s)]
*  worked for a guy named Steve Quake, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=739.6400000000001s)]
*  and then separately on his own without permission [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  or anything from Stanford, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=743.48s)]
*  went off and started his own laboratory in China. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=744.96s)]
*  And stood up at a meeting a few years ago and said, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  he had done CRISPR in human babies. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=749.5200000000001s)]
*  This has been done. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he was arrested for this, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=752.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he mutated the HIV receptor, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=754.6400000000001s)]
*  which everyone thinks, okay, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=757.12s)]
*  that was designed to prevent these babies from getting HIV. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=758.6s)]
*  It turns out that that mutation is thought to perhaps [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=761.72s)]
*  enhance memory by sort of parallel mechanisms. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=764.36s)]
*  And then it was very unclear for a short while [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=768.28s)]
*  whether or not this guy was either gonna get a Nobel Prize [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=770.96s)]
*  or that they were gonna throw him in jail. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  And so everyone is very tense and waiting in my community [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=775.32s)]
*  thinking, okay, because when somebody's kind of up [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=778.0s)]
*  for a big discovery like this, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=780.52s)]
*  everyone kind of circles maybe wanting, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=782.2s)]
*  that maybe they should be involved in getting the accolades. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=784.4s)]
*  But the moment that the international community, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=787.36s)]
*  I think rightfully so, said, this is horrible. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=793.24s)]
*  There's no ethics committee. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  You need to think about what you're doing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=794.9599999999999s)]
*  Everyone was like, I had nothing to do with this guy. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=796.6s)]
*  I never had anything. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=798.48s)]
*  And there was a deep excavation of emails and all sorts of, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  everyone was like, I got nothing to do with this guy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=801.64s)]
*  So it was pretty interesting. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=803.4s)]
*  Then China said, oh, we're gonna punish him. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=804.4s)]
*  But I'd be willing to bet both hands [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=806.9599999999999s)]
*  that his punishment consists of a jail cell [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  that is pretty luxurious with a laboratory. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  There's no question that CRISPR is going on there. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=815.72s)]
*  CRISPR is going on in certain regions of, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=818.44s)]
*  other locations on the globe [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  where things aren't as regulated [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=825.6s)]
*  because think about the potential payoff [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=826.84s)]
*  for being able to rescue a Huntington's mutation, right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=828.7600000000001s)]
*  A Huntington's Korea mutation [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=832.36s)]
*  that has somebody at some point in their life, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=834.0s)]
*  but unable to control their arms, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=836.24s)]
*  hemi-bolismus of the arms. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=840.6s)]
*  Huntington's disease. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=841.96s)]
*  It's a deterioration of the parts of the brain [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  that control motor function. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=845.12s)]
*  The parts of the brain that control motor function [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=847.04s)]
*  have two main pathways. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=848.44s)]
*  One is a go pathway, like reach for this coffee mug. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=849.84s)]
*  And the other one is a no-go pathway resisting movement. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=852.36s)]
*  And the no-go pathway degenerates substantially. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=854.84s)]
*  Other things too. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=857.24s)]
*  And people with Huntington's Korea [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=858.12s)]
*  end up with these writhing ballistic movements [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=859.52s)]
*  and it's an inherited disease. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=862.04s)]
*  So you know what gene, it's the Huntington gene. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=863.44s)]
*  And if you know that your, for instance, parent has it, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=866.96s)]
*  you can get tested for it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=869.52s)]
*  A lot of people don't wanna get tested. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=870.84s)]
*  They don't want the answer because it's late onset. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=872.32s)]
*  So you can be normal a certain portion of your life [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=874.8s)]
*  and then get it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=876.36s)]
*  It's a tragic disease. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=877.2s)]
*  But if you test positive for this gene, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=878.28s)]
*  you know you're going to get Huntington's. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=880.44s)]
*  In which case with CRISPR, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=882.52s)]
*  you could just put the gene back in and rescue function. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  What causes someone to eventually succumb to that disease? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=886.2s)]
*  If it's a late onset disease, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=890.12s)]
*  if they don't have it when they're young [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  and they develop when they get older, what changes? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=893.28s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not just deterioration [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=895.88s)]
*  of those particular neurons. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=897.72s)]
*  It's deterioration of the neurons [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=899.36s)]
*  that control those neurons. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=901.44s)]
*  And everything's working in a kind of a top-down suppression [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=902.96s)]
*  all the time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=905.76s)]
*  In fact, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=906.6s)]
*  who's somebody I know quite well named Matthew McDougal, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=909.16s)]
*  he came up through my laboratory, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=911.16s)]
*  Elon made a great choice in hiring him, told me recently, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=912.64s)]
*  the best way to think about the frontal cortex [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=915.48s)]
*  is that basically its main job, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=917.6s)]
*  besides picking context and strategy for a given situation, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=919.28s)]
*  is to tell certain parts of your brain [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=922.96s)]
*  that really wanna do things. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=924.4399999999999s)]
*  Shh. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=925.92s)]
*  That's the best description I've ever heard [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=927.24s)]
*  of prefrontal cortex. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=929.2s)]
*  You know, it's what's keeping Jamie from doing things [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=930.6s)]
*  that he shouldn't right now and me doing things [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=933.68s)]
*  that I shouldn't right now. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=935.8s)]
*  And every time you have a crazy idea like, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=936.64s)]
*  maybe I should jump off this bridge. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  Why would I think that? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=939.7199999999999s)]
*  That's a healthy operation of your brain saying, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=940.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to, because I'm kind of curious, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=943.5999999999999s)]
*  but I don't want to, so I'm not going to. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=945.3599999999999s)]
*  With Huntington's, what happens is just slow deterioration [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=947.4s)]
*  of those neurons, but there's a lot of deterioration [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=950.0s)]
*  of these neurons that control motor function. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  And eventually what happens is the deeper neurons [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  that control motor function start shutting down [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=958.0s)]
*  the autonomic functions like breathing, heart rate, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=959.8s)]
*  and so eventually people just succumb to some basic, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=964.48s)]
*  we call them housekeeping functions. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=967.12s)]
*  So they'll have to be on a respirator [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  and they have to use a catheter tube [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=972.72s)]
*  and they have to defecate into a bag. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=976.2s)]
*  And at some point they just become a deteriorated [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=979.32s)]
*  mass of neurons. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=982.76s)]
*  So what's first to go there, however, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=984.32s)]
*  is the control of motor function. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=987.48s)]
*  And it goes first in the direction of too much activity [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=989.08s)]
*  because of all these breaks and accelerators [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=992.28s)]
*  that we have in the brain. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=993.92s)]
*  So in any case, CRISPR, gene manipulation, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=996.0s)]
*  of the sort that this guy did in this laboratory in China, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=998.56s)]
*  again, I think an ethics committee needs to tell the world [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1001.36s)]
*  or decide for the world what people should be allowed [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1004.4399999999999s)]
*  to do and not do. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1006.6s)]
*  But you can imagine for something like Huntington's, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1007.88s)]
*  it would be tremendously advantageous. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1009.56s)]
*  Like if you had a child who you knew [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  was someday going to get Huntington's, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1013.72s)]
*  you'd want to do a CRISPR mutation [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1015.6s)]
*  and put the healthy gene back. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1017.8s)]
*  Is there anything that's been shown to slow down [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1018.84s)]
*  the progress of Huntington's? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1023.32s)]
*  There I'm not so versed. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1025.76s)]
*  It's a little bit like MS, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1027.28s)]
*  another neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1028.76s)]
*  where certain things exacerbate it, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1031.28s)]
*  like inflammation of any kind. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1033.64s)]
*  And those things can be almost random in some ways. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1036.44s)]
*  Like some people who have MS will eat a salad dressing [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1040.52s)]
*  with mustard in it, have a huge inflammatory response [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1044.04s)]
*  and have a flare up, blurry vision and get worse. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1046.24s)]
*  And then it returns to mustard. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1049.08s)]
*  Things like mustard. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1050.84s)]
*  Is mustard inflammatory? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1051.68s)]
*  Mustard isn't necessarily whole body inflammatory, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1053.64s)]
*  but if it's spicy mustard, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1055.84s)]
*  it binds to what's called the substance P receptor [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1057.72s)]
*  or the capsaicin receptor. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1059.92s)]
*  We have receptors for anything that's kind of hot [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1061.28s)]
*  and spicy. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1063.72s)]
*  And those are the same receptors [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1064.88s)]
*  that respond to hot liquid. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1066.64s)]
*  Heat and spicy obviously very closely linked. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1068.76s)]
*  And pain, all three of those very close. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1071.44s)]
*  Whereas pain relief very closely related to menthol [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1073.28s)]
*  and cool, not just the taste, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1077.12s)]
*  but the actual physical sensation of cool. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1079.0s)]
*  So heat, pain and inflammation, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1081.56s)]
*  kind of our cousins in this sense. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  And cool, menthol and lack of inflammation [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1086.0s)]
*  are also cousins in terms of receptors, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1089.72s)]
*  neural circuits, this kind of thing. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1092.16s)]
*  So can spicy food cause inflammation? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  Sure, yeah. Really? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1096.52s)]
*  Yeah, but I think one of the best ways [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1097.8s)]
*  to think about inflammation, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1099.72s)]
*  and here I definitely hat tip to Lane Norton, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1100.92s)]
*  who we both know, and Andy Alpin, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1104.36s)]
*  who both really impressed upon me the fact [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1106.96s)]
*  that if we were to measure somebody's blood pressure, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1109.64s)]
*  inflammatory markers, heart rate, and cortisol [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1112.96s)]
*  during a hard workout, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1116.84s)]
*  and you didn't know they were doing a hard workout, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1118.28s)]
*  I just handed you the data and you're a medical doctor, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1119.8s)]
*  you'd say, this person's dying. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1121.64s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1123.32s)]
*  So inflammation is robust during a hard exercise. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1124.44s)]
*  But I think what's so incredible about the human body [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1128.2s)]
*  is that the increase in blood pressure, inflammation, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1131.16s)]
*  et cetera, is what triggers the adaptation [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1133.8s)]
*  so that blood pressure and inflammation, et cetera, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1136.64s)]
*  are all much lower the other 23 hours of the day. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1138.88s)]
*  And so there's something special about our system [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1142.04s)]
*  whereby, yeah, maybe if you had really hot peppers, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1144.04s)]
*  like the most famous of these is the Carolina Reaper. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1146.8400000000001s)]
*  You know about this, the Carolina Reaper? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1150.24s)]
*  I have some in my hot sauce. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1151.52s)]
*  Oh. Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1153.0s)]
*  Someone ate- [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1154.24s)]
*  Senor Lechuga made me this trio of hot sauces. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1155.12s)]
*  And there's Reapers in there. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1158.96s)]
*  Is that a person or a brand, Senor Lechuga? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a brand. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1162.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I thought it'd be awesome if- [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1164.28s)]
*  There's three hot sauces that we developed. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1165.12s)]
*  One of them is, my friend's over at Half Face Blades, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1168.52s)]
*  they developed this one that I really liked, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1173.52s)]
*  so he added that to my little three collection [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1175.04s)]
*  and it's like, I think it's Reapers, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1177.1599999999999s)]
*  sun-dried tomatoes, and some other stuff. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1181.76s)]
*  Oh, and truffles. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1186.04s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1188.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1188.84s)]
*  Yeah, and then he's got two other ones. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1189.68s)]
*  One of them with habanero, but there it is. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1191.3999999999999s)]
*  Those are the three. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1195.1599999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1196.2s)]
*  Yeah, so if you like hot shit, I like it hot. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1197.76s)]
*  This stuff is legit. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1202.8s)]
*  So one of them is heirloom tomatoes, winter truffles, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1205.32s)]
*  and Reapers, that's the Half Face Blades cooperative. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1208.12s)]
*  And then the other one is, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1212.12s)]
*  I don't even know how to say that word. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1213.56s)]
*  Chula-Kale, how do you say that? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1214.84s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1216.6s)]
*  Chula-Kale. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1217.76s)]
*  I'm in Texas, I'll embarrass myself even more. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1218.6s)]
*  Get your car share off that, please. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1220.6s)]
*  Kalima salt and ghost pepper. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1222.04s)]
*  That one's rough, but it's really delicious though. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1224.9199999999998s)]
*  And the other one's habanero, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1228.0s)]
*  Urfa chili and paprika. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1229.84s)]
*  And I love them all. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1232.36s)]
*  But I like really hot. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, if you're like, boy, this Tabasco is rough, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  stay the fuck away from that stuff, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1240.48s)]
*  because the stuff I like is pretty rough. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1242.0s)]
*  Well, the Carolina Reaper in small amounts, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1244.08s)]
*  I'm sure you can spice it just right. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1246.12s)]
*  There are these pepper eating contests that people- [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1248.8s)]
*  Oh, I've seen them. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1251.12s)]
*  We've played them on the podcast. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1252.2s)]
*  So a few years back, somebody ate a Carolina Reaper [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1253.44s)]
*  and ended up with what's called thunderclap headache. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1256.88s)]
*  Thunderclap headache is a massive inflammation [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1259.96s)]
*  of the meninges of the brain. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1262.28s)]
*  So you got your brain, it's sitting in fluid, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1263.68s)]
*  everyone knows that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1265.32s)]
*  And then there's some thick dura stuff around it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1266.16s)]
*  There's thick, thick fibrous tissue, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1268.36s)]
*  like, well, you're a hunter. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1270.24s)]
*  So when you get, want to take the brain out, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1271.28s)]
*  people think, oh, you just kind of pop the brain out. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1272.96s)]
*  You have to, you need a sharp razor, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  really sharp scissors to get through a sharp knife. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1277.68s)]
*  The swelling of the meninges [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1280.6s)]
*  is what happened to this person. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1282.32s)]
*  They got an unbelievable headache, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1284.12s)]
*  and it's actually inflammation-induced brain damage. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1285.92s)]
*  Now that's only eating an extremely hot pepper [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1288.8s)]
*  in huge quantities. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1291.8s)]
*  How many peppers does this guy eat? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1293.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1295.0s)]
*  I think- [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1295.84s)]
*  Just eating one of those things. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1296.66s)]
*  In the pepper sauce, my stuff, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1299.48s)]
*  it's like the tiniest amount. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1301.68s)]
*  It'll wreck you. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1303.4s)]
*  Yeah, thunderclap headache. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1304.68s)]
*  We know a couple other things about spice. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1306.08s)]
*  And here, I just, I always, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1308.24s)]
*  I want to make sure I give proper attribution. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1310.08s)]
*  The Nobel Prize was given a couple of years ago [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1312.04s)]
*  to a guy down at the Scripps Institute in San Diego, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1314.28s)]
*  Ardem Padapuchin, and David, excuse me, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1316.92s)]
*  oh gosh, David Julius at UCSF, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1321.52s)]
*  for the discovery of these receptors [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1323.48s)]
*  for pressure, cool heat. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1325.24s)]
*  And then it's an amazing set of discoveries [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1326.96s)]
*  that just occurred really in the last 10 years. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1329.04s)]
*  We know that all of those pathways go to areas of the brain [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1331.82s)]
*  that are involved in, of course, like behavior. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1335.72s)]
*  Like if you touch something really hot, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1337.28s)]
*  you taste something really hot. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1338.4s)]
*  For most people, they're going to resist that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1339.3600000000001s)]
*  But also to the hypothalamus, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1340.8s)]
*  which houses all these hormone control areas, et cetera. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1342.2s)]
*  People who can tolerate stronger spice, men and women, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1345.18s)]
*  we know it's correlated with higher levels [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1349.5s)]
*  of circulating testosterone. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1351.28s)]
*  That I think is interesting. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1353.08s)]
*  What we're really talking about is higher pain threshold. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1354.06s)]
*  And you and I have talked before about [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1357.5s)]
*  if there's one clear effect of testosterone, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1359.26s)]
*  it's that it makes effort feel good. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1361.84s)]
*  That that pain starts to have a little bit [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1363.84s)]
*  of a come hither kind of thing to it. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1366.06s)]
*  It feels a little bit enticing [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1367.96s)]
*  when testosterone levels are elevated. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1370.3s)]
*  When testosterone levels are lower [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1372.3999999999999s)]
*  or if people have lower levels of testosterone, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1373.82s)]
*  effort feels more overwhelming. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1375.98s)]
*  How's that? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1379.1399999999999s)]
*  And the other thing is that ingestion of spicy peppers [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1380.94s)]
*  resets your calibration for what's spicy. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1384.3s)]
*  I think we know that too. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1386.9s)]
*  And in a way that also adjusts people's pain threshold. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1388.5s)]
*  So if people get better at eating hot peppers, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1392.42s)]
*  they're better at dealing with all types of pain. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1394.54s)]
*  And I find this fascinating because I know you and I [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1396.46s)]
*  are both kind of obsessed with ice baths and cold clutches. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1398.64s)]
*  And I've been going deep into that literature around cold [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1402.22s)]
*  and what's really known about cold thermogenesis [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1405.06s)]
*  and not known. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1406.94s)]
*  And it seems like these acute adrenaline, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1408.38s)]
*  acute pain pathways, they do exactly what exercise does, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1412.1000000000001s)]
*  which is in the moment, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1415.8200000000002s)]
*  if you were to measure somebody's inflammation, et cetera, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1416.74s)]
*  you'd say this person is dying. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1419.74s)]
*  They are in a terrible state. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1421.14s)]
*  They might as well be getting open heart surgery [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1422.4s)]
*  with no anesthesia, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1424.3400000000001s)]
*  the way some people react to the ice bath. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1425.2600000000002s)]
*  It's kind of silly to us. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1426.8200000000002s)]
*  But for people that don't like the cold, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1428.9s)]
*  they're like, you gotta be kidding me. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1430.8600000000001s)]
*  I'd never go near it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1431.9s)]
*  They try and disparage it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1432.8600000000001s)]
*  They try and poke every hole in the data. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1433.94s)]
*  They're just scared, right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1435.8200000000002s)]
*  They're just scared. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1437.1000000000001s)]
*  But they are actually the people that benefit the most [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1438.6200000000001s)]
*  because that really acute adrenaline spike, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1440.78s)]
*  that pain that you feel creates a higher pain threshold later, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1443.76s)]
*  higher threshold for work output, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1448.3400000000001s)]
*  all of the things that most people seek. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1450.94s)]
*  And so to me, it's always interesting [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1452.8200000000002s)]
*  that you have to look at what's happening during, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1454.3400000000001s)]
*  and you have to look at what's happening afterward. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1456.42s)]
*  And for some reason as humans, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1458.0800000000002s)]
*  we like these creature comforts of massages, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1459.6000000000001s)]
*  which are great. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1462.44s)]
*  The sauna, which is great, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1464.6000000000001s)]
*  although if you crank it up really hot, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1465.8200000000002s)]
*  it's work at some level. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1467.0s)]
*  It's always work at the end. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1468.56s)]
*  There's that moment. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1470.24s)]
*  The last five minutes of a 25 minute session [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1471.08s)]
*  at 190 degrees, that's work. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1473.24s)]
*  Yeah, and there's something about the burning [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1475.48s)]
*  in the nose for me. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1478.0s)]
*  At least my heart rate starts to look, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1479.8s)]
*  I wanna get the hell out of here. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1481.02s)]
*  Burning in the nose. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1481.86s)]
*  So are you using water on the rocks a lot? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1482.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1485.24s)]
*  So that's what's giving you the burning in the nose? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1486.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1487.56s)]
*  It's always hard to know how hot it is right [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1488.68s)]
*  at the place where it reaches your body. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1490.68s)]
*  I've been cranking it way, way up. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1492.84s)]
*  Like what temperature? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1494.68s)]
*  Like 260. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1495.52s)]
*  260. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1497.12s)]
*  260. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1497.96s)]
*  But I cover my head. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1498.8s)]
*  Why, what are you, a brisket? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1500.32s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, so that, well, what I found is- [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1502.6799999999998s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1505.32s)]
*  So what's interesting is your desire to get out [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1506.84s)]
*  of the hot tub or the too hot hot tub [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1509.28s)]
*  is because of burning on the skin, right? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1512.52s)]
*  But your desire to get out of the sauna [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1513.96s)]
*  is usually a brain thing. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1515.8799999999999s)]
*  You'll notice this because if you go to a Russian banya, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1517.3999999999999s)]
*  they all wear the little wool hats. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1519.34s)]
*  That's to insulate their brain against the heat [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1521.08s)]
*  so they can stay in at hotter temperatures on their body. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1523.22s)]
*  So I'm in at 260, but I've got my head covered [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1525.48s)]
*  with a wool cap. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1527.72s)]
*  So it doesn't feel as stressful, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1528.9s)]
*  but I'm doing it because I like to sweat. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1531.24s)]
*  If it doesn't feel as stressful, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1533.44s)]
*  wouldn't have less of a positive effect. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1535.08s)]
*  Okay, so this is great. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  Because what you're starting to do is tease out the variables. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1538.84s)]
*  So this is where I think it gets interesting. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1540.72s)]
*  You can get better at sweating. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1542.4s)]
*  I know fighters do this in preparation, you know, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1544.3600000000001s)]
*  dropping weight. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1546.24s)]
*  You can get better by doing more sauna. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1547.06s)]
*  You get to be a better sweater, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1548.6s)]
*  which means that you can drop, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1550.4s)]
*  you can cool more easily even in clothes [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1552.68s)]
*  or if you're out running or hunting or doing anything. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1555.02s)]
*  So there's some advantage to being better at sweating. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1557.22s)]
*  And sweating itself is a whole interesting story. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  You actually have nerves that control the sweat glands. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1563.58s)]
*  That's actually controlled by little nerve endings. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1566.1s)]
*  And those pathways can grow very, very quickly [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1568.46s)]
*  in the presence of heat. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1571.8s)]
*  So what I've been trying to do [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1573.0s)]
*  is learn how to dump heat better. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1574.06s)]
*  And if I don't use the hat, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1575.9s)]
*  what happened was I was getting up to 220 [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1578.18s)]
*  and I'd sit in there for like 45 minutes. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1579.86s)]
*  I'm thinking, this is not doing anything for me anymore. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1581.32s)]
*  I want to increase my sweating. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1583.58s)]
*  Have you brought in an independent thermometer? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1585.72s)]
*  If you're not trusting the 260. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1588.5200000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1589.72s)]
*  So what I did is I had the, no, I haven't. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1590.8000000000002s)]
*  So- [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1593.16s)]
*  Who makes your sauna? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1594.0s)]
*  This is Dundalk. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1595.64s)]
*  But so what I had the guy do who had installed it for me [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1597.1200000000001s)]
*  is put the thermometer down low [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1600.5600000000002s)]
*  because it's a trigger, right? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1603.2800000000002s)]
*  It's going to shut it off when it hits a certain temperature. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1604.5600000000002s)]
*  So what I'm really trying to do [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1607.0800000000002s)]
*  is get it really, really hot down near the floor. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1608.2s)]
*  Because then I'd, you know, when I stand up [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1611.3000000000002s)]
*  when it's that hot, I'm just ready to pass out. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1613.04s)]
*  No chance. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1615.44s)]
*  But you know, I think Laird, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1616.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to get this wrong on the numbers, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1617.58s)]
*  but you know, I know Laird brings his Airdyne bike in there. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1619.84s)]
*  With oven mitts on. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1623.08s)]
*  So he's got to be putting himself at least 260, right? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1624.72s)]
*  Himself, I don't think he has a sauna set at 260. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1629.56s)]
*  I think his sauna set in the 200s though, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1633.32s)]
*  I think it's like 215 or 220. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1635.24s)]
*  But pedaling on the Airdyne, that's- [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1637.08s)]
*  No, he's a psycho. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1638.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's psycho. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1639.12s)]
*  But he's a different kind of human being. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1639.96s)]
*  But I'm contrasting this with cold. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1642.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1644.04s)]
*  Well, that's a difference. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  Are you going cold and then 260? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1645.84s)]
*  I'm a wimp. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1648.1999999999998s)]
*  I start in the cold for a minute, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1649.04s)]
*  then I go into the sauna, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1651.4399999999998s)]
*  then back into the cold for two minutes, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1652.56s)]
*  back into the sauna, then three minutes. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1654.26s)]
*  But you're not a wimp, why are you saying that? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1655.6s)]
*  Well, listen, if I were tougher, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1656.8799999999999s)]
*  I'd go five minutes in the cold straight off. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1658.28s)]
*  But I just had Susanna Soberg out for a podcast. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1660.6399999999999s)]
*  And she taught me some really interesting things. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1665.32s)]
*  First of all, this has really helped. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1667.1599999999999s)]
*  I did this- [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1668.6799999999998s)]
*  We should explain that she's the woman [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1669.52s)]
*  who created the Soberg Principle. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1670.64s)]
*  Yeah, Susanna Soberg did her PhD in Denmark [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1672.48s)]
*  as I think one of the best scientists [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1676.2800000000002s)]
*  in terms of deliberate cold exposure and its benefits. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1679.1200000000001s)]
*  Because she actually did something that's remarkable, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1682.0400000000002s)]
*  not just in that field, but overall, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  which is that she employed real world type experiences [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1687.3200000000002s)]
*  and exercise of deliberate cold and sauna, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1692.96s)]
*  and turned it into a very rigorous study [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1695.76s)]
*  of brown fat thermogenesis, which is this sort of, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1698.08s)]
*  think of it as sort of like the oil in the candle [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1701.48s)]
*  of your body increases mitochondrial function [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1703.8799999999999s)]
*  and thermogenesis heats you up. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1706.08s)]
*  Metabolism, subjective wellbeing, sleep, et cetera. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1708.08s)]
*  She did all of that and published this [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1711.6s)]
*  in Cell Reports Medicine. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1713.6799999999998s)]
*  And I realized it's just one study, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1715.04s)]
*  but to do that studies on humans is hard. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1716.86s)]
*  To do it with multiple variables is even harder. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1720.32s)]
*  And to do it in a real world context is even harder. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1723.08s)]
*  So what she showed was that if people get 11 minutes [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1725.64s)]
*  of deliberate cold exposure per week total, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1730.1200000000001s)]
*  this is divided up into sessions of one to three minutes [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1733.0s)]
*  or four minutes even. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1735.88s)]
*  So it's not 11 minutes all at once. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1737.2s)]
*  They fundamentally change the amount of brown fat [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1739.18s)]
*  that they have, which means they fundamentally change [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1742.3200000000002s)]
*  the number of mitochondria in the brown fat, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1744.5200000000002s)]
*  which means they fundamentally change [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1746.14s)]
*  their thermogenic properties of their body [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1747.44s)]
*  and increase their metabolism. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1749.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, the people who don't like cold say, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1750.72s)]
*  well, the increase in metabolism wasn't enough [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1753.0400000000002s)]
*  to offset more than a few bites of a bagel or something. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1755.0s)]
*  But that's not the point really. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1757.76s)]
*  What she also showed was that this increase [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1759.36s)]
*  in thermogenesis allowed people to be more comfortable [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1761.72s)]
*  in cold environments even when they're not in the cold. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1764.96s)]
*  And then people say, well, who cares, right? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1767.6s)]
*  I'll throw on a jacket. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1769.06s)]
*  Ah, but what she was able to show is that the ability [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1770.2s)]
*  to be comfortable in the cold correlates [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1773.4s)]
*  with a bunch of other important immune functions [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1775.28s)]
*  and metabolic functions and insulin sensitivity, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1778.32s)]
*  which is a good thing. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1780.9s)]
*  And the inability to do that is likely [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1782.32s)]
*  to not be healthy for us. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1785.76s)]
*  She also showed that 57 minutes per week [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1787.72s)]
*  is the threshold for sauna. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1789.84s)]
*  So if people get 57 minutes per week [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1791.72s)]
*  of uncomfortably warm but safe sauna exposure, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1794.12s)]
*  they can get very similar effects. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  And then that gave rise to this question I always said, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1799.48s)]
*  do you end with cold or do you end with heat? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1802.12s)]
*  And she said, end with cold because then your body's forced [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1804.02s)]
*  to warm itself back up. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1806.36s)]
*  And that's what's now called the Soberg principle, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1807.96s)]
*  which is when you end with cold, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1810.72s)]
*  your body has to use its natural machinery to heat back up. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1812.52s)]
*  In talking to her recently, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1817.04s)]
*  I learned some really interesting things [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1818.4s)]
*  that I've been incorporating. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1819.6000000000001s)]
*  First of all, I've always avoided putting my head under [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1820.92s)]
*  until the very end in the cold. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1822.96s)]
*  Turns out that if you put your face in the water [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1825.28s)]
*  right as you go in, you activate the mammalian dive reflex. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1827.54s)]
*  And this reflex increases the so-called [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1831.2s)]
*  parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1834.28s)]
*  which is just nerd speak for it lowers your heart rate, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1837.2s)]
*  it makes you calmer and it makes you better able [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1840.14s)]
*  to tolerate stress. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1842.0600000000002s)]
*  So try this next time. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1843.48s)]
*  You could even just put your face in before- [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1844.74s)]
*  I go right under. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1846.14s)]
*  You go right under. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1847.1000000000001s)]
*  So that's the right way to do it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1847.94s)]
*  I plug my nose, I go right under. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1848.7800000000002s)]
*  So I didn't know this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1849.94s)]
*  A lot of people that do deliberate cold get headaches, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1850.7800000000002s)]
*  they don't feel good. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1852.98s)]
*  And a lot of times it's because they slowly immerse [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1853.8200000000002s)]
*  themselves up to the neck. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1856.0200000000002s)]
*  And then right at that interface of cold and hot, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1857.5s)]
*  it creates change, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1859.8200000000002s)]
*  there's a constriction right below, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1861.18s)]
*  a little bit of vasodilation above, they get headaches, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1862.5s)]
*  they don't feel good, the heart rate is way too high. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1864.3000000000002s)]
*  Putting your face under really helps. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1866.8600000000001s)]
*  Isn't that anxiety though? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1868.0200000000002s)]
*  I just feel like that's all psychological. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1869.34s)]
*  I really do because there's a moment when you get in [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1871.6599999999999s)]
*  the cold where there's a part of your brain that goes, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1874.3799999999999s)]
*  let's get out of here. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1878.22s)]
*  You can get out of this if you will just get out right now. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1879.3s)]
*  And you gotta go shut the fuck up. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1882.1799999999998s)]
*  But if you don't say shut the fuck up, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1883.5s)]
*  then that thing runs rampant through your brain [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1885.6599999999999s)]
*  and that kicks your heart rate up [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1887.98s)]
*  and that kicks your anxiety up. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1889.78s)]
*  I really think it's psychological. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1891.82s)]
*  Well, it's psychological and it's physiological. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1894.06s)]
*  So here's- [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1896.3s)]
*  Right, physiological because of psychological. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1898.54s)]
*  So here's what we know for sure. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1900.3s)]
*  For the first 20 to 30 seconds of cold shock [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1901.62s)]
*  when you get in, which is how it's described, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1904.74s)]
*  that prefrontal cortex that normally has the job [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1907.78s)]
*  of handling context and says shh to the reflexes [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1911.06s)]
*  of the brain and the impulses of the brain is not active [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1914.1s)]
*  for 20 to 30 seconds. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1917.5s)]
*  So your reflex to get the hell out of there [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1918.78s)]
*  there's a clear and logical reason for that. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1923.26s)]
*  After that 20 or 30 seconds, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1926.6599999999999s)]
*  the forebrain starts coming online again. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1928.22s)]
*  That's your opportunity to start negotiating with yourself [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1930.34s)]
*  of, oh, this is actually good for me. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1933.54s)]
*  This is, I can handle this. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1935.42s)]
*  I got through that so I can get through the next one. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1937.82s)]
*  What I've been doing recently is trying to not go for time, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1940.22s)]
*  but going for the only way I can describe this [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1943.42s)]
*  would be walls. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1945.54s)]
*  Like sometimes just getting in the thing is a wall for me. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1946.38s)]
*  So I go, okay, I got over one wall [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1948.82s)]
*  just getting in the damn thing. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1950.1000000000001s)]
*  Then I go, oh God, here it comes. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1951.58s)]
*  Forebrain shutting down, I'm like panicking. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1953.66s)]
*  I'm gonna get through this. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1955.6200000000001s)]
*  And then I'm watching for when I have the impulse to get out. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1956.82s)]
*  And when I start to notice is that the gaps [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1960.9399999999998s)]
*  between those walls start getting longer and longer. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1963.1s)]
*  The more you do it. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1965.82s)]
*  The more you do it. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1966.6599999999999s)]
*  You have one at your house? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1967.48s)]
*  I do, yeah. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1968.32s)]
*  And then pretty soon what's happened is- [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1969.1599999999999s)]
*  How cold is it? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1970.1399999999999s)]
*  It's hard to, I suppose it's probably in the low 50s. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1971.58s)]
*  What? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1975.1399999999999s)]
*  Low 50s or high 40s. Why is it so warm? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1975.98s)]
*  I don't know, low 50s, high 40s. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1978.74s)]
*  Why do you do that? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1980.1799999999998s)]
*  Stay in there longer, I don't know. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1981.02s)]
*  Well, we have two. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1982.3s)]
*  I confess we have the Morosco one, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1983.1399999999999s)]
*  which is that one's really cold. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1984.94s)]
*  And that one is- [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1986.7s)]
*  You avoid that one. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1987.66s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1988.5800000000002s)]
*  I like to go in the sauna first. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1989.42s)]
*  I don't like when I'm hearing it. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1990.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1992.1000000000001s)]
*  I've been doing longer exposure in the warmer one. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1993.02s)]
*  That's so much easier though. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1996.18s)]
*  It is? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1997.74s)]
*  We had one here that was kind of broken. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=1998.5800000000002s)]
*  And it was at 54 degrees. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2000.14s)]
*  Okay, that's too warm. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2001.8200000000002s)]
*  And I climbed in and I'm like, this is a fucking joke. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2002.66s)]
*  What, 50s okay though? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2003.94s)]
*  All right, listen. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2006.06s)]
*  34. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2008.22s)]
*  34 is where you got, yeah, you and Kim Haines. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2009.5s)]
*  34. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2011.8200000000002s)]
*  I like where the ice breaks off the bottom [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2012.66s)]
*  of the thing and floats to the top. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2014.82s)]
*  You realize I just uninvited myself [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2016.4199999999998s)]
*  on the Kim Haines hunting trip. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2018.22s)]
*  Cause he was like, you should come hunting. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2019.74s)]
*  I've never gone. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2020.82s)]
*  But I think he'll probably just say I'm a wuss [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2021.86s)]
*  until I get down to the 30s on these cold plunges. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2023.98s)]
*  No. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2026.1s)]
*  I did a workout with him. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2026.9399999999998s)]
*  I went up there. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2028.02s)]
*  I was sore for two weeks. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2028.86s)]
*  Those high rep weight workouts that he does, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2030.5s)]
*  they're insane. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2032.3s)]
*  Yeah, he does a lot of that stuff. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2033.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like I'm a slow lazy bear in the gym. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2034.1399999999999s)]
*  Like I like to lift heavy, rest, go like this kind of thing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2036.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, he does a lot of endurance work. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2038.62s)]
*  He does a lot of his stuff is about muscular endurance [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2040.82s)]
*  and pain threshold and what you can tolerate. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2043.46s)]
*  It's all repetitions. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2046.3400000000001s)]
*  Cause repetitions, like if you just do three to five reps, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2047.74s)]
*  it's pretty easy. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2050.58s)]
*  As you said, testosterone rewards, that kind of effort. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2051.42s)]
*  There's a big difference between that kind of stuff [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2055.02s)]
*  and like, you know, he's an ultra marathon runner. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2057.34s)]
*  He likes to push the mind. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2059.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2060.98s)]
*  Well, I'll do the long runs. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2061.82s)]
*  I do a long run on Sunday. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2062.66s)]
*  I did two hours yesterday around, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2063.66s)]
*  they called a lake, but it looks like more like a river. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2065.7400000000002s)]
*  It is a river. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2067.78s)]
*  It's a branch of the Colorado river. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2068.62s)]
*  So I kept going around that thing [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2070.7s)]
*  until I couldn't go around anymore. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2072.14s)]
*  But yeah, I need to go colder. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2073.74s)]
*  I will get in the ice one. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2075.7799999999997s)]
*  What is this will need to go? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2077.5s)]
*  Why don't you just do it? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2079.58s)]
*  Well, there are mornings I'll just jump in [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2080.7s)]
*  the cold one for 30 seconds. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2082.7s)]
*  I do it every fucking day. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2084.06s)]
*  I don't have any negotiation. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2085.46s)]
*  There's no negotiation. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2086.98s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't go in every day. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2088.54s)]
*  I'm saying I don't always go into that one first. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2090.14s)]
*  I go first thing in the morning. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2091.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2093.02s)]
*  Well, you're a better man. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2093.86s)]
*  No, it's not a better man. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2094.8199999999997s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2096.18s)]
*  It's just, if you have like all these room, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2097.46s)]
*  this negotiation room and all this leeway, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2101.14s)]
*  then you won't do it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2104.18s)]
*  If you just, I brush my teeth every day. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2105.54s)]
*  Do you? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2107.3399999999997s)]
*  Twice a day? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2108.18s)]
*  Yeah. Well, get in the fucking cold. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2109.02s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2110.7799999999997s)]
*  All right, I'll start going. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2111.62s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2112.46s)]
*  It's three minutes. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, in the beginning, when I first got it, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2114.12s)]
*  I would like procrastinate. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2115.58s)]
*  I'd get a cup of coffee. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2116.7799999999997s)]
*  And then I looked at my phone. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2117.8199999999997s)]
*  It was 12 minutes later. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2118.7s)]
*  I was like, I already be done. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2119.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2121.2599999999998s)]
*  I would have been done eight minutes ago. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2122.1s)]
*  Well, I'm going to get thermometers, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2122.94s)]
*  a second thermometer for the sauna, verify. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2124.62s)]
*  I'm going to verify the data, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2126.98s)]
*  second independent measurement and the cold. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2127.98s)]
*  I may have to imagine that the Morosco one, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2130.3s)]
*  because it has pieces of ice floating in it, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2132.3s)]
*  it's got to be colder than 50. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2134.38s)]
*  Yeah, I bet it is. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2136.0600000000004s)]
*  You can tell if you know what the Morosco has two lids, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2137.78s)]
*  you have the lid where you climb in [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2140.6600000000003s)]
*  and there's another lid where the equipment is. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2141.86s)]
*  If you lift up that equipment lid, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2143.32s)]
*  you'll see a thermometer. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2144.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2146.3s)]
*  You'll see a digital thermometer that's a setting. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2147.1400000000003s)]
*  It's like what it's set at and what it's actually at. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2148.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2151.1800000000003s)]
*  And I guarantee you, you're probably in the thirties. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2152.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2153.7400000000002s)]
*  So I've been doing shorter exposures there [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2154.9s)]
*  and then longer exposures in the 50 one. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2156.98s)]
*  What's the longer in the 50 one? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2160.06s)]
*  Well, I'm in there a while. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2161.2599999999998s)]
*  Like how long? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2162.46s)]
*  So that one, when I go in there, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2163.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm staying, you know, 10, 20 minutes. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2164.2999999999997s)]
*  And here's the reason, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2166.02s)]
*  the study that was published [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2167.14s)]
*  in the European Journal of Physiology [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2168.18s)]
*  that showed these huge increases in dopamine, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2169.98s)]
*  that was the first of these sorts of studies. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2172.5s)]
*  I don't know if I've mentioned this, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2174.2599999999998s)]
*  but when you go in the cold [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2175.1s)]
*  for a very brief period of time, one to three minutes, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2176.52s)]
*  and it's shockingly cold, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2178.86s)]
*  you have to catch your breath, stabilize your mind, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2180.48s)]
*  that evokes a dopamine epinephrine [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2182.94s)]
*  and norepinephrine release. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2185.94s)]
*  These three things together are called the catecholamines. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2187.06s)]
*  Those normally would increase from, you know, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2190.06s)]
*  a cup of coffee and a hard sprint [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2193.18s)]
*  for 10 to 30 minutes, maybe an hour. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2196.46s)]
*  When you do the cold exposure, the way you're doing it, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2200.62s)]
*  or longer exposures at about 50 degrees or so, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2203.54s)]
*  you're seeing increases in dopamine, norepinephrine, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2206.52s)]
*  and epinephrine that are two to three X above baseline. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2209.22s)]
*  This is huge. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2213.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2214.2599999999998s)]
*  This is huge. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2215.1s)]
*  This is on the order of many drugs, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2215.92s)]
*  but the difference is most drugs spike dopamine [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2218.14s)]
*  and then drop it below baseline. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2220.5s)]
*  The increases in this case are lasting many hours, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2223.2s)]
*  two to four to even six hours. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2225.98s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2228.18s)]
*  And there are very, you know, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2229.02s)]
*  whenever people criticize deliberate cold exposure, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2229.92s)]
*  they go, it's not leading to that much fat loss, granted, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2232.0s)]
*  but it's, to my knowledge, there is no drug, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2234.94s)]
*  nor is there any form of exercise, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2238.7s)]
*  conventional forms of exercise, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2240.8599999999997s)]
*  that increase the catecholamines to that level for that long. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2242.54s)]
*  And with dopamine, it's all about the amplitude [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2246.54s)]
*  and the duration, how fast it rises, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2250.14s)]
*  how fast it stays up there. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2251.82s)]
*  There's nothing quite like it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2253.5s)]
*  And, you know, I did three plunges here. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2254.7s)]
*  I'm staying at a place that actually has a plunge. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2256.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know the temperature, but it felt cold to me. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2257.72s)]
*  So I did three minutes, three minutes, three minutes, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2259.3s)]
*  and they had a hot tub, so I bounced back and forth [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2261.3s)]
*  for a minute in between. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2262.9s)]
*  And as you know, you feel better much of the day, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2264.46s)]
*  if not the entire day. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2268.2599999999998s)]
*  That is not a coincidence. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2269.4s)]
*  Your system is circulating much higher levels [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2270.98s)]
*  of the catecholamines. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2273.7s)]
*  And this is shown in that paper. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2274.7s)]
*  It's now been shown in a series of other papers. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2276.1s)]
*  My colleague, Craig Heller at Stanford, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2278.02s)]
*  has known this for a long time. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2279.8199999999997s)]
*  And this is why, and for other reasons, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2281.22s)]
*  the athletes at Stanford who use cold [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2283.66s)]
*  do it before their workouts. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2285.7s)]
*  Everyone now knows that it blocks hypertrophy [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2287.94s)]
*  if you do it after. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2289.7799999999997s)]
*  But if you wait a few hours, you're okay. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2290.98s)]
*  Four to six hours, you're okay. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2293.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I like to do it first thing in the morning [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2294.86s)]
*  just because I don't want to do it first thing [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2298.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's why I like when people complain [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2299.66s)]
*  about cold plunges, that it's not worth it, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2301.68s)]
*  it doesn't do anything. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2304.06s)]
*  I'm like, fuck you, it doesn't. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2304.9s)]
*  You just don't like the fact that other people [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2306.1800000000003s)]
*  can do it every day. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2309.7000000000003s)]
*  And you don't like the fact that you can't do it every day. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2311.06s)]
*  You're talking to me specifically. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2313.62s)]
*  No, no, other people. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2314.46s)]
*  Not you, you do. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2315.7400000000002s)]
*  But there's people out there that will complain [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2316.94s)]
*  about something and find an excuse why it's not beneficial. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2319.54s)]
*  And the reason for that excuse is not that there's not data. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2322.7400000000002s)]
*  The reason for that excuse is coming up [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2326.5s)]
*  with some sort of an excuse for themselves. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2328.6s)]
*  That's what that is. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2331.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2332.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think of health and performance, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2333.62s)]
*  so mental health, physical health and performance [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2337.14s)]
*  along fundamentals. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2338.66s)]
*  You talk about these all the time. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2341.3399999999997s)]
*  I think the five pillars, if you will, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2342.7799999999997s)]
*  or sunlight, if I may, getting light in your eyes, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2345.22s)]
*  avoiding too frequent bright light exposure [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2350.42s)]
*  in your eyes at night, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2353.72s)]
*  unless you're doing something you really enjoy. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2354.58s)]
*  Okay, so you're doing comedy. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2356.56s)]
*  You're out past 10 p.m., right? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2358.18s)]
*  You're not going to wear sunglasses [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2359.66s)]
*  or something necessarily. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2360.88s)]
*  That would be ridiculous. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2362.38s)]
*  That would be ridiculous, right? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2363.7799999999997s)]
*  Who's like, yeah. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2364.62s)]
*  People would go, what the fuck is this weirdo [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2365.4399999999996s)]
*  doing with sunglasses on? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2366.54s)]
*  It's past 10 p.m., I have to have my blue blockers on. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2367.7s)]
*  I've got friends that wear the red lights at night [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2370.4199999999996s)]
*  and dim all the lights, you know, that whole thing. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2372.18s)]
*  That's a little extreme. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2373.4599999999996s)]
*  That's a little extreme. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2374.7s)]
*  Those people are always weird. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2375.74s)]
*  Yeah, but sunlight, so sunlight during the day, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2377.06s)]
*  morning and day, and trying to limit bright light exposure [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2379.4599999999996s)]
*  at night as much as is normally possible. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2382.18s)]
*  Then I would say movement. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2385.5s)]
*  So you got to move, cardiovascular resistance training. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2388.08s)]
*  That's one of the beautiful things I think that's happened [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2390.2599999999998s)]
*  in the last couple of decades is that, you know, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2391.96s)]
*  resistance training is no longer just considered [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2394.44s)]
*  the thing that football players and bodybuilders do. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  Everyone, old, young, female, male. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2398.36s)]
*  Women no longer, I hope, are concerned about getting, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2400.92s)]
*  quote unquote, too big from weightlifting or something [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  or turning into a bodybuilder. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2405.6s)]
*  I think that's kind of gone away. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2406.44s)]
*  I like to think that's gone away. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2407.68s)]
*  Most women realize that the only reason why women [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2409.04s)]
*  do get too big is they take exogenous hormones. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2411.76s)]
*  They're taking steroids. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2414.48s)]
*  Yeah, you throw a bunch of Anivar in there, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2415.76s)]
*  you get the square jaw and the torto shell abs. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2417.04s)]
*  But women who don't do that and who lift weights regularly [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2420.96s)]
*  look way better. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  They look way better, and our friend Peter Attia [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2425.4s)]
*  has talked about one of the major causes of death later [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2429.48s)]
*  is falls due to stepping down off things. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2432.32s)]
*  The inability to hang from a bar is correlated [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2435.28s)]
*  with lack of health in men and women. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2437.94s)]
*  So being able to have some strength. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2440.7200000000003s)]
*  So exercise, then nutrients, right? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2442.48s)]
*  Macronutrients, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2446.36s)]
*  People now think about it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2448.12s)]
*  So you need all that stuff, vitamins, minerals, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2448.96s)]
*  and the other stuff. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2450.36s)]
*  And then I think in addition to that, sleep, right? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2451.44s)]
*  I think Matt Walker deserves a tremendous [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2454.7200000000003s)]
*  debt of gratitude from everybody. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2458.28s)]
*  Because 10 years ago, everyone was like, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2459.58s)]
*  I'll sleep when I'm dead. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2460.76s)]
*  Now we know you're probably not gonna dissolve [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2461.6s)]
*  into a puddle of your own tears [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2464.28s)]
*  from a couple of bad nights sleep every once in a while. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2465.54s)]
*  But sleep makes you mentally, physically better. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2467.92s)]
*  You perform better. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2471.1200000000003s)]
*  And then the last one is this whole, not notion, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2471.96s)]
*  it's social connection, right? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2474.94s)]
*  You can't stay isolated constantly [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2476.1600000000003s)]
*  or people lose their minds. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2478.8s)]
*  So when you look at people that get very depressed [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2480.52s)]
*  or they're suicidal, one or several of those five things [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2482.64s)]
*  is going to be diminished. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2487.0s)]
*  And then what happens is people hear [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2487.92s)]
*  about deliberate cold exposure. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2489.3199999999997s)]
*  And if they don't like it or they wanna poke at it, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2491.2799999999997s)]
*  they say, oh, it blocks hypertrophy. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2494.0s)]
*  Okay, well, only if you do it in the four to six hours [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2495.56s)]
*  after a hypertrophy workout. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2497.96s)]
*  I thought it was two. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2499.52s)]
*  Well, they've looked immediately after, you know, again- [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2501.8399999999997s)]
*  Immediately after is bad. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2504.04s)]
*  Immediately after is bad. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2505.2s)]
*  So if you work out, but you can do it after cardio, right? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2506.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2509.0s)]
*  The only time I do it right after workouts [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2510.6400000000003s)]
*  is after I do a, generally I do a really hard cardio workout [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  and then I'll do the sauna for 25 minutes [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2517.1600000000003s)]
*  and then I'll do the cold plunge. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2519.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll end with the cold plunge. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2520.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the- [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2522.7200000000003s)]
*  That's okay, right? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2523.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2524.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it blocks, it lowers inflammation, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2525.44s)]
*  which is what you want from the resistance training. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2527.52s)]
*  Again, it goes back to this, you know, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2530.88s)]
*  it wasn't just these guys, but again, I point to Lane [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2532.36s)]
*  and to Andy Galpin who've been shouting [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2535.38s)]
*  from the rooftops for years. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2537.1600000000003s)]
*  Blood pressure up, inflammation up is a good thing. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2539.16s)]
*  So you have to be careful when someone says, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2541.52s)]
*  oh, you know- The hormetic effect. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2542.72s)]
*  You eat the hormetic effect. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2543.56s)]
*  You eat this, you become inflamed. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2544.6s)]
*  Well, how long and what's the hormetic effect? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2545.92s)]
*  And so in terms of, you know, deliberate cold exposure, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2548.44s)]
*  people like to say, oh, it doesn't burn much fat, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2552.46s)]
*  it blocks hypertrophy. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2555.0s)]
*  But if you look at the mental benefits [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2555.92s)]
*  of having your catecholamines, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2558.3999999999996s)]
*  dopamine or epinephrine and epinephrine, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2560.12s)]
*  systemically elevated to two to three X [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2561.56s)]
*  for four to six hours after a 30 second [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2564.6s)]
*  to three minute protocol, you're not going to show me a drug [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2569.08s)]
*  or a form of exercise that can do that. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2573.08s)]
*  For me, the best thing for sleep is sauna. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2575.44s)]
*  Like sauna pre-sleep is amazing. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2579.24s)]
*  Well, do you know why that is? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2582.16s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2583.6s)]
*  Ah, it's really interesting. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2584.44s)]
*  When you heat the surface of your body, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2585.8399999999997s)]
*  you would think, oh, you know, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2588.2799999999997s)]
*  my whole body temperature is getting really hot. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2589.7599999999998s)]
*  But if I were to measure your core body temperature, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2592.5s)]
*  what happens is your medial preoptic nucleus [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2595.4s)]
*  of the hypothalamus says, oh, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2597.06s)]
*  the surface of my body is really hot. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2598.3s)]
*  I'm going to cool down my core temperature. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2600.22s)]
*  And falling asleep at night requires a one to three degree [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2602.14s)]
*  drop in bodily temperature. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2605.24s)]
*  And when you wake up in the morning, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2606.7s)]
*  you have a one to three degree increase [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2608.62s)]
*  in bodily temperature in the morning. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2610.26s)]
*  That triggers a cortisol spike, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2611.46s)]
*  that triggers norepinephrine, and then you start waking up. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2613.64s)]
*  So body temperature and the ability to fall asleep [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2616.66s)]
*  and stay asleep and wake up are very tightly correlated. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2618.98s)]
*  But your whole circadian rhythm is temperature driven. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2622.74s)]
*  And so, for instance, you probably have a best time of day [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2625.7s)]
*  for you to work out where you feel best. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2628.62s)]
*  You probably, if I were to have you train at 2 a.m. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2630.7799999999997s)]
*  when you went to bed a couple hours before, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2634.18s)]
*  you'd feel miserable. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2636.7999999999997s)]
*  You're not going to perform as well. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2637.64s)]
*  Grip strength in the middle of the night. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2638.4799999999996s)]
*  I wake you up, I take your grip strength measurement. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2639.62s)]
*  It's going to be strong, but not as strong as it would be [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2641.64s)]
*  at your peak time during the day. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2643.14s)]
*  If we looked at your body temperature, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2645.1s)]
*  we'd find that your grip strength is weakest [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2646.3199999999997s)]
*  when your body temperature is lowest. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2648.5s)]
*  So you'd say, well, I'm asleep. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2650.7s)]
*  But there's an easy experiment. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2653.64s)]
*  This has been done. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2655.2s)]
*  We just keep you awake for 24 hours. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2656.04s)]
*  We measure your body temperature. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2657.2s)]
*  It has a very regular circadian rhythm. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2658.24s)]
*  That persists. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2659.72s)]
*  And we measure grip strength. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2660.7599999999998s)]
*  That's been done numerous times. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2662.6s)]
*  People living in caves, they've done those experiments. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2664.16s)]
*  Have they done experiments where people do the sauna [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2666.16s)]
*  and then work out? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  Because if grip strength, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2672.0s)]
*  and it's tied to body temperature, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2673.3199999999997s)]
*  if you can raise your core body temperature from the sauna. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2675.6s)]
*  Sauna's dropping your core body temperature. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2678.2s)]
*  The inside of it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2680.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2681.12s)]
*  Even while you're at peak sauna, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2681.94s)]
*  you're sweating like a pig. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2683.82s)]
*  So at some point, you won't be able [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2685.06s)]
*  to thermoregulate anymore. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2686.5s)]
*  And then your body temperature will go up [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2688.1s)]
*  and you can become hyperthermic. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2689.54s)]
*  So when you are in the sauna and it's 210 degrees [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2691.1s)]
*  and you're sweating like a pig, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2694.86s)]
*  your body temperature is lower? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2696.6s)]
*  Your core body temperature is fighting to get lower. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2698.42s)]
*  And when you get out, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2700.58s)]
*  your core body temperature continues to go down. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2701.46s)]
*  It plummets. That's right. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2703.18s)]
*  And the exact opposite happens [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2704.18s)]
*  when you get in the cold plunge. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2705.82s)]
*  You feel cold on the surface. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2706.9s)]
*  So your body goes, oh shit, hypothalamus. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2708.54s)]
*  Again, medial preoptic area gets a signal from, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2711.68s)]
*  I mean, if you think about how beautiful this mechanism is, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2714.44s)]
*  I still like get goosebumps and no pun intended. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2716.7799999999997s)]
*  When I think about it, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2719.2s)]
*  you have receptors on your skin surface that sense cold. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2720.12s)]
*  Send that to your hypothalamus, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2723.14s)]
*  which says, huh, it's cold out there. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2725.12s)]
*  I'm going to generate heat. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2727.04s)]
*  How do I generate heat? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2727.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, there are two things you can do. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2728.8799999999997s)]
*  I can make you shiver, which will generate heat, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2729.96s)]
*  or I can make you move. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2732.68s)]
*  Another shivering is just another form of moving. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2735.12s)]
*  Or I can activate this very specialized fat tissue, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2737.3999999999996s)]
*  which is not under the skin. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2741.12s)]
*  It's not subcutaneous fat, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2742.52s)]
*  but it's around your critical organs, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2743.7599999999998s)]
*  which is the brown fat. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2745.88s)]
*  Activate the mitochondria there. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2747.2s)]
*  And basically at that very core level, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2749.24s)]
*  get electrons moving and the brown fat in term [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2751.4s)]
*  activates the thermogenic system and starts heating you up. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2755.04s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2758.8399999999997s)]
*  And then what's beautiful is that the brown fat [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2759.68s)]
*  has a sort of memory of that experience. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2761.9s)]
*  So even after you get out, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2764.0s)]
*  you're walking around right now. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2765.58s)]
*  I did cold plunge this morning. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2766.68s)]
*  You did cold plunge this morning, right? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2767.64s)]
*  So your body temperature is about one to three degrees hot, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2769.6800000000003s)]
*  or probably about one or two degrees hotter [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2773.36s)]
*  than it normally would be. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2775.08s)]
*  Dopamine's getting cranked out. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2776.26s)]
*  And so all day long, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2778.08s)]
*  you're warmer at, let's say, cool ambient temperature. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2779.84s)]
*  In fact, in Scandinavia, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2783.88s)]
*  I learned this in researching the Soberg work. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2785.0s)]
*  I went deep into this cold thermogenesis world over there [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2787.4s)]
*  that they've been researching this really carefully. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2791.08s)]
*  And they have a saying in Norway, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2793.1600000000003s)]
*  I obviously don't know it in Norwegian, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2794.7400000000002s)]
*  but it translates to essentially in the spring [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2796.2000000000003s)]
*  as it's getting warmer in Texas. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2798.98s)]
*  What you want to do is to put, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2801.16s)]
*  they say put on more layers. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2803.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2805.42s)]
*  So that you can prepare yourself [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2806.2400000000002s)]
*  for being able to cool yourself off easily in the summer [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2807.7400000000002s)]
*  when it's really hot. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2811.08s)]
*  You'll be more comfortable in the heat of summer in Texas [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2811.96s)]
*  if you bundle up a bit more in the spring. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2815.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2817.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, you're adapting. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2818.18s)]
*  And then they say the opposite too. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2819.62s)]
*  That just sounds annoying. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2820.46s)]
*  But then they say in the fall, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2822.34s)]
*  what you're supposed to do [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2823.82s)]
*  is not walk around with a sweater, you wear a t-shirt, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2824.7400000000002s)]
*  and then guess what? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2827.3s)]
*  In the winter, you're thermogenically. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2828.14s)]
*  How about just fucking wear clothes for the weather? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2829.62s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2831.7s)]
*  Look, I get the whole idea of sauna and cold plunge [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2832.7s)]
*  and adapting your body, but now we're just, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2836.1s)]
*  I think too much of this is mental masturbation [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2839.74s)]
*  for some people. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2841.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, let me be clear. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2842.64s)]
*  It's the principle. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2843.48s)]
*  It's the principle. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2844.5s)]
*  I understand the science behind it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2845.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not saying wear a sweatshirt in the spring. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2847.14s)]
*  Just wear what's comfortable, Jesus Christ. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2849.42s)]
*  What I'm saying is that when we, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2851.3799999999997s)]
*  what's, Jamie's laughing. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2853.14s)]
*  He's from Ohio. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2855.2999999999997s)]
*  They're just like, this is ridiculous. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2856.14s)]
*  That's cold enough out there. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2857.82s)]
*  You don't need to plunge. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2858.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm from Boston. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2859.54s)]
*  Well, I think the principle is what's interesting, right? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2860.38s)]
*  Is that if you teach your body to tolerate warm, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2864.02s)]
*  then you will be more comfortable in very hot. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2867.84s)]
*  It's sort of obvious and vice versa for cold. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2871.32s)]
*  Well, I certainly think that there's a great benefit [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2874.2200000000003s)]
*  to being able to tolerate temperatures, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2876.1200000000003s)]
*  whether it's cold temperature or warm temperature, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2877.94s)]
*  because I think there's a mental resiliency aspect to it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2880.1400000000003s)]
*  What's interesting to me is when I get out of the cold, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2883.46s)]
*  my entire body, my skin is bright red, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2886.28s)]
*  where your body's trying to heat itself up, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2890.84s)]
*  because you're in there for three minutes, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2893.1000000000004s)]
*  or I'm in there for three minutes. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2894.36s)]
*  But when I get out of the sauna, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2895.6400000000003s)]
*  generally I stretch and my house is warm, right? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2897.48s)]
*  And at nighttime, I do the sauna in the house. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2901.5s)]
*  And when I'm stretching, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2904.0800000000004s)]
*  within a minute or two minutes after the sauna, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2905.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm fucking freezing, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2907.6800000000003s)]
*  because my body's trying to cool off so quickly, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2909.4s)]
*  because it's gone through the whole 25 minute session. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2912.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, the contrast of heat and cold [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2915.52s)]
*  is we know very good for our cardiovascular system, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2917.44s)]
*  because we think of the blood vessels and capillaries [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2920.72s)]
*  and arteries as just tubes, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2923.2s)]
*  but they're really cells, endothelial cells. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2924.48s)]
*  They're laid out like silly putty, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2926.24s)]
*  linking them all like tubes, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2927.52s)]
*  and they are very contractile. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2928.48s)]
*  They need to do that [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2930.36s)]
*  because of the pulsing of blood through them. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2931.2s)]
*  That's the whole basis of systolic [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2932.36s)]
*  and diastolic blood pressure is the top measurement. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2933.84s)]
*  It's a pressure when it's not blood pumping through [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2935.92s)]
*  and it's pressure when it's relaxed, okay? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2938.68s)]
*  So this system can become very dynamic, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2940.36s)]
*  you don't want it rigid, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2945.48s)]
*  especially given what Atiya tells us, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2946.84s)]
*  and I believe him is that the number one killer [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2949.24s)]
*  in the world is cardiovascular disease [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2950.7599999999998s)]
*  or cerebrovascular disease. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2952.44s)]
*  You want the little micro capillaries of your body [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2953.56s)]
*  to be very flexible, not rigid. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2955.36s)]
*  So when you go heat cold, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2957.7599999999998s)]
*  you're basically going vasoconstriction dilation, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2959.64s)]
*  vasoconstriction dilation. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2961.68s)]
*  I'm not talking about heat cold, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2962.64s)]
*  I'm just talking about heat and stretching, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2964.08s)]
*  just getting out of it. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2965.8s)]
*  My body cools itself off and I get really cold [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2967.0s)]
*  in like five minutes. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2970.16s)]
*  So that could be the drop, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2971.2s)]
*  which is when your blood goes to the center of your body [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2972.64s)]
*  to preserve your core organs [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2976.56s)]
*  and then the surface of your body is cold. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2978.12s)]
*  And then as you start to heat up again [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2980.2799999999997s)]
*  and there's vasodilation and it goes out to the surface, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2982.72s)]
*  your surface is cold and it actually cools the blood [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2985.3599999999997s)]
*  at the surface and that's what's called the drop. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2988.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's when your body temperature goes down. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2990.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, once you put on clothes and head to your workout [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2993.2s)]
*  or head to work, what's gonna happen is [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2995.7599999999998s)]
*  your body temperature is now going to increase more quickly. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=2997.7999999999997s)]
*  It normally would do that anyway early in the day. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  As you wake up, your body temperature goes up, up, up, up, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3002.2s)]
*  and then whenever you achieve sort of a dip in energy [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3004.4399999999996s)]
*  in the afternoon, there's probably one time in the afternoon, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3008.48s)]
*  whether or not you need a nap or not, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3010.7999999999997s)]
*  that you feel a little bit lethargic [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3012.7999999999997s)]
*  and then you kind of come back. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3014.2799999999997s)]
*  That represents the peak in your body temperature [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3016.2799999999997s)]
*  for 24 hours. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3019.2s)]
*  In fact, most people, if they want to figure out [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3020.6s)]
*  their sort of optimal bedtime, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3022.24s)]
*  I know this gets pretty down in the weeds, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3023.68s)]
*  you just look at that number. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  So maybe it's three o'clock and you say about seven hours [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3027.04s)]
*  after that, plus or minus an hour. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3029.7599999999998s)]
*  That's probably when somebody should go to sleep. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3031.8s)]
*  How do I know that? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3033.4s)]
*  Because that's when body temperature starts dropping [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3034.4s)]
*  by one to three degrees. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3036.0s)]
*  So doing cold early in the day makes total sense. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3037.52s)]
*  Doing cold, deliberate cold exposure before a workout, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3040.4s)]
*  total sense. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3043.28s)]
*  Doing sauna before sleep, total sense. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3044.52s)]
*  The cold in the morning, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3047.0800000000004s)]
*  the other thing that it does when I get out [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3048.4s)]
*  is it makes me like really fucking happy, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3049.96s)]
*  which is what you were talking about [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3053.32s)]
*  with the dopamine raise. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3054.36s)]
*  It's so significant. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3055.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it really, it is a joy of life feeling. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3057.1600000000003s)]
*  And then as I start my workout, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3061.16s)]
*  I generally start really slow. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3063.2s)]
*  I just do like a lot of like shadow boxing [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3064.96s)]
*  and maybe I'll skip a little rope [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3067.56s)]
*  to try to get my blood up. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3069.48s)]
*  And then once I've do that for a few minutes, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3071.3199999999997s)]
*  then I have a series of a hundred pushups [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3073.04s)]
*  and a hundred body weight squats that I do every day. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3075.36s)]
*  So I go through that and that's my warmup [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3077.04s)]
*  for everything else. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3079.24s)]
*  Cause it's pretty low stress, low impact, very easy to do. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3080.08s)]
*  And then by the time the hundred is, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  a hundred squats and a hundred pushups are done, I'm warm. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3085.7999999999997s)]
*  And then I start whatever workout I'm gonna do. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3088.36s)]
*  But God damn, I feel happy. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3090.16s)]
*  That is the people that are trying to avoid it [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3092.2s)]
*  because oh, you're fucking, you doesn't do anything. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3095.16s)]
*  Shut up, just do it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3098.3199999999997s)]
*  Stop your excuses and stop arguing about it. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3100.3599999999997s)]
*  You're only arguing about it [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3103.3199999999997s)]
*  because you don't want to experience discomfort. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3104.8399999999997s)]
*  I know what you're doing. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3106.68s)]
*  You know what you're doing. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3108.48s)]
*  We all know what you're doing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3110.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3111.3599999999997s)]
*  Just get in there. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3112.92s)]
*  Just do it. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3114.24s)]
*  It's great for everybody. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3115.12s)]
*  And if you can't fucking handle it, don't talk about it, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3116.84s)]
*  but don't pretend that it's not good for you. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3120.36s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3122.44s)]
*  It's one of the most, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3123.92s)]
*  you could sell that shit in a pill. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3124.76s)]
*  It would be so valuable. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3126.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, how many people are on SSRIs [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3128.44s)]
*  and they're like, I kind of feel better. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3130.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, I completely agree with you. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3132.28s)]
*  Completely agree. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3134.0s)]
*  And I'm not, you know, again, Craig Heller [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3134.84s)]
*  in our biology department at Stanford [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3136.6400000000003s)]
*  has been talking in this general theme for a long time. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3138.08s)]
*  Anna Lemke, who you had on here, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3141.4s)]
*  talked about patients of hers who got sober [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3142.76s)]
*  using cold plunges. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3145.64s)]
*  You say, well, how do they get sober using cold plunges? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3147.24s)]
*  You just, you know, taking one addiction [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3149.64s)]
*  and replacing it with another. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3151.3599999999997s)]
*  No, what's very clear is that when you're suffering [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3152.4s)]
*  or you're lazy or you're procrastinating, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3155.92s)]
*  doing something that's harder than the state that you're in [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3158.64s)]
*  bounces you back much faster. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3161.72s)]
*  This is all based in the dynamics of dopamine. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3164.3199999999997s)]
*  It's sort of crazy. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3166.92s)]
*  You know how people are procrastinating [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3167.96s)]
*  to write something and they start cleaning the house? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3169.44s)]
*  Something they normally don't want to do. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3171.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, it's just something that's easier [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3173.3199999999997s)]
*  than the thing that you're supposed to do. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3174.84s)]
*  It turns out, and I learned this from Anna, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3177.6400000000003s)]
*  if you do something that's even harder [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3179.88s)]
*  than the thing that you're trying to avoid, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3182.08s)]
*  all of a sudden you're able to do that. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3184.36s)]
*  And you're like, oh, okay, well, it's just psychology, right? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3186.1200000000003s)]
*  No, it's not psychology alone. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3188.0s)]
*  It's psychology, but once dopamine is deployed [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3189.7200000000003s)]
*  at that level, you're a different person. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3192.44s)]
*  And I know this because if you take someone's dopamine [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3196.0s)]
*  and lower it, that makes them depressed. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3198.56s)]
*  That gives them, if you lower it even more [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3201.1200000000003s)]
*  you don't give them movement disorder, Parkinson's. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3202.96s)]
*  If you give them their dopamine back, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3205.2s)]
*  their focus increases. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3208.48s)]
*  How do I know that? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3209.52s)]
*  There's a reason there's an ADHD drug shortage right now. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3210.36s)]
*  Ritalin, Adderall, they all tap into this system, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3212.96s)]
*  the dopaminergic and adrenaline norepinephrine system. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3216.16s)]
*  So one of the most prescribed and over prescribed [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3219.28s)]
*  classes of drugs is a drug designed to try [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3221.84s)]
*  and get exactly this effect of cold plunges. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3224.32s)]
*  And so I completely agree. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3227.44s)]
*  If people would just take a very cold shower [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3228.76s)]
*  or a very cold plunger, a little bit longer [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3230.84s)]
*  at 50 degrees, but although I agree with you [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3233.7200000000003s)]
*  that shorter, colder is better. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3234.56s)]
*  What I didn't describe, and I'm not trying [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3237.0s)]
*  to rescue myself here, but I do that daily. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3238.76s)]
*  But then on Tuesdays is the typical day [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3241.32s)]
*  where I do very, very hot and very, very cold [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3243.6800000000003s)]
*  back and forth for well over an hour back and forth. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3246.38s)]
*  Yeah, you do that, that serious growth hormone [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3249.44s)]
*  increasing protocol. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3253.76s)]
*  I'm trying to condition myself to really be able [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3254.88s)]
*  to tolerate heat and cold. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3257.36s)]
*  The other thing I learned again from Susanna, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3258.76s)]
*  I take no credit for this is, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3260.48s)]
*  and I'm not suggesting people replace the cold plunge [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3263.12s)]
*  with this or a cold shower with this. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3265.5s)]
*  You're starting to see more of this on social media [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3267.52s)]
*  and it's embarrassingly silly to think [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3269.12s)]
*  that that's a replacement. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3271.28s)]
*  What I'm about to describe as a replacement for cold plunges. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3272.5s)]
*  But if you put, she taught me, she said, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3274.64s)]
*  if you even just put a small portion of your skin [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3277.68s)]
*  in ice cold water, like your hand or your arm, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3280.12s)]
*  you actually activate the brown fat system. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3282.86s)]
*  That's how robust this system of surface temperature [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3285.44s)]
*  to body is. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3288.04s)]
*  And so I don't think it's a good replacement, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3289.36s)]
*  but now you're seeing people saying, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3291.7200000000003s)]
*  oh, you just have to put your face in a bowl of ice water. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3293.6400000000003s)]
*  There was a device that was going around a while back [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3297.2000000000003s)]
*  that people were using when they were lifting weights [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3300.52s)]
*  where they're putting their hand into something [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3302.76s)]
*  that was freezing their hand [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3305.36s)]
*  and it increased their ability to do work [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3307.44s)]
*  quite substantially. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3309.92s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3310.96s)]
*  Yeah, so this was developed by Craig Heller's lab. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3311.8s)]
*  It's called the Cool Mitt. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3313.88s)]
*  It's a bit controversial and I'll tell you why. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3315.7200000000003s)]
*  So you have on the surface of your hands, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3318.12s)]
*  on the bottoms of your feet and on your upper face, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3321.3199999999997s)]
*  you have what's called glabrous skin. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3323.2799999999997s)]
*  It's the only skin on your body [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3324.92s)]
*  that's incapable of growing hair [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3326.2s)]
*  because there are no hair stem cells there. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3327.8399999999997s)]
*  It's also the place where, believe it or not, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3330.08s)]
*  it goes, normally things go arteries, veins, capillaries. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3332.08s)]
*  But in this case, you're missing one of those components. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3336.2799999999997s)]
*  And what it is is that the top of your face, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3338.46s)]
*  the palms of your hands and the bottom of your feet [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3340.8599999999997s)]
*  are like radiators. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3342.3399999999997s)]
*  You can heat passes out of your body very readily. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3343.2799999999997s)]
*  This is why animals like bears who are covered with hair [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3345.98s)]
*  will stand in cold water to cool off. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3348.44s)]
*  It's very effective. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3350.26s)]
*  It's also true that if you want to heat up, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3351.7s)]
*  you do it through these portals. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3353.38s)]
*  And so Craig's lab did two really important experiments. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3355.38s)]
*  The first one was heating people up. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3359.2s)]
*  It turns out when people come out of anesthesia, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3360.66s)]
*  it's very slow. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3362.62s)]
*  And this is a problem for all sorts of critical reasons [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3363.54s)]
*  related to keeping people alive. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3366.94s)]
*  And if you measure people's body temperature [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3369.52s)]
*  when they're coming out of anesthesia, it's very low. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3371.46s)]
*  And as it heats up, they wake up just like out of sleep. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3373.38s)]
*  His laboratory developed these heating devices [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3376.58s)]
*  that would heat people's palms or the bottoms of their feet. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3380.6400000000003s)]
*  And they found that they could bring them out of anesthesia [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3382.7000000000003s)]
*  much faster and recovery rates were much better. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3384.84s)]
*  Super impressive result, not talked about often enough. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3387.44s)]
*  And the reason it's not talked about often enough [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3390.38s)]
*  is all this stuff around thermogenic studies [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3392.84s)]
*  was really hot in like the 19, no pun, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3395.0s)]
*  in the, sorry, in the 50s, 60s, 70s. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3398.3s)]
*  And then it was sort of considered kind of like not lame, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3401.66s)]
*  but it wasn't hot science. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3404.42s)]
*  There I go again. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3406.14s)]
*  I'm really not trying to pun here. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3407.14s)]
*  Then what's happened in recent years [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3410.72s)]
*  is people have gotten into these protocols [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3412.8599999999997s)]
*  and it's become more popular. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3414.5s)]
*  His laboratory also showed that one of the reasons [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3415.58s)]
*  why we fail on like a set of dips or chins, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3418.94s)]
*  local muscular failure is due to heating of the muscle [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3421.8199999999997s)]
*  locally due to work. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3425.02s)]
*  And then there's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3426.46s)]
*  which is very heat dependent. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3429.2599999999998s)]
*  When your muscle gets too hot, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3430.7s)]
*  pyruvate kinase can't function and your muscle fails. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3433.3199999999997s)]
*  It's one of the reasons you fail on a set. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3435.8599999999997s)]
*  So what they figured out was if you cool people's [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3438.1s)]
*  core body temperature, they can do more work. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3440.3399999999997s)]
*  Now it got a little confused. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3443.5s)]
*  People say, oh, I didn't double my bench press [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3444.8599999999997s)]
*  after cooling my hands. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3446.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's not really the point. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3447.7799999999997s)]
*  The point is that let's say you can do 10 sets of 10 [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3449.3399999999997s)]
*  at a given weight with two minutes of rest in between. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3451.54s)]
*  And that's all you can do. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3454.8399999999997s)]
*  And you're hitting failure, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3456.54s)]
*  maybe you have to adjust the weight down [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3457.74s)]
*  on sets four, five, six, et cetera, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3458.9s)]
*  classic 10 sets of 10 that I don't know if people [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3460.7000000000003s)]
*  do German volume training or five sets of five. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3463.3s)]
*  If you lower the core body temperature [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3465.86s)]
*  through the proper use of Palmer cooling as it's called, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3468.42s)]
*  or through some other device, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3472.02s)]
*  what you find is people can continue to get the same number [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3473.42s)]
*  of repetitions provided they keep the rest the same [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3475.86s)]
*  and they can double the amount or more of work [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3478.02s)]
*  that they're doing total. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3480.86s)]
*  So they can increase their volume. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3482.1600000000003s)]
*  The interesting thing is they preserve the training effect. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3483.6600000000003s)]
*  So if you can go from doing, I don't know how many dips, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3487.18s)]
*  I saw you do a bunch of pushups right there [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3490.06s)]
*  on a podcast recently, you did like 75, right? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3491.4199999999996s)]
*  So in theory, if we'd been cooling your palms, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3494.4199999999996s)]
*  you would have been able to keep going much longer, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3497.2799999999997s)]
*  possibly 150. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3500.2599999999998s)]
*  And you say, well, how could that be? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3501.58s)]
*  Well, it's just a, it's a local change [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3502.74s)]
*  in the enzymatic reaction at the level of muscle. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3504.58s)]
*  Now, the problem with Palmer cooling is people will go out [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3506.8599999999997s)]
*  there and say, I'm going to hold ice packs. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3509.8599999999997s)]
*  But if you do that, you'll constrict the portals. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3511.3199999999997s)]
*  It has to be the right temperature [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3513.66s)]
*  so that you can continue to pass cool in. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3514.98s)]
*  And that's why it requires a device to heat, excuse me, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3516.42s)]
*  to cool your palms, but not so cold that you vasoconstrict. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3521.1s)]
*  And so there is the cool mitt device, to be honest, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3524.54s)]
*  is it a very effective device? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3527.9s)]
*  They've never been very effective at marketing that device, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3529.82s)]
*  but they use athletes at Stanford use it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3532.94s)]
*  But nowadays what athletes mainly are doing, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3534.94s)]
*  and I talked to pro basketball players, football players, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3536.82s)]
*  tier one military, they're doing cold before their training [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3539.86s)]
*  because it's just simpler and you don't need a device. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3543.52s)]
*  Inter workout or intra workout cooling [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3546.7599999999998s)]
*  is really an interesting topic, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3549.32s)]
*  but it hasn't been perfected at the level of devices. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3551.44s)]
*  They're still kind of clunky. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3553.72s)]
*  You got to go put your hand in the thing. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3555.08s)]
*  No knock on cool mitt. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3556.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think they're trying really hard. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3557.68s)]
*  I actually got one for Cam [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3560.3s)]
*  that I still need to deliver to him. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3561.56s)]
*  Well, what if someone just is in the middle of a workout [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3563.2s)]
*  and they just get in a cold plunge for five seconds? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3566.24s)]
*  Yeah, you need to lower your core body temperature. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3569.02s)]
*  So in- [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3571.7999999999997s)]
*  20 seconds, half hour? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3573.04s)]
*  Like how long you're in there for? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3575.16s)]
*  Probably, here's what I think could really help [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3576.6s)]
*  and you could try it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3579.2s)]
*  If you don't have access to a cool mitt, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3581.0s)]
*  and I can get you one for you to try, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3582.52s)]
*  but if you hold on, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3583.7599999999998s)]
*  you'd want to hold something cold between your hands [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3585.24s)]
*  for maybe 20, 30 seconds. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3587.64s)]
*  Well, just dunk your hand into the cold plunge. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3589.3199999999997s)]
*  You could do that too. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3591.08s)]
*  If you have your cold plunge right there. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3592.24s)]
*  Yeah, my cold plunge is right next to the gym. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3593.3199999999997s)]
*  I could just dunk my hands in there. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3594.96s)]
*  Yeah, the relationship between temperature and sleep, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3596.3199999999997s)]
*  temperature and the deployment of these neurochemicals, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3598.72s)]
*  temperature and performance is one of these variables [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3602.2s)]
*  that right now professional sports teams [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3605.24s)]
*  and tier one military and scientists [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3607.68s)]
*  are really starting to understand, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3609.72s)]
*  like this is not a small variable. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3610.9599999999996s)]
*  This is a super powerful variable. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3612.9199999999996s)]
*  It's just not an easy one for the conventional gym to have. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3615.16s)]
*  Maybe at some point in the future, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3618.08s)]
*  every state they'll have stations in the gym [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3619.3999999999996s)]
*  where you kind of plug in. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3621.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3622.3999999999996s)]
*  And you can just do more work. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3623.4399999999996s)]
*  It's all about the ability to do more work. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3625.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and recover. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3627.8s)]
*  And recover. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3629.52s)]
*  And it's clear that the cold after training is, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3630.36s)]
*  if your goal is to train again, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3633.2000000000003s)]
*  well, then you want inflammation down. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3635.0800000000004s)]
*  But if your goal is to improve as a consequence [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3636.44s)]
*  of that training session, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3638.44s)]
*  you have to be careful how much you're blocking [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3639.76s)]
*  the inflammation. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3640.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of Jiu-Jitsu guys [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3641.8s)]
*  like to do cryotherapy post-training [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3643.44s)]
*  and they say that it helps tremendously. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3646.0s)]
*  And because of that reduction of inflammation, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3647.76s)]
*  because you're not really training for hypertrophy, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3650.28s)]
*  you're training for volume and work [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3652.2400000000002s)]
*  and cardiovascular function [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3654.2400000000002s)]
*  and your ability to execute techniques [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3657.24s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3659.16s)]
*  I mean, the ability to do more work [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3660.4s)]
*  is I think one of the not so secret secrets [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3662.32s)]
*  of performance enhancing drugs too. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3665.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's everything. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3666.6s)]
*  Even at the level of being able to get [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3668.84s)]
*  a really good night's sleep [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3670.56s)]
*  even when you're slightly over-trained. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3671.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3673.24s)]
*  You know, people always say, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3674.08s)]
*  well, what are these performance, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3674.92s)]
*  do steroids make you grow muscle? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3676.28s)]
*  Well, they'll increase protein synthesis. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3678.12s)]
*  Well, look at Lance Armstrong. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3679.88s)]
*  I mean, he was on steroids and he was rail thin. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3681.24s)]
*  It's not about that. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3683.44s)]
*  It's about recovery. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3684.56s)]
*  Yeah, he could just do- [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3685.72s)]
*  But what do you ask your body to do? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3686.56s)]
*  He could just do more work. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3688.04s)]
*  Yeah, way more work. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3689.16s)]
*  And I, for all I know, I believe he's natural, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3690.48s)]
*  but like you think about a guy like Floyd Mayweather [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3693.7599999999998s)]
*  and I used to see him running in the middle of the night [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3695.8399999999997s)]
*  and you know, it's Vegas. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  If his testosterone happens to be exceedingly high, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3700.08s)]
*  naturally, he can do more work and recover [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3702.72s)]
*  than the person whose testosterone is lower [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3705.7999999999997s)]
*  before they hit a wall. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3709.12s)]
*  So I'm not saying he was using anything. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3710.8799999999997s)]
*  What I'm saying is if somebody is, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3712.48s)]
*  has higher levels of circulating testosterone, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3714.6s)]
*  male or female, they can do more work and recover. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3716.64s)]
*  That's just the way it is. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3719.52s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3720.88s)]
*  Floyd Mayweather reportedly took banned IV [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3721.7999999999997s)]
*  prior to Manny Pacquiao fight. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3724.16s)]
*  So banned, but this is banned IV for what? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3726.04s)]
*  It might be banned IV just because [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3728.7999999999997s)]
*  they had some sort of protocol set for, yeah, C-USADA. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3732.24s)]
*  So USADA is, they're the ones who regulate the UFC testing [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3737.72s)]
*  and they use, they won't allow people to use IVs [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3742.52s)]
*  because IVs will allow you to mask whether or not [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3747.12s)]
*  you've done performance enhancing drugs. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3749.84s)]
*  I don't think it was just that. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3752.64s)]
*  I think it was, he tested positive for something. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3756.04s)]
*  I mean, amphetamines cause a, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3759.0s)]
*  it's gonna vary by dose, et cetera, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3761.04s)]
*  but at least a thousand fold increase [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3762.44s)]
*  in basal catecholamine levels. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3765.8s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3767.72s)]
*  How many people do you know that are on Adderall? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3768.56s)]
*  In the, I don't have a lot of friends in the finance world, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3770.92s)]
*  but of the ones that are, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3775.84s)]
*  the friends I have who are in finance, 100%. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3778.04s)]
*  The scientists I know, zero, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3783.16s)]
*  but scientists generally aren't of the Adderall type. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3785.36s)]
*  Musicians, not so much. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3788.88s)]
*  Those are kind of the categories. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3791.48s)]
*  And podcasters, I don't know how many. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3792.6s)]
*  Quite a few podcasters. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3794.64s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are journalists that are on it. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3796.32s)]
*  A lot of writers and journalists are on it. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3800.36s)]
*  I've been shocked when I talk to these people. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3802.8s)]
*  You know my feeling about writers and journalists. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3805.7200000000003s)]
*  What's your feeling? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3808.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't know if we bring this up or not, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3809.6s)]
*  but I think the tides have changed in recent years [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3811.6s)]
*  and conventional media has, is used to kind of, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3815.1200000000003s)]
*  they email you, they want a conversation. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3820.1200000000003s)]
*  I think sometimes they're surprised you don't leap [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3822.84s)]
*  to have that conversation. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3824.52s)]
*  I think one of the problems with the traditional press [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3826.88s)]
*  is that it's hard to know where their heart is, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3829.96s)]
*  or where they are on a topic. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3834.0s)]
*  And so conversations with them have become [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3835.6s)]
*  a bit of a razor's edge, frankly. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3838.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, they're also deeply influenced by money. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3840.16s)]
*  That raccoon dog thing, I guarantee you, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3845.48s)]
*  there are some people behind the scenes [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3848.32s)]
*  that are trying to come up with some sort of [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3850.04s)]
*  a plausible scenario that's alternative [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3851.7200000000003s)]
*  to the lab leak theory. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3854.52s)]
*  And that's why they're coming up with this. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3855.88s)]
*  The people that I've talked to that understand this, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3857.92s)]
*  I've had many conversations with virologists [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3860.1600000000003s)]
*  and evolutionary biologists who explain to me [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3863.76s)]
*  why this is most likely a lab leak. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3867.48s)]
*  No one has, they're not arguing with this. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3870.1200000000003s)]
*  So when someone comes along with this, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3873.28s)]
*  and they're saying, oh, we found it, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  like, no you didn't, no, you know you didn't. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3876.6400000000003s)]
*  You're writing this article [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3879.6000000000004s)]
*  because you're being influenced to do so. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3881.28s)]
*  Like someone is telling them [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3883.44s)]
*  that this is a good thing to put out. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3885.72s)]
*  Someone is giving them information and saying, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3887.9199999999996s)]
*  we believe this and you should print this. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3890.8399999999997s)]
*  And there's money behind that [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3894.6s)]
*  that doesn't reach independent journalism. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3898.0s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3900.2s)]
*  Like the amount of money behind an advertisement [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3901.12s)]
*  that goes to CNN or an advertisement [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3904.44s)]
*  that goes to the New York Times, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3906.64s)]
*  it's a different thing than what goes to Breaking Points [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3908.12s)]
*  with Crystal and Sager, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3911.16s)]
*  than what goes to Matt Taibbi's Substack. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3912.12s)]
*  There's none there, there's no influence there. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3914.8s)]
*  These people are influenced by gigantic corporations. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3917.1600000000003s)]
*  That's why they put out articles that are not plausible. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3920.7200000000003s)]
*  That's why people don't trust them anymore. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3924.0s)]
*  That's why people think they're fucking shady. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3926.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, you're right. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3929.2000000000003s)]
*  They're incentivized by a whole set of things [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3930.92s)]
*  that are not obvious from the articles themselves. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3933.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of what Sager and Crystal have done [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3935.52s)]
*  and are doing. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3938.04s)]
*  Me too. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3939.0s)]
*  Huge fan. It's incredible. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3939.84s)]
*  It's incredible and it's important. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3940.88s)]
*  And they're so fucking honest. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3942.7200000000003s)]
*  They give you what is their actual take [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3945.52s)]
*  on whatever is going on in the news [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3948.68s)]
*  and it's well researched. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3950.8399999999997s)]
*  And the fact that that exists now is so important [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3952.68s)]
*  because if it was not for independent journalism, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3956.64s)]
*  we would be in a pickle. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3959.94s)]
*  We would be in a really bad state [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3961.64s)]
*  because a lot of people got duped by the pharmacy, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3963.52s)]
*  the pharmacological industry, the pharmaceutical industry, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3966.48s)]
*  the medical industry, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3970.72s)]
*  military industrial complex. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3973.16s)]
*  They've been duped by so many different companies [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3974.96s)]
*  and corporations that have a vested interest [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3978.8799999999997s)]
*  in getting one narrative out. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3981.64s)]
*  And if you can get that narrative out [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3984.08s)]
*  through the traditional pipelines of mainstream media [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3985.8399999999997s)]
*  with no one fact checking, no one interfering, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3988.64s)]
*  no independent journalist saying, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3992.56s)]
*  actually, that's not true at all. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3994.24s)]
*  Here's why they did that. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3995.7599999999998s)]
*  This was the influence. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3997.24s)]
*  Here's where the money is. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3998.2599999999998s)]
*  We have emails. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=3999.3999999999996s)]
*  We can show you. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4000.4399999999996s)]
*  They were influenced. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4001.6s)]
*  If it wasn't for them, we would be fucked. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4003.2s)]
*  And it's one of the beautiful things [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4005.7599999999998s)]
*  about the internet today. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4007.12s)]
*  The internet today allows people like that to thrive [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4008.4s)]
*  because these mainstream media corporations are so corrupt. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4012.08s)]
*  They're so obviously indebted to the companies [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4016.7799999999997s)]
*  that pay for their advertising. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4019.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my initial experience of them [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4021.64s)]
*  was long before I had a podcast, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4024.48s)]
*  did an interview with traditional media, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4027.2999999999997s)]
*  and then it comes out and I was, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4029.48s)]
*  they didn't say anything bad, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4033.14s)]
*  but my quote was given to somebody else. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4035.44s)]
*  Their quote was given to me. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4037.6s)]
*  And then you say, and I wrote and said, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4039.2400000000002s)]
*  hey, this is factually incorrect. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4040.76s)]
*  I didn't say this. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4043.36s)]
*  First of all, I'm not a medical doctor. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4044.2000000000003s)]
*  They swapped the names either accidentally. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4046.52s)]
*  And then I got this, oh, well, kind of response, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4048.68s)]
*  like too late. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4052.02s)]
*  But when it's- No retraction. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4054.0s)]
*  No, and when it's your neck on the line, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4055.52s)]
*  it's your name. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4057.4s)]
*  In science, all we have is our reputation. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4058.22s)]
*  In science or in anything, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4060.2s)]
*  that's all we have is our reputation. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4061.4199999999996s)]
*  So it's a scary thing to hand that over to somebody. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4062.72s)]
*  So unless it's a particular few set of sources, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4065.3199999999997s)]
*  I generally decline traditional media conversations. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4068.2599999999998s)]
*  And now the fight isn't just for traditional, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4071.3399999999997s)]
*  over media traditional or independent, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4074.7599999999998s)]
*  the universities too, right? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4077.58s)]
*  We were asking, I have to say, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4079.02s)]
*  and this is not to be politically correct or incorrect. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4080.7s)]
*  Stanford has been very good [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4085.38s)]
*  about letting different faculty at Stanford [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4088.26s)]
*  voice their differing opinions on everything [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4090.6600000000003s)]
*  from COVID to politics. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4093.6600000000003s)]
*  There's a free speech, a right to free speech petition [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4097.22s)]
*  that's been going around the campus for a while. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4101.3s)]
*  And you can find this online. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4103.3s)]
*  Now, a lot of people also will hear things about, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4104.66s)]
*  oh, I hear on college campuses like Stanford, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4106.58s)]
*  you're getting a lot of pressure to do this [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4108.5s)]
*  or a lot of pressure to do that. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4110.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there are pressures from students and top down. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4111.3s)]
*  Listen, students are under pressure, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4114.86s)]
*  administrators are under pressure, faculty under pressure. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4116.299999999999s)]
*  But Stanford has been very good about allowing people [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4118.78s)]
*  to have their own independent social media channels [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4122.28s)]
*  and talk to the public the way they feel is best. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4125.42s)]
*  That's excellent. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4127.9s)]
*  And I have to say, it's one of the things [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4128.98s)]
*  that makes me really proud to be there. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4130.66s)]
*  It's an amazing place too. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4131.98s)]
*  But if you, and I'm not gonna throw out names here [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4133.62s)]
*  because it's not my place [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4136.299999999999s)]
*  and they should probably just come on the podcast separately, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4137.139999999999s)]
*  but you've got people at every end of the major debates [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4139.12s)]
*  out there about public health. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4142.94s)]
*  And everything in between on Twitter, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4144.6s)]
*  fewer on Instagram, but on Twitter, voicing their opinion. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4147.6s)]
*  And honestly, I think it's beautiful [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4150.46s)]
*  that they are allowed to do it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4152.56s)]
*  Well, they're allowed to now because Elon bought Twitter. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4154.200000000001s)]
*  But before Elon bought Twitter, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4157.240000000001s)]
*  people were being silenced for things [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4159.0s)]
*  that have been absolutely proven to be correct, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4160.52s)]
*  which is crazy. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4163.280000000001s)]
*  The value that he's given back to people [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4164.76s)]
*  in the last, what has it been, four or five months [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4167.360000000001s)]
*  since he's been in there is tremendous. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4169.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I remember people picking on, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4172.08s)]
*  oh, it's this feature, that feature, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4173.52s)]
*  we're gonna have to buy a verified check or whatever. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4174.92s)]
*  These things that when you compare that to the ability [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4177.96s)]
*  for people to have honest, open discourse, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4181.040000000001s)]
*  honest for them because there's no regulator. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4183.280000000001s)]
*  So that to me is incredible and fundamentally important. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4186.92s)]
*  He's given people their voice back. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4190.96s)]
*  And that includes both sides. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4192.88s)]
*  That's what's often not stated is that people [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4194.200000000001s)]
*  on both sides are starting to get the ax, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4196.240000000001s)]
*  mostly on one side, but it's really incredible. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4198.120000000001s)]
*  And I think we're, I'm hopeful. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4201.56s)]
*  I'm a live and let live type person. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4205.160000000001s)]
*  I really, as long as people aren't harming other people, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4207.240000000001s)]
*  I truly just encourage people to do [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4209.200000000001s)]
*  what feels right to them. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4211.4800000000005s)]
*  As we should all be. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4212.8s)]
*  As we should all be. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4213.96s)]
*  It's kind of bananas where we went between [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4214.8s)]
*  in the last few years. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4217.6s)]
*  But what's happened in health and public health, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4218.4800000000005s)]
*  I think is pretty remarkable and encouraging [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4220.52s)]
*  from my standpoint anyway, which is people now realize [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4223.320000000001s)]
*  that medical doctors have a certain type of information [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4226.320000000001s)]
*  that is extremely valuable. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4229.240000000001s)]
*  And they come in a range of flavors and qualities. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4230.68s)]
*  Same with psychologists, same with scientists, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4233.76s)]
*  same with public health officials, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4236.360000000001s)]
*  same with everything from your masseuse [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4238.08s)]
*  to your chiropractor. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4240.68s)]
*  Like there is a range of quality and expertise [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4241.64s)]
*  and orientation. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4244.240000000001s)]
*  And to silence any one of those at the exclusion [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4245.4400000000005s)]
*  of the others is not only foolish, it's dangerous. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4249.04s)]
*  And so I think there's no going back. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4252.56s)]
*  There's no going back. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4254.8s)]
*  Now people seek advice on multiple dimensions. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4256.08s)]
*  You know, a few years ago, if you said supplements, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4258.6s)]
*  people like, oh, that's expensive urine. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4260.4s)]
*  Well, that's true if you're talking [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4262.12s)]
*  about vitamins and minerals. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4262.96s)]
*  But how many people do I know who during the pandemic [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4263.799999999999s)]
*  started taking vitamin D, getting some sunshine? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4267.36s)]
*  What do you mean by that's true [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4270.12s)]
*  if you're talking about vitamins and minerals? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4271.08s)]
*  Well, I think when we hear the word supplements, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4272.599999999999s)]
*  it gets confusing for people. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4274.4s)]
*  I actually am wishing for a better word [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4275.719999999999s)]
*  because when people hear supplements, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4278.04s)]
*  they think vitamin minerals. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4279.24s)]
*  Isn't that just expensive urine? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4280.28s)]
*  But it's not. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4281.92s)]
*  Your body absorbs it if you take it with fat [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4282.759999999999s)]
*  and protein and carbohydrates. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4284.679999999999s)]
*  Right, and if you over ingest fats, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4286.4s)]
*  excuse me, water soluble vitamins, you will excrete some. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4289.24s)]
*  But then there's a whole category of supplements [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4291.88s)]
*  like food supplements, protein, et cetera. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4293.719999999999s)]
*  And then there's an entire category of compounds [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4295.599999999999s)]
*  that we call supplements that have nothing to do [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4298.639999999999s)]
*  with proteins, fats or carbohydrates, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4300.96s)]
*  vitamins or minerals, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4303.0s)]
*  things that are known to have very potent effects. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4304.44s)]
*  There's a reason why the National Institutes of Health [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4307.12s)]
*  has a division now simply for these types of studies. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4309.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4312.599999999999s)]
*  Things like ashwagandha can potently reduce cortisol. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4313.44s)]
*  It shouldn't be used long-term, but in the short-term, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4317.68s)]
*  this can be very beneficial for people, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4319.4400000000005s)]
*  especially late day, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4320.84s)]
*  because late day peaks in cortisol, not good for us. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4321.92s)]
*  We know this correlated with depression, anxiety, insomnia, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4324.68s)]
*  which then has a cascade of negative effects. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4327.400000000001s)]
*  Things like creatine, not just for, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4329.92s)]
*  we think creatine muscles, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4332.16s)]
*  and indeed it brings water into the muscles [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4333.72s)]
*  and make you stronger. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4335.400000000001s)]
*  Most of the data, clinical data on creatine [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4336.320000000001s)]
*  are to enhance forebrain function. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4338.52s)]
*  It's one- [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4340.200000000001s)]
*  It's a nootropic. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4341.04s)]
*  It's a nootropic, post-concussion, post-surgery, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4341.860000000001s)]
*  postpartum depression, headache, I mean, fish oils. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4345.92s)]
*  So there's this whole category of things that, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4349.32s)]
*  in theory, you could get from food, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4351.08s)]
*  but the volumes that you would have to eat [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4353.24s)]
*  and the sourcing is just impractical. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4355.16s)]
*  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4357.32s)]
*  I mean, there's rhodiola rosea, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4358.88s)]
*  which is reducing cortisol. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4360.28s)]
*  There's interesting data on that. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4362.0s)]
*  And then there's the stuff we've talked about before [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4363.32s)]
*  about hormone augmentation. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4365.08s)]
*  But for the typical person out there nowadays, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4366.36s)]
*  I think they're thinking about, well, what can I do? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4369.38s)]
*  What can I eat? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4371.9s)]
*  How can I take better care of myself? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4372.74s)]
*  Am I magnesium deficient or not? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4375.24s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4377.0199999999995s)]
*  But will taking some additional magnesium help me sleep? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4377.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4380.66s)]
*  Will it hurt me? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4381.5s)]
*  No. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4382.32s)]
*  Well, are you magnesium deficient? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4383.16s)]
*  Get your blood work done. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4385.96s)]
*  Like, if you want to find out that, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4387.48s)]
*  get your blood work done. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4388.8s)]
*  Everyone should have their blood work done. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4389.679999999999s)]
*  But I was curious about why you were saying [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4390.92s)]
*  that it's just expensive urine. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4393.16s)]
*  Oh, no, no, this is what other people have been saying. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4394.599999999999s)]
*  But they're wrong. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4396.88s)]
*  No, this is what, you know, when I was young, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4397.719999999999s)]
*  I got into this training and supplementation early [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4400.0199999999995s)]
*  and people would say, oh, it's just expensive urine. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4402.88s)]
*  Don't spend your money on that. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4405.2s)]
*  There are certain things, like within supplementation, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4406.48s)]
*  also the foundational supplementation, as I call it, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4409.72s)]
*  like things like athletic greens, right? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4412.14s)]
*  Or I guess they call it AG1 now. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4414.32s)]
*  Things that are in such combinations of herbs [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4415.76s)]
*  and plant-based compounds, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4418.24s)]
*  like you can't take them one by one. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4419.76s)]
*  And then other things like magnesiums for sleep [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4421.5199999999995s)]
*  or inositol and the date on depression [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4423.64s)]
*  or inositol and insulin sensitivity. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4426.08s)]
*  You know, the number of people that are out there [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4428.42s)]
*  who are pre-diabetic or type two diabetes, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4429.6s)]
*  of course they need to exercise and eat right. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4432.54s)]
*  But things like inositol can improve insulin sensitivity. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4434.4s)]
*  What is inositol? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4436.92s)]
*  Inositol is, it's similar to a vitamin, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4437.879999999999s)]
*  but it works in a pathway that makes cells [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4440.219999999999s)]
*  more insulin sensitive, which is good. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4441.839999999999s)]
*  So you can use the glucose and insulin that you make. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4444.08s)]
*  So you're not overproducing insulin. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4447.28s)]
*  Type two diabetes is essentially overproduction of insulin [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4448.719999999999s)]
*  because your cells aren't able to use the insulin [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4451.74s)]
*  that's around so you crank out more of it. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4454.0199999999995s)]
*  Type one diabetes, lack of insulin from the pancreas. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4455.32s)]
*  That's why people in Jaffa inject it, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4458.0199999999995s)]
*  who have type one diabetes. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4459.44s)]
*  So things like inositol. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4461.04s)]
*  I mean, and the list just goes on and on, you know? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4462.56s)]
*  And so to me, I think the view is changing, I hope, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4465.04s)]
*  that, you know, the idea previously was that [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4468.46s)]
*  before the pandemic, frankly, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4471.280000000001s)]
*  was that supplements are just kind of like [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4472.8s)]
*  nootropic that or, you know, it's kind of, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4474.72s)]
*  you don't need it. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4477.04s)]
*  I'm not saying you need it, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4478.0s)]
*  but they are a powerful argument to good sleep, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4478.96s)]
*  good nutrition, good training, good social connection. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4483.38s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to optimize. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4486.120000000001s)]
*  If you want to optimize. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4487.6s)]
*  The idea of needing it, like, what do you mean to exist? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4488.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4490.200000000001s)]
*  You can't just eat McDonald's and just live. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4491.04s)]
*  Like, if you want to optimize your health, yeah. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4492.68s)]
*  Supplements are very beneficial. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4494.84s)]
*  Very beneficial, but I think for you and me, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4496.4s)]
*  it's a duh, but I think for a lot of people out there, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4498.04s)]
*  they seem to think that there's something unique [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4501.8s)]
*  about prescription drugs [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4505.38s)]
*  that makes them better than supplements. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4507.48s)]
*  Well, that's because they've been lied to. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4510.16s)]
*  I mean, that's the real problem, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4512.0s)]
*  is that the corporations who control these prescription drugs [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4513.48s)]
*  and sell these prescription drugs [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4517.14s)]
*  and sell advertising on television [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4518.56s)]
*  have got it into people's heads. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4520.34s)]
*  That's why I was maddening [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4522.02s)]
*  when I had Peter Hotez on the podcast [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4523.360000000001s)]
*  and he was talking to me about the importance of vaccination. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4525.54s)]
*  I said, do you exercise? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4527.9400000000005s)]
*  How do you eat? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4529.66s)]
*  What did you take vitamins? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4530.58s)]
*  And there was zero going on with him. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4531.82s)]
*  He goes on walks occasionally. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4534.46s)]
*  I mean, there was eats, fucking junk food. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4536.4400000000005s)]
*  He wasn't taking vitamins. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4539.74s)]
*  You know, he told me that some internist told him [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4541.62s)]
*  to take vitamin D. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4544.9400000000005s)]
*  So he took that for a while. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4547.900000000001s)]
*  I'm like, for a while? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4549.16s)]
*  Vitamin D seems to have made it through the shoot, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4550.860000000001s)]
*  like where anyone will take it [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4552.58s)]
*  because it doesn't seem scary to them or something. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4554.02s)]
*  Well, there was a recent study that talked about people [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4555.58s)]
*  that died or were hospitalized from COVID [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4558.18s)]
*  and they could have prevented, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4560.9800000000005s)]
*  somewhere in the neighborhood, see if we can find this, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4562.660000000001s)]
*  was a very high number, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4564.620000000001s)]
*  a very high percentage of hospitalizations and deaths [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4566.18s)]
*  could have theoretically been prevented [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4570.18s)]
*  with vitamin D supplementation. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4573.38s)]
*  This was based on the number of people that were in the ICU [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4574.92s)]
*  that were deficient from COVID, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4578.06s)]
*  deficient from vitamin D, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4580.5s)]
*  that were in the hospital for COVID. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4582.099999999999s)]
*  And it was in the high 80s or in the low 80% rather. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4583.5s)]
*  And then they did this study showing [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4586.86s)]
*  what would have happened [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4589.7s)]
*  if they had just supplemented vitamin D. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4591.66s)]
*  I know many physicians. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4596.0599999999995s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4597.86s)]
*  New study reveals vitamin D in the body [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4598.7s)]
*  can significantly reduce the risk of severe outcomes [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4600.5s)]
*  for COVID-19. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4603.099999999999s)]
*  Does it have the numbers? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4604.179999999999s)]
*  What year is this from? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4605.54s)]
*  This is recent? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4607.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but this seems like a strange website, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4608.38s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4610.26s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4611.1s)]
*  I clicked quick because it said two weeks ago. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4611.9400000000005s)]
*  Original.newsbreak.com. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4613.26s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4615.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4618.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're selling something. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4619.58s)]
*  Little TikTok icon in the corner. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4620.42s)]
*  God, people are selling things. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4622.1s)]
*  It's so hard. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4623.38s)]
*  There's so many wacky websites. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4624.22s)]
*  You know what? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4626.02s)]
*  You don't know what's real. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4626.86s)]
*  I think that when I stepped back [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4627.7s)]
*  from what you were saying a few moments ago, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4629.86s)]
*  I think people need to remember that scientific journals, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4632.900000000001s)]
*  of which I'm on the advisory board of several [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4636.46s)]
*  and have been for a long time and are well-meaning things, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4638.46s)]
*  let's keep in mind they're run by people. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4642.46s)]
*  And the goal of those journals ultimately [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4645.18s)]
*  is to publish papers that are true [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4648.62s)]
*  but that get people to read them. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4650.7s)]
*  The more subscriptions, the more they sell, right? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4652.42s)]
*  So I have a good friend who is a senior editor [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4655.22s)]
*  at a journals, there's really only three top tier journals, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4658.18s)]
*  Nature, Cell, and Science. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4660.7s)]
*  And I asked him once, I said, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4662.3s)]
*  what determines whether or not one paper is accepted or not? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4664.38s)]
*  And he said, well, we get to determine, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4667.14s)]
*  obviously the reviewers have to give it thumbs up [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4669.34s)]
*  at some point, but we get to determine the direction [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4671.42s)]
*  that the journal wants to go. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4675.14s)]
*  So during the pandemic, there was enormous incentive [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4676.18s)]
*  for publishing papers in these journals [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4678.86s)]
*  that provided some either hope or fear [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4681.26s)]
*  or whatever it was exciting at the time [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4685.14s)]
*  because people were buying up these journals like crazy. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4686.82s)]
*  I mean, they have to pay their staff too. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4689.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's a business like anything else. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4690.66s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is, aside from the federal research budget, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4693.22s)]
*  which is frankly, we have a much greater budget [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4696.46s)]
*  than in other countries for research [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4700.820000000001s)]
*  relative to the total amount available, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4702.62s)]
*  but it's still very low compared to what we need. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4704.46s)]
*  But money is what drives research. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4707.46s)]
*  I mean, it's not going to, the more money you have, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4709.9800000000005s)]
*  the more margin for error you can have [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4712.26s)]
*  in terms of the people in your lab. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4714.14s)]
*  If you only have a million dollar a year operating budget, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4715.54s)]
*  it's a business, you can have two or three really good people [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4718.14s)]
*  and if someone's not so good, that's bad. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4720.700000000001s)]
*  If you have a giant budget, you can have 20 people [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4722.9s)]
*  and 10 of them can suck. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4726.82s)]
*  That's rare to see that. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4728.5s)]
*  Usually it's a mixture of competent to talented, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4729.58s)]
*  the occasional bad apple, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4732.219999999999s)]
*  and those bad apples are very, very dangerous. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4733.66s)]
*  And the bad apples I'm talking about [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4736.179999999999s)]
*  are not the kind of people [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4737.54s)]
*  that necessarily go around creating data out of nowhere. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4738.379999999999s)]
*  These are the people who slice off [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4742.5s)]
*  and make experiments that didn't work kind of disappear. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4744.66s)]
*  Oh, there was something wrong with that mouse. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4747.86s)]
*  That is a serious problem in science, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4749.7s)]
*  far more than fabrication of data. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4751.66s)]
*  And how often does that occur? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4753.5s)]
*  Oh, it's incalculable, but I would say that kind of, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4755.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been in laboratories big and small across my career. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4758.66s)]
*  I've been around them a lot. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4761.42s)]
*  Everyone in every field knows the papers that are like, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4762.86s)]
*  yeah, nobody believes that. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4765.42s)]
*  And these papers are influenced by money, generally? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4766.66s)]
*  Not directly. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4770.34s)]
*  So the PIs, the lab, this is the way it works. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4771.18s)]
*  The lab heads, to get to a position [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4773.42s)]
*  where you're running a laboratory at a major university [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4776.0199999999995s)]
*  or any university, frankly, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4778.66s)]
*  you have to love what you're doing. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4779.66s)]
*  You don't make a lot of money as a university professor. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4781.22s)]
*  There are incentives through things like companies [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4783.54s)]
*  and a lot of professors now have companies [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4786.46s)]
*  and we can talk about that. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4787.900000000001s)]
*  And that's complicated sometimes, not complicated. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4788.780000000001s)]
*  But the point is that they want to, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4791.34s)]
*  heads of labs want to make fundamental discoveries. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4793.900000000001s)]
*  They want to be true. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4796.0s)]
*  The three biggest fears for a real scientist [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4797.9800000000005s)]
*  are to get something wrong [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4800.54s)]
*  and to get it wrong for the wrong reasons. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4802.900000000001s)]
*  The wrong reasons would be someone comes to your laboratory [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4804.620000000001s)]
*  and sees an opportunity to please the PI. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4806.820000000001s)]
*  This is, I think, one of the major sources [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4809.26s)]
*  of error in science. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4810.9800000000005s)]
*  Someone, you get, publishing papers as a postdoc [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4811.900000000001s)]
*  is what gets you a job. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4814.900000000001s)]
*  So I've known over the years, postdocs, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4816.34s)]
*  and there's a lot of discussion about, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4818.860000000001s)]
*  this is inside ball of science, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4820.18s)]
*  where someone gets there and realizes [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4821.46s)]
*  that the head of this lab has a pet hypothesis [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4823.3s)]
*  that's really exciting to them. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4825.9400000000005s)]
*  Why is it exciting? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4827.3s)]
*  Because it's exciting. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4828.3s)]
*  They like the idea, but also, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4829.14s)]
*  it would allow them to renew their funding. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4830.26s)]
*  Yes, definitely, money's involved. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4832.02s)]
*  And then that person goes and does experiments [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4834.06s)]
*  and shows the PI, the experiments that work, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4836.54s)]
*  and doesn't show them the experiments that don't work, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4840.14s)]
*  and then tells themselves, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4841.62s)]
*  those experiments didn't work because, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4843.42s)]
*  you know, the centrifuge was off, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4845.1s)]
*  or the mouse was sick, or something, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4846.9800000000005s)]
*  gives themselves reasons why it was okay to remove data. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4848.58s)]
*  That occurs, I think, I'm going to guess here. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4853.1s)]
*  I don't know, but based on my observation, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4855.18s)]
*  that's probably about 10 to 15% [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4857.780000000001s)]
*  of the top tier published papers, I think, don't last, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4861.860000000001s)]
*  meaning in the years following, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4865.18s)]
*  they don't replicate and they go nowhere. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4866.58s)]
*  And I don't think it's because people made up data, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4868.02s)]
*  quote unquote. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4870.3s)]
*  I think it's because they threw out bad data, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4871.14s)]
*  or data that, excuse me, they threw out data [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4873.42s)]
*  that didn't fit their hypothesis and labeled it no good. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4875.540000000001s)]
*  That is very common. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4879.1s)]
*  Now, people who, quote unquote, fudge data, make up data, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4880.820000000001s)]
*  I would say that's 2%. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4884.22s)]
*  But that's the Alzheimer's study. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4886.740000000001s)]
*  Okay, so the Alzheimer's stuff [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4888.3s)]
*  was legitimately a data fraud issue. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4889.580000000001s)]
*  Which is really crazy. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4892.620000000001s)]
*  Which is really crazy. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4893.860000000001s)]
*  It lasted for so long before people discovered it. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4894.700000000001s)]
*  So then you say, why could that happen? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4897.34s)]
*  Because- [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4898.9400000000005s)]
*  Can you explain to people what happened? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4899.78s)]
*  Yeah, so basically the theory of Alzheimer's [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4900.62s)]
*  that's still very prominent is that it's the accumulation [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4904.900000000001s)]
*  of these things called Plaxentangles, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4907.14s)]
*  which you can see under the microscope. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4908.82s)]
*  And they've always been considered a signature [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4910.18s)]
*  that you can see with your eyes of neurodegeneration [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4914.22s)]
*  that's associated with Alzheimer's dementia. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4916.42s)]
*  And it's been the way that people have measured [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4918.3s)]
*  whether or not a treatment has worked or not worked [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4921.18s)]
*  whether or not it could decrease these Plaxentangles [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4923.900000000001s)]
*  in mouse tissue and sometimes in human tissue. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4927.780000000001s)]
*  Now we have to be clear that Plaxentangles [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4929.900000000001s)]
*  do accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4931.7s)]
*  and mice that have mutations [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4933.820000000001s)]
*  that make them kind of like good models for Alzheimer's. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4935.7s)]
*  But early on in the research on Alzheimer's, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4939.02s)]
*  so dating back well over a decade now, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4941.66s)]
*  there was basically a data fraud, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4944.06s)]
*  fudging of data we call it, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4946.34s)]
*  where someone essentially said that there was a label [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4947.7s)]
*  for a particular Plaxentangles protein [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4952.1s)]
*  that represented something that it didn't. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4954.620000000001s)]
*  And then what this has cascaded into over many, many years [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4957.620000000001s)]
*  is an entire set of theories about which drugs [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4961.26s)]
*  ought to be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4963.660000000001s)]
*  And I would say now trillions of dollars [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4965.820000000001s)]
*  put into research along those particular lines of inquiry. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4969.46s)]
*  So what we're basically saying is one mistake [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4972.9400000000005s)]
*  can cascade into a series of thousands [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4974.660000000001s)]
*  or tens of thousands of mistakes [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4977.34s)]
*  that can take a field really far astray. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4978.740000000001s)]
*  And that's what's happened now. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4982.02s)]
*  They realized that there was a problem with the early data. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4982.860000000001s)]
*  Now, the thing that's kind of baffling [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4984.900000000001s)]
*  is how the field continued down this path for so long [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4987.580000000001s)]
*  without actually considering alternative hypotheses [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4991.34s)]
*  with any seriousness. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4993.9400000000005s)]
*  Why somebody didn't say, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4995.46s)]
*  hey, let's go back and test the initial premise [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4996.42s)]
*  of all of this. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4998.34s)]
*  And part of that has to do with, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=4999.18s)]
*  biotech is neither good nor bad nor evil nor anything. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5001.22s)]
*  But it's a business. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5004.820000000001s)]
*  And there's a pretty quick runway [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5006.14s)]
*  from a big landmark discovery to a couple of verifications [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5008.5s)]
*  to people founding companies, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5012.54s)]
*  to big dollars coming in through investments. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5014.22s)]
*  And then, I mean, how many times have we been told [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5016.82s)]
*  blockbuster finding in mice? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5019.3s)]
*  And then people with Alzheimer's say, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5021.14s)]
*  well, when is there gonna be treatment? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5023.22s)]
*  10 years. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5024.54s)]
*  How long? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5025.38s)]
*  About 10 years. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5026.22s)]
*  This 10 years thing has been kicked down the road [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5027.04s)]
*  about for 50 years. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5029.26s)]
*  I mean, I've been in the research game 30 years, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5031.02s)]
*  close to it, you know? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5033.62s)]
*  And so many things have just been kicked down the road. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5035.1s)]
*  Now, there are kind of maverick folks within science [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5037.74s)]
*  who test very alternative hypotheses. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5040.94s)]
*  And they are really the heroes of science, in my opinion, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5043.139999999999s)]
*  because they're saying that's all fine and good, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5045.74s)]
*  or maybe it's all false. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5047.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5048.46s)]
*  I'm gonna go a different direction and explore. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5049.3s)]
*  But in the sociology of science and science funding, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5051.0599999999995s)]
*  it is very, very hard to impossible to get funding [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5053.54s)]
*  from the federal government [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5058.62s)]
*  to do truly high-risk pioneering science. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5060.0599999999995s)]
*  You might say like, how could that be? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5063.94s)]
*  In general, when you get funded by the government, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5065.54s)]
*  my lab has been funded by the government for many years, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5067.5s)]
*  you get funded for work that is already completed. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5069.54s)]
*  You show it to them in a grant. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5072.42s)]
*  You say, this is what I wanna do. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5073.72s)]
*  You get the money and wow, the paper comes out [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5075.46s)]
*  like the same year. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5077.9s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5078.74s)]
*  And then you use the money to fund the next thing. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5079.56s)]
*  Every card-carrying laboratory head knows this. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5081.1s)]
*  Why? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5084.38s)]
*  Because when you put in a grant that says, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5085.22s)]
*  this is a really exciting idea, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5086.78s)]
*  they're not gonna fund that. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5088.36s)]
*  So this is why philanthropy and private money [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5089.44s)]
*  comes into science [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5092.22s)]
*  and is very exciting and enticing to scientists [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5093.06s)]
*  because they can start testing things [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5095.18s)]
*  that the federal government funding bodies [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5097.26s)]
*  are just too conservative to test. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5099.4800000000005s)]
*  But that also leaves it open to manipulation by bad actors. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5101.280000000001s)]
*  The whole system is, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5104.9400000000005s)]
*  there's no way to bulletproof the system against bad actors, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5107.08s)]
*  meaning people who fudge data [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5109.66s)]
*  or I think the more sinister aspect of my field [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5111.38s)]
*  are these individuals who come to a laboratory and go, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5116.5s)]
*  I want a job. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5119.3s)]
*  Being a postdoc, you're not paid much. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5120.18s)]
*  Oftentimes they have families, they're under stress. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5122.08s)]
*  I'm not justifying their actions. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5123.820000000001s)]
*  And people go, how do you get the job at the best places? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5125.04s)]
*  Well, you get it by publishing papers [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5128.68s)]
*  in really great journals and with your name first. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5130.28s)]
*  So what does that lead to? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5133.08s)]
*  It leads to really high ambition people [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5134.18s)]
*  working very, very hard and science is hard. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5137.28s)]
*  A lot of experiments fail. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5139.64s)]
*  And some people will just figure out [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5140.96s)]
*  that if they can just give the lab director, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5143.22s)]
*  figure out their pet hypothesis, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5146.5199999999995s)]
*  like figure out what mommy and daddy like, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5148.44s)]
*  what mommy or daddy like most and give them those results, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5150.08s)]
*  those people get promoted very quickly. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5153.5s)]
*  Now, in the long run, they don't do well. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5156.58s)]
*  Or what you'll find is they often just switch [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5159.9s)]
*  to an entire new area of science when they start their lab. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5161.9s)]
*  They kind of get there. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5164.44s)]
*  And then years later, or even a year later, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5165.38s)]
*  you go, whatever happened to that result? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5167.26s)]
*  Well, if you ask people in the laboratory, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5168.74s)]
*  postdocs and graduate students, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5170.9s)]
*  it's sort of, I think probably like any career path, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5172.38s)]
*  they know the truth. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5175.18s)]
*  So if you ask them, what do you think of that paper? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5176.62s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, I don't know. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5178.14s)]
*  That means it's bullshit. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5179.86s)]
*  Shouldn't they be allowed to like have one of those [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5181.679999999999s)]
*  like witness things where they do their voice differently [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5184.16s)]
*  and shade their face? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5187.28s)]
*  Well, the problem is they're all colleagues. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5188.639999999999s)]
*  That study is bullshit. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5190.36s)]
*  Science is weird too, because unlike in UFC [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5191.679999999999s)]
*  or something like that, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5193.96s)]
*  everyone's really nice to each other's faces. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5194.92s)]
*  They're like, oh yeah, great to see you, great to see you. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5196.72s)]
*  Then you get the paper, anonymous peer review. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5198.5599999999995s)]
*  And then they're like, that's when people attack each other, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5200.72s)]
*  kill people's grants, kill people's papers. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5203.5599999999995s)]
*  Science is a, it's not a cutthroat game, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5205.639999999999s)]
*  but it's a very human game. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5208.08s)]
*  And now I also want to highlight, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5209.76s)]
*  cause I feel like as an ambassador for my field, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5211.64s)]
*  I do want to say that there are excellent scientists [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5213.8s)]
*  who care so very much about the truth [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5217.6s)]
*  and who go through every detail of every paper. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5219.84s)]
*  Their families suffer. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5223.72s)]
*  They, everybody suffers as the consequence [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5225.12s)]
*  of their neurotic tendency. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5227.4400000000005s)]
*  But those people are the heroes of science [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5228.68s)]
*  because they won't let something go to publication [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5231.0s)]
*  unless they know is absolutely watertight. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5234.360000000001s)]
*  I think what you said is very important [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5236.08s)]
*  and it's a very human thing. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5237.52s)]
*  Subject to human emotions and human instincts [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5240.0s)]
*  and ego and jealousy. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5242.5199999999995s)]
*  And a partner at home who's probably like, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5245.4s)]
*  hey, when are you going to get out of graduate school [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5247.0s)]
*  and we're going to actually move out [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5248.44s)]
*  of this one bedroom apartment where I want kids? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5249.36s)]
*  Or all our friends are like taking vacations into loom [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5251.48s)]
*  and we're like suffering here. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5254.599999999999s)]
*  And, or people who think, you know, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5256.28s)]
*  oh, you get a PhD and that guarantees a win. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5259.0s)]
*  I mean, all it does is give you the opportunity [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5261.0s)]
*  to keep competing. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5263.44s)]
*  So when you see people at the best institutions [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5264.48s)]
*  or even somebody at a, not one of the top, top institutions [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5267.44s)]
*  who's able to keep their lab funded [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5271.12s)]
*  over a long period of time, that says one of two things. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5272.599999999999s)]
*  It says they're either really good at picking questions [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5275.679999999999s)]
*  and being very consistent, or they are very good [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5279.24s)]
*  at hiring people that are extremely careful [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5283.4s)]
*  and hardworking or sometimes both. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5285.919999999999s)]
*  But listen, the bigger the labs, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5287.96s)]
*  the higher the probability of a bad apple. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5290.599999999999s)]
*  And it happens all the time, all the time. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5293.28s)]
*  It's just stunning when something like the amyloid plaques issue [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5296.0s)]
*  in terms of Alzheimer's is established and stays for so long. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5300.48s)]
*  Well, there was decades of like people were acting on that bad. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5306.48s)]
*  It wasn't just bad. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5313.84s)]
*  It was falsified data. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5314.72s)]
*  Well, it was truly falsified data. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5316.48s)]
*  And there's a whole other aspect to the sociology of science [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5318.72s)]
*  that I think is not often discussed, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5322.0s)]
*  which is that there's a huge incentive [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5324.28s)]
*  to being promoted by your elders, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5327.4s)]
*  by your graduate advisor and postdoc advisor, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5331.2s)]
*  because they are the ones that write the letters, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5333.24s)]
*  they get you promotions, et cetera. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5334.679999999999s)]
*  And so what tends to happen is people tend to continue [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5335.92s)]
*  to do science that pleases their elders. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5338.599999999999s)]
*  Now, for myself, I had both the curse and the blessing [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5341.12s)]
*  of my undergraduate advisor, graduate advisor, and postdoc. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5344.679999999999s)]
*  We're all incredible people and scientists in different ways. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5347.5199999999995s)]
*  I was very, very blessed. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5350.8s)]
*  But the first one killed himself. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5352.8s)]
*  He had a bad depression, killed himself. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5354.88s)]
*  Second one, cancer at 50. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5356.400000000001s)]
*  Third one had a heart attack across the desk from me, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5358.04s)]
*  first day of work at Stanford. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5361.08s)]
*  He was my postdoc advisor, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5362.400000000001s)]
*  eventually died of pancreatic cancer. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5364.4400000000005s)]
*  So the joke in my field is you don't want me to work for you. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5365.84s)]
*  Right? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5367.92s)]
*  Like it's like a death sentence. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5368.76s)]
*  Now they're all dead, but the good, you know, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5369.6s)]
*  is a terrible thing to be orphaned in science [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5371.6s)]
*  because promotions, things like that. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5373.400000000001s)]
*  Other people stepped in and helped me, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5375.16s)]
*  and I'm very grateful to those people. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5376.76s)]
*  But one of the blessings, the hidden blessings, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5378.4800000000005s)]
*  the silver lining in all this is like, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5380.84s)]
*  I didn't have to please anybody. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5383.52s)]
*  And so when it came time to do a podcast [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5384.84s)]
*  or to look at data or review a paper, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5387.280000000001s)]
*  I was not worried about pleasing anyone. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5389.76s)]
*  But prior to that, I'll tell you, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5392.400000000001s)]
*  I've been asked to write letters for people's tenure. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5394.240000000001s)]
*  You know, can this person have a job for life or not? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5396.280000000001s)]
*  They get 10 to 12 letters. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5398.4800000000005s)]
*  And I've had people say, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5400.280000000001s)]
*  hey, listen, we're having a really hard time [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5401.12s)]
*  getting letters for this person. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5402.84s)]
*  And you know, this person really needs tenure [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5404.64s)]
*  and they got a family and you know, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5406.92s)]
*  and you look at the work and you know, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5408.360000000001s)]
*  and you want to say no, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5410.320000000001s)]
*  because you don't want that person to review your paper [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5413.4400000000005s)]
*  and give an ax your next paper. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5415.68s)]
*  Now I've been very lucky because I don't, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5417.84s)]
*  first of all, I think it's maybe just the way I'm wired. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5420.84s)]
*  I just don't care about that aspect of human. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5423.76s)]
*  You know, I'm one of these people, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5426.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm sort of like my bulldog Costello was, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5427.320000000001s)]
*  like I'm going to go along with things [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5428.8s)]
*  until you try and push me. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5430.240000000001s)]
*  And then like I just have kind of a resistance thing. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5431.360000000001s)]
*  It's some developmental error or something, who knows. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5433.96s)]
*  But I think it's helped me a lot [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5437.360000000001s)]
*  because what I've told those people asking for letters [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5440.28s)]
*  is listen, I think they're not getting strong letters [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5442.679999999999s)]
*  because they're not good enough for tenure at this place. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5445.08s)]
*  But that is unusual. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5448.44s)]
*  Everyone plays this nice, nice game [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5449.92s)]
*  because when you're nice to people, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5451.88s)]
*  they think you get stuff. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5453.84s)]
*  And it creates a rather dark underbelly of science [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5455.0s)]
*  that people don't talk about. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5460.36s)]
*  So in this field of Alzheimer's, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5461.42s)]
*  what ends up happening, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5464.12s)]
*  what I think ended up happening was [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5465.28s)]
*  there was such incentive to go with the party line [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5466.759999999999s)]
*  and publish things that were validating of previous papers [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5469.56s)]
*  because let's be honest, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5472.04s)]
*  when you say nice things about other people in papers, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5473.120000000001s)]
*  it's easier to get your papers in. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5475.660000000001s)]
*  And you know, scientists on Twitter is changing things [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5477.64s)]
*  because now people will really pick apart a figure, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5480.68s)]
*  they'll really go after them. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5483.6s)]
*  I think it's great. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5484.64s)]
*  It's great. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5485.52s)]
*  It's great. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5486.34s)]
*  And I learned from you early on and from Lex early on, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5487.18s)]
*  if you're going to be out there as a scientist [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5489.56s)]
*  or on social media at all, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5491.080000000001s)]
*  you have to ignore a lot of stuff. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5493.240000000001s)]
*  But if there's something to pay attention to, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5495.240000000001s)]
*  like Lex and I talk about this, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5498.0s)]
*  he and I, I'll just reveal a writing an article [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5500.4s)]
*  for one of the nature journals [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5501.759999999999s)]
*  about science and social media. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5503.099999999999s)]
*  The journals are now starting to pay attention to podcasts. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5504.4s)]
*  And so conversation and being able [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5507.24s)]
*  to really rip something apart [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5510.5199999999995s)]
*  and having a pretty thick skin about it, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5512.08s)]
*  that's the nature of good science. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5513.599999999999s)]
*  And I think that that field of Alzheimer's [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5515.599999999999s)]
*  was all pre-social media [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5517.78s)]
*  and people knew there was bullshit in there [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5519.36s)]
*  and they just went along with it. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5522.2s)]
*  Whole companies were founded, investor money. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5523.5199999999995s)]
*  Where are those companies? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5525.599999999999s)]
*  Where are those drugs? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5526.44s)]
*  It's so sketchy. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5527.64s)]
*  And that's just one, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5528.56s)]
*  we're talking about the Alzheimer's thing, that's one. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5530.96s)]
*  And then the other one was connecting heart disease [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5533.0s)]
*  to saturated fat that was funded by the sugar companies [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5536.4800000000005s)]
*  in I believe the 1960s, right? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5539.96s)]
*  Was it in the 1960s? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5542.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is less in my wheelhouse, but the whole- [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5543.4800000000005s)]
*  It's also fraudulent work. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5545.92s)]
*  With a relationship between dietary cholesterol [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5547.400000000001s)]
*  and serum cholesterol doesn't exist. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5549.400000000001s)]
*  The relationship between saturated fat and serum cholesterol, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5551.240000000001s)]
*  however, I think there is a link there. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5554.8s)]
*  This is more at Tia's territory than mine. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5556.56s)]
*  But even the markers that he's really highlighted [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5558.6s)]
*  are so key, things like ApoB. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5562.04s)]
*  He's big on your ApoB level [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5563.72s)]
*  is a critical determinant of your longevity. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5565.64s)]
*  But what they were trying to do was take away the option [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5568.8s)]
*  that sugar was responsible. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5573.4800000000005s)]
*  And so they were putting an improper blame on other things. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5575.400000000001s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5580.8s)]
*  And they were just doing this funded by the sugar companies [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5581.64s)]
*  and it's transparent. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5584.160000000001s)]
*  And I think they were only paid like $50,000, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5586.12s)]
*  which is kind of crazy [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5588.48s)]
*  because it changed dietary guidelines for decades. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5589.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, scientists, I guess this is an opportunity [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5593.08s)]
*  to bring up Jeff Epstein. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5596.08s)]
*  So people sometimes wonder, like we're scientists [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5597.24s)]
*  hanging out with him to get with these young women [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5602.04s)]
*  or something, I know scientists. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5605.44s)]
*  There are some scientists like that. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5606.92s)]
*  They were spending time with him [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5608.719999999999s)]
*  because he was giving their laboratories money [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5610.5199999999995s)]
*  that they didn't have to write grants for. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5612.759999999999s)]
*  Why was he doing that though? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5614.4s)]
*  Oh, they're very strong opinions. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5615.839999999999s)]
*  I never met him. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5619.719999999999s)]
*  I know people who knew him, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5620.839999999999s)]
*  but he clearly understood social engineering. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5623.44s)]
*  He understood that rich people have, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5628.2s)]
*  they can get anything they want, anything they want, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5630.719999999999s)]
*  except the one thing they can't easily control [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5633.799999999999s)]
*  is their reputation. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5636.599999999999s)]
*  Cause that requires other people's perceptions [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5637.5199999999995s)]
*  and just being rich doesn't make you necessarily respected [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5640.36s)]
*  by certain people, yes, by certain people, no. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5644.04s)]
*  So he understood that very wealthy people [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5645.5199999999995s)]
*  feel more important and can derive more sense [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5647.96s)]
*  of self-respect when they're surrounded by brilliant people. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5651.68s)]
*  And he was very good at bringing truly brilliant people [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5655.0s)]
*  into that mix. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5658.5199999999995s)]
*  People like Murray Gell-Mann who discovered the quark, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5659.36s)]
*  he's a particle physicist, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5661.88s)]
*  head of the Santa Fe Institute, Nobel Prize. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5663.72s)]
*  I mean, Gell-Mann used to pick on Richard Feynman. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5665.5199999999995s)]
*  He was one of the few people who could, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5668.36s)]
*  maybe not verbally joust with him, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5670.2s)]
*  but at a scientific level could pin that guy. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5671.68s)]
*  So they were on more or less equal tier, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5675.16s)]
*  but Gell-Mann was right up there. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5678.04s)]
*  So Epstein understood like bring around the Gell-Manns, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5680.04s)]
*  bring around the top genetic researchers from Harvard. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5683.84s)]
*  By doing that, he made these rich people feel like [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5687.4400000000005s)]
*  they were in the company of interesting, important people. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5689.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5691.8s)]
*  And why would scientists spend time with rich people? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5692.64s)]
*  I'll be really honest. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5694.72s)]
*  I do a lot of work for these days for talking about science [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5695.96s)]
*  and trying to generate science philanthropy. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5699.92s)]
*  That's a big part of my life now, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5702.36s)]
*  trying to generate money to give to studies [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5703.76s)]
*  that are really interesting and valid. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5706.16s)]
*  We could talk about that if you like. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5708.0s)]
*  Scientists will show up to dinners [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5711.2s)]
*  that normally they'd rather be in their labs [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5714.04s)]
*  or writing grants or with their families, frankly, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5715.56s)]
*  if there's the possibility of money [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5717.88s)]
*  being given to their laboratory, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5719.84s)]
*  because then they can hire more people and do more science. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5721.08s)]
*  Money alone doesn't drive good science, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5723.36s)]
*  but the more money you have, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5725.92s)]
*  the bigger margin of error you have. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5727.2s)]
*  So if Epstein offered laboratories [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5728.88s)]
*  a million dollars a year for four years, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5732.4800000000005s)]
*  to a guy of that wealth as trivial, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5734.32s)]
*  to a laboratory, that is four national institutes [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5736.4400000000005s)]
*  of health grants per year. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5740.32s)]
*  And the workload to maintain those four grants is immense. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5742.72s)]
*  So they'd show up with the possibility of getting money. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5745.52s)]
*  That's where they were hanging out [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5747.400000000001s)]
*  with a dirt bag like him. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5748.24s)]
*  And they had blinders on. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5749.92s)]
*  Either they knew or they didn't know what he was up to, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5751.76s)]
*  but they had blinders on [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5753.400000000001s)]
*  because they weren't thinking about the implications. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5754.32s)]
*  Well, it was also one of the things about something [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5756.16s)]
*  like that must be that if you go there [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5759.6s)]
*  and you see Steven Pinker and you see Lawrence Krauss [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5761.320000000001s)]
*  and you see Bill Gates, it seems like you should be there. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5765.96s)]
*  It seems fine to be there. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5769.64s)]
*  Also on sinister, diabolical, narcissistic and sociopathic, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5771.16s)]
*  but brilliant social engineering on the part of Epstein. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5776.400000000001s)]
*  He understood that they felt comfortable in the room [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5778.96s)]
*  because of who else was there. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5781.4800000000005s)]
*  Rich people will show up to a place [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5783.0s)]
*  for who's not there, as we know. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5784.72s)]
*  They like to have space. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5786.400000000001s)]
*  Scientists generally don't like to hobnob. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5789.16s)]
*  It's not really their thing. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5791.84s)]
*  What they like to do is work on their projects. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5793.36s)]
*  They're a little bit like comedians [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5797.16s)]
*  in the sense that they have a craft [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5799.0s)]
*  they want to be working on. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5800.599999999999s)]
*  They're only going to do things like go out and get money [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5801.679999999999s)]
*  if they have to get money. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5804.639999999999s)]
*  And they do a lot to get money. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5806.24s)]
*  Well, I'm sure there's a social aspect of it [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5807.679999999999s)]
*  and hanging around with other brilliant scientists [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5809.679999999999s)]
*  at a wonderful place. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5811.84s)]
*  You have good food and drink and there's pretty girls around. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5813.0s)]
*  It's probably exciting. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5815.88s)]
*  It's probably exciting, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5817.0s)]
*  although I think that at some level, scientists, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5817.92s)]
*  real scientists, died in the world scientists, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5820.72s)]
*  would rather just be doing science and living their lives. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5822.84s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5824.6s)]
*  I mean, this is a very rare occasion. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5825.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm sure that they're doing this. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5827.52s)]
*  So he had the whole thing, the Harvard shirt. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5828.76s)]
*  I mean, he kind of, he ingratiated himself [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5831.08s)]
*  in this community. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5833.12s)]
*  He just understood. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5834.12s)]
*  It was sort of like, I do some work [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5835.4800000000005s)]
*  with some professional sports teams, right? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5837.0s)]
*  And the only people that they look up to [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5838.8s)]
*  are tier one special operators. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5841.92s)]
*  You tell a pro-MBA player, like, oh, in the NFL, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5843.4800000000005s)]
*  they do this, they're like, whatever. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5846.2s)]
*  You tell them that, you know, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5847.6s)]
*  this will increase your output by 10%. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5848.8s)]
*  They're like, whatever. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5851.72s)]
*  They don't care. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5852.72s)]
*  They want to play video games. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5853.56s)]
*  They do not care. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5854.4800000000005s)]
*  They want to hang out with their girlfriend [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5855.320000000001s)]
*  or their four girlfriends, whatever it is. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5856.320000000001s)]
*  You tell them tier one operators who do high risk, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5858.320000000001s)]
*  high consequence work and are on deployment schedules [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5860.68s)]
*  that would dissolve you into a puddle of your own tears [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5863.52s)]
*  because it's a vampire schedule. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5866.0s)]
*  You don't get to sleep when you want to. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5867.360000000001s)]
*  And you get, you potentially die. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5868.76s)]
*  You potentially all die. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5870.92s)]
*  And their running times are faster. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5872.0s)]
*  Their recovery times are faster. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5874.360000000001s)]
*  Their shooting accuracy is far better [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5876.0s)]
*  than your shooting accuracy. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5877.72s)]
*  And that's with a gun and getting shot at. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5878.72s)]
*  And they go, okay, I'll listen. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5880.96s)]
*  They look up to tier one operators. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5882.36s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5884.6s)]
*  And so if you want them to listen, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5885.44s)]
*  you understand that fact. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5887.04s)]
*  You look at what tier one operators are doing. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5888.0s)]
*  That's what professional sports teams [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5890.08s)]
*  are trying to glean that information. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5891.44s)]
*  Billionaires, they have different interests, obviously. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5893.68s)]
*  They, some race yachts, some, you know, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5897.04s)]
*  want to start new projects, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5899.08s)]
*  but they want to be around [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5900.52s)]
*  really innovative, interesting people. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5901.92s)]
*  And in academia, there are very small subset of those [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5904.04s)]
*  running big laboratories. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5907.0s)]
*  And Epstein just got that down to the detail. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5908.12s)]
*  And then he understood, I think, with politicians, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5911.72s)]
*  they can, their reputations are everything. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5914.6s)]
*  And so he gave them a vaulted world [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5917.4s)]
*  where they could behave how they wanted. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5919.48s)]
*  I mean, in some sense, I mean, he, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5921.4s)]
*  his story is one of multiple psychologies, not just his. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5923.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's why people that have studied him [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5928.84s)]
*  and the whole case believe that, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5931.24s)]
*  and from other evidence and information as well, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5932.88s)]
*  that he was part of some sort of an intelligence operation [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5936.4400000000005s)]
*  and there was compromising these people. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5939.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure that at some point, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5940.84s)]
*  he had information on other people [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5942.8s)]
*  and he just used it as a, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5944.52s)]
*  and it doesn't have to be strong hand blackmail, right? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5946.36s)]
*  He could just say, you know, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5948.56s)]
*  we've got information, we'll hold it secure. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5950.8s)]
*  Well, you would just, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5953.84s)]
*  you don't even have to blackmail someone. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5955.64s)]
*  If you know they have information on you [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5958.52s)]
*  and they have not used it, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5960.64s)]
*  you will act in their best interest [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5961.88s)]
*  to try to get them on your good side. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5964.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, in the unraveling [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5966.84s)]
*  of all the dark sorted shit around Weinstein, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5969.24s)]
*  it was discovered, I think in New York, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5974.52s)]
*  like near that avenue, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5975.92s)]
*  down in Alphabet City police precinct, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5977.52s)]
*  it turns out that there were, you know, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5981.56s)]
*  a boatload of files that date back ages. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5983.0s)]
*  And you know, there were, it's not that cops are corrupt, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5985.36s)]
*  it's that they're incentivized by certain things too. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5987.32s)]
*  And their bosses were telling them, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5989.0s)]
*  you gotta do certain things, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5990.16s)]
*  you gotta put away certain files. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5991.0s)]
*  And you know, people are trying to make careers. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5992.16s)]
*  I think that's why that show, it's a little outdated now, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5994.2s)]
*  but from technology standpoint, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5996.16s)]
*  but the wire was so brilliant [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5998.04s)]
*  is that every aspect of that was a human endeavor. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=5999.24s)]
*  And science is a human endeavor. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6002.6s)]
*  And we're kind of paying attention [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6004.28s)]
*  to the darker unfortunate side. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6006.2s)]
*  There are also, again, I always feel like I got to shine [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6007.76s)]
*  light where it belongs to, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6010.72s)]
*  which is that a lot of amazing science is happening [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6012.32s)]
*  because of excellent philanthropy [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6015.32s)]
*  of people that are not pedophiles. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6017.24s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6018.8s)]
*  And those people, you know, but let's be honest, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6019.76s)]
*  walk onto any university campus, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6022.76s)]
*  look at the names on the sides of the buildings. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6024.68s)]
*  Do you think they're there to honor those people [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6026.400000000001s)]
*  because those were great people? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6028.08s)]
*  Sometimes they're great people. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6029.88s)]
*  They're there because those people donated [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6031.08s)]
*  50 to a hundred million dollars. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6032.88s)]
*  I mean, and this has been known in law schools [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6034.8s)]
*  and business schools for a long time, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6037.8s)]
*  because you'd see it on the, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6039.12s)]
*  that was kind of more accepted there [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6040.2s)]
*  because it's business and law. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6042.12s)]
*  But if you walk onto any campus, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6043.8s)]
*  I don't care if it's UT Austin or Stanford or it's Harvard, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6045.320000000001s)]
*  the names on those sides of buildings, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6047.6s)]
*  sometimes it's the Kennedy building. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6050.4800000000005s)]
*  Sometimes it's the Rockefeller building. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6051.68s)]
*  More often than not, these are names of people [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6053.4800000000005s)]
*  you don't recognize anymore. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6055.280000000001s)]
*  And names of people don't even live in the United States. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6057.0s)]
*  They gave a hundred million dollars [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6059.04s)]
*  for a building that trains medical students. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6060.4800000000005s)]
*  Universities are a business too, 100%. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6061.96s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that they're trying to corrupt anybody, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6066.0s)]
*  but they have to survive. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6068.400000000001s)]
*  You had to get to pay the janitor. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6069.400000000001s)]
*  You gotta pay the cops. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6071.360000000001s)]
*  You get on the campus. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6072.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, so it is a business. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6073.02s)]
*  And I think that's the human side actually, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6074.72s)]
*  to your credit, I learned from you. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6078.0s)]
*  I think you may or may not remember, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6080.28s)]
*  but a few years ago, we were talking about [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6081.12s)]
*  everything that was going on in the public health thing. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6082.08s)]
*  And you're like, the reason I'm curious about this, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6083.799999999999s)]
*  and I don't trust this, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6086.08s)]
*  these were your words more or less, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6087.12s)]
*  was because I know about people. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6088.28s)]
*  And that's at the end of the day, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6090.759999999999s)]
*  it's all about people and their psychology. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6092.2s)]
*  Well, that is science as well. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6094.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, the human aspect of science is science. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6096.679999999999s)]
*  It's understanding motivations and incentives. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6099.719999999999s)]
*  And there's just a lot, I mean, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6102.639999999999s)]
*  look, that's how they got this whole FTX thing, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6104.799999999999s)]
*  with Sam Bankman Fried. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6108.6s)]
*  He's parked at home prison two blocks from Stanford campus. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6111.240000000001s)]
*  Is he really? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6114.8s)]
*  You go visit him. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6115.64s)]
*  No, he needs a haircut, that guy. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6116.46s)]
*  Does he? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6117.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, have you seen him? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6118.3s)]
*  I think the police have his problems. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6119.14s)]
*  I just see this kid with an afro, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6119.9800000000005s)]
*  it looks like he hasn't been released. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6121.240000000001s)]
*  I think what happened there is so- [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6122.4400000000005s)]
*  But no, there was a lot of celebrity endorsements, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6124.56s)]
*  is my point. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6126.3s)]
*  Sure, Tom Brady. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6127.14s)]
*  But that's what it is. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6128.08s)]
*  You get people to think, oh, Tom Brady's investing. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6129.280000000001s)]
*  It must be good. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6132.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6133.400000000001s)]
*  And that kind of thing is exactly [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6134.8s)]
*  sort of methods that Jeffrey Epstein used. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6138.44s)]
*  It's just- [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6140.72s)]
*  Having this association with people [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6141.56s)]
*  that are respected and popular. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6143.36s)]
*  How should I say this? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6148.08s)]
*  If I had a super high powered psychiatric microscope, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6151.08s)]
*  I'd go back and find out how everyone [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6155.48s)]
*  that you would ever work with [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6158.16s)]
*  or that you're getting information from, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6159.04s)]
*  you would find out what their kind of core developmental [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6160.22s)]
*  dissatisfaction is, right? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6164.04s)]
*  Because I think therein you see. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6165.8s)]
*  I'm sure everyone has this. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6167.96s)]
*  I'm sure Bankman Fried felt like this big [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6170.160000000001s)]
*  as the consequence of something [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6174.38s)]
*  in his psychology or experience. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6175.64s)]
*  And as a consequence, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6177.04s)]
*  justified doing this horrible thing. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6178.200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think he was clearly on amphetamines. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6180.08s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6182.76s)]
*  That won't help. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6183.6s)]
*  That whole organization was backed up by amphetamines. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6184.4400000000005s)]
*  And this is publicly known. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6188.64s)]
*  She tweeted, Caroline Ellison, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6190.88s)]
*  tweeted that talking to people [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6193.68s)]
*  like normal people when you're on amphetamines [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6197.88s)]
*  is very boring. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6199.96s)]
*  And people are boring. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6200.8s)]
*  This overuse of amphetamines is, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6202.28s)]
*  I mean, all we know is that, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6203.92s)]
*  and we do know that they narrow your focus. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6205.16s)]
*  They become very outward and goal directed. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6207.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6210.2s)]
*  I mean, that's what cocaine and amphetamines do. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6211.04s)]
*  They make you very of what's in the future [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6212.56s)]
*  and what you can go get [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6214.82s)]
*  as opposed to being in bliss in yourself. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6215.76s)]
*  Perhaps an interesting intersection of this idea [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6219.16s)]
*  of neurochemistry and psychology [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6221.4400000000005s)]
*  and universities and sciences. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6223.4s)]
*  Recently, I was asked to give a talk at Stanford [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6225.08s)]
*  to a bunch of potential donors. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6227.8s)]
*  And on the stage next to me was Michael Pollan, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6230.6s)]
*  who I have tremendous respect for. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6233.16s)]
*  Love that guy. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6235.0s)]
*  Yeah, even though he's over at Berkeley, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6235.84s)]
*  like we tolerate him. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6236.78s)]
*  No, I'm kidding, Michael. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6237.62s)]
*  That's a Stanford Berkeley joke. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6238.44s)]
*  He is wonderful and amazing [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6239.96s)]
*  and such a pioneer of this whole psychedelic space. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6241.96s)]
*  And you might say, well, there were others. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6245.84s)]
*  There's Terrence McKenna and there's the classic people. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6247.12s)]
*  But I started off that evening by saying, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6249.72s)]
*  we need to take a step back [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6251.96s)]
*  and just acknowledge what's happening here, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6253.52s)]
*  which is saying the word psychedelics on a podcast for me, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6255.240000000001s)]
*  five, six years ago, could have cost me my job. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6259.040000000001s)]
*  Easily saying, yeah, I've taken MDMA [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6261.6s)]
*  as part of a clinical trial three times. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6263.68s)]
*  It was tremendously beneficial. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6265.320000000001s)]
*  I think psilocybin can aid with depression. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6267.120000000001s)]
*  That would have cost me my job. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6268.8s)]
*  Done, fired. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6269.84s)]
*  I would have walked out of here, done. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6270.68s)]
*  Now, just this last month, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6272.280000000001s)]
*  the cover of UCSF Magazine and Stanford Magazine, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6274.240000000001s)]
*  Alice in Wonderland, psychedelics, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6278.400000000001s)]
*  deep feature about MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin, DMT. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6281.26s)]
*  What's happened now is this is what used to cost [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6286.54s)]
*  university professors their jobs in the 60s and 70s [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6289.38s)]
*  and did cost them their jobs [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6292.02s)]
*  at places like Harvard in particular, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6293.46s)]
*  is now the subject of research studies, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6295.7s)]
*  clinical studies at Stanford and elsewhere, right? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6297.9400000000005s)]
*  UCSF, Johns Hopkins. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6300.58s)]
*  This is now really big science [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6302.42s)]
*  and pharma is moving in very quickly. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6304.820000000001s)]
*  What they're trying to do [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6306.7s)]
*  is create non-psychedelic psychedelics, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6307.62s)]
*  figure out what sorts of chemistry changes [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6310.42s)]
*  that doesn't give you hallucinations [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6312.74s)]
*  and create new antidepressants. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6314.42s)]
*  That's what they want to do with psilocybin [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6315.9800000000005s)]
*  because doing two journeys on a drug and then you're done, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6317.54s)]
*  that's not good business. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6320.3s)]
*  And what I love about what Michael Pollan is saying [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6321.54s)]
*  is that he's the one that's really, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6324.02s)]
*  he's really hitting the drum on this one. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6325.74s)]
*  He's saying these things work. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6327.54s)]
*  The clinical data are showing that. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6329.86s)]
*  65% plus success rate for what would otherwise be [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6331.62s)]
*  intractable, untreatable suicidal depression. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6336.46s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6338.96s)]
*  And now the universities are behind it, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6339.8s)]
*  but they're behind it [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6341.72s)]
*  because laboratories are getting funded to do it. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6342.56s)]
*  Laboratories are getting funded to do it [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6344.0s)]
*  because there are grants. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6345.92s)]
*  Why are there now grants from the federal government? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6347.88s)]
*  Well, philanthropists came in early and provided money [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6349.76s)]
*  and now people are starting to see that there are big, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6353.320000000001s)]
*  big potential outcomes at the level of pharma. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6358.04s)]
*  Now the classic psychedelics community [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6360.84s)]
*  isn't going to like that. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6363.4400000000005s)]
*  They're like, no, this is plant medicine. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6364.400000000001s)]
*  It's got a hundred thousand year history [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6365.64s)]
*  and there are more indigenous people, et cetera. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6367.48s)]
*  Academia and pharma don't care about that. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6370.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm not, I'm one of these people. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6372.74s)]
*  I don't, I'm not saying they're bad and they're good. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6374.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm saying that it's humans again. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6376.959999999999s)]
*  So why are universities suddenly okay [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6378.679999999999s)]
*  with the idea of discussions about psychedelics [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6380.5599999999995s)]
*  in front of their top tier donors, [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6382.32s)]
*  the people that literally supply the blood to the university? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6384.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, because top tier donors [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6387.839999999999s)]
*  are now really interested in psychedelics. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6389.36s)]
*  So what drives every aspect of it [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6391.74s)]
*  from the student who's pipetting in the lab [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6394.66s)]
*  to the highest tier of administration in the university [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6397.820000000001s)]
*  all the way up to directors of NIH, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6401.22s)]
*  it's all interconnected at the level of incentives. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6403.9800000000005s)]
*  Right, but the top tier donors [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6409.14s)]
*  are clearly influenced by the zeitgeist [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6410.64s)]
*  and the way people have approached [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6413.38s)]
*  and thought about psychedelics has radically changed [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6415.860000000001s)]
*  over the last 10 years. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6418.860000000001s)]
*  And Michael Pollan is one of the reasons for that [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6419.900000000001s)]
*  because the omnivores dilemma, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6421.740000000001s)]
*  he had established himself as a legitimate journalist [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6424.22s)]
*  who would comb through and parse through all the data [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6428.46s)]
*  to give you a comprehensive understanding [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6432.7s)]
*  of what exactly is going on. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6434.34s)]
*  And he went out and did them, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6435.7s)]
*  or at least some of them as a kind of late, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6437.22s)]
*  the typical person not, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6439.66s)]
*  and didn't come out with wearing a robe [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6441.3s)]
*  or sit in the lotus position or something. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6446.38s)]
*  And he can discuss them like a journalist. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6447.66s)]
*  And then having podcasts discuss it, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6450.1s)]
*  then you're getting these positive drug stories out to, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6453.24s)]
*  and I don't even like calling them drugs, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6456.8s)]
*  positive compound stories about psychedelics [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6458.88s)]
*  that are going out to millions and millions [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6461.04s)]
*  and millions of people. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6463.5599999999995s)]
*  And you're hearing about these people, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6465.08s)]
*  particularly soldiers who are coming back with PTSD, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6466.84s)]
*  who are having tremendous results, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6470.8s)]
*  people with overwhelming depression, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6472.2s)]
*  people with all sorts of problems with drug addiction [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6474.679999999999s)]
*  and so many different ailments [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6477.76s)]
*  that are being helped in this way. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6480.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6482.0s)]
*  And look, you deserve tremendous credit here. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6482.84s)]
*  I know you're not wanting to sit here [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6484.56s)]
*  and take praise from your guests, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6486.8s)]
*  but I'm going to just say that you've been talking about this [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6488.16s)]
*  for a long time about the tremendous value of these things, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6490.4400000000005s)]
*  not just for gaining new perspective, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6494.0s)]
*  because I think in the 60s and 70s, it was, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6495.64s)]
*  remember it was tune in and drop out, right? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6497.5s)]
*  Now we're talking about the use of psychedelic medicine [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6500.08s)]
*  to be able to lean into life in a healthy way. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6502.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the major difference. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6505.42s)]
*  And you've really pioneered the discussion around that, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6506.52s)]
*  Michael Pollan and there are others too, I realize. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6508.4400000000005s)]
*  But at a time when it was considered really wacky [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6510.68s)]
*  and out there, now it's becoming, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6515.240000000001s)]
*  it's headed towards mainstream medicine. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6517.88s)]
*  And I think it's fundamentally important. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6519.84s)]
*  I mean, I think Robin Cardart Harris's laboratory at UCSF [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6522.0s)]
*  has a paper out just today on the use of DMT [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6525.18s)]
*  for treatment of psychiatric illness. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6528.240000000001s)]
*  His laboratory has been looking at high dose psilocybin, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6530.96s)]
*  two sessions, guided sessions, treatment of anorexia, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6534.04s)]
*  ADHD and depression with very high success. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6538.320000000001s)]
*  Nolan Williams lab at my university at Stanford, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6541.58s)]
*  he's a triple board certified psychiatrist, neurologist, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6544.48s)]
*  running the studies with veteran solutions, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6547.58s)]
*  the group down in Mexico of tier one operators [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6550.0599999999995s)]
*  and other people who come back who are just messed up. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6552.58s)]
*  They're either heading towards suicidal depression [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6555.099999999999s)]
*  or they're just not feeling quite right. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6557.78s)]
*  And using Ibogaine DMT in tandem [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6560.18s)]
*  and getting tremendously positive results. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6563.08s)]
*  So he's doing the neuroimaging on them. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6565.099999999999s)]
*  So times are really changing and you and Michael [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6567.04s)]
*  and others really deserve a token of gratitude. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6569.78s)]
*  I've completely revamped my stance on psychedelics. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6572.599999999999s)]
*  I'm still yet to do a high dose psilocybin journey. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6575.46s)]
*  I haven't done that yet. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6577.62s)]
*  What was your original stance on psychedelics? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6578.46s)]
*  I don't want to lose my job. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6580.54s)]
*  And I'll be honest. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6581.96s)]
*  So I was kind of a wild youth, barely finished high school. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6582.8s)]
*  And I did recreationally, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6585.54s)]
*  I took LSD and psilocybin in high school, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6587.179999999999s)]
*  hung around with a wild bunch [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6589.099999999999s)]
*  and we were just partying with it. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6590.219999999999s)]
*  I didn't know what I was doing. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6591.3s)]
*  So my view of it was, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6592.38s)]
*  it was associated with a time in my life [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6593.5599999999995s)]
*  where I was pretty wayward. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6595.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6596.3s)]
*  Then I never touched it. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6597.36s)]
*  I drank a little bit. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6598.62s)]
*  I smoked a little bit of weed here and there, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6600.46s)]
*  but never really liked weed very much. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6601.3s)]
*  It just wasn't my thing. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6602.62s)]
*  And then when I did this three sessions with MDMA, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6604.18s)]
*  that completely transformed my understanding [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6607.82s)]
*  of how these drugs work. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6609.74s)]
*  I also realized, you probably already know this, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6611.0s)]
*  but I was very curious about MDMA [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6614.16s)]
*  and the reputation that puts holes in the brain, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6616.0599999999995s)]
*  kills serotonin neurons. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6617.78s)]
*  You know, the study on MDMA that showed neurotoxicity [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6619.14s)]
*  is, was retracted from science. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6622.08s)]
*  They actually inadvertently injected methamphetamine [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6624.36s)]
*  into those monkeys. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6627.78s)]
*  But you never hear about that. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6628.96s)]
*  How do you inadvertently inject methamphetamine? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6630.4s)]
*  Like, oh, I thought it was aspirin. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6634.08s)]
*  You don't hear about that retraction. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6635.8s)]
*  You hear that. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6637.12s)]
*  So they now have data in humans asking, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6637.96s)]
*  what are the safety profiles on MDMA [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6641.64s)]
*  for people that take it every once in a while, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6643.46s)]
*  to people have taken hundreds of doses of MDMA. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6645.46s)]
*  And there's one population of people [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6648.84s)]
*  that you can do this on [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6650.68s)]
*  that makes it a really good experiment. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6651.5s)]
*  Those people can't do any other drugs [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6653.12s)]
*  because then it becomes confounded by, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6655.16s)]
*  are they doing meth? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6656.88s)]
*  Are they doing coke? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6657.72s)]
*  Cancilla-Cybin, what else? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6658.88s)]
*  It's not a good experiment. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6660.0s)]
*  You want single variable manipulation. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6661.04s)]
*  There's only one group that you can do that on, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6662.88s)]
*  and that's who they did it on, and that's Mormons. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6664.68s)]
*  So the Church of Latter-day Saints has one drug [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6667.240000000001s)]
*  that's not on the banned substance list, and that's MDMA. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6671.72s)]
*  And I'm not saying all Mormons- [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6674.320000000001s)]
*  They can't even drink coffee. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6676.160000000001s)]
*  It makes it an even better experiment. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6677.64s)]
*  And so I'm not saying that Mormons are all taking MDMA, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6679.72s)]
*  but there is a substantial number of LDS, Latter-day Saints, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6682.8s)]
*  I think they call themselves now Mormons, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6687.64s)]
*  as most people know them, who have taken tons of MDMA. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6689.4400000000005s)]
*  And they've done brain imaging [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6692.92s)]
*  and psychiatric profiles on them. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6694.0s)]
*  Those data say that as long as it's not contaminated [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6695.8s)]
*  with something else, which is a serious issue, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6699.84s)]
*  the neurotoxicity is nil to none. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6701.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6704.240000000001s)]
*  Amazing, right? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6705.08s)]
*  At the appropriate dosages, et cetera. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6705.900000000001s)]
*  That's amazing. Amazing. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6707.120000000001s)]
*  And the problem is contaminated- [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6708.52s)]
*  So I've changed my stance. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6709.360000000001s)]
*  Contaminated MDMA is super common. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6711.120000000001s)]
*  The recent data I saw is that you go out and buy MDMA [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6713.88s)]
*  from a quote unquote trusted source, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6716.74s)]
*  and six out of 10 are going to have potentially [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6719.0199999999995s)]
*  lethal levels of fentanyl in them. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6722.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6723.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6724.9s)]
*  Six out of 10. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6725.74s)]
*  Yeah, and everyone nowadays knows to say, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6726.86s)]
*  oh, this is from maps, you know, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6728.54s)]
*  cause it's like saying like, you know, it's clean, right? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6730.34s)]
*  So in any way, I've completely changed my stance [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6733.0199999999995s)]
*  on psychedelics. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6735.58s)]
*  I think they have tremendous power if done responsibly. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6736.94s)]
*  I think that they hold the greatest promise [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6739.54s)]
*  for drug-based psychiatric treatments. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6742.38s)]
*  And I think we're looking at a time in which [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6745.46s)]
*  it's absolutely clear that these things [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6748.1s)]
*  should be available to people. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6752.3s)]
*  Robin will tell you the worst part [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6753.26s)]
*  about running his laboratory is someone will come in [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6754.54s)]
*  with intractable suicidal depression. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6756.36s)]
*  They'll do two psilocybin treatments and they're better. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6758.02s)]
*  And then two years later, they'll come back and they'll say, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6760.62s)]
*  how can I do another one? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6763.34s)]
*  Because it made me feel so much better. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6764.38s)]
*  And he'll say, sorry, they're still illegal. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6766.02s)]
*  And he can't provide them, he'd lose his job. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6768.5s)]
*  So right now the legalization effort is really important. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6771.22s)]
*  And I intend to get more vocal about this. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6775.54s)]
*  Well, that's great. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6778.1s)]
*  I'm glad you will. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6778.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think it's a popular stance now. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6779.76s)]
*  I don't think it's nearly as dangerous as it was [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6781.820000000001s)]
*  five, 10 years ago. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6784.58s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy cause it's, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6786.3s)]
*  that's one of the more interesting aspects [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6789.02s)]
*  of the way podcasts have infected [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6790.820000000001s)]
*  the popular opinion on things. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6794.9800000000005s)]
*  Cause it's sort of changed people's understanding [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6797.1s)]
*  through data and through talking to people [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6799.38s)]
*  like Michael Pollan or Rick Doblin or any of these experts [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6801.38s)]
*  that really could tell you what's actually going on [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6806.02s)]
*  and how this helps. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6809.1s)]
*  And then there's many people that have these stances [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6810.14s)]
*  on these drugs that hear these things now and go, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6813.1s)]
*  you know what, God damn it, maybe I'm ruining my life [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6815.74s)]
*  by not being open. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6818.9800000000005s)]
*  Like maybe this could actually help me. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6820.74s)]
*  Maybe this could help my mom. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6822.86s)]
*  Maybe this could help my father. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6824.34s)]
*  Maybe this could help my brother. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6825.74s)]
*  There's so many people out there [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6827.7s)]
*  that really could use some help. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6829.179999999999s)]
*  And human beings have been using these compounds [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6832.94s)]
*  and these substances and these mushrooms [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6836.54s)]
*  and these psychedelics for thousands of years. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6839.54s)]
*  There's a reason why they put them in rituals. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6842.66s)]
*  They may be the source of most religious experiences. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6845.04s)]
*  They may be the source of many religious texts. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6847.62s)]
*  In fact, John Marco Allegro, one of the head, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6850.38s)]
*  the guys who was hired to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6854.32s)]
*  he wrote a book called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6858.839999999999s)]
*  after translating the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6861.5599999999995s)]
*  His belief was that the entire Christian religion [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6866.32s)]
*  was initially based on psychedelic mushrooms [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6869.799999999999s)]
*  and fertility rituals. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6873.099999999999s)]
*  And so he wrote this book that was bought out [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6874.96s)]
*  by the Catholic Church. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6877.259999999999s)]
*  And then you had to buy, it's reprinted now, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6879.0s)]
*  but you had to buy used copies of it online to get it. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6882.1s)]
*  And so then he made another book called [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6886.46s)]
*  The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6888.620000000001s)]
*  that was based on the same material. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6891.18s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6893.56s)]
*  This is really an opportunity to say [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6895.820000000001s)]
*  about that positive aspect of philanthropy. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6898.660000000001s)]
*  One thing that I know about very wealthy people [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6901.06s)]
*  is they almost always have at least one family member [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6903.42s)]
*  who's really screwed up, really screwed up, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6905.820000000001s)]
*  mentally especially. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6909.06s)]
*  Not just wealthy people, poor people too, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6911.42s)]
*  but like most people. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6914.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6915.06s)]
*  I'm talking about that category. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6916.14s)]
*  Most people have a family member that's fucked. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6916.9800000000005s)]
*  Right, so what's happened is a lot of the money [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6918.38s)]
*  that's going into psychedelic research [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6920.58s)]
*  that's coming from philanthropy [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6922.06s)]
*  is coming from these very, they feel desperate, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6923.5s)]
*  very wealthy people, and they're going to universities [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6927.42s)]
*  and saying, what can you do for my kid? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6929.9400000000005s)]
*  And the university is saying, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6932.26s)]
*  well, we've got transcranial magnetic stimulation [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6933.1s)]
*  and that works on some people, but not others. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6934.9800000000005s)]
*  And they're saying, great, what else do you have? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6936.46s)]
*  And they're saying, well, we have talk therapy. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6938.14s)]
*  And they're saying, well, that's important too, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6939.34s)]
*  but what else do you have? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6940.58s)]
*  And they're saying, well, there's these interesting compounds [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6941.9800000000005s)]
*  that seem to relieve depression. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6944.1s)]
*  And they're like, well, why isn't that available? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6945.22s)]
*  Well, it's still illegal and we don't have money to fund it [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6946.9400000000005s)]
*  because the federal government's been very reluctant [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6949.26s)]
*  to get involved in it. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6951.82s)]
*  I mean, it's an odd thing that we have, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6952.78s)]
*  we have bodies within the government [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6956.3s)]
*  that are designed to put people in prison for drugs. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6959.22s)]
*  And then we also have bodies of the same government [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6962.54s)]
*  that funds from the top down that study drugs. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6965.38s)]
*  But keep in mind that the NIH up until recently [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6968.86s)]
*  was only studying drugs of abuse. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6970.74s)]
*  Remember it's NIDA, right? [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6972.339999999999s)]
*  It's about drugs of abuse, addiction and abuse. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6973.78s)]
*  So they're studying cocaine, amphetamine [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6976.259999999999s)]
*  for their addictive properties. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6977.62s)]
*  Studying psychedelics becomes a little bit of a tricky thing. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6980.46s)]
*  Where are you going to fund that? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6983.099999999999s)]
*  Is it because if anything, they're anti-addictive [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6984.46s)]
*  according to the data, right? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6987.099999999999s)]
*  And here I should be careful and say that [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6988.62s)]
*  like the Ibogaine studies, there is a heart risk. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6990.299999999999s)]
*  They do have cardio, they usually have someone measuring. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6992.46s)]
*  For Ibogaine. Yeah, for Ibogaine. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6994.7s)]
*  Have there people died of heart attacks from Ibogaine? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6996.259999999999s)]
*  No, but not that I know of, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6998.26s)]
*  but they're always monitoring blood pressure [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=6999.54s)]
*  and heart rates. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7002.62s)]
*  For like Veterans Solutions, they have physicians there [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7003.7s)]
*  and they're very careful. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7005.900000000001s)]
*  Great organization. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7007.54s)]
*  Ibogaine is a very strange one. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7008.66s)]
*  I've never done it. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7010.18s)]
*  I've never. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7011.42s)]
*  But the people that have, have had crazy stories. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7012.26s)]
*  22 hours. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7014.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 22 hours and horrific experiences [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7016.18s)]
*  were just intensely introspective, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7019.42s)]
*  breaking down of all the pathways in your mind [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7023.1s)]
*  that have been carved throughout [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7027.62s)]
*  all of your traumatic experiences, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7029.22s)]
*  your whole life that led you to be the person you are today. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7031.34s)]
*  I know multiple people that have done it [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7034.62s)]
*  because of an addiction to opiates. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7036.58s)]
*  And it's helped them. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7038.58s)]
*  It's helped them tremendously, kicked them. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7039.42s)]
*  But how can you argue with those data? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7041.9s)]
*  I mean, when you hear that, I mean, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7043.5s)]
*  opioid addiction is one of the hardest things [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7045.34s)]
*  for people to kick. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7047.18s)]
*  I mean, people die trying to go cold turkey. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7048.14s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7050.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think Ibogaine was described to me by a friend [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7052.7s)]
*  who was a former SEAL team operator [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7054.9s)]
*  because he went down to veteran solutions and he said, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7056.78s)]
*  it was eyes open, no hallucinations. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7059.02s)]
*  Every time he would close his eyes, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7060.82s)]
*  he would get a high definition movie quality view [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7062.42s)]
*  of an experience from his life. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7066.74s)]
*  And he had agency. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7068.74s)]
*  He could move himself differently within that experience. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7070.38s)]
*  And then it would move like a cube [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7072.98s)]
*  and he'd get another experience. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7074.66s)]
*  And then he was in that experience, 22 hours. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7076.62s)]
*  And then down there, they follow that up with DMT, one or two. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7078.7s)]
*  And he described DMT as being strapped to the shockwave [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7082.86s)]
*  of an atom bomb. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7085.98s)]
*  This is somebody who's obviously been [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7087.459999999999s)]
*  through some intense experiences anyway. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7089.0599999999995s)]
*  And all of that might just sound really crazy and extreme, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7091.299999999999s)]
*  but keep in mind, those same people [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7093.66s)]
*  are coming back to Stanford [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7095.0599999999995s)]
*  and Nolan is scanning their brains before and after [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7096.459999999999s)]
*  and seeing incredible changes in the positive direction. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7099.62s)]
*  I think for most people, the psilocybin macrodose, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7102.98s)]
*  two macrodoses seems to be the depression treatment. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7106.66s)]
*  So this is 25 milligrams of psilocybin. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7109.7s)]
*  I think it translates to about 2.5 to five grams [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7112.139999999999s)]
*  of mushrooms, is that about right? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7114.82s)]
*  It's what Robin tells me. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7116.46s)]
*  That's the heroic dose. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7118.299999999999s)]
*  The heroic dose. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7119.299999999999s)]
*  And what's interesting is the microdosing, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7120.139999999999s)]
*  because now there's the comparison of daily one milligram, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7122.099999999999s)]
*  AKA microdosing versus the two heroic doses. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7125.9s)]
*  The microdosing has not shown impressive results [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7129.86s)]
*  for treating depression. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7132.62s)]
*  And I think people should know that. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7133.66s)]
*  I'm not saying microdosing is bad, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7135.46s)]
*  but in terms of treatment of depression, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7136.9s)]
*  it has not proved to in the clinical studies. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7138.54s)]
*  So for that application, but I can tell you personally, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7141.0199999999995s)]
*  that microdosing for just daily life [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7145.58s)]
*  makes things really fun. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7148.34s)]
*  Tell me more. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7150.42s)]
*  I enjoy it. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7151.26s)]
*  I enjoy it. Are you on it now? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7152.38s)]
*  No, no, no, right now I'm not. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7153.5s)]
*  I'm not on anything with coffee. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7155.34s)]
*  But I have done it many times. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7157.3s)]
*  And I've taken a gram a day, 30 days in a row. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7161.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, so a gram a day is probably about five, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7165.139999999999s)]
*  five milligrams. I mean, I take days off here and there, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7167.42s)]
*  but I enjoy it a lot. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7169.66s)]
*  It gives you a silly, carefree consciousness [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7171.9400000000005s)]
*  that is unperturbed, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7176.46s)]
*  meaning that it doesn't affect my judgment. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7178.860000000001s)]
*  It doesn't affect my ability [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7181.46s)]
*  to have a conversation with someone. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7182.700000000001s)]
*  It doesn't affect my ability to do my job, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7184.46s)]
*  whether it's do a podcast or even do UFC commentary [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7186.620000000001s)]
*  or do anything else. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7189.740000000001s)]
*  It just puts me in this very appreciative, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7191.06s)]
*  thankful, low anxiety state. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7194.700000000001s)]
*  Can I ask you a question about that [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7198.18s)]
*  and in an earlier podcast you brought up [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7201.86s)]
*  that when things got a little hectic in life [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7204.98s)]
*  that you were doing mushrooms. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7208.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7209.58s)]
*  Were those mushroom doses higher dose mushrooms [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7210.42s)]
*  than you were referring to? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7212.58s)]
*  No, one gram. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7213.42s)]
*  I mean, occasionally higher. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7214.46s)]
*  Yeah, but one gram seems to be like the magic number for me. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7216.42s)]
*  Like one gram just sort of, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7220.5s)]
*  you skate around for like four or five hours [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7222.179999999999s)]
*  and there's no come down. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7224.78s)]
*  There's no, it's just like, you're just happy. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7226.0199999999995s)]
*  Amazing. Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7229.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people in my field have been encouraging me [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7230.06s)]
*  to do the macro dose psilocybin. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7233.02s)]
*  It's in the books. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7237.820000000001s)]
*  I really want to do it. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7239.1s)]
*  Robin Cardart-Harris again describes it [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7241.42s)]
*  as one of the more quote unquote honest psychedelics. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7243.38s)]
*  Like you can't really decide what's going to come up. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7246.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7248.740000000001s)]
*  And a key thing he mentioned is that people need, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7249.580000000001s)]
*  this is, you may find interesting. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7252.1s)]
*  I'd love to know if you believe this [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7253.3s)]
*  for your own experience as well. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7254.780000000001s)]
*  He said there are a couple of variables [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7256.38s)]
*  to these successful treatments of depression [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7257.9400000000005s)]
*  with high dose psilocybin. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7259.78s)]
*  One of them is that people stay in the eye mask. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7261.219999999999s)]
*  That if they spend too much time in the room [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7263.46s)]
*  with the eye mask off, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7265.259999999999s)]
*  they don't do enough of the introspective. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7266.62s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine that's the case [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7268.179999999999s)]
*  because you're just distracted by visuals [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7269.9s)]
*  and you could concentrate on that instead of just, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7271.98s)]
*  McKenna's used to always just, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7274.54s)]
*  Terrence McKenna used to always say silent darkness [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7276.259999999999s)]
*  is the most important aspect to a real trip [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7278.46s)]
*  where you're learning and you're going in [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7281.66s)]
*  with the intention to interface [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7284.099999999999s)]
*  with this divine consciousness and learn something. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7286.099999999999s)]
*  I got to pee. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7289.38s)]
*  Let's pee and we'll come back. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7290.22s)]
*  I'll be right back, boss. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7291.5s)]
*  I did an episode on water. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7292.34s)]
*  The water people are crazy. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7294.7s)]
*  It's amazing, you think of all the topics [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7296.3s)]
*  that you could cover, you think, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7298.62s)]
*  oh, you know, water is very benign, right? [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7299.46s)]
*  The prescriptive that comes out of the data, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7301.58s)]
*  if you want to keep your cognitive [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7303.3s)]
*  and physical function best, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7304.46s)]
*  it's an average, not every hour, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7305.42s)]
*  an average of eight ounces for every hour, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7307.62s)]
*  up to 10 hours after your wake. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7310.9400000000005s)]
*  So that's 80 ounces during the daytime. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7312.38s)]
*  You're going to be peeing constantly. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7314.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably good. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7315.7s)]
*  And then less at night. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7316.9800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, the water people, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7318.1s)]
*  because what happens is people go, [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7320.38s)]
*  oh, you know, pH water doesn't change your body's pH, true, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7322.18s)]
*  but there are some advantages to pH water. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7324.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it has minerals in it. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7326.660000000001s)]
*  Then people go, no, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7327.620000000001s)]
*  it's all about deuterium depleted water. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7328.46s)]
*  Near the ocean, there's more deuterium in water, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7329.9800000000005s)]
*  not from ocean water. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7332.860000000001s)]
*  And then people are like really into [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7333.9800000000005s)]
*  deuterium deplete water for cancer. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7335.5s)]
*  This is all these niche communities in water, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7337.02s)]
*  reverse osmosis water, which has no magnesium or calcium. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7339.900000000001s)]
*  Then it's like, people are really into that. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7342.740000000001s)]
*  People say, that's terrible. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7344.26s)]
*  And every free hydrogen water, structured water, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7345.1s)]
*  and it's bananas. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7349.14s)]
*  And so the key thing is there's the Galpin equation, [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7351.1s)]
*  which is your body weight in pounds divided by 30 [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7354.5s)]
*  equals the number of ounces of water to drink [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7356.820000000001s)]
*  for every 15 minutes you train. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7358.700000000001s)]
*  Like Galpin's figured out that can improve performance. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7360.5s)]
*  Like there's all this like water gets super geeky [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7362.46s)]
*  and I love it. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7364.9800000000005s)]
*  One thing before I forget, Robin Carter Harris, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7366.06s)]
*  he said, I mask. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7369.22s)]
*  And he said, the power, I was so surprised. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7370.820000000001s)]
*  This is like a hardcore researcher tells me [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7373.38s)]
*  the most important variables are the dose. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7377.38s)]
*  So set and setting the, obviously, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7380.38s)]
*  but the eye mask and music. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7382.1s)]
*  He's like, when people don't have music, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7385.3s)]
*  somehow the music and that the music [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7388.14s)]
*  during a psilocybin journey have a kind of a build [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7389.86s)]
*  and then have a kind of more emotional soft tone [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7394.06s)]
*  in the kind of taper of the final hours or two. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7396.34s)]
*  He said that he thinks that that's a very important [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7399.46s)]
*  component to guiding the introspection. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7401.78s)]
*  And if for me, as a biomedical researcher [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7404.82s)]
*  at a school of medicine, and he's at the school [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7407.58s)]
*  of medicine to hear this conversation, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7409.139999999999s)]
*  like I don't know whether to laugh or cry [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7411.0599999999995s)]
*  because these are the kinds of conversations [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7414.099999999999s)]
*  that a would cause you to lose your job [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7416.46s)]
*  for legal reasons in 10 years ago, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7418.78s)]
*  or people would just say they've lost their minds. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7420.78s)]
*  And this is the hottest topic in biomedical research [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7423.58s)]
*  right now in terms of psychiatry, the hottest topic. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7427.46s)]
*  Psychedelics, psychedelics with music. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7429.94s)]
*  Psychedelics in general, just what's happening in a journey, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7432.139999999999s)]
*  how to do a journey properly, how much dosing. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7435.299999999999s)]
*  And so, take your life five, 10 years ago, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7437.62s)]
*  or even before, things that you've been talking about [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7440.379999999999s)]
*  with people for a long time. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7442.099999999999s)]
*  And now it's being talked about by these, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7443.219999999999s)]
*  in the biomedical research community funded by- [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7445.78s)]
*  20 years ago, I was being warned by producers [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7448.139999999999s)]
*  of a television show. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7452.0199999999995s)]
*  They're like, why are you doing this? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7453.46s)]
*  Like, you're talking about this openly. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7454.98s)]
*  Like, this is terrible. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7457.379999999999s)]
*  Why are you doing this to your brain? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7458.86s)]
*  I'm like, you guys don't know [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7460.299999999999s)]
*  what the fuck you're talking about. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7461.9s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know what to tell you, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7462.94s)]
*  but I'm not scared to express my opinions on things [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7464.099999999999s)]
*  if I actually believe them. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7467.78s)]
*  Well, this is my strongest stance [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7469.179999999999s)]
*  in why I love your podcast, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7471.54s)]
*  why I pay attention to podcasts [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7473.259999999999s)]
*  in addition to scientific journals, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7474.7s)]
*  is that if you look at, let's say, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7476.0199999999995s)]
*  let's look at this really niche, crazy field [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7478.62s)]
*  of bodybuilding. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7480.82s)]
*  Like, how many people want to look like Darian Yates? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7481.74s)]
*  How many people want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7483.42s)]
*  female body? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7485.339999999999s)]
*  Very few, very, very few. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7486.219999999999s)]
*  And yet that niche community understood hormone augmentation [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7488.06s)]
*  at the extremes, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7492.1s)]
*  and now we understand hormone augmentation [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7493.18s)]
*  at a healthy dosages in men and women [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7497.34s)]
*  has tremendous longevity, health span effects, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7500.740000000001s)]
*  mental and physical in terms of. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7503.38s)]
*  And so there's value in these early niche communities, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7505.900000000001s)]
*  you know, psychedelics or in bodybuilding or martial arts [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7510.1s)]
*  or in yoga communities or in breath work. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7513.14s)]
*  It's just that we see these extremes of like a Wim Hof [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7515.82s)]
*  or somebody who's doing deliberate heat exposure [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7518.259999999999s)]
*  and cold exposure. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7521.58s)]
*  And the question for a really good scientist should be, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7522.42s)]
*  is there value there? [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7525.179999999999s)]
*  What can we extract that the general population [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7526.099999999999s)]
*  could benefit from at a more subtle level? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7528.179999999999s)]
*  Like weight training. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7530.98s)]
*  Everyone you say, you only lift weights [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7531.82s)]
*  if you're going to the military [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7533.179999999999s)]
*  playing football, you're a bodybuilder. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7534.0199999999995s)]
*  How about extending neural function in the brain [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7536.0199999999995s)]
*  by stimulating the neuromuscular system, right? [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7539.299999999999s)]
*  In people in their seventies. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7542.66s)]
*  I mean, that's being done now. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7544.0599999999995s)]
*  So I think that an open-mindedness [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7545.1s)]
*  is really what's needed in biomedical research [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7548.18s)]
*  and public health. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7550.900000000001s)]
*  And I think, I can't speak for you obviously, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7551.9800000000005s)]
*  but I get very frustrated as I think you do [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7554.46s)]
*  and other people do when people are immediately [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7557.26s)]
*  to shut the door like, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7558.900000000001s)]
*  oh, that's just like crazy bro science biohacking. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7559.740000000001s)]
*  Actually there's a different name for it. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7562.26s)]
*  It's called ahead of its time science. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7563.820000000001s)]
*  It's called paying attention to things [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7567.740000000001s)]
*  that clearly have big effects and that at lower dosages [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7569.54s)]
*  or done in a particular way [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7572.8s)]
*  might actually have tremendously positive effects. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7574.46s)]
*  And the best example I can point to [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7576.86s)]
*  would be physical training, resistance training, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7578.62s)]
*  but also, if you jog in the 1950s, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7580.94s)]
*  I'll never forget that scene in Mad Men [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7584.34s)]
*  where the woman's out for a jog [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7585.66s)]
*  and all the housewives are like, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7587.02s)]
*  what is she doing? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7588.94s)]
*  No one ran outside of PE class. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7589.78s)]
*  Well, jogging craze. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7591.66s)]
*  Now it's like accepted to be a runner. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7593.26s)]
*  It's encouraged to be a runner. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7595.54s)]
*  Huge effects, psychedelics. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7596.9800000000005s)]
*  And so I think I'm old enough now in 47 [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7598.74s)]
*  to just see like, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7601.5s)]
*  yeah, the stuff that everyone thought was crazy supplements. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7602.34s)]
*  You don't need that. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7604.62s)]
*  This is the stuff that can make life better. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7605.72s)]
*  And so I don't encourage people to die, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7608.46s)]
*  but I encourage many of them to retire. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7611.82s)]
*  I'm like, just a lot of voices just need to retire. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7613.7s)]
*  Just go away and let the next generation come in [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7615.8s)]
*  and they'll eventually replace me too. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7619.26s)]
*  I had to replace us all and they'll get replaced, [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7621.32s)]
*  but let these new ideas at least be considered [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7623.860000000001s)]
*  and talked about. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7626.7s)]
*  That to me is what's exciting about podcasting [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7627.54s)]
*  and social media. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7629.4400000000005s)]
*  And also if you're getting advice, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7630.28s)]
*  particularly advice about physical health, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7632.5199999999995s)]
*  about metabolic health or about mental health [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7634.94s)]
*  or about the possible, [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7637.719999999999s)]
*  the actual benefits, whatever they may be. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7641.48s)]
*  And it's very, it's not just dose dependent [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7644.84s)]
*  when we're talking about psychedelics. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7647.88s)]
*  It's dependent upon the psychology of the individual. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7649.2s)]
*  It's dependent upon your life experiences, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7651.32s)]
*  whether or not you have a tendency to schizophrenia. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7653.16s)]
*  It's not like- [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7655.04s)]
*  Those people shouldn't do it. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7655.88s)]
*  Bipolar schizophrenia very clearly. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7656.7s)]
*  You ramp up the dopamine and or serotonin system, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7658.64s)]
*  you amplify psychosis. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7661.22s)]
*  In fact, I was studying cannabis for a while for an episode, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7662.6s)]
*  clear health benefits of cannabis. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7665.72s)]
*  And yet we also know that if young males in particular, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7667.56s)]
*  study out of Canada who have a predisposition to psychosis, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7671.46s)]
*  do very high THC cannabis, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7675.400000000001s)]
*  they are at a much greater risk. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7678.96s)]
*  The estimate is up to four times greater risk [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7680.92s)]
*  for a major and possibly permanent psychotic episode. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7682.8s)]
*  Now, I am not saying that weed is bad. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7686.36s)]
*  I'm saying that there are individuals [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7688.66s)]
*  for which it is not going to be a good idea. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7690.24s)]
*  And there are other individuals [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7691.839999999999s)]
*  for which it might be a very good idea. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7692.839999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7694.839999999999s)]
*  Look at the individual. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7696.5199999999995s)]
*  Like if you're talking to someone who's fat [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7698.179999999999s)]
*  and they're talking to you about health, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7700.24s)]
*  maybe that person is not really qualified [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7701.98s)]
*  to have this discussion. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7707.04s)]
*  Maybe they haven't taken care of their own physical health. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7708.4s)]
*  So they really shouldn't be distributing information. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7710.96s)]
*  If you knew something that could radically change [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7712.799999999999s)]
*  the way your body responded to diseases, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7716.76s)]
*  the kind of energy levels that you would have, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7719.28s)]
*  your mental health, but yet you were ignoring it [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7721.24s)]
*  for some strange reason. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7723.599999999999s)]
*  Well, that person has a giant hole in their life game. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7724.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of people out there [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7728.2s)]
*  distributing health advice [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7729.64s)]
*  that have a giant fucking hole in their health game. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7731.96s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7734.84s)]
*  Like Bill Gates is a great example of that. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7735.68s)]
*  He's got this big fat belly [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7737.32s)]
*  and he's telling people they have to get vaccinated. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7738.8s)]
*  Like this kind of binary thinking, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7740.54s)]
*  this kind of ridiculous way of looking at the world [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7743.64s)]
*  through only pharmacological interventions, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7747.160000000001s)]
*  through only medicine, through only this, through only that. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7750.12s)]
*  There's so many different things [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7753.700000000001s)]
*  that you have to do to be healthy [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7755.4800000000005s)]
*  and it's too much work for most people. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7756.92s)]
*  So they're not going to weight train enough. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7759.400000000001s)]
*  They're not going to eat the proper foods. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7761.5s)]
*  They're not going to supplement their hormones. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7763.92s)]
*  They're not going to do blood work on a regular basis [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7765.92s)]
*  and have someone who is a qualified physician [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7769.96s)]
*  who goes over that blood work with them [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7774.6s)]
*  and gives them a comprehensive understanding [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7775.52s)]
*  of what they need to do or not need to do. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7778.72s)]
*  Hey, your blood pressure's too high. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7780.52s)]
*  Hey, your body fat's too high. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7782.200000000001s)]
*  Hey, you're this, you're dehydrated. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7784.1s)]
*  You're this, you're that. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7785.8s)]
*  You have low vitamin D, you have low magnesium. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7787.0s)]
*  All that shit is massively important. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7789.120000000001s)]
*  So when you see someone who's distributing advice [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7791.4800000000005s)]
*  and they clearly aren't paying attention [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7794.320000000001s)]
*  to everything that we know today, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7796.18s)]
*  well, they're not on the cusp. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7798.6s)]
*  They're not ahead of the game. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7800.72s)]
*  They shouldn't be the type of person [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7802.84s)]
*  that's telling the rest of the world what to do. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7804.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a dentist with bad teeth. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7807.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7808.96s)]
*  But cosmetic surgeons and dentists with bad teeth, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7810.36s)]
*  you don't see them. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7812.76s)]
*  You don't see a wrinkled doc with a prune face [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7813.6s)]
*  because it's right there. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7816.0s)]
*  That's the product that people are paying for. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7816.84s)]
*  Unless he's really good. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7818.52s)]
*  This guy doesn't give a fuck about what he looks like, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7820.24s)]
*  but he can make you look great. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7822.04s)]
*  Well, and those are their reputations, [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7823.32s)]
*  I have to imagine, travel really fast. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7824.96s)]
*  You'd have to be a genius. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7826.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7827.64s)]
*  I did an episode on hair recently [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7829.24s)]
*  and it was like the guy who did a hair transplant [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7830.68s)]
*  for the first time, his name escapes me for the moment. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7832.4400000000005s)]
*  He figured out how to make his practice popular. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7834.200000000001s)]
*  He worked on politicians and celebrities [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7837.240000000001s)]
*  and word spread quickly. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7838.88s)]
*  And, you know, he had a, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7840.16s)]
*  he was the one who was the mind behind that brand Clinique. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7841.280000000001s)]
*  He said, we should call it something clinical. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7845.4800000000005s)]
*  So it sounds like medicine. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7847.320000000001s)]
*  That whole brand. Oh, that's hilarious. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7848.52s)]
*  Yeah, oh, and he died at 96 [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7849.4800000000005s)]
*  with a full head of hair, by the way. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7851.200000000001s)]
*  It's interesting that, you know, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7853.52s)]
*  you were talking about people won't do the thing. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7855.68s)]
*  Right now, there's a lot of excitement [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7857.360000000001s)]
*  about semaglutide. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7858.88s)]
*  Okay, so this is a GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7860.84s)]
*  The story of that, since you like animals [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7865.36s)]
*  and the natural world, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7867.48s)]
*  a guy down in South America was looking at Gila monsters, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7869.12s)]
*  those really scary things. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7872.599999999999s)]
*  And he realized they don't have to eat very often. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7873.84s)]
*  I wonder if they're hungry all the time or not. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7876.4s)]
*  Turns out, takes their blood, isolates a peptide, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7878.5199999999995s)]
*  which turns out to be GLP-1, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7881.4s)]
*  puts it into other animals [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7883.8s)]
*  and realizes it suppresses appetite. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7885.12s)]
*  Amazing, right? [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7887.16s)]
*  Like, this is what I love about biology. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7887.98s)]
*  Some dude who studies Gila monsters. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7889.36s)]
*  Turns out humans make GLP-1. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7891.719999999999s)]
*  GLP-1 is stimulated by things like yerba mate tea. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7894.28s)]
*  Certain other compounds, plant compounds, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7898.599999999999s)]
*  stimulate its release. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7901.12s)]
*  But what does it do? [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7902.759999999999s)]
*  In the hypothalamus, it suppresses hunger [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7903.839999999999s)]
*  by way of, there's a particular brain arcuate pathway, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7906.759999999999s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7910.12s)]
*  But it also affects the mechanosensors of the gut [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7910.96s)]
*  so that you feel like your gut's full. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7914.12s)]
*  It's almost like getting like a pharmacologic's [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7916.56s)]
*  tummy, a stapled stomach, right? [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7919.240000000001s)]
*  So when people take a drug that mimics GLP-1, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7921.080000000001s)]
*  their brain's like, well, I'm not as hungry, [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7924.52s)]
*  and their stomach feels full, even though it's empty. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7926.400000000001s)]
*  And so people lose weight. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7928.8s)]
*  It has other effects too, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7930.14s)]
*  but it's working on body and brain. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7931.04s)]
*  This becomes obviously the blockbuster drug of our times. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7933.68s)]
*  This is reminiscent of the fen-fen. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7936.64s)]
*  Remember fen-fen? Yeah, I remember. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7938.76s)]
*  Couple people died of fen-fen, right? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7940.200000000001s)]
*  I knew a gal who developed a heart problem. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7941.72s)]
*  It's a valve thinning and some issues there, gone, done. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7944.4s)]
*  It was off the market. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7947.72s)]
*  I remember that I was in college. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7948.5599999999995s)]
*  Fen-fen, gone. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7949.4s)]
*  It was an amphetamine, right? [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7950.24s)]
*  It was an amphetamine, yeah. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7951.36s)]
*  And it probably felt pretty good to be on too, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7953.04s)]
*  because things like Adderall, Ritalin, all that, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7954.96s)]
*  people like that because it's amphetamine. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7957.24s)]
*  If I show you the structure of amphetamine, [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7959.84s)]
*  I show you the structure of Adderall-Ritalin, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7961.08s)]
*  you don't have to be a chemist to just go, [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7963.12s)]
*  those look very similar. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7964.88s)]
*  So GLP-1 is changing everything. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7966.5199999999995s)]
*  Type 2 diabetes, people are taking it obesity, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7971.08s)]
*  people crave food less. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7973.96s)]
*  And somehow, and I don't know how to explain these data, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7975.48s)]
*  Attiya would know far more about this than I would, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7978.599999999999s)]
*  is somehow it's also allowing people to lose weight [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7981.2s)]
*  even though they're eating similar amounts. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7984.679999999999s)]
*  And so it's probably impacting metabolic pathways. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7987.04s)]
*  It's not without its side effects, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7989.5199999999995s)]
*  but getting, I think it's called a Zempic, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7990.88s)]
*  is the brand name. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7992.48s)]
*  That's going to be like Adderall soon. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7994.88s)]
*  It's going to be hard to find. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7996.16s)]
*  Really? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7997.679999999999s)]
*  Soon it will be, because it is so, [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=7998.5s)]
*  I mean, everybody's trying to get this stuff. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8000.32s)]
*  But won't they just ramp up production of it? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8002.56s)]
*  If they can, if they can keep up. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8004.68s)]
*  But right now there's an Adderall shortage. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8005.88s)]
*  There's an Adderall shortage? [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8007.72s)]
*  And there's a huge, because of all the non-prescription, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8008.88s)]
*  people get the prescriptions and sell it. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8010.96s)]
*  Big, big money on college campuses, big money in finance. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8013.280000000001s)]
*  In the- [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8016.360000000001s)]
*  But then there must be a real problem [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8017.200000000001s)]
*  with like cartel fake Adderall that's laced. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8018.360000000001s)]
*  It's being cut, it's being cut and resolved. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8021.64s)]
*  Yeah, so, but I think the semiglutide thing, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8024.68s)]
*  you know, I'm more of the, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8027.0s)]
*  I always feel like behaviors first, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8028.280000000001s)]
*  nutrition, supplementation, and then prescription drugs. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8030.56s)]
*  I have a question for you about the semiglutide stuff, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8033.120000000001s)]
*  because one of the things that we've discovered [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8036.400000000001s)]
*  when we started going into it [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8038.56s)]
*  and talking about on the podcast was that [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8040.240000000001s)]
*  34% of the weight loss was muscle mass, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8042.320000000001s)]
*  bone mass, and connective tissue. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8045.56s)]
*  Doesn't surprise me. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8048.64s)]
*  My thought was, was that because they were losing weight? [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8049.4800000000005s)]
*  Because if you just get someone to lose weight, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8054.080000000001s)]
*  if someone just stops eating food [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8056.72s)]
*  and just starts like really kind of starving themselves, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8059.36s)]
*  they are 100% gonna lose bone mass, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8062.839999999999s)]
*  they're gonna lose muscle mass, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8065.32s)]
*  and they're probably losing some connective tissue mass too. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8066.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they get skinny fat. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8069.799999999999s)]
*  Is there anything that's been done to do, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8071.16s)]
*  yeah, skinny fat, is there anything that's been done [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8073.599999999999s)]
*  where they've examined people who have done weight training [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8076.48s)]
*  and done resistance training [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8080.96s)]
*  while they're taking semiglutide, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8082.799999999999s)]
*  and does that mitigate the effect of that stuff? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8084.799999999999s)]
*  I have to imagine it would. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8088.84s)]
*  I'm not aware of any trials. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8090.04s)]
*  I mean, doing human research is so tedious and expensive. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8091.72s)]
*  You'd have to have people, you could do it. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8096.84s)]
*  You could, but if you had 50 subjects in each group [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8099.32s)]
*  doing weight training and are they doing sets to near, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8103.18s)]
*  how hard are they? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8105.24s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8106.08s)]
*  So I'm not dismissing it. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8106.900000000001s)]
*  It's an awesome study. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8107.96s)]
*  You'd want to see that. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8108.96s)]
*  You'd want to encourage people to weight train [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8110.16s)]
*  to offset the muscle loss and fat loss. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8112.82s)]
*  One thing that's interesting is that [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8115.92s)]
*  when you trigger the hypothalamus with GLP-1, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8116.92s)]
*  the hypothalamus sends out signals to multiple tissues, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8119.76s)]
*  if not all the tissues of the body. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8122.4400000000005s)]
*  So it doesn't just send signals to the adipose tissue [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8123.96s)]
*  saying, oh, you know, lose body fat. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8126.24s)]
*  It's going to also signal to the musculature. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8129.02s)]
*  And Lane and I get into some really deep dives [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8131.28s)]
*  on this kind of thing. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8134.2s)]
*  You know, when years ago, there's a study [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8135.04s)]
*  what's called NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8137.36s)]
*  If you look at people that move around a lot, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8139.88s)]
*  bounce their knee, kind of moving around, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8142.16s)]
*  those people are like very staccato with their movements, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8144.04s)]
*  they can burn up to 1,800 calories more per day [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8146.08s)]
*  than a person that sits very still. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8151.72s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8153.36s)]
*  This is beautiful work done by Rothwell and Stock. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8154.2s)]
*  If people want to look up those papers, amazing papers. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8156.88s)]
*  Is there health benefit to that in any way? [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8159.48s)]
*  Or is it just a matter of burning off calories? [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8161.96s)]
*  Just burning calories. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8164.48s)]
*  This is, so micro movements. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8166.0s)]
*  And so then, you know, for instance, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8167.6s)]
*  in the treatment of anorexia, the most deadly, by the way, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8169.24s)]
*  of the psychiatric illnesses, most, many anorexics die [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8171.6s)]
*  and they have low muscle mass. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8175.54s)]
*  This is where I'm going with this [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8176.82s)]
*  because it relates to the semiglutide thing. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8177.78s)]
*  They are often in their treatment forbidden [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8179.66s)]
*  from doing these kinds of fidgeting things [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8181.9s)]
*  because they're constantly trying [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8183.78s)]
*  to lose weight all the time. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8185.06s)]
*  Anorexics are very aware of the caloric content of food. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8186.46s)]
*  It's almost, they have a near precision calculator [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8189.26s)]
*  in their head of the caloric content in foods. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8192.62s)]
*  They can look at a hamburger [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8194.66s)]
*  and they can tell you how many fats, carbohydrates [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8195.66s)]
*  and proteins are in there. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8197.62s)]
*  They're a computer and it's horrible. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8198.86s)]
*  And they're also always trying to lose weight, [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8201.86s)]
*  always trying to burn calories. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8203.82s)]
*  And so this neat non-exercise induced thermogenesis, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8206.339999999998s)]
*  thermogenesis, excuse me, is very robust. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8209.939999999999s)]
*  In people that move around, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8214.06s)]
*  even there's a study out of University of Texas Houston, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8217.74s)]
*  this is wild, the soleus muscle, [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8220.64s)]
*  the wider muscle of the calf, for those that don't know that. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8222.279999999999s)]
*  There's a guy down there [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8224.779999999999s)]
*  who's running a human physiology laboratory. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8225.9s)]
*  And he's like, you know, insulin insensitivity [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8228.16s)]
*  is a real problem, type two diabetes. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8230.9s)]
*  The soleus muscle is 1% of our total musculature. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8232.66s)]
*  And he asks a really great question. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8235.58s)]
*  He's like, what if when people are sitting during the day, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8237.58s)]
*  cause everyone's sitting, they just bounced one, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8239.74s)]
*  you know, did what he called a soleus pushup, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8241.82s)]
*  which is kind of, it's a one-legged seated calf raise, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8243.74s)]
*  right, with no weight. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8246.78s)]
*  And they're just bouncing their heel like this, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8247.66s)]
*  like I used to in class. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8249.22s)]
*  What turns out the soleus is an unusual muscle [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8250.9s)]
*  cause it's very small percentage of our total musculature, [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8253.02s)]
*  but its energy utilization is enormously high. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8255.78s)]
*  What does he see? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8258.6s)]
*  Well, when people just bounce their heel, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8259.44s)]
*  their insulin sensitivity improves, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8261.74s)]
*  their resting glucose improves, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8263.699999999999s)]
*  and all they're doing is moving a bit more, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8265.699999999999s)]
*  but they are moving their soleus. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8268.699999999999s)]
*  What's happening? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8270.34s)]
*  It's likely that they're mimicking walking enough [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8271.5s)]
*  during the day that they're getting these positive effects. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8276.1s)]
*  Now, I'm not encouraging people to just do this. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8278.38s)]
*  And when I put some of this out on social media, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8280.86s)]
*  you know, the gym jockeys, you know, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8282.76s)]
*  who I'm friends with, right, they sort of, [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8286.42s)]
*  they were like, dude, come on, [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8288.1s)]
*  don't get people thinking this is exercise. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8289.38s)]
*  I'm not saying that people should just do this, [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8290.9s)]
*  but these micro movements that we do [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8293.14s)]
*  add up a lot during the day. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8295.06s)]
*  So there's nothing wrong with facts. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8297.06s)]
*  No, there's nothing wrong with facts. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8298.859999999999s)]
*  You're not saying this is all you need to do. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8300.1s)]
*  If you were doing that, that would be an issue. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8302.46s)]
*  I'm never, I try and avoid the words only, you know, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8304.22s)]
*  as much as I can in life, unless it's appropriate. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8307.539999999999s)]
*  So you asked about loss of musculature. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8310.8s)]
*  When we are losing weight, [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8313.279999999999s)]
*  or when we have high levels of GLP-1, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8316.16s)]
*  signals are actually sent to the musculature [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8318.42s)]
*  to become catabolic. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8321.16s)]
*  Like the body wants to conserve its most precious resource, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8323.22s)]
*  which is muscle and fat. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8326.4s)]
*  And so GLP-1, very likely based on the output, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8328.62s)]
*  my knowledge of the output of the hypothalamus, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8332.78s)]
*  the animal studies tell us that it's signaling [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8335.1s)]
*  to the most metabolically expensive tissue of the body [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8336.98s)]
*  to conserve itself or to catabolize itself. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8339.94s)]
*  So, you know, fat is one of the harder reserves to lose [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8343.84s)]
*  for that reason, but losing muscle is bad. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8346.86s)]
*  And I guess the short and sweet of this is [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8349.1s)]
*  anyone trying to lose weight [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8351.900000000001s)]
*  should be doing resistance exercise, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8352.94s)]
*  especially if they're in a caloric deficit. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8354.58s)]
*  What is this here? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8357.18s)]
*  People take semiglutide, but don't resistance train, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8358.02s)]
*  risk losing muscle as well as fat, doctors warn. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8361.460000000001s)]
*  Here's why it's important to have a healthy balance [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8364.2s)]
*  of the two. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8366.26s)]
*  I found a couple recent articles that say [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8367.460000000001s)]
*  some doctors are telling people with this, [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8370.380000000001s)]
*  you have to weight train or you're going to lose muscle. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8372.34s)]
*  Well, that's- That makes sense. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8374.58s)]
*  Well, but that is literally the case [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8375.82s)]
*  when people starve themselves. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8379.9s)]
*  That's one of the things that happens [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8382.46s)]
*  when you starve yourself is your body start, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8383.46s)]
*  I mean, it happens to fighters [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8385.18s)]
*  when they're cutting weight, if they do it improperly, [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8386.82s)]
*  if you're not just cutting water, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8388.82s)]
*  your body starts to absorb your muscle tissue. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8390.02s)]
*  And your body temperature, core body temperature goes down [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8392.42s)]
*  because you're less thermogenically active. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8394.74s)]
*  Jamie, I don't think I've ever asked you to- [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8396.96s)]
*  Put that back up, please. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8398.5s)]
*  There've been a few studies of muscle loss [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8400.46s)]
*  of semiglutide so far, [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8402.18s)]
*  but Japanese researchers reported that people lost [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8403.3s)]
*  half a kilo of muscle after three months on the drug. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8405.820000000002s)]
*  That's not that much. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8409.140000000001s)]
*  Half a kilo of muscle is a pound. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8410.980000000001s)]
*  Why are they saying it that way? [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8413.460000000001s)]
*  Like they're making it look like it's- [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8414.460000000001s)]
*  It's one pound of muscle. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8416.460000000001s)]
*  Traditional media. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8417.900000000001s)]
*  Right, but it's two pounds is a kilo, right? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8418.820000000002s)]
*  I know. 2.2, yeah. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8421.42s)]
*  So what the fuck are you saying? [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8422.740000000002s)]
*  They lost a pound of muscle? That's not hard. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8424.1s)]
*  It's a common problem with interventions to lose fat. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8427.380000000001s)]
*  But yes, that is a common problem [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8429.7s)]
*  with interventions to lose fat. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8431.140000000001s)]
*  Makes it imperative to also prescribe resistance training [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8432.58s)]
*  to prevent muscle loss. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8435.14s)]
*  But my concern is that semiglutide is seen [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8436.14s)]
*  as a magic bullet by some people [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8438.619999999999s)]
*  and isn't always combined with exercise. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8441.82s)]
*  I'm sure. I'm sure. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8444.06s)]
*  You know, there's so many confusions [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8446.099999999999s)]
*  in exercise science and weight loss [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8447.699999999999s)]
*  that I've learned about recently from Lane [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8449.42s)]
*  that just make me- like I'm baffled. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8451.46s)]
*  So for instance, you hear that if you eat fewer carbohydrates, [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8454.9s)]
*  you burn more fat, right? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8457.42s)]
*  Okay, so it seems like a simple statement. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8458.9s)]
*  So people go, yeah, I'm going to have a low carb diet. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8460.939999999999s)]
*  I'll burn more fat. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8462.46s)]
*  But when you say fat, what they're talking about [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8463.78s)]
*  is not necessarily body fat. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8466.060000000001s)]
*  Like when people mistake body fat from dietary fat, [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8467.94s)]
*  this is how kindergarten or nursery school [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8470.54s)]
*  or illiterate we are about our own health. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8474.900000000001s)]
*  Because people- so it is true that if you- [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8476.78s)]
*  Lane has been educating me on this. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8479.300000000001s)]
*  If you reduce your carbohydrate intake, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8481.5s)]
*  yes, you'll burn a greater percentage [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8483.78s)]
*  of your calories from fat. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8485.54s)]
*  But if you're eating a lot of fat, [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8487.58s)]
*  you're going to burn a greater percentage of it [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8488.900000000001s)]
*  from those fat calories that you're eating. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8490.380000000001s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean you're losing fat stores. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8492.3s)]
*  All that matters in the end [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8494.38s)]
*  is that calories in, calories out balance. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8495.34s)]
*  What helps people with, you know, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8497.179999999998s)]
*  like particularly things like the carnivore diet [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8500.5s)]
*  or something like that, what helps them is with satiety. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8503.3s)]
*  Like there's something about carbohydrates [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8506.5s)]
*  and so they're so good, you want to keep eating them. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8508.939999999999s)]
*  Like if I have a steak by itself, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8511.46s)]
*  I eat the steak and I'm good. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8515.099999999999s)]
*  But if there's like lobster mashed potatoes [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8516.98s)]
*  or fries sitting there, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8519.74s)]
*  I keep going and that's like an extra thousand calories, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8521.1s)]
*  at least. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8524.34s)]
*  Well, part of that is the blood sugar response. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8525.18s)]
*  Some people will say, why do I crave a big dessert [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8527.26s)]
*  or dessert something sweet after a big meal? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8530.18s)]
*  That should make no sense, right? [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8532.42s)]
*  Well, that's a blood sugar increase. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8533.42s)]
*  But the other reason is your gut has neurons in it. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8535.300000000001s)]
*  Those neurons signal to the dopamine centers in your brain. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8539.82s)]
*  And those neurons are looking for basically three things. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8542.54s)]
*  They want amino acids. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8545.18s)]
*  We are basically amino acid foraging machines. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8547.300000000001s)]
*  Fatty acids, because fats are good for us too. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8549.98s)]
*  That's my opinion, not in excess, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8553.46s)]
*  but they're good for us. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8555.06s)]
*  And sugar. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8555.9s)]
*  And when you get enough steak, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8557.42s)]
*  you're getting enough amino acids and fatty acids. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8561.199999999999s)]
*  And that signal is sent to your brain [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8563.359999999999s)]
*  and a pathway shuts down that says, I need more. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8564.98s)]
*  The moment you throw in a cookie after that steak, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8567.5s)]
*  all of a sudden your appetite goes, [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8570.74s)]
*  and it's not blood sugar, [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8572.779999999999s)]
*  or at least not blood sugar alone. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8574.46s)]
*  It's those neurons in your gut going, [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8575.779999999999s)]
*  oh, there's sugar coming into my system. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8577.38s)]
*  Get more of that, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8578.82s)]
*  because it's an evolutionary conserved system [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8580.06s)]
*  designed to get you more resources. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8582.5s)]
*  So this is why if you look at your gut brain axis, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8584.18s)]
*  as yes, there's a microbiome and that's important too. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8587.26s)]
*  But if you think about it as it's sensing things [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8589.22s)]
*  independent of taste, [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8591.58s)]
*  it's actually looking for specific nutrients. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8592.779999999999s)]
*  Then I think if people forage most for high quality protein [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8595.34s)]
*  and high quality fats, [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8599.44s)]
*  it's kind of obvious that that's the best way [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8600.58s)]
*  to build the basis of your diet. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8602.94s)]
*  And then carbohydrates on a kind of as needed basis. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8605.619999999999s)]
*  If you're doing a lot of weight training, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8609.66s)]
*  depleting glycogen, et cetera. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8610.5s)]
*  So that's where I think there's a place [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8611.34s)]
*  for low or zero carbohydrate diets. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8612.3s)]
*  I tried carnivore with the fruit and honey and all that, [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8614.9s)]
*  and I just could gorge myself and gorge myself. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8618.66s)]
*  I didn't do well on that. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8620.66s)]
*  If I've ever just done meat, I actually feel pretty good. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8621.78s)]
*  I confess, but I'm an omnivore. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8624.38s)]
*  So you gorge yourself on fruit and honey? [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8626.3s)]
*  Is that what you're doing? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8628.539999999999s)]
*  So I've done just meat and I felt pretty good. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8629.38s)]
*  It's great. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8632.34s)]
*  I mean, you feel lighter, you definitely lose weight, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8633.18s)]
*  you're holding less water. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8635.3s)]
*  I found it hard to train really hard with the weights. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8636.7s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8639.5s)]
*  And so I asked Paul Saladino, I said, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8640.900000000001s)]
*  I want to bring in some rice and oatmeal here [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8644.220000000001s)]
*  because I'm suffering in the gym [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8646.140000000001s)]
*  and that's my, I love working out. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8647.58s)]
*  And he said, well do fruit and honey in addition to that. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8650.1s)]
*  So I added in fruit, non-pasteurized cheese and honey [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8652.68s)]
*  the way they do that. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8655.42s)]
*  And sorry, Paul, for me, [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8656.26s)]
*  all it did was just send my appetite through the roof. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8658.02s)]
*  I was just like gorging myself with cheese and fruit [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8659.820000000002s)]
*  and meat all the time. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8662.02s)]
*  I didn't feel well and I still couldn't train well. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8662.84s)]
*  So for me, what works best is mostly quality proteins [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8664.86s)]
*  and quality fats. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8668.42s)]
*  And I get some, I eat a bit of butter and saturated fats [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8669.34s)]
*  but also carbohydrates. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8672.140000000001s)]
*  Is there any, yeah. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8673.78s)]
*  Is there any evidence that rice is bad for you? [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8674.86s)]
*  No. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8677.86s)]
*  So I judge things on, you know, obviously on science [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8678.7s)]
*  but also on how I feel after I eat them. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8683.34s)]
*  And when I eat pasta, I feel like I ate a brick. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8685.52s)]
*  I feel like I ate like a paste. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8688.220000000001s)]
*  How much pasta are we talking? [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8690.7s)]
*  I eat a lot. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8691.82s)]
*  I'm a glutton. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8692.66s)]
*  I like a big bowl of spaghetti [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8694.34s)]
*  with like sausage and meatball. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8696.62s)]
*  So good. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8698.66s)]
*  I love it. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8699.5s)]
*  Lasagna, I love it. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8700.32s)]
*  But if you train hard, it should be fun, right? [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8701.58s)]
*  I don't feel like that with rice. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8703.300000000001s)]
*  When I have rice, like you say, [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8705.26s)]
*  if I have like a steak and some rice, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8706.68s)]
*  I eat the rice and I'll feel full. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8708.76s)]
*  I feel good, but I do not feel like, oh, [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8711.86s)]
*  I don't feel terrible. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8715.1s)]
*  And it seems to give me energy for workouts. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8716.58s)]
*  The problem that I had with pure carnivore [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8719.34s)]
*  was that I work out very hard. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8721.74s)]
*  And when I work out very hard on pure carnivore, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8724.86s)]
*  I was struggling. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8726.5s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8727.9s)]
*  When I added fruit though, [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8728.74s)]
*  I didn't have the same problem that you had [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8730.58s)]
*  where it's like, that's like most of my diet. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8733.02s)]
*  Like, you know, we're talking like 90%. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8736.26s)]
*  90% of my diet is just meat and fruit. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8738.58s)]
*  That's 90% of my diet. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8741.62s)]
*  I'll eat a salad if I feel like eating a salad. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8743.140000000001s)]
*  I enjoy salads, but I always make sure [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8746.1s)]
*  that I'm only putting olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8747.640000000001s)]
*  That's all I use. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8751.02s)]
*  I don't use like bullshit salad dressings [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8751.84s)]
*  because they're all filled with seed oils. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8754.04s)]
*  And sugar. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8755.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's all garbage. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8756.16s)]
*  It's like so many people think they're eating well. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8757.0s)]
*  And like, my God, you have 500 calories [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8758.76s)]
*  of fucking nonsense on your salad. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8760.92s)]
*  That, you know, and it's like, it's not good for you. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8763.52s)]
*  Yeah, you and I eat pretty similar. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8765.6s)]
*  I do eat rice, oatmeal, typically after I train. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8767.7s)]
*  And in the evening, I like some carbohydrates for my meal [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8770.48s)]
*  because it helps me sleep. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8772.44s)]
*  I have read things about glyphosate and oatmeal [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8773.6s)]
*  and that some oat meals have a very high level [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8776.92s)]
*  of glyphosate contamination. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8781.36s)]
*  Or Sheena Swan, when like there are phthalates. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8783.04s)]
*  Yes, phthalates. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8785.76s)]
*  Glyphosate's a different thing. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8787.36s)]
*  That's round up. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8788.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think the nutrition, you know, it's clear. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8789.640000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm citing him a lot because frankly, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8792.36s)]
*  he's like an encyclopedia for this stuff [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8794.32s)]
*  and he can call it meta-analysis like nobody's business. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8795.84s)]
*  You know, Lane's made it very clear [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8798.08s)]
*  by pointing out the data that carbohydrates [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8800.6s)]
*  aren't going to disrupt your ability to burn fat, right? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8804.92s)]
*  It's about keeping calories in check. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8807.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's calories in, calories out. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8809.0s)]
*  Lane is very specific about that [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8810.2s)]
*  and I think he's absolutely right. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8812.0s)]
*  You know, there's so many people that have these ideas [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8813.800000000001s)]
*  that if you eat carnivore, you burn fat [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8816.880000000001s)]
*  because of, you eat less calories. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8819.28s)]
*  You get satisfied quicker, you eat less calories. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8821.880000000001s)]
*  Well, I have one idea that I'm hoping someone will test, [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8824.6s)]
*  which is when you're on a low carbohydrate diet [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8827.5s)]
*  or you're doing intermittent fasting, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8829.640000000001s)]
*  one thing that's very clear is that your adrenaline [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8831.400000000001s)]
*  and noradrenaline epinephrine levels are higher. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8833.960000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that you see [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8836.36s)]
*  is that people are more alert [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8837.720000000001s)]
*  and when they're more alert, they move more. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8838.92s)]
*  And that brings us back to NEAT, [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8840.68s)]
*  this non-exercise induced thermogenesis. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8842.04s)]
*  As you said, you eat a big bowl of pasta [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8843.88s)]
*  and it tends to make you feel kind of sedentary. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8845.2s)]
*  Whereas when you just eat meat, you can go, go, go. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8847.48s)]
*  I ran into Jordan Peterson not that long ago [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8850.36s)]
*  and you know, he's really big. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8854.12s)]
*  He does three steaks a day and not just for his age, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8855.2s)]
*  he looks very fit and he feels strong. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8858.76s)]
*  Now I don't know what he's doing in the realm of training. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8861.04s)]
*  I don't think he lifts weights. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8862.88s)]
*  Exactly, so I don't think he has to replenish glycogen [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8864.32s)]
*  the same way many people do, [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8866.52s)]
*  but I think for people who are doing [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8867.54s)]
*  mostly cardiovascular exercise, some resistance training, [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8868.78s)]
*  I think he does some, [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8871.54s)]
*  the carnivore thing may work very well. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8873.220000000001s)]
*  But I think that also just being a mobile moving person. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8875.980000000001s)]
*  And you know, this thing about NEAT was discovered [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8880.380000000001s)]
*  because they noted that people that were very thin [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8883.140000000001s)]
*  tend to move a lot. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8885.300000000001s)]
*  It was a reverse, it was kind of correlation [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8886.62s)]
*  in both directions. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8888.42s)]
*  Whereas people who are larger tend to be pretty sedentary [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8889.660000000002s)]
*  and they move slower. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8891.86s)]
*  I think that one of the best examples online, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8893.140000000001s)]
*  at least, of someone who's on a pure carnivore diet, [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8895.62s)]
*  who's very active is Sean Baker. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8898.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8900.660000000002s)]
*  And Sean Baker's just, I mean, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8901.5s)]
*  he regularly posts his workouts. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8903.1s)]
*  He's 56 years old. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8905.34s)]
*  I mean, he's doing heavy deadlifts [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8907.820000000002s)]
*  and he holds world records for rowing. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8910.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's like a serious power-based athlete [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8913.900000000001s)]
*  who only eats steak. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8917.220000000001s)]
*  That's all he eats. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8919.060000000001s)]
*  He doesn't incorporate organs. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8920.220000000001s)]
*  He doesn't do anything else. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8922.1s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if he's taking any vitamins [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8923.34s)]
*  or minerals, but I mean, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8925.22s)]
*  most of what that guy eats is steak. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8926.82s)]
*  He looks super fit. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8929.98s)]
*  He's great, he's very fit. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8931.179999999998s)]
*  I know a number of police officers and firefighters [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8932.539999999999s)]
*  are doing that now because a lot of their job, [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8936.26s)]
*  especially police officers, is sedentary [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8938.019999999999s)]
*  and then it's go, go, go. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8939.779999999999s)]
*  And they seem to like that. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8941.939999999999s)]
*  There's a study on intermittent fasting [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8943.859999999999s)]
*  that was done by Sachin Panda's lab out of the Salk [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8945.26s)]
*  on firefighters, because their schedules are crazy. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8947.14s)]
*  And being a night owl and then swing shifts [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8949.66s)]
*  is just terrible wreaks havoc on your metabolic system. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8952.58s)]
*  I mean, it's just one of the quickest ways [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8955.3s)]
*  to make yourself ill, but we need shift workers, right? [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8956.62s)]
*  Thank you, shift workers. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8959.539999999999s)]
*  So the intermittent fasting and these more, [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8960.66s)]
*  let's just call them elimination diets [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8965.3s)]
*  where it's mainly carnivore, really help them, [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8966.62s)]
*  those communities stay fitter and more active. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8968.74s)]
*  There's a guy on Instagram, I don't know his name, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8971.1s)]
*  but I love his police posts. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8973.58s)]
*  He shows us. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8974.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8975.7s)]
*  Amazing. Yeah, follow him. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8976.539999999999s)]
*  And he sometimes puts up this post. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8977.36s)]
*  I love these ones. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8978.46s)]
*  I do see how intense that job is and like, wow. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8979.3s)]
*  But he'll post like supplements and it's a steak. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8982.74s)]
*  He's just all about protein training and the job. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8985.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8987.82s)]
*  In other aspects of life, he keeps quiet [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8988.66s)]
*  for good reason, of course. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8991.82s)]
*  But it's clear that for people that need to be active [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8992.9s)]
*  or who are sitting a ton, [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8996.060000000001s)]
*  that the carnivore diet might be a great thing. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8997.94s)]
*  And now I'm not talking about [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=8999.54s)]
*  the carnivore fruit, meat, honey thing. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9001.42s)]
*  Again, apologies, Paul, I'm not saying that's bad, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9003.980000000001s)]
*  but these are people who are mainly just doing meat. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9006.140000000001s)]
*  And they just feel like their appetite is more regular. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9008.58s)]
*  And cops, you kind of see it's a binary distribution. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9010.94s)]
*  They're either really fit or they're really unfit. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9013.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9016.779999999999s)]
*  And listen, it's gotta be an incredibly hard job. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9017.619999999999s)]
*  Firefighters, the fitness part, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9019.859999999999s)]
*  it seems a little bit more aligned to like working out [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9022.02s)]
*  at the station and things like that. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9024.1s)]
*  In any case. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9025.74s)]
*  They have a lot more downtime. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9027.18s)]
*  They have a lot more downtime. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9028.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9029.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think that we were talking, [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9030.0s)]
*  I think last time we spoke about supplementation [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9032.74s)]
*  as it relates to metabolic pathways. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9035.539999999999s)]
*  And one thing I've been tracking pretty closely [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9037.82s)]
*  is this whole, the NMN thing has now taken a different [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9039.26s)]
*  direction. Great, I was gonna bring that up [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9041.82s)]
*  before we wrap this up. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9042.66s)]
*  Yeah, so, yeah. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9043.82s)]
*  So. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9045.78s)]
*  So let's explain NMN for people. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9046.98s)]
*  It's a precursor for NAD+. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9048.78s)]
*  Right, so NAD is critical to energy production [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9050.5s)]
*  in all cells, vital. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9054.1s)]
*  Levels of NAD tend to go down as we age. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9056.74s)]
*  It's an absolute requirement for cellular health and life. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9060.5s)]
*  You need it. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9063.14s)]
*  Some years ago, as David Sinclair came on this podcast, [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9064.74s)]
*  and discussed that his laboratories, [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9069.14s)]
*  tenured professor of genetics, Harvard Medical School, [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9071.859999999999s)]
*  and other laboratories are starting to explore [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9074.42s)]
*  stimulating the NAD pathway as a tool [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9077.539999999999s)]
*  for extending lifespan in mice. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9079.42s)]
*  And that there were already some data from yeast. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9082.3s)]
*  There are now some clinical trials in humans. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9086.26s)]
*  You can't just take NAD, or you can, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9089.18s)]
*  but it doesn't get into cells very easily. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9091.38s)]
*  Here I'm painting with a broad brush. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9093.22s)]
*  But there are basically two ways [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9094.74s)]
*  that you can tickle this pathway, increase NAD. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9096.58s)]
*  One is to take NMN, right? [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9100.3s)]
*  Some people will try different B vitamins, but NMN, [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9103.1s)]
*  which the idea is that it gets into cells [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9107.06s)]
*  and it's converted into NAD. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9108.78s)]
*  Some people are more proponents of taking NR. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9110.3s)]
*  Okay, so, and the end product is thought to be the same. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9113.7s)]
*  However, there's a lot of controversy [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9116.94s)]
*  about whether or not NAD or NR are better. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9118.42s)]
*  NR is what was initially sold under the brand name Elysium, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9120.62s)]
*  with a unbelievable cast of scientific advisors, [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9125.54s)]
*  Nobel Prize winners. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9129.580000000002s)]
*  This is a very East Coast oriented thing, [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9130.580000000002s)]
*  but a colleague of mine right downstairs for me [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9132.5s)]
*  at Stanford School of Medicine, who has a Nobel Prize [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9134.300000000001s)]
*  for studying this, for discovering the structure of RNA, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9135.94s)]
*  Roger Kornberg, his daddy discovered RNA, Arthur Kornberg. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9138.220000000001s)]
*  There was literally an ad of him holding [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9141.460000000001s)]
*  a true nitrogen bottle like this, you know? [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9143.78s)]
*  And it's like, okay, I started paying attention to this. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9145.42s)]
*  NR and NMN, they're taking an oral form in capsules. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9148.140000000001s)]
*  Some people are giving NAD infusions out there. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9151.54s)]
*  This is a more expensive boutique thing. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9154.42s)]
*  But after David started talking about NMN, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9156.38s)]
*  a lot of people, including myself, [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9160.94s)]
*  started experimenting with it. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9162.58s)]
*  Now, just to take a step back, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9163.94s)]
*  a lot of people out there, [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9166.06s)]
*  like if there isn't a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9168.14s)]
*  you know, random trial, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9171.5s)]
*  then why would you ever take something? [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9174.02s)]
*  And then there are a lot of people, like David or me, [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9175.82s)]
*  or a lot of people out there who think, [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9178.5s)]
*  well, if there are some mouse data or something safe, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9180.3s)]
*  why wouldn't I try, right? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9182.74s)]
*  Because when it comes to longevity, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9183.9s)]
*  nobody wants to be in the control group. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9185.38s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9187.38s)]
*  I mean, that's like, you know? [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9188.22s)]
*  So this is a highly contentious field. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9189.859999999999s)]
*  But then what's happened is, [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9192.1s)]
*  so you can take NMN as a subliminal powder or- [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9194.3s)]
*  Which seems to be more effective, NMN or NR? [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9197.02s)]
*  Okay, that's, there are people who will argue NR. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9200.14s)]
*  There are people- Are there people that take both? [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9204.42s)]
*  I was taking both for a while. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9206.66s)]
*  How did you feel? [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9208.34s)]
*  I felt like I had more energy. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9209.34s)]
*  Now, it's subjective, it's an NN1 thing, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9211.38s)]
*  but I still take NMN sublingually. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9214.46s)]
*  I take a pretty high dose. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9216.98s)]
*  So the recommendation was anywhere from 500 milligrams [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9218.98s)]
*  to about a gram and a half. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9221.46s)]
*  When you say sublingually, are you taking it- [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9222.3s)]
*  You take a powder and put it under my tongue. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9223.78s)]
*  No, how are you getting this powder? [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9225.38s)]
*  So should I tell you how it was banned [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9227.26s)]
*  and how I'm still getting it? [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9229.5s)]
*  Or I was buying it, you could buy it from Renew by Science. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9230.34s)]
*  And now it's banned? [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9233.38s)]
*  Yeah, I have no relationship to Renew by Science. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9234.34s)]
*  But now it's banned officially? [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9236.14s)]
*  Yeah, so what happened was this last year, [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9237.38s)]
*  something was sent to the FDA. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9240.539999999999s)]
*  There's a company called Metro International Biotech, [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9244.5s)]
*  sometimes just referred to as Metro Biotech. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9247.94s)]
*  This is a company that has a trial. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9250.22s)]
*  They're studying something similar to NMN. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9253.1s)]
*  It's a slight variation on NMN. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9256.98s)]
*  And it's an experimental drug. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9259.3s)]
*  And the way the FDA works is if something is being explored [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9261.7s)]
*  as an experimental potential prescription drug [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9265.42s)]
*  or pharmaceutical compound, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9268.22s)]
*  it cannot be sold as a supplement. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9270.3s)]
*  So it's a question of what went in first. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9272.1s)]
*  Now this happened a few years ago [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9274.26s)]
*  for something called NAC, N-A-C-O-C-I-S-T-E-N. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9275.9s)]
*  And NAC is still available [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9279.06s)]
*  despite it initially getting banned. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9280.26s)]
*  And I'll tell you how it was rescued from that. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9281.74s)]
*  So it turns out that Metro International Biotech [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9284.02s)]
*  is a company that has a pretty impressive advisory board. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9286.9s)]
*  Li-Wei Tsai from MIT, who I know, [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9290.380000000001s)]
*  Alzheimer's researcher, some other folks. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9292.5s)]
*  David Sinclair is part of the company. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9294.5s)]
*  It's either his company or he's certainly [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9296.9s)]
*  on the head of the advisory board or on the advisory board. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9298.3s)]
*  That's what the website says. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9300.5s)]
*  So there are a lot of people that are a bit inflamed, [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9302.3s)]
*  if you will, because this thing was popularized [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9306.259999999998s)]
*  through the discussion of NMN and its potential virtues. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9308.98s)]
*  And then now the FDA sent out a ruling early this year [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9312.259999999998s)]
*  that supplement companies cannot sell it. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9315.58s)]
*  Many supplement companies responded to that and said, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9317.859999999999s)]
*  okay, we won't sell it. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9319.779999999999s)]
*  Other companies such as Renew by Science, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9321.74s)]
*  we'll see what happens after this podcast, [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9323.859999999999s)]
*  have continued to sell it. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9325.259999999998s)]
*  If you go on there this morning, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9326.74s)]
*  you could buy NMN. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9328.14s)]
*  So the FDA- [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9329.859999999999s)]
*  I want to buy some before this podcast hits the air. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9330.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I have a boatload. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9332.859999999999s)]
*  I'll give you some too. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9334.14s)]
*  And it's clean. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9335.18s)]
*  Yeah, so the bags of it are the best way to go [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9336.9s)]
*  because you can buy it in pretty high volume [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9339.699999999999s)]
*  in the bags or canisters. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9341.06s)]
*  And I personally take, because I'll tell you the results [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9343.019999999999s)]
*  that I experienced, which I really liked, [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9345.9s)]
*  I take about two grams per morning under my tongue. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9348.019999999999s)]
*  Definite increase in subjective feeling [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9351.06s)]
*  of increase in energy. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9353.42s)]
*  And you believe that sublingual is the way to go [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9354.38s)]
*  as opposed to taking it in oral form and pills? [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9356.22s)]
*  Yeah, and that's because Atiya who, again, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9358.9s)]
*  Peter, forgive me if I'm misspeaking here, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9361.82s)]
*  but Atiya was like, there's no way [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9363.859999999999s)]
*  that's going to get into your cells, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9365.66s)]
*  taking it, taking his capsules. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9367.22s)]
*  And I said, what about sublingual? [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9369.179999999998s)]
*  He's like, I just don't see how it could happen. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9370.46s)]
*  And- [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9372.74s)]
*  But it's been proven that it gets in through IV. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9373.58s)]
*  Right, it gets in through IV [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9376.82s)]
*  and there are also electrophoretic patches, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9378.019999999999s)]
*  some NAD patches. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9380.42s)]
*  I managed to stock up on those. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9381.98s)]
*  I can send you some of those. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9383.14s)]
*  I have a huge cache of those. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9383.98s)]
*  NAD patches? [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9384.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's a patch you put on, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9385.66s)]
*  it's slow release of NAD. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9386.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's got two electrodes and you just put it, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9388.3s)]
*  yeah, it's pretty, it's good stuff. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9391.619999999999s)]
*  That's some robot shit. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9393.02s)]
*  So, Alex Friedman, you know, who takes no supplements. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9394.06s)]
*  He lives on meat, athletic greens, element and mint tea. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9398.1s)]
*  You know? [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9401.9s)]
*  Well, those are all good. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9402.74s)]
*  And life. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9403.98s)]
*  Elements, a good supplement. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9404.82s)]
*  Athletic greens is awesome. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9406.42s)]
*  Yeah, so people are upset [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9407.7s)]
*  because they feel like they were turned onto this stuff [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9410.02s)]
*  and then it's now- [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9412.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9413.82s)]
*  This could soon be a prescription drug. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9414.9s)]
*  Now, keep in mind that the resveratrol thing was similar [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9417.18s)]
*  in the sense that there was a variation on resveratrol [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9420.22s)]
*  that was patented and sold to a company. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9423.42s)]
*  And that sort of didn't pan out [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9426.66s)]
*  or is still a work in progress. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9429.38s)]
*  And you can still buy resveratrol. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9431.9s)]
*  That's not a problem because it was different enough. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9434.5s)]
*  So the FDA decided to let NAC stay on the market [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9435.98s)]
*  because many, many people wrote letters to the FDA [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9441.74s)]
*  saying, this is ridiculous. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9444.98s)]
*  This is of value. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9446.26s)]
*  And it was out as a supplement. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9447.3s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9449.02s)]
*  What's the benefits of NAC? [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9449.859999999999s)]
*  NAC is again in these metabolic pathways [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9452.34s)]
*  for metabolic health. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9454.3s)]
*  This isn't my area of expertise. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9455.699999999999s)]
*  So I don't want to talk out of turn here. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9457.02s)]
*  I don't know the specific details [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9459.66s)]
*  of why people are taking, I don't take that. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9461.699999999999s)]
*  So part of the reason I think it's healthy [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9464.3s)]
*  to have this conversation is to understand [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9467.06s)]
*  how this stuff happens. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9468.62s)]
*  NMN could soon be a prescription drug [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9471.58s)]
*  that you can only get with a prescription. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9474.140000000001s)]
*  And then I think Metro International Biotech [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9475.94s)]
*  will likely hold the patent. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9478.02s)]
*  If people are interested in certain compounds [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9480.220000000001s)]
*  remaining on market, they should definitely write to the FDA. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9482.42s)]
*  The FDA, as much as that's a mysterious, [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9486.060000000001s)]
*  big stone block kind of company, very opaque to us, [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9488.980000000001s)]
*  I think they listen when things happen in large volume. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9492.58s)]
*  And so I'm certainly going to write letters. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9496.1s)]
*  And I think that keeping NMN on the market [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9498.7s)]
*  as a supplement would be wonderful [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9501.62s)]
*  for many people that want to take it. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9503.140000000001s)]
*  Now the folks who are involved with NR companies [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9504.300000000001s)]
*  are delighted because for them, this is like, [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9507.1s)]
*  again, I'm not going to get into the debate [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9509.7s)]
*  of what's better NR, NMN, [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9510.94s)]
*  because I just don't have the expertise to parse that. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9512.26s)]
*  There are other people that are better suited to do that. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9514.74s)]
*  But the people that work on NR are thinking like, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9516.86s)]
*  this is great. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9518.66s)]
*  Like let this whole NMN thing fan out [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9519.58s)]
*  because it's a market competition. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9521.78s)]
*  Does NR have a shelf life? [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9522.62s)]
*  Like if you have a jar of that stuff from a year ago, [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9526.42s)]
*  is it still good? [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9529.5s)]
*  I have to imagine it is. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9530.82s)]
*  I didn't refrigerate my True Niogen. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9532.38s)]
*  And I liked True Niogen. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9535.58s)]
*  I experienced the same effects. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9537.14s)]
*  Again, I have no relationship to that company. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9538.46s)]
*  They're all podcast bonds, they don't pay me a dime, [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9540.18s)]
*  et cetera. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9542.26s)]
*  The problem is it's very expensive [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9543.1s)]
*  to take the kind of dosages that I'm taking. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9544.9s)]
*  And whereas we- [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9548.06s)]
*  You think high dosages is the way to go? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9548.9s)]
*  I do. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9550.98s)]
*  Yeah, why is that? [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9551.82s)]
*  I just didn't experience much of a subjective effect [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9553.18s)]
*  at low dosages. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9556.14s)]
*  So something like Elysium? [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9556.98s)]
*  That's, yeah, same. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9558.42s)]
*  Like how much were you taking of that? [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9560.380000000001s)]
*  I was getting up to a gram and a half. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9562.220000000001s)]
*  How many pills is that? [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9563.98s)]
*  I was up to like seven or eight pills, I think. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9565.02s)]
*  I don't quite recall. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9567.42s)]
*  But I will say with NMN, a couple of things happened. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9568.26s)]
*  First of all, energy, my recovery from workouts, [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9570.62s)]
*  much better. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9574.1s)]
*  I had to take it early day [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9574.94s)]
*  because it was giving me a lot of energy. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9575.76s)]
*  And then I'm not into my nails and hair, frankly. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9577.62s)]
*  Not one of those. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9580.42s)]
*  When my hair is starting to go, [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9581.380000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to let go. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9582.74s)]
*  But I did notice like my hair and nails [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9583.58s)]
*  are growing at a ridiculous rate. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9585.86s)]
*  And then I came off it just as a control experiment, [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9587.66s)]
*  slowed down again. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9590.18s)]
*  So it was really interesting. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9591.06s)]
*  I think there's something there in cellular growth pathway. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9591.9s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9593.86s)]
*  And I didn't change anything else. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9594.699999999999s)]
*  I was doing blood work. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9595.92s)]
*  I still do blood work regularly. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9596.84s)]
*  So, you know, is it going to make me live longer? [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9598.5s)]
*  I don't know, but I don't know how, [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9600.78s)]
*  the day I die, I won't know whether or not [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9602.58s)]
*  I would have lived shorter or longer anyway. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9604.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like what, how do you feel now [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9605.86s)]
*  is what's important. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9607.86s)]
*  Yeah, so I really like the sublingual NMN. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9608.699999999999s)]
*  There's some other talk about the FDA [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9611.0s)]
*  making testosterone something where you're going to have [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9613.44s)]
*  to go to your doctor once a month. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9617.34s)]
*  Yeah, they don't want it by telehealth. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9620.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9621.88s)]
*  So I think I saw one of, [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9622.92s)]
*  there's a Chris Bell that posted something about this. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9624.68s)]
*  There are a lot of CLIC clinics, as I call them, [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9628.24s)]
*  online clinics who are prescribing testosterone [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9632.16s)]
*  at whatever dosages that they deem are appropriate [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9635.84s)]
*  for someone based on blood work. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9638.24s)]
*  I mean, if you go to the doctor, [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9641.6s)]
*  you're basically going to get the same blood work. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9642.44s)]
*  Once a month is preposterous. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9643.28s)]
*  People do not have the time to go to a doctor once a month. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9645.24s)]
*  That is very annoying. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9648.36s)]
*  Originally what they wanted to do with TRT, [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9649.800000000001s)]
*  remember people were going in [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9651.880000000001s)]
*  and getting their full 200 milligrams [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9652.84s)]
*  because it's typically testosterone cypionate [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9654.52s)]
*  in this country, 200 milligrams per mil, [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9656.44s)]
*  which is, you know, one syringe full [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9659.12s)]
*  if it's a one ml syringe, obviously. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9661.68s)]
*  People were getting that once every two weeks. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9663.16s)]
*  And that's a crazy dosage scheme. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9665.800000000001s)]
*  You're supposed to, the best way we know is to divide it up. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9667.36s)]
*  Sublingually every three days. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9670.04s)]
*  Subcutaneous. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9672.28s)]
*  Subcutaneous, excuse me. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9673.12s)]
*  Yeah, don't go under the top. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9674.2s)]
*  Yeah, don't do that. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9675.04s)]
*  There was an oral version [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9676.320000000002s)]
*  that they were working on for a while. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9677.640000000001s)]
*  There was an oral version of testosterone. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9678.880000000001s)]
*  Well, there are, I mean, things like oxandrolone [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9680.720000000001s)]
*  and Anivar were always taken as pills, but the liver. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9682.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it was a spray. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9684.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9686.6s)]
*  It was a sublingual spray. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9687.44s)]
*  There's the cream, there's the dermal scrotal patches. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9688.560000000001s)]
*  That gets weird. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9691.2s)]
*  But subcutaneously every three days [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9692.04s)]
*  is supposed to be the way to go. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9694.52s)]
*  Yeah, every other day or every three days [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9695.800000000001s)]
*  at a lower dose to spread it out [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9697.400000000001s)]
*  because the testes normally kick out somewhere [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9698.76s)]
*  between seven and 15 milligrams of testosterone per day. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9701.44s)]
*  So, and you got two testes, most people anyway. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9704.76s)]
*  So most men have two testes, obviously. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9707.44s)]
*  So what you're talking about is 200 Migs on one day [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9710.800000000001s)]
*  and then coming back two weeks later is crazy, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9714.48s)]
*  but that was really serving the physicians well [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9716.24s)]
*  because you had to go in for a clinic visit, et cetera. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9718.2s)]
*  But people would get these giant spikes and then the crash. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9720.56s)]
*  And the conversion to estrogen [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9723.64s)]
*  from a massive dose all at once. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9725.04s)]
*  A ridiculous dose that you should never take. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9726.68s)]
*  And sometimes a too big a dose can crush libido. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9728.720000000001s)]
*  It's a mess. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9732.0s)]
*  So I think if people need to be able to self-administer [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9733.24s)]
*  and all this ruling would do, frankly, [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9737.12s)]
*  is send people into gray market routes. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9740.28s)]
*  That's all it would do. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9743.2s)]
*  There's like a zero minus one. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9744.56s)]
*  Is that going to happen? [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9746.4s)]
*  I sure hope not. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9748.08s)]
*  I sure hope not. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9749.28s)]
*  Because I think the number of people [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9750.12s)]
*  that can afford to go to a physician who's really good, [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9751.44s)]
*  who's going to dose it correctly is so infinitesimally small. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9753.8s)]
*  And testosterone is not particularly expensive, [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9757.8s)]
*  but I'm very sensitive to the idea that a lot of the things [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9761.439999999999s)]
*  that hold great health benefits are just outside [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9764.72s)]
*  the financial reach of a lot of people. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9767.0s)]
*  Well, it will become outside the financial reach [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9768.48s)]
*  if you're making people have a doctor's appointment [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9770.64s)]
*  once a month. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9773.439999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9774.519999999999s)]
*  You're going to have to pay for that appointment. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9775.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't imagine your insurance [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9777.32s)]
*  is going to cover all of that. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9779.4s)]
*  No, I think it's going to kick up the black market. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9780.72s)]
*  So right now, I'm sure there are people [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9783.2s)]
*  who are starting to stock up Sipienate so they can sell it. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9784.76s)]
*  It's sending us back into the dark ages, frankly, [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9787.880000000001s)]
*  of that stuff. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9790.960000000001s)]
*  So hopefully not. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9792.0s)]
*  If someone tells me who to talk to or petition. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9793.480000000001s)]
*  As you can tell, I'm getting more vocal about stuff. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9796.320000000002s)]
*  I also feel safer nowadays to talk about things [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9797.92s)]
*  than I did a few years ago [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9799.880000000001s)]
*  because things are becoming more commonplace, [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9801.28s)]
*  mostly because I have colleagues who contact me and say, [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9802.84s)]
*  like, hey, how do I get on testosterone? [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9805.800000000001s)]
*  Do I need testosterone? [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9808.36s)]
*  Once they start getting older and they say [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9809.400000000001s)]
*  you still look healthy. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9811.12s)]
*  Yeah, psilocybin, testosterone, [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9811.96s)]
*  so many different things that are very beneficial. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9815.0s)]
*  Just look at people that are healthy and happy. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9817.359999999999s)]
*  Like, what are they doing? [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9819.519999999999s)]
*  And are they honest? [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9820.48s)]
*  Talk to them. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9822.32s)]
*  And beautiful thing about a podcast is people [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9823.679999999998s)]
*  who are healthy and happy will tell you this is what I do [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9826.56s)]
*  and this is what you can do and this is the pros, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9828.919999999998s)]
*  this is the cons. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9831.279999999999s)]
*  Go to a doctor, get yourself checked out. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9832.72s)]
*  Don't do it if you're this, don't do it if you're that. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9834.919999999998s)]
*  But there's probably a great number of people [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9837.32s)]
*  that could benefit from these things. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9841.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9842.36s)]
*  And I just say, because we were talking about NMN [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9843.2s)]
*  and David Sinclair, I mean, [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9845.36s)]
*  he's going to know the nuance there. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9846.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't know all the nuance. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9847.84s)]
*  Haven't talked to him in a while, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9849.480000000001s)]
*  but I think he's definitely in the camp [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9850.560000000001s)]
*  of people in science who are thinking what's possible, [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9853.28s)]
*  taking some significant steps based on mouse work. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9857.960000000001s)]
*  And I do want to be fair to people that do that, right? [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9861.2s)]
*  I do that too. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9864.080000000002s)]
*  I mostly focused on human studies and human stuff, [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9865.0s)]
*  but there are many people out in the world [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9867.6s)]
*  that are interested in things they can do for their health. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9870.88s)]
*  And they know that if they're waiting [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9873.839999999998s)]
*  for the random controlled trial and huge numbers of subjects, [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9874.92s)]
*  and especially for people with diseases in their family [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9879.519999999999s)]
*  or that have diseases, [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9881.8s)]
*  they're not interested in waiting. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9883.0s)]
*  They don't want to do anything sketchy or dangerous, [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9884.72s)]
*  but they're not interested in waiting. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9886.64s)]
*  So I think David's, you know, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9887.839999999998s)]
*  he's really driving certain things hard [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9889.4s)]
*  and some people agree with him, some people don't, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9892.439999999999s)]
*  but he's got a vision. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9894.48s)]
*  The one thing I can say for sure about David [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9895.48s)]
*  is he's got a vision and he's going for it. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9897.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9899.199999999999s)]
*  And there are, you know, this thing about FDA controlling [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9900.52s)]
*  or non-FDA controlling, I think it's vexing some people. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9903.640000000001s)]
*  And it'll be interesting to see how it goes. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9907.12s)]
*  But if you're interested in keeping NMN [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVvSe9xJoys&t=9908.52s)]
