*  Hey, ball hog. Hey, buddy
*  Dude you know I had today hmm duck eggs duck eggs you don't need them now
*  You don't need them in your life no good is the reason why they sell chicken eggs and that duck a trick me
*  Where'd you go duck eggs? Where did you get duck? Erwan? Oh, yeah, I go to Erwan
*  Yeah, like oh duck eggs and tastes notably shitty
*  Really yeah like gooey like it sticks to the roof of your mouth is that smaller to know they're bigger
*  They're bigger ducks are maybe quail eggs. I've had yeah, those are good. Those are good. They're small
*  Yeah, they're really little because quail are tiny, but ducks are big fucks. Yeah, they are they shit out some big eggs
*  And they're nasty they know they they like stick to your mouth like
*  And you fry it mm-hmm same way like same way loose yolk or no like easy. Yeah, yeah
*  It's like regular yolk, but the yolk sticks to your mouth alright stays inside your mouth. It sounds like a ball hog
*  Yeah, it's not I don't recommend. I'm feeding the rest of them to my dog. I think really he loves them those eggs
*  He loves eggs Marshall those yeah crack open an egg and mix it in with his kibble sometimes. That's awesome
*  Yeah, most the time I feed him
*  Either he gets a little bit of kibble and some elk meat
*  Or give him ground elk meat or some some other kind of meat much spoiled. He eats well. He eats well. That's awesome
*  Yeah, I think everyone loves Marshall
*  Have you met him? Yeah, you met him here right couple times. Yeah, he's the sweetest dog in the world
*  Yeah, I got it. You know the dogs were like that. Yeah, it's a special dog. It's golden retrievers man
*  They're smart to the real smart. I have a fucking box of sand as a dog, but she's adorable
*  She's sweet, but she's dumb shit. What is she Brussels Graffon? Well? I don't even know what that is looks like an Ewok
*  Oh, I do know what that is okay. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
*  That's an odd choice is that your wife's choice of course yeah, yeah rods. Yeah, getcha getcha with the dog choice
*  Little dog, but they basically want a baby that they don't care too much of it dies
*  I think she'd be pretty sad this one died
*  Pretty sad, but not like babysat. No fuck no no no no no no it's like a
*  It's like a baby that you know you only have to take care of for like 14 years
*  Yeah, yeah, we talk about it sometimes like I love you so much
*  I'll say it to the dog, and I know you won't be here long you know yeah
*  She's pretty young though, so I think I think you know for lucky. She'll have a good run. I lost the dog last year
*  That was terrible. Yeah, I've lost a dog two years ago. It's rough. It's two dogs in a row
*  Well, they're both were so old they couldn't walk anymore
*  Our guy horrible heart condition, and you know we've given him all the meds
*  And he was just on a decline and I was on the road
*  when he
*  Died and you know I just was kind of stunned and I and I kind of you know I had to keep doing the shows
*  Obviously right it was like a long weekend of shows then when I got back I fucking broke down
*  Yeah, it really fucks you up. It's a weird relationship humans and animals. You know yeah, yeah
*  It's yeah, and especially like if you do you grow up with dogs. Yeah, yeah
*  So it's like it really becomes like it feels weird when you don't have a dog for me. I've always had a dog
*  Yeah, I've always had cats and dogs always most of my life
*  Yeah, either like when I was living in an apartment in New York
*  I had a cat in Boston had a cat and then when I soon as I got to LA I got dogs
*  Yeah, so I got a yard. I'm like all right. I'm getting a dog. It's the best like the first thing. I thought of they're the best
*  No, they bark when someone's coming near your fucking house. It's true. Yeah, they are really and they have that extra
*  System in them you know that level of sensitivity to sound and smell that like yeah when they start like what are you talking about?
*  Yeah, they see things like when I was having coyote problems. I took Marshall out even when he was pretty young
*  He was like six seven months old. I took him out and he was just like
*  And I'm like what are you what are you freaking out about and then I turn look and I see these eyeballs
*  Moving through the trees outside the chicken coop. I'm like you little cunts. It's fucking coyote cunts coyotes are such fuckers, man
*  There's such fuckers. I lived in you know in this neighborhood where?
*  What pull out of your driveway noon? Yeah standing in the middle of the street. Oh, yeah looking around
*  Well, we're Whitney lives in Woodland Hills. Yeah, yeah, is that that area?
*  She was on the street for me, bro. Her area is infested
*  She's got dogs like three or four dogs in the yard barking and these coyotes don't give a fuck
*  Did you see that video where they the pack came into her house or into her yard? Yeah, there's like six of them
*  Yeah, yeah that name that neighborhood. They're sketchy
*  I told her to get a subsonic 22 and just start taking them out
*  She won't she's like this pop pop put him down pop pop pull bait out there. Mm-hmm
*  Does this wait in your window city rules about taking out a coyote the city rules you keep your fucking mouth shut yeah
*  Shoot shovel and shut up
*  Coyotes what's the is there any upside they handle anything yes rats rats yeah, oh yeah, man
*  So our owls and hours are way cooler than coyotes and then owls don't eat your larger dog
*  Delete the fuck out of your cat though. They sure will owls. We eat everything
*  I said I saw an owl flying with a rabbit a big-ass rabbit and his claws once they're so vicious
*  Yeah, and they're such scary hunters like I know at night and head spins around have you ever seen that video?
*  There's a nest video of these hawks that are in a tree and this owl comes out and snatches one of the hawks and flies
*  Away, and you just from a distance are like what is that right when you you're talking about the one where eyeballs
*  Yeah, and then also they're like and it goes BAM. It's just gone. Yeah. Yeah, they're fucking monsters
*  Freaky animals man, and we think of them as being these wise
*  like
*  Like it's professors of the woods for some strange reason have you ever heard Matt Bronger's owl bit no
*  It is one of the funniest things is it really yeah
*  This is like the bit that he first like his early on you know getting his his a
*  first big joke that broke and
*  You know it was on Letterman, and he was on Comedy Central with it. It is hilarious. I gotta see it
*  I gotta see it as a
*  Owls are one of those weird animals that we have this very strange relationship with well
*  We don't know what they really are yeah, we have this distorted bears are another one
*  We have this distorted perception with their did you see that video that was going around about that guy?
*  I've got his face
*  Literally eaten off by a grizzly and they shot the grizzly when it was on top of them no oh
*  Dude, have you seen it Jamie?
*  He's talking
*  While his face is gone
*  He's talking about like you could see one eye through this
*  Mass I mean if Jamie shakes his head like never showed you real quick god damn it
*  Wait yeah, we can't really show it on the oh yeah, yeah of his face
*  But that's crazy attack to no it's right after the attack the guy that was with him
*  Started filming it, and it's just one of those things where okay, so this is the bear and this is the guy and that's his face
*  And this is him talking where are you where are you seeing this?
*  Yes
*  Bro the thing chewed his face up. That's him now. See looks like now fuck they rebuilt his face. That's incredible
*  Your doctor well you saw the the chimp victim lady. Yeah her face is gone
*  Well that chimp worked on her for a while. Did you see the tree trimming? Oh go lower there Jamie go lower scroll down
*  whoa
*  What tree trimming what what you've never seen that we talking about dude, and there's and you get to see the live
*  Oh where the tree goes into the guy's face and split his whole fucking head wide open
*  Yes, and then they show him in the hospital. Yeah, you can see
*  Even in his completely destroyed face the panic and it's like he knows how serious his situation is yeah, I mean
*  They were able to I don't know I haven't seen the post surgery stuff
*  But that dude a tree just like perfect he cut he was chewing and like he just cut it and it's
*  Split his whole fucking face open yeah, oh my god. Yeah, it's rough man. Yeah, that's a rough look right there
*  That's a rough look. It's amazing. I will they put that guy back together if I was him
*  I would just be the punisher for grizzly bears
*  Just load up every year with a million rounds of ammo. Oh my just go hunting bears fuck you
*  Have you hunted a bear? Yeah, yeah black bears not not grizzly bears
*  Yeah, yeah, we don't we have this image of them because of teddy bears because kids have them
*  You know they love them little brown bears are the biggest right polar bears brown bears, and then yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, cuz I mean a brown bear can stand up and be what like nine feet tall or even bigger 11 really yeah Kodiak
*  The really big one and they go you're in a swipe
*  Just yeah capitate my friend watched a bear kill a moose with one swat broke its back
*  he watched chase this moose through a scope was looking at through a
*  Spotting scope which is like like a super powerful telescope that you could look at you know like a mile away
*  You can watch things happen and this bear just swat hit this moose in the back and snapped its back
*  Man fuck kind of fucking power you have to snap a moose is back. Oh my god. I just tore it apart
*  I mean how powerful is that animal it's a big fucking animal man. You know you're talking about a
*  1500 pound
*  Just ball of muscle and fat I just thought about sometimes like you know cuz you you know a lot of obviously like trained fighters
*  And that equation always plays in your head. What if like trained fighters people?
*  Don't realize sometimes how
*  Well like how much that training puts that person at an incredible advantage in a place right like sure like your average guy
*  Trying to get that smoke with a trained fighter is a is a problem right but at a certain point. What's the equation where?
*  All the training doesn't matter you know I mean size yeah size and strength like how big of a
*  Giant and how much how powerful does he have to be where all your training?
*  Wouldn't matter it depends on what kind of training you do like with jujitsu. It's a pretty big
*  Advantage right with jujitsu you get I've tapped guys that are a hundred pounds heavier than me right just crazy that is crazy
*  Yeah, but I would never strike with a guy
*  That's a hundred pounds heavier than me because that would just yeah, you'd get killed
*  Yeah, cuz even through your gloves you keep your gloves up and some 300 pound guy
*  Clubs you with the right hand yeah, it's just like your whole brain gets rattled right you can tap a 300 pound guy though
*  As long as he doesn't throw you on the ground the problem is it picks you up in the air and throws you on the ground
*  Slams you and hits you with the earth yeah
*  Because there are those like those dudes that are almost animals. Yeah, you see them walking around six eight
*  Oh, yeah, three fifty. You know you're like you're like. I don't care. How well you're trained if that dude is like athletic
*  Oh, yeah, like a pro like a gorilla pro football player. Oh, yeah, like you see one of them
*  I was I remember I'll never forget this we were in Phoenix, and we were going into this bar, and it was like
*  20 plus years ago, and as we were waiting in line this pro football player walked through the line
*  And it was like a grown-ass man amongst little kids
*  Yeah
*  It was like a third grade class and someone's daddy showed up and just walked through the line this guy had to be like
*  6-7-6-8
*  350 he was so big I was laughing yeah, I was like look at the size of this fucking guy
*  Yeah, just big old corn-fed white boy. Just walking through the crowd like imagine that dude gets a hold of this
*  That's what they do
*  That's their job throw you into the ground and just break everything break your hip and your legs and everything
*  I know you don't follow football, but I always think of this dude about like savagery Larry Allen
*  He played for that camera the Cowboys were dominant in the 90s
*  This dude was not just so big and so freaky strong, but like was born mean
*  Oh, no
*  Like he's what you want if you're like yeah like he had the athleticism the strength
*  That's him right there 73. Yeah, yes
*  size of this fucking guy dude would just he would just
*  absolutely
*  You know destroy like break people's will how long did he play for oh?
*  He had played over ten seasons and he was
*  He was like he's so big and so fast so athletic this guy was so athletic man
*  Like he was he there's amazing footage of him
*  Just chasing like the his team through interception. He's chasing the the the hundred and eighty pound guy down like crazy shit
*  He benched to 25
*  45 times
*  You know
*  Just imagine doing 45 push-ups yeah, that's a lot dude do 45 reps of the bar, and you're gonna feel the burn man
*  Yeah, you know like that's that's crazy
*  It's just it's it's nuts
*  700 pound benchpress god damn not a normal size of that dude. Yeah, these dudes are like
*  Yeah, well you know I mean you gotta think if
*  That's your gig your gig is to be gigantic and fast and powerful and you've been working on that since grade school
*  Yeah, look at them all fucking around jump. They're jumping on like he is an animal like he's a trained lion
*  Goddamn, dude. Yeah. Yeah, he's so strong giant. Yeah, there's there's like that mountain guy that Game of Thrones guy like yeah
*  Exactly that's what I'm thinking about it like guys like that who are
*  If you're like oh, but like I know spar with Connor no car fucked him up
*  Oh, he did yeah, he fucked him up like really fucked him up
*  He just kept hitting him and he kept moving away from him and he couldn't hit Connor. He's trying to hit Connor
*  He couldn't hit him and Connor kept but he was kicking him in the stomach punch him in the stomach and eventually just got exhausted
*  And he gave up yet see that like that part. I mean in see but that's like kind of like with rules, right?
*  We're gonna do mm-hmm. We're gonna do we couldn't grab Connor. He cried to try to grab him
*  Yeah, I got her there's it was in a gym
*  So there's plenty of room for Connor to move around them
*  Look at it, but look at the size difference between the two of them. See he started talking shit and and Connor was like
*  Oh really? Okay. Come on, buddy. Let's spar. Let's spar
*  He doesn't know what to do right the thing is Connor is much smaller than him
*  But he doesn't know what to do see like he just hit Connor in the stomach there
*  And he doesn't know what to do yeah, look at that jumping front kick to the body and then pushed him away
*  so he's trying to grab him, but he doesn't know what to do and Connor just keeps moving and
*  Connors in great shape and that big fuck has never done cardio in his life
*  All that guy does is do squats and deadlifts and just gets huge
*  Yeah, so his his heart is probably right now pounding out of his chest that fucker played basketball before. Oh, he was really skinny
*  Yeah, he was really crazy. Let's see now now Connor starting to punch him
*  He's starting to punch him in the stomach and the dude's trying to grab him and he tries to hit
*  See now he's taking a break and the least he's stomach heaving. Yeah, he doesn't know what to do
*  Yeah, he doesn't know how to get out of this because they're fucking around
*  He doesn't know how to get out of this he tries to grab him because like no
*  I'm just gonna move you go ahead and just get gassing them out. Yeah, exactly
*  And then he's like nodding say come on big boy come on
*  But his trainer has got to be going crazy like what in the fuck are you doing?
*  You're one of the top fighters on the planet Earth and you're here fucking around with a
*  300 pound giant what if this guy gets a hold of one of your legs and decides to rip it apart exactly exactly
*  That's what I'm talking about. See they punched him in the stomach. Uh-huh. I
*  Guess they're not punching each other in the face. Yeah, they're going bare bare knuckle that dude's head is
*  Doesn't even fit the body. He's getting tired though. See cuz all the flinching. Yes Connor Connor's making a flinch
*  He's he's he's making a move. He's fainting and when you faint like that see he doesn't know what to do
*  He's giving up. He's like I give up. I give up. I give up cars not letting him give up. Look at him
*  He's not letting him give up. It's like come on fucker
*  Now he's gonna get into some jujitsu here no, he's just he's lucky knees him in the body Christ he's punched him
*  He's mean. He's not letting him rest. Yeah, I let some rest
*  Look how small god damn. Yeah. Yeah, see that guy was done though
*  Thing about being that big
*  You don't you can't go long
*  It's like a muscle car right you got a muscle car with a five gallon engine or a five gallon gas tank
*  I'm a big-ass engine. You really you don't have much you go hard for a second. Yeah. Yeah, you're not gonna last it's like
*  and then
*  That's actually fascinating to watch weird, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know big you ever seen a wolverine chase off wolves
*  Wolverines are a little it's like a 35 pound animal everything gets the fuck away from it like Jesus
*  Because they're so ferocious. They're so crazy and they they feel like no pain. Yeah, like things can bite them and like
*  They'll chase wolves. They'll chase bears. What's the news with Connor?
*  By the way, is he throwing out that he wants to fight someone he wants to fight Khabib could be but he's they're trying to set up
*  Oh, look, we are
*  Most if this in the future, this is March 24th on Tuesday and everyone's on fucking full lockdown here
*  They're talking about doing a UFC. They don't know where it's gonna be for
*  Khabib versus Tony Ferguson. They're talking about doing that somewhere
*  Somewhere in another country, you know, I told Danish do it on a battleship
*  Just do it on a battleship in international waters fly everybody in a helicopter fucking cool idea
*  And there's no organization like the UFC that could pull that off
*  Yeah, you can't do that with like any other sport. No, you cuz you don't need many very many people
*  You just need the fighters. Yeah, I mean, I don't even know if they're gonna have an undercard and the more the crazier the setting
*  Yeah for a fight the more exciting it could be like and there'll be lions roaming and yeah
*  I would imagine one of those sheiks that has you know, a trillion dollars does they do it in my palace?
*  The palace you set up an octagon in a giant ballroom dude if you guys called sheiks and and like do you want like they would start
*  Problem. Yeah, this is no problem at all. This is come on. Yeah, they'll fucking sanitize the shit out a couple jets fly everybody in
*  sanitize the runway just
*  crates of Lysol
*  Absolutely crop just your plane spraying Lysol over everything. It would be
*  They would do it right actually
*  They have so much money, yeah, I mean they they could do it right they could test everyone
*  Well, what do you do if someone has like is they're asymptomatic? They want to fight anyway, and but they test positive
*  Yeah, they're gone
*  You gotta go be you gotta go. What if it's Tony?
*  They test positive, but they're asymptomatic too much resting heart rates low. Everything's fine too much good to go
*  You're shedding it man shedding it as you walk around after he's over we just cover him in a big plastic suit
*  I guess if the other fighter was like I'm cool with it. Yeah, it could be probably cool with it, too
*  Yeah, sure you have medicine. Yeah, send location bring medicine. Did you see that couple what they did?
*  Do you see that today what?
*  That so Trump was talking about potential massive. Yes, and then one of them
*  I don't want to say the name wrong. So whatever it I forget what I'll tell you exactly what it is
*  What is it's it's medication they use on a koi pond well to kill bacteria
*  That's the one that they took yes, but it's the core name
*  I think it's called chloroquine the same name of it
*  But the one for the koi pond has in like a hyphen and another uh-huh
*  Yeah, the same name without the hyphen is actually a medication
*  It's a medication for malaria for malaria correct apparently holds promise, but they took koi pond
*  They've fish tank medicine they they took poison
*  Yeah, that they took poison is what they took and then they were like he told us to take it
*  Yeah, but he didn't you know it's not and then they're like we saw it in our cabinet
*  You think you have fucking malaria meds in the back of your pantry?
*  Yeah, we had it in the shed. Yeah, we used to kill everything in the koi pond and we figured hell
*  Jed took it and he's dead. Well the woman they were talking to her and
*  They said now it was funny because the the reporter was baiting her the reporter was like now
*  This is you saw President Trump say that you should take the yeah, they were showing it a lot
*  That's what she said they were showing it a lot. I'm know it's a different name. It's a different name you fucks
*  Yeah, there's the same beginning and you just like as a P. I feel comfortable saying this public PSA
*  You probably don't have the cure at home right now. I feel comfortable
*  Yeah, I feel comfortable with you saying that yeah unless you just got back from somewhere
*  Yeah, maybe man
*  Maybe maybe you have it. Yeah, it's a different medication. Yeah, but people are blaming Trump for that
*  Yeah
*  this just like this game of trying to get clicks and
*  Blaming people for like Trump did not tell people to drink koi pond killer. No, no, it definitely didn't do that
*  He's been hilarious in this
*  Well, did you see that one lady? We're we're talking I was talking about this earlier
*  There's this one lady who is
*  Getting she has an opportunity to talk to Trump in a press conference and she said
*  Did you hear that one of your one of the members of your cabinet referred to it as the kung flu?
*  You know that yeah, and he's like the what say that again, and she was kung flu
*  So he makes her say it and then then he goes who who said it and well, I heard someone have you get you heard
*  Yeah, this is the one question you have right that's the president United States during one of the biggest health crisis is the world
*  Has ever known? Yeah, and you want a mildly racist term is what you want to check in on
*  Yeah, are you gonna stop to that they want to get a call people out? Yeah
*  We did a thing yet. He must have caught up though because yesterday
*  he he read a statement that like I
*  I
*  Love our Asian Americans and well, it's cuz he kept referring to it as the Chinese. I know I know Chinese virus
*  And he scratched out on his report. Yeah, it wrote Chinese
*  Chinese but that's people have to understand it's also because he's in fierce
*  Negotiations with China over these trade sanctions. There's a lot going on and he's a combative dude
*  Yeah, he'll take you know a chance to
*  So the same lady did it with Kellyanne Conway same thing same question
*  Yeah, and and you know and there and she's like I'm not gonna get into speculation here about a guy
*  Yeah, but who's you don't know who said it?
*  You just you just heard someone said it and then you know, this lady didn't know Kellyanne Conway's husband's half Asian, right?
*  So her kids are quarter Asian. She's like, I'm sure you know, like you're not saying that I'm racist or jay's my children are Asian
*  Yeah, like what are you? What are you doing? Isn't that marriage kind of interesting? Oh, yeah hilarious
*  I mean, he's the most outspoken critic. He hates Trump beyond hates
*  Beyond hates him and she's his most ardent defender. Yeah, it's crazy. How do you guys go to bed at night?
*  some people can these some people can be like liberals and
*  Republicans and live together fine. Some people can be like hunters and vegans and live together
*  So vocal about their positions don't understand how anyway, what do you want to eat like it's fucking crazy
*  by the way, how great would it have been if
*  Trump or Kellyanne Conway had been asked about the kung flu and they're like, are you gonna think that's they're gonna say
*  It's not a funny term. Yeah, like it would be great. It would be kind of great
*  I mean look if it was an Italian virus. Yeah, and then they called it the pasta virus
*  Yeah, I mean would it would people really get mad? No, probably not
*  What would they got the meatball? What would be the thing? Yeah, you know the pizza virus. I don't know. Yeah rigatoni virus
*  Parpadeli virus. It's just I don't know man. I read a terrible thing that one lady said
*  That some lady she's Asian and she was at a
*  Store and some lady yelled she had a mask on she yelled fuck you at her in her face
*  And then she took off her mask and coughed at her
*  At the Asian lady, yeah coughed at her and yelled fuck you at her see that's when all the racial jokes stop being
*  Yeah, they all just went out the window right there
*  Yeah, cuz there are like legit morons out there, but that's blame an Asian American
*  Yeah person of Asian descent live in an America that has zero to do with any of this and she'll be like fuck you
*  Cuz there's people just looking for an excuse to blame
*  Whatever on someone else and if it's an Asian person or a Latino person or whatever the fuck it is or all the fucking post
*  You remember post 9-eleven all these poor Sikh people? Yes
*  Yes, yes, you fucking Muslim and they're like, I'm not Muslim
*  Yeah, it's bad enough that you're doing that, but I'm not even the target
*  Yeah, you're trying to reach here think turbans everyone with a turban is Muslim
*  Because we forget that like, you know the world's full of idiots too
*  Those are the people you really got to worry about it's you know
*  I don't want people to die from this disease course
*  But I would like us to lose a significant portion of our moron population
*  It'd be cool if it taught if it like preyed on low IQ individuals
*  All these dummies kind not just low IQ because there's some low IQ people that are really nice
*  But it would be great if it was low IQ people who are mean
*  Like if there was a disease that only killed racists, it's like open mouth breathing people
*  Something about racism just it just kills people with racism
*  Like there's a gene and it targets that gene and people who are racist they just drop like flies
*  There are a lot of older people dying. So it might be working
*  It's definitely killed a few racists in this last few weeks imagine if that's like something people focus on here's one silver lining
*  Oh
*  The old grand wizards are gone
*  We went into the Facebook pages of all the people who died and 64% were racist. That'd be awesome
*  That would be a nice silver lining. Yeah, but what about the other you know, no, I know 36. Yeah, just nice old granny
*  It's terrible. I love their neighbors. It's terrible. Yeah. Yeah
*  But it's one of those things where you can't even crack a joke because then people oh, yeah
*  What about this person and that person you just you just can't listen to them. Yeah, so I talked to Michael yo
*  Actually, I haven't even talked to him because he's not talking cuz he can't talk. He's just texting
*  He's still fucked up five days ago thought he was dying
*  What's the hospital? No, I mean he's been in the hospital for over a week, but five days ago
*  He thought he was dying. He got this what happened. He went to New York
*  He did my podcast right after he did my podcast that weekend
*  So he flew to New York City did his shows in New York City
*  Was feeling kind of sick
*  And then got it it got pneumonia and the corona virus at the same time in New York or in LA when he got home
*  So he was feeling kind of shitty and then it hit him. So he probably had a weakened immune system, right?
*  Then he's not a boozer. So I don't think he was boozing
*  But you know, he doesn't have any like that, you know, no lying health is no nothing because he seems like a healthy guy
*  Yeah shape in shape. Yeah works out a lot. He said he was killing workouts. He said nothing was wrong with him
*  He said just start feeling like he had a cold and then flew home and then boom that is double whammy, but he's recovering
*  He's recovering. Yeah, he's not the mean he's not gonna die
*  But he's not out of the woods yet and some of these people that have gotten through this disease have some sort of permanent lung impairment
*  You know one that one that scared me I was reading about this guy see if you can find this guy
*  2012 gold medalist and swimming 31 year old guy got it
*  And he said he's the absolute worst virus. He's ever experienced in his life. He said it was devastating
*  So it's like some people have it like Idris Elba and there's nothing. Yeah
*  Asymptomatic. Yeah seem to be fine. Well, they're they are I mean from I just spoke to an infectious disease doctor on the way over here and
*  and
*  they're saying that
*  You know the that's one of the big things about
*  The asymptomatic people is like they're essentially what can keep this thing going for a while because you're shedding for
*  15 days and if you're if you're not holed up if you're walking around
*  you're just brushing by people and you're at the park and you're in the store and you're
*  You're shedding you're spreading it your asymptomatic and then you go home
*  But you just gave it to you know, these three or four people then they go home
*  It's just so weird that some people don't experience anything and for other people like this guy who's a 31 year old Olympic swimmer
*  Cameron Vanderberg 2012 Olympic swimming champion details about with Corona. I think he's from Africa. Is that where he's from?
*  Retired South African Olympic swimmer
*  Details of struggle with coronavirus. I mean this guy is
*  Super healthy. Yeah, really really fit. He says he doesn't smoke
*  Lives a healthy lifestyle and he's young he's in the the least risk demographic
*  Create incredible so you can't really predict how this will go
*  He said although the most severe symptoms extreme fever have eased
*  I'm still struggling with serious fatigue and a residual cough that I can't shake any
*  Physical activity like walking leaves me exhausted for hours. This is crazy. He's 31 and he's a stud
*  Yeah, I mean you look at that guy. Yeah Olympic swimmer, right? I mean talk about
*  Cardiovascular shape there's some of the the most powerful
*  Cardiovascular fit people on earth and
*  Incredible. He said he's been struggling with it for 14 days
*  Jesus Christ by me are the worst fires I've ever had
*  Yeah
*  Says any physical activity like walking leaves me exhausted for hours
*  The loss in body conditioning has been immense and can only feel for athletes that contract
*  Covid 19 as they will suffer a great loss of current conditioning through the last training cycle. It's funny how he's thinking about it
*  Infection closer to competition being the worst
*  Yeah, isn't it funny how he's thinking about in terms of conditioning cycles like that's that's how Olympians think
*  Yeah, did you see how I mean they just
*  Agreed to postpone but even like two days ago Tokyo was like we're not don't even think about it. Yeah
*  Because they're crooks, yeah, look that whole thing is a crooked
*  Organization. Yeah, they should pay those athletes. They're making billions of dollars the athletes make
*  The athletes make nothing. Yeah, they're like if you get a sponsorship in a sport that's popular
*  Yeah, then you're right if you are the top
*  like if you get to win a gold medal and
*  Everybody pays attention and then you become like Michael Phelps where everybody knows your name. You can make a living. Yeah
*  Everybody else is fucked. Yeah, while those cunts are raking in billions and billions of dollars
*  It is the grossest thing and all sorts only the only thing that's close is college basketball
*  College basketball and college football where those guys again make billions of dollars for those organizations and make no money for themselves
*  And then you have these people who are like, yeah
*  These guys get a free education the fuck out of here fuck out of my face fuck out of here
*  Especially football get the fuck out of here
*  Yeah, you get a free education when you get your brain scrambled every day and your brain scrambled and this like the football programs at a major
*  university are
*  So goddamn valuable not just even monetarily it's becomes the image of the school
*  Yes
*  They even get a high profile school gets more applicants and you get more people enrolled just because of that program
*  It's crazy and it's a dirty thing. It's a dirty thing that just like keeps going
*  So it should have been they should have fixed out a long time ago. Those guys should have been able to they should be getting paid
*  I mean and people like whoa, come other college students don't get
*  Because you don't have those fucking skills, dude bad motherfuckers. Yeah, that's just what they got
*  Yeah
*  If you're winning NCAA basketball championships for your school
*  You should be making a shitload of money cuz your goddamn school is making a shitload of money from you and then if you're like
*  A bad motherfucker on one of those teams they sell your jersey do yeah. Yeah, you don't make anything from them
*  They sell your jersey and they're like didn't you get that algebra class for free? Oh, yeah
*  Thanks, man, and we gave you a tracksuit and shoes
*  Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah, and if you even get I think if you get like I
*  Mean you can't get anything you can't even hook you up with an apartment dude. It's it's super fucked
*  big NCAA's again like a
*  super corrupt organization you've seen
*  That Icarus movie Icarus documentary
*  Well, it shows how the IOC
*  Yes
*  It shows how how dirty like even testing is yeah in the Olympics and it shows how the Russian team in
*  Soji was just completely not just cheating but every one of their athletes
*  They took their piss and swapped it out for clean piss all of them. They had a hole in the wall
*  They transfer piss back and forth to man
*  There was a Russian team. Yeah, the Russian team is like culturally built in to deceive there
*  Seriously, it's about winning. It is about winning, but it's also like it is
*  Lies on every level. Well, did you hear me talking about?
*  Yoel Romero
*  Did you ever hear after the fight no the recent one no
*  Dana White gave me this information
*  They brought in yoel Romero because he had a fractured orbital
*  After in one of his fights, okay
*  And they bring him in and then he gets examined by this doctor and the doctor calls up the UFC afterwards and said
*  Where did you get this guy and he goes? What do you mean? And then like what's going?
*  He goes I've never seen anyone like him. They're like, oh, yeah, he's an amazing athlete. No, no
*  I've never seen a human being like this like this is the most unusual
*  Human being I've ever seen in my 40 years of practicing medicine
*  He said his tendons in his eye are four times larger than a normal person's he goes
*  His physical structure is different than any human being I've ever seen in my life
*  Whoa, whoa
*  Cuba yeah, who knows what kind of fucking wacky experiments they were doing some Russian pills when he was a kid. That's for sure
*  Imagine yeah, right imagine. I mean he was a
*  Top of the food chain wrestler. He meddled in literally every single
*  International wrestling meet he ever competed in
*  Yo, al Romero is a super stud. Yeah, just a super stuff. That was a weird fight though, right? The last one is he yes
*  Yes, it wasn't a good fight. Isn't that crazy. We were in an arena like a week before it hit the fan
*  I know we were hanging out in Vegas, but it was a little sketchy then remember
*  We're like everything gonna be okay. Yeah, we're weirded out then we went to like
*  We didn't went to my show yeah, we hung out and had a show and then that was probably the last big show
*  We'll see in a long ass time. I keep thinking about how I was talking about today
*  I did all this morning phoneers today for for the special
*  Ball hog ball hogs out on Netflix right now favorite by the way is they had you called calling to so many radio stations and this
*  guy's like
*  He goes. Oh
*  I'm big instant family fan. When are you gonna do another one and I go
*  What do you mean? He's like, I like that show I go. It's a movie
*  It's a movie called instant family. He goes. Oh, yeah, when's the next one? I was like the sequel to an adoption film
*  What like do you just tell they're just you know idiots reading shit off to you?
*  But I was talking to somebody on the in the pressing today and I go
*  most of us comics
*  Since we've been active working comedians at Adam at most two weeks
*  We've gone without doing stand-up and then that return, you know when you first get on stage after like a vacation
*  You're like I just feel fucking weird. Yeah, you know, you have like weird butterflies your rhythms off your pacing's a little off
*  You forget a word or something because you're just not fresh. We might be two three months
*  It's never easy easy. Yeah, easy without ever doing it. Yeah March all of March, right?
*  All of it was your show your show was the beginning of March March 7th
*  Yeah, March 7th and 8th you do the Mirage so all of March all of April
*  We mean we easily could be deep into July or August before I did a set March 11th
*  Was my last set and then March 12th. I canceled my had a show you canceled it, too
*  Yeah, so I was doing a Spanish show at the Belly room and then I can't in the main room
*  Yeah, I canceled that and that was it and everything got moved
*  Yeah, the store said they were gonna cancel
*  gatherings of less the the the state mandate was anything with
*  200 people or more and the main room I think holds 400 people so they decided to keep the belly room open
*  Which is I mean the the OR which is one 150 I think yeah something like that
*  And then they asked me if I want to do a spot there and I'm like, I don't think I do
*  I think I'm good. I'm like, I don't know what to do here. And then I had
*  The
*  Improv a couple days later and then I texted the improv. I'm like, I think we should shut this down
*  Yeah, doesn't seem right the way that it I don't know what it is rolled out was funny
*  Yeah, so I had that weekend at the ice house. So I go move that, you know, I go we can't do it
*  So we moved it the following week, which would have been the weekend that just ended was supposed to be in Dayton and even on Monday
*  They were like, do you want to do you want to do on Monday or maybe it was Friday?
*  They're like you can still do date. They were given Swartz Swartz and had some shows in Utah
*  They were giving him a hard time. They were like, you know, hey, we're gonna lose our shirt if you cancel
*  He's like, um, I'm not a fucking what yeah. No
*  Guys, yeah, hey, and then I I go we gotta move the date
*  So then we move that and then you know every day we keep pushing things month by month
*  It's a foul Chappelle's doing shows like real late. Really?
*  Yeah, really he was doing shows like the weekend after yours Wow. Yeah
*  Yeah, big one super. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah fucking big-ass theaters. Yeah. Yeah, I was uh, I
*  Mean I'm supposed to be in Vancouver on the 20th. That's never gonna happen
*  No, then Chappelle and I were doing a show in Nashville and a show in New Orleans. Those are not gonna happen
*  That's the end of April. I don't get moved
*  Apparently, I mean I hope people
*  Get the opportunity to get a refund because there's a lot of people right now that probably bought tickets and like fuck
*  I need that money right now just for food and shit. You're totally right. How many people are just have zero check?
*  It's probably like 50% of the population in right? It's enormously devastating to the economy. Yeah
*  I mean we had some people working on our house. I had to fix something in the garage
*  I was like to be are people working or are they allowed to work and everyone's just just doing social distancing and
*  Yeah, I had some work done and they were like excited to do it. Yeah people were happy to work
*  Yeah, I've been getting text messages and emails from people that are like
*  I mean they had like viable businesses and they counted on the money being in there every week and there was no
*  Plan on the table for anything that involves no one being able to work. Of course
*  Yeah, why would anybody be prepared for this?
*  No one of course and no one knows how long it could last and I'm reading something about
*  California where they're talking about like shows and concerts. It might be six months
*  Yeah, I believe it. I mean it's it is
*  So April May June July August September
*  We wouldn't do shows until September. It's so weird, but I mean what will it be like also weird
*  So weird, but it'd be weird for everybody. That's true. That's true. Be weird for the audience be weird for everybody
*  I keep thinking too, you know
*  We we know all these people in clubs and like they're like immediately have no job the servers servers is what I'm chefs
*  Yeah, the servers we got to do something for them at the store for sure
*  Because they don't have any money. It's not like they're comics who have like saved up money and have no they count on that
*  thousand bucks in the bank those those shifts every week and you get tipped out, you know, yep. Yeah. Yeah, it's
*  It's fucking weird man. It's gonna be weird when everything rolls back up
*  There's a lot of restaurants are gonna go under a lot of businesses. Yeah, I think I heard something about the Marriott CEO
*  Giving up his all his
*  Salary and everything just to like give it to some of the that's nice
*  I think I think it was maybe I'm plugging the wrong guy, but one of those CEOs was like, you know, just
*  Push it on down. Yeah, I have a buddy of mine who runs a production company and
*  he had to lay off 30 people yesterday and
*  He was just like yes, there's no money coming in everyone. No one's paying him everything shut down and
*  You know and these workers were like, why don't you just pay us? Well, we're not working
*  He's like cuz I'm making you money, right?
*  It's like what do you want me to do?
*  like I don't know what you want me to do and it was this weird conversation because he was
*  He was like, what am I supposed to do? And I'm like, I don't I don't I hope I never
*  Experienced that yeah, I don't know what you're supposed to do. No, it's because I don't know how much I don't he's not rich
*  Yeah, it's a real dilemma man. Yeah, because if he's right, he's running a production company, right? Yeah, so he has a huge overhead
*  He has
*  cameraman and trucks and post production facilities and all this different stuff and
*  It's all dependent on money coming in and then when the money doesn't come in and then the payroll keeps coming out
*  Like you'll go dry real quick. Yeah, I mean even if you have even if you have some money
*  There's a there's a limit to how long you could do that for. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah season, but people that work for you
*  I guess just assume you make more money you got enough money to pay me keep paying me
*  Crazy and he's like he's like I'm not rich
*  He's like I barely you know, I feel like I make enough money every year to live a good life
*  But yeah not to pay 30 people where there's no money. You're actually paying you're paying 30 people
*  Let's just say they get a hundred grand a year. Mm-hmm. That's so much money. Yeah, that's so much money
*  Yeah, what that would be over three million. Yeah, right like that gone. Yeah
*  I mean you have to be able to have coming we have a staff, you know, we make podcasts
*  Yeah, and we're continuing to do podcasts so we can keep paying the staff. Yeah, that's weird, right?
*  We can we can keep doing this. Yeah, and then you got to think also like if someone is doing that and you have
*  You know 30 people that you're laying off
*  They those people have to get unemployment. How much unemployment is there?
*  It's a record number by four times the amount that's ever been filed
*  And it all filed like in within the same like 72 hours
*  I'm a to my they have to pay those people. I'm sure it's not enough. I'm sure they don't have enough to pay
*  I think the numbers come out Thursday
*  The new ones the first numbers of like this is how many people have don't have a job now
*  The number is gonna be crazy. This could be nuts. It's gonna be crazy
*  And what is this quarter gonna look like like on the books this one and the next one actually? This is you gotta assume
*  Let's let's be conservative and say 40% of the country's out of work. That's conservative, right?
*  It's a good question. I'm not really sure I don't know. It's I mean, I'm sure something like that like
*  40 million people that we're working probably at least aren't are not working right now that we're working and this is worldwide
*  Oh that number is way fucking higher. Yeah, I mean just in this country, but worldwide
*  It's like half the places are really like we are not at a real lockdown some places have really locked down
*  Yeah, we were talking about that before the podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see the Italian mayor's screaming at everybody? Stay the fuck home
*  Yeah, there's a video compilation I'll send it to Jamie it's it's actually pretty funny
*  There's a video compilation of all these Italian mayor's fucking screaming at people to stay the fuck home
*  My cousin in Peru said you can't walk your dog in in Lima right now. So where's your dog shit?
*  I guess in the house or something. Congratulations. If Marshall had a shit in the house, we'd have a real issue
*  First of all, he'd be so confused. You sure you want me to start doing this? I'd be like dude, trust me
*  Just shit right there
*  Nobody leaves their home nobody goes out of my scene. It's an order. So watch out
*  What are you doing with these
*  Incontinent dogs you need to stay at home. People are dying. Don't you get it? This is super Italian
*  What a beautiful language
*  It's a beautiful language the best
*  It's I mean it's interesting how
*  Like American language like the American the sound that we make. Yeah, I think the way we speak English in America
*  It's this look at this guy's got his mouth. It's stop writing me letters. It's useless. Stay home. You'll be just fine
*  All these hairdressers coming to your homes what the hell are they for who the hell is gonna see you?
*  I
*  Mean going to your house they came to my house
*  It has been to other people's houses to do the you have coronavirus in your hair instead of hairspray
*  The rigatoni virus is killing us everybody rigatoni virus. So racist
*  Where's your neck where are your hand gestures sure what kind of mayor are you what kind of Italian to you?
*  I'm not feeling this guy get out of your pencil neck. Ciao. Did I got see?
*  Shut them off Jamie
*  Yeah, it's uh, well Italy is losing hundreds and hundreds of people a day like yesterday
*  It was like 500 they said yesterday was the the first day where the number dipped
*  Yeah, but I mean it's down before 500 day before was 800 day before was 700. Yeah, it's been going
*  It's been nuts, but they do have the second oldest
*  Population of a major country in the world and a giant population of smokers
*  Yeah, all smoke over there and then all day long every greeting is
*  Kiss kiss kiss, you know, and they're all drunk. Yeah affectionate all baiting each other smoking
*  fingering each other. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, I go to Italy every summer. Yeah, not this summer not this summer
*  No, maybe it'd be a good discount fucking great
*  That country by the way, like I mean a huge part of that GDP is tourism
*  Yeah, you know like I mean I want to say like over 15% Mm-hmm. So it's gonna be slammed for this. I know it's weird
*  It's like you wonder what what does a country do to sort of mitigate the issues that are being caused by that?
*  The only thing I keep thinking about how like when you think about how badly
*  So many places are doing is just that everybody else is doing for you know, I mean, yes, it's not one place
*  This is a worldwide pandemic. So yeah, I'm not selling you can think of yeah
*  That's the only thing you can think of it's it's a strange strange time for us
*  I'm hoping that on the other end we come out of this with a little
*  Perspective, you know the people that survive come out of this with a little perspective like hey, we got it good
*  We got it real fucking good. I think that perspective will last about seven days
*  Well with 9-eleven last a few months, yeah, yeah people will be like in New York it lasted a few months. Yeah, that's true
*  I think I think it was more special in here. It'll affect Italians for a long time, you know places that are devastated by it
*  Yeah, I think so. But I mean, yeah people, you know
*  Usual humans are just are gonna react to the current condition. Yeah, that's the problem with us. We're
*  Get real comfortable. I saw that that uh
*  the somebody tweeted or something that this whole thing is the Earth's
*  Vaccine and we're the virus
*  Somebody someone trying to be profound someone trying to be profound
*  But then you start looking at they're like, you know pollutions down the water is cleaner
*  The you know, the fish are swimming in the canals of Venice again. It's good point
*  He's got a good point. They have a point. Well, look at Los Angeles air quality better than it's been ever for sure
*  It's amazing no one's driving. Yeah. Yeah, but also no one's eating. No, yeah
*  There's that part. Yeah
*  Well this the way we live is ridiculous and our ridiculous is not even as bad as New York's ridiculous
*  New York's ridiculous is the most ridiculous because they're literally stacked on top of each other. Yeah, there's no getting away from anybody
*  They have the most ridiculous way of life and they love that life
*  You know, they love the fact that they can go to a hundred different restaurants at midnight
*  Yeah, you know sure and it's great to be I mean I love being around it it's fine I like to visit
*  Yeah, it is fun. But I mean I would hate to be cooped up there right now. Oh
*  Be terrible terrible terrible get out of the city. Yeah. Well are you bailed? Yeah. Yeah, I was telling you earlier
*  He went down to Maryland. It's hilarious. He's like don't tell
*  Yeah, he likes to keep his woman in the dark doesn't know the extent of this
*  What do you think I'm gonna do well, she doesn't have a fucking phone yeah, he's like she doesn't know you don't DM her this shit
*  Maybe that's why they get along so good. She's like she balances him out. It's definitely strange way
*  He is so funny too in that he of course was like
*  Fucking five days ago. I know guys really fucking freaked out about yeah, he's like I'm doing sets 24 hours later
*  He's like I gotta get out of the city. What are you guys doing? How you guys keeping social distancing?
*  What's going on here, how did you switch so well where this text group group text that we're in we were all like hey
*  What happened? Yeah, what happened over the last 24 hours? Yeah. Well a couple people got freaked out. So I freaked out
*  Like who freaked you out?
*  It's a weird time man, but I get I bet for Burt special and for your special this is gonna be fucking bonsai
*  It's so bizarre the bonsai is not a good word
*  Bonanza bonanza is what I meant to say it is bizarre that so many people are
*  Forced to be home. Yeah, and they've already announced that all the the views are up. Oh, they have to throttle streaming
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, but I've noticed it too on podcasts like downloads are up the user
*  Oh, yeah, people are consuming content, you know, yeah, and you know, it also kind of keeps them sane
*  It's like your show like your mom's house or this podcast or any these podcasts that people subscribe to
*  It's a part of their routine. So yes
*  At least there's some normalcy and I don't want to overplay that make it seem like we're doing some great service
*  No, but there's something that does give people some comfort. I think they really like it's that familiarity of like I listen to Joe's show
*  It's on this makes me this distracts me from from yeah, you know the chaos for a little bit
*  I mean, I guess that's why we're allowed to do it because we're we're considered part of media. Yeah, you know, yeah
*  I think it's funny that
*  My show is like well who farted loudest today and that's but they're like, yeah
*  Yeah, but it is. I mean look if the fucking regular news that horseshit if that's yeah. Yeah, you know, if that's media
*  We're definitely media. Yeah. Yeah, I know it's so I don't know these I think with the
*  Time and like wisdom and having experienced and observed
*  Media for a while now and you get to like a traumatic thing like this a pandemic
*  You I really look at I watch news I've always consumed a lot of news
*  I'm like so much of this is just ridiculous
*  Sensationalism, you know, it really is all that same. There's no there's no different the big news organizations than those bullshit click things. Yeah
*  It's almost like news should be nonprofit. I got a fucking breaking story for you. I forgot what I am
*  I cannot believe I almost forgot this. Oh, so, you know the guy in those
*  Texts that the big black guy. Yes sitting with his cock. Yeah
*  Well, let's explain that is a trick people always say the link. Oh my god
*  It's it's now killing more 20 year olds and any disease every like what?
*  I think click the link and there's this jacked black dude with a dick that looks like my leg
*  Sitting on the edge of the bed. Yeah, I'm like he's like have you seen a bigger dick?
*  Right, that's what his expression is and it's limp. It's limp. Yeah, there he is. There he is. Yeah
*  So
*  Breaking news. Yeah, this is breaking news. He's dead, right? He's dead. He died a few years ago
*  so and by the way that the the
*  That meme of like it's kind of has gone viral
*  I mean like every I mean, you know, I get 25 a day from different people
*  I have a doctor friend who sends me I'm like Jesus Christ
*  So it's like it's not just in like a comedy sir, and I'm sure people listening or watching have
*  Have have seen it as well, so I was like who is this fucking guy, right?
*  Like I just kind of just get curious you keep seeing this and it's like sort of like this sense of
*  Relief of from the seriousness of the day, right?
*  You'll be having you just seeing like these people died and you know quarantines and then you get this ridiculous
*  Text and it's this guy so I saw an article
*  where
*  The photographer who took that photo was like he was like, oh, it's so sad that people are using
*  his image that way
*  Because you know he passed away and and you know
*  He thought it was kind of offensive that he was being used to prank or whatever and he said, you know
*  I saw that people started selling merch with this guy's face on it and he goes I just wish he goes I own the
*  Photograph and I'm not trying to come after anyone. I just wish they would share
*  Proceeds of that merch with the family so I saw that and I was like, oh I want to do that
*  So I launched a shirt with that guy's face on it. This is wash your hands
*  And then
*  And then I go I go I want to give the proceeds to this man's family so
*  Because of that article I reached out to people I was able to get in touch with the photographer the guy who took that picture and
*  Then I found I got in touch with his the the models
*  fiance who you know his ex-fiance
*  I mean whatever right he passed away. So anyways, I contacted her I found her
*  I've learned a little bit about this guy in that photo and I'm giving them the proceeds from
*  The shirt sales all of them all the profits will go to them and I also found that when he when he died like the family
*  wasn't
*  Prepared like financially for anything so they had to set up a go fund me for his funeral and tombstone and all that
*  So I'm gonna blast it out and I talked to them beautiful. They're happy with it. So that's my breaking news

*  Tiger bit off your fucking arm and you weren't upset
*  And she's taking they're filming her with a stub you like what what's going on with her and that cameras on the guy Joe exotic
*  Yeah, as it's happening. He's like I'm never gonna financially recover from this
*  His main
*  financial
*  How about the one they're talking about shutting him down? It's like this is gonna be bigger than Waco. Oh
*  God yeah what yeah, that's you people they try to take your tigers. Yeah, he would I'm sure he would dude
*  It's it literally is mine my bit from my last no my triggered Netflix special my 2016 Netflix special come to life
*  Yeah, that bit about tigers in Texas. Yeah, so you could just have them. Yeah, I had a bit about
*  I had a bit years before that about
*  The Ohio Oh the guy yeah, I had a bit about that
*  They used to be like one of my they got blew his brains out right
*  Just let him let everybody out of the cage and then blew his brains out
*  Somebody else deal with this let tigers and seeing that footage and they're like and and seeing the guy give the press conference
*  he's like he reads he's like
*  this cat
*  And then he looks up he's like and 16 lions
*  Fuck
*  And they just had to run around and gun them down oh my god
*  It was those hairs not prepared for that either those cops were big game hunters. They're just lucky. They got them all yeah
*  That's just it's this like they're not prepared for that in the same way cops are not trained for combat
*  People forget that like when there's these big shootings, and they're like why didn't the cops go in there?
*  They're not trained for that. Do you remember the North Hollywood shootout? Yeah, of course
*  I was on news radio at the time and we were all held up in the fucking we were in the break room watching it
*  We were like what the fuck we were like eating looking up at this camera where these guys wearing
*  armored vests and high-powered
*  16 shit yeah shooting at cops
*  Crazy that that I remember I was in high school and
*  And I was watching that and I was like that's what California's like
*  That's what I mean you go that can only happen in California
*  Yeah, people don't know that was a
*  That was a game changer that was a bank robbery where guys had like fully automatic machine guns
*  Yeah, and armored vehicle didn't have our vehicles
*  But they have like full bulletproof vests and suits and yeah, and they were fully locked up
*  They were on steroids and coke and it was like a real-life Grand Theft Auto shipment like real life
*  Yeah, like shooting these
*  Fully automatic guns at helicopters and shit too and but anybody that came in the way
*  Yeah, I remember there was one where they coked up and everything though. Yeah, sure
*  There was one activist that was upset because the cops let one guy bleed out
*  They're like they could have taken him to the hospital and they chose not to like what the fuck is wrong
*  But it made me realize like there's gonna be people that complain about everything no matter what everything
*  Everything yeah, and they just want to be heard
*  It's like they just want they want to have a hot take yeah on things mm-hmm and they and they're just waiting for
*  The the group of people that go like good point yeah that feels bad
*  So it's gonna be people to do that to ya ya no matter. There's so many of us
*  There's always gonna be someone that agrees with your stupid point. Yeah, that's true
*  Yeah, that's that's what that's what like social media thrives off. Oh, yeah
*  I have a stupid point to make who else agrees with me. There's always someone no matter what there's always some ugly
*  You can have the most ridiculous point mm-hmm. There's going always gonna be someone. It's like I'm with him
*  This it's just a numbers game
*  Yeah, and then they find those people and then they get on a reddit reddit page some somewhere
*  And they they all get together, and then they agree with each other
*  Yeah, and then they think oh the rest of world's fucked and then they they just have this echo chamber
*  Yeah, people love doing that. I mean that's what flat earthers do sure
*  I mean if you watch that doc on rocket man the did you watch him die?
*  I watched the did you see rocket man die no wait you want to see that okay?
*  Yeah, he shot that rocket up in the air to try to prove that the earth was flat
*  and
*  They didn't fasten the parachute correctly to the capsule and so the parachute goes off
*  With the initial launch oh fuck yeah the parachutes gone like right away, and then it falls down here goes watch
*  Wait so to say what's happening here, so this guy he decided he was gonna
*  prove that the earth was flat so he built a rocket and
*  Launched himself up into the air he had done it once before
*  But this time he launched himself really high to try to film the earth so watch boom look others the parachutes gone
*  He shoots straight up in the air, and then like oh my god. What is breaking news at least fucking idiots
*  So watch it comes down right here there it is also
*  That's he's on that full speed on the way down, and he's waiting for the parachute to go off boom
*  Yeah, no parachute
*  Hmm just boom so I had the experiment go
*  Not good not well not good or perfect
*  How did these guys really think that I mean how fucking dumb are you they're pretty dumb
*  But here's the other thing how gross is it that in a video like that you have to have like and coming up next
*  Yeah, how about have some respect you fuck Jesus Christ? It's uh you know
*  Did you speak you know like the like that crazy shit have you seen like Tom Hanks is comments?
*  About the coronavirus no no the comments in his posts no dude all the top comments are like you are
*  Pedophile you fucked all these kids, and it's like like dozens of them yes, Tom Hanks
*  Well because of there's like that there's like flat earthers. I'm saying there's the people who are like Hollywood is a pedophilia
*  Conspiracy it is I mean I because I went to just be like oh, what's you know is he recovering?
*  I just saw his went to his page. Is this on Twitter no Instagram, and it's like
*  significant number of them and like with hundreds and thousands of likes and what yes who
*  I've never heard this it's so strange Tom Hanks is a I think they think that any high a list Hollywood person
*  automatically
*  Son responded did you see that no no I did not
*  Like cuz made those weird videos last recently like yeah with the reggae voice and stuff yeah
*  He made a video trolling everyone saying like we're in the Illuminati. Oh, that's funny and like oh god
*  What's up everyone?
*  Yeah, it's true my parents got coronavirus crazy um they're both down in Australia right now because my dad was shooting a movie down there
*  But the Instagram comments fine, they're not even that sick dude. They're not worried about it
*  They're not tripping, but they're going through the necessary health precautions obviously
*  But I don't think it's anything to be too worried about I appreciate everyone's concern
*  This is not the one where he talks about the Illuminati
*  Hey guys, I'm really stressed out right now
*  It's been coming to my attention that a lot of Trump supporters have been figuring out the truth about me and my family
*  you know being in the
*  Know what I'm talking about and I don't know what to do right now because everything's starting to come to light
*  I mean these extremely reliable websites like 4chan 8chan have been exposing shit
*  And it's like if somebody wrote it on the internet, you know, it must be true and it is true
*  So it's like I don't know how this is gonna affect our whole new world agenda
*  Ever since the Simpsons predicted my dad being the spokesperson for the coronavirus, even though they didn't predict anything
*  Is it's just been it's been troublesome to say the least
*  I guess I'm just gonna have to work extra hard at my human sacrifices
*  I'm late for one right now, and I'm a little hungry so I might eat someone's pinwheel can
*  Okay, yeah
*  Why does he have that all-seeing eye tattooed in the middle of his chest? He's a lot of tattoos. It's a weird choice
*  What do you got there Tom? I was looking at I pulled up
*  The Hanks's comments like they're so outrageous, you know, it's like what what started it off
*  It's this whole concept that like any a list Hollywood type
*  I don't know what the origin is of that but if it's like, you know
*  Spielberg Hanks crew like any of those big-time names. They're like you're part of the pedophile ring
*  It's just like that's how they get to be huge
*  You have to be a part of the pedophile ring for them to become a big movie star. I think so
*  It's so exhausting. Yeah, it's so exhausting these fucking people. It's exhausting
*  Again, we need a disease. It kills morons. This could be it. I don't think it is
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  What if they're invulnerable what if it's like a disease that literally lowers over an IQ of the world?
*  Like if you're really smart, he's dying dying. Oh my god
*  Well, this is a weird disease too because my friend dr. Peter Atiyah. He said there there's
*  some speculation that it might be
*  Related to genetics and blood type people that are more vulnerable to it, right?
*  Oh type Oh positive seems to be the least vulnerable and a seems to be the most vulnerable interest
*  I don't know. Yeah
*  Should know I don't don't
*  She text my doctor you should find out bro if you're vulnerable. Hmm, and then don't let Bert sneeze on you. Oh
*  He's gonna survive everything everything. He'll be fine. I know at the end of the bra. He'll be like 85
*  I really do hope that this is a wake-up call for him and he gets off those fucking medications
*  We talked about it yesterday. Yeah getting off blood met blood pressure medication. Does he need it?
*  No, he's fat. He just needs to stop being fat
*  If he stopped drinking so much, you wouldn't need blood pressure medication
*  He's fucking boozing every night if he just took three months off and exercise and ate well and didn't drink
*  Bullshit and didn't eat sugar. I guarantee you wouldn't need any of that
*  Well, this actually quarrent that the benefit of this is that you know where he really goes the hardest is on the road
*  Yes, the road really fucks with him. We talked about that yesterday
*  Like I asked him if he was a prisoner to this sort of image that he's created and he's like kind of yeah
*  Definitely. Yeah, I mean that party animal image is
*  It's unsustainable. It's also he doesn't you know, he has that personality where he doesn't want to let somebody down
*  So if somebody even if he's done for the night, he's like, all right, I'm definitely going in
*  Yeah, and somebody's like hey man
*  One more shot
*  He's gonna do it the ever were you a Hunter S Thompson fan at all?
*  No, I never I never really you know got into it was exposed to it that much
*  I'm big fan of his and when he died one of the saddest things was watching the interviews before he died
*  Because he was a heavy boozer
*  Drug yeah, I know that deep into his 60s. Yeah, I think how old was he when he died
*  He was in the 70s when he died. Was he 70s? How old was her as tops when he died?
*  I
*  What are you doing? I finally just found that link and other guys original dick took me to a fucking
*  I'm deep on the internet right now. Oh, do you want to see where I'm at? Or let's just show the dick
*  Let's see the original dick. He's like it's deeper
*  It's huge. It's a different picture
*  But that's a different picture that's it's the same photo shoot right but where's the the actual photo where you see whoa
*  See that's what I'm saying. I got I got into is he eating someone's ass

*  Yeah, but yeah, this is a night know your meme thing and guys a giant dick there, dude
*  I don't know what you're talking about with look at the size of the same one as always that's a different
*  Well, that's a weird angle right there. Anyway, you could make that bigger so we can
*  Yeah, let's do it giant hog looks like it's not a small dick. I think you're wrong Jamie. I think it's the same hog
*  Hot hot
*  Muscle bear Oh muscle bear so he was doing that kind of porn. Yeah. Oh
*  Okay, I think he's doing looks like he's doing solo
*  That's you know
*  Okay pictures of me. I need some pictures of me beat off. Yeah, there's a lot of money in that maybe I
*  Don't know
*  starting only fans Jamie, um
*  What were we just talking about before that?
*  We were talking about
*  Bert and partying and
*  Fuck onto the road not being on the road. Yeah, we passed that though. We're talking about new stuff
*  People at home are screaming
*  We're not even high about that. No, not even high my memory sucks
*  Yeah, but being a prisoner though to that Oh Hunter S Thompson Hunter S Thompson
*  Sorry, when he was oh, how old was he when he died? That's the question when he died
*  You barely could understand a word he was saying because he was so
*  He would just stumble all his words and together 67 that's incredible
*  I think I remember that didn't kill himself after a football game. No, he killed himself cuz NFL was over
*  That's what I mean. Well, there was no NFL because after the Super Bowl or something, right?
*  wasn't he got in an argument with his wife he shot at her with a pellet gun and
*  Then went inside and blew his brains out
*  Something, you know something along those lines, but
*  When he died before he died he would go on Conan and you know take Conan with him in the backyard
*  I don't if you ever seen those videos. Yeah, he had this house of Woody Creek, which is outside of Aspen
*  and he would shoot guns out there and
*  Had Conan come and visit him and
*  You could barely understand a word. He was saying he was so fucked up. It's like his
*  His ability to express himself was just gone. It was just all the words blurred and mumbled together
*  It's in danger of that kind of thing
*  Sure
*  20 years from now if he keeps going hard in the paint every night. I mean when hunter was in his 40s
*  He was fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah when hunter was in his 40s is when he was running for sheriff. I think I
*  Think maybe his 30s. I
*  Don't know it's just that life of boozing is so unsustainable
*  Yeah, the pot smoking thing is so sustainable. It's so shocking like you talked to Tommy Chong. He's fine
*  He's been he's like 80 years old. Yeah, it's been smoking pot his whole life. He can talk to you fine
*  Yeah, but the booze will wear on you whose crushes you that's true. What was the other author?
*  That guy really got fucked up because King yeah, man. Yeah, how did he die?
*  Was it alcoholism?
*  Was no way no is that I did he kill himself? I don't know
*  But I remember he looked like fucking shit he looked like hell
*  Yeah, remember Mickey work played him in that movie barfly. Uh-uh. You don't remember no
*  Yeah, make you work and fade on away. I just remember
*  Barfly
*  Leukemia leukemia and probably related to alcohol, but when he I remember the the footage of when the documentary crew was in his house
*  Kowski's like you fucking cunt. Yeah kick sir. Kick the girl. Yeah
*  That's how they rocked it all day long. That was the way they lived. Yeah
*  Yeah, that white trash
*  Romanticized white trash boozy life. It's very strange because he was a brilliant poet. Yeah, he would write interesting shit
*  And you'd go wow that book post office. That's fantastic. Yeah. Yeah
*  He's a lot of great stuff great short pieces. Yeah, but
*  You know his life was just gross. Yeah, dude. Yeah, it was Hollywood gross, you know
*  Like living in Hollywood just going to the bars bars bars bars. Yeah
*  Smoking and talking slow. Oh man. I know I can't imagine I mean thinking about it makes me feel sick
*  Like to be in bars drinking and smoking all day all day. Yeah, just going to bars and talking shit
*  Yeah, like there's some funny videos of him reading
*  Reading his stories reading like doing public readings and people are interrupting him. He's threatening to stab them
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, he was he was a wild dude
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean but that was part of his appeal part of his appeal was that here's this guy it's like
*  He's not trying to be commercially successful. He's not trying to buy a mansion and have a big yard fence
*  He's just living in some shitty apartment
*  Drinking heavily. Mm-hmm and just cranking out work
*  I remember reading his stuff for the first time and just being like I didn't know anybody wrote like this
*  Yeah, cuz I how like he would be so vulgar at it. Yeah, I know. Yeah
*  I really liked it
*  You should see bar fly
*  Yeah, I should it's weird Mickey work plays it. He does a weird take on him, too
*  I told his to all my friends. He's always getting in fights
*  he's like at this bar getting fucked up and getting in fights getting his ass kicked and
*  but it's this
*  it's just this
*  Agreement that everyone has like everyone's fucked up and you're all just gonna meet together at this place and be
*  Fucked up together. Yeah and live your fucked up lives. Yeah drunk
*  Yeah, I don't know man, it's not for me, but I enjoy watching it
*  Do you have moments with Bert where you were we're alone with him off-camera? We try to
*  Talk some sense into him about like his crazy lifestyle stuff about the booze. Yeah. Yeah, sure
*  Yeah, I've talked to him before about it. I mean, you know the thing about him is that he's so
*  like high functioning and
*  He he's he is the perfect person
*  To be he has the perfect defense of like I'm fine because he he can do so much and
*  You know, he's not sleeping in he's getting up, you know with with the kids for school. He's going on tour
*  He says he goes back to bed. Does he? Yeah, I don't know that he goes back to bed. He's drinking at 11
*  Joey he goes back to bed
*  Who's it Joey said I go really yeah tells you gets up with the kids that motherfucker sleeps till 2 in the afternoon
*  Really? He goes right right back to bed. Joey told me that he goes I got too fucked up the other day
*  He's like even me. I
*  Go what happened? I fight some 400 milligram thing. I fell asleep like it in no no no 400 like millions THC
*  He's like Tom Segura. He always says, you know your full fucking name
*  Yeah, that's why I had my M&Ms in my teeth on the sleep apnea machine
*  He's like it was bad. My wife saw me and she was like, what are you doing?
*  He was what do you prefer that I do this so I'm out that robbing people
*  Yeah, and she was like good point
*  Those aren't the two options you have if anybody if I had a magic wand and one person to fix their lifestyle
*  It would be Joey. It would be clean clean up his diet. Yeah, that's gotta be as unhealthy as Bert if not more
*  Yes, he's so big and you know, he's 60 years old almost
*  You can't you can't last being that big and he's this is already it
*  But he's already in a much better place than he was ten years prior, right? Yes, but well no ten years ago
*  He lost a shitload of weight. Okay, there was one point in time. We lost like 80 pounds
*  Yeah, memory he said my head looked too big
*  He that was like his I got a gain weight again reasoning for gaining weight, but he can do it
*  Yeah, like red band did that to red band got really skinny red band got down like 160. He did remember that
*  Yes, and then I went a long time without seeing him and I saw him again
*  He put on a bunch. Yeah, but he's a cape. I mean we're all capable of it, you know, I go up and down all the time
*  I'm just like, you know for me you can always tell if I'm gaining weight. It's not exercise for me
*  It's that I started eating sugar again. Mm-hmm, you know, like I worked out like
*  Crazy last year. I got there was points where I was working out like out of 75 days
*  I'd work out like 62 of you know, but but I was not dropping weight cuz you're eating I was eating
*  Yeah, yeah, you want a reward for all that hard working out and eat a piece of cake. Yeah, and then I also
*  Sometimes it's not even the cake. It's like I'll just you'll see somebody who
*  Works out a lot and eats like a large balanced diet and I'll be like, well, I want to do that
*  You know you should do eat nothing but duck eggs
*  The whole month I lose so much weight gooey jizz in my mouth. You lose so much weight, but I
*  Have to eliminate noise you make when you eat a duck egg
*  You're really gonna cripple the duck egg industry with this
*  I'm gonna stick to chicken eggs. They're better. They're better. No, it's the only okay. Maybe people are in though
*  Maybe I cooked them wrong. I'm sorry duck egg people. Yeah, you're gonna get some messages about that
*  But I have to do like the protein fat thing. I have to yeah
*  It's like the only way that I'll not blow up. Did you quit the carnivore diet? Yeah, how long did you last?
*  I did it hardcore for about a month and then I did how long before the diarrhea went away
*  I was about ten days. I got a text from you. This diarrhea is astonishing. It was
*  was
*  Great name for diarrhea astonished I have photos of my phone that I saved cuz I'm like this is crazy
*  I have ink the other ink like real special
*  Diarrhea that I had was when you know
*  So I went from like just doing that hardcore to having like some greens
*  But like meat, you know meat fat and then like some greens that was fine
*  It was when I that first day of like fuck it gonna have some pasta and a donut today
*  And then it was like like just immediate crazy shits crazy shits
*  But it's like make up your mind. Yeah, I'm here to punish you
*  I had to hold on to the side of the seat to watch it was like rocket man really really
*  extraordinary
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, there's a volume that's astonishing, right?
*  It's like the amount that comes out like I don't eat that much
*  You would know too you had like this warning your stomach does things that tells you like you're gonna want to sit down for this one
*  Yeah, like there's like little explosions
*  Yeah, and you when you feel the liquid you feel water in your gut. I think I strengthened my asshole muscles, though
*  That's good because I I was clamping them down so often
*  Well, yeah yikes and then I barely made it to the toilet. That is yeah
*  This is I just never saw it coming because most of what I was eating before was kind of carnivore esque and
*  Then I would have like a little bit of vegetables or some pasta or something like that
*  But I lost 12 pounds in a month in a month and she got shredded pretty easy and I kept most of it off
*  Yeah, I gained maybe three or four because I went back to eating pasta and bread and during this
*  Quarantine I'm not on any diet. I'm just cuz I'm my concern is
*  Just I mean what if it's hard to get food? Yeah, you know, I want to make sure that I'm just eating food
*  Yeah, I'm not I'm not thinking about the way I look. I don't think diet is a real big concern
*  I mean, you know, I'm not trying to like go off the rails, but it's no. Yeah. Yeah, I lost 10 in that month
*  Oh, that's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, if you just cut out the sugar
*  You just feel so much better too you do and you and I see the fucking I
*  See the dark cycle that happens when you start I start with sugar like when I start being like
*  I'll have this today and that tomorrow. Are you yeah double stuff for you?
*  And then I realized that like I don't even want it but I'm craving it, you know, yeah
*  It fucking yeah, there's a thing that I get when I'll eat carnivore. Well have a big steak, right?
*  So I'll eat a steak and then I'm done. I'm done eating
*  Unless I want a cookie then I could have more room. Yeah more room for that cookie. Yeah. Yeah or pasta
*  I got more room for that pasta. It's incredible on the carnivore thing the amount that I can eat and not feel
*  Like that stuff feeling at all at all like a 22 ounce fucking t-bone
*  And you feel fine feel fine. You don't feel wrecked. No. Yeah, it's the best feeling after food because you don't feel
*  Like you fucked up. Yeah, you feel like you like you have all your mental capacity
*  You have your full mental capabilities you can think and talk and when I eat a big bowl like if I eat lasagna

*  I'll be like, hey check this who's this and I'll it'll be like me and I'll show it to him
*  He's like, yeah anyway, and he just immediately
*  He's like put the fucking Paw Patrol back on
*  Yeah, I know that okay, it's you you're right in front of me. What I give a shit if you're on the phone
*  Yeah, doesn't care one day. He's gonna appreciate it one day. What are you kids into it?
*  Yeah, they they get weirded out, but they see people approach you. They do not like that. Yeah, they do not like that
*  Yeah, my my littlest especially does not like that. I said she's like because people don't pay attention to her
*  They just start talking to me and if she's talking to me people interrupt her to talk to me. I mean, it's a really angry
*  Pull on me. Yeah, that makes sense. It does make sense
*  I'll just saw it somebody talking to me and he just he was like they walked away
*  He was just I could tell he wanted to be like what was that all about? Do you know that guy?
*  Yeah, yeah, it's like my kids always say that do you know him? I don't Mike no
*  Like buddy, he comes up to you like he knows you I know. Yeah
*  Like you took them a while to figure out they've never seen me perform. But one time we were all in Irvine together
*  And I was doing the improv and I snuck them backstage
*  I'm like you want to see what the crowd looks like and then like they like peek behind the counter like oh my god
*  There's so many people. Yeah, I go and this is only a comedy club. This isn't even a theater and it's not even an arena
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, I want I want them to come to an arena one day that would be
*  Bonkers that is you have to because it's so bonkers. Of course. It's got it's gonna blow their minds. Yeah
*  Yeah, they'd be like wait a minute. Wait a minute. They're always people. Yeah, but who knows if that'll ever happen again
*  I know who knows
*  Yeah, this is like no one saw this coming. I
*  mean
*  people that put on like concerts and
*  Sporting events and entertainment has just completely
*  Other than this kind of shit. Yeah, this is it. Yeah, this is it
*  Yeah, somebody was I saw these ideas because people were you know doing virtual performance, you know
*  Whatever you can go live and play a guitar sing and they're like people but you should do like virtual comedy shows
*  I'm like you you have to have the live audience
*  What's that dude's name that did that one comedy special?
*  Gerard Carmichael filmed it. I don't know his name. I don't know his name, but I know you're talking that was no audience comedy
*  Yeah, it's a strange concept terrible idea. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah when Gerard was telling me I was like what?
*  Yeah, like what are you gonna do? I think the idea of the audience has played out like
*  Audience they said you mean the most important part of a comedy show the fact there's people there to laugh
*  It's an unusual it's funny. All right. I think they took a swing. Yeah, it didn't work out
*  I mean, I guess you know, I respect taking high risk, you know, that's a dumb risk though
*  Yeah, that's like I'm gonna swim but with no water. What do you think I'm gonna swim in the bottom of the pool?
*  I'm just gonna see who can just do swimming motions. Yeah, see how fast I can get across the pool
*  It's it is strange. I mean like that's one that I never thought somebody would try to do
*  I never thought HBO would go great idea HBO signs off on a lot of
*  Outrageous ideas. I don't think they know what they're doing. Yeah, I mean they made Game of Thrones
*  So they probably like well, we know it we got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, where the shit
*  Well, they hit a home run for sure. Every cycle of shows. They always have one that goes. Oh my god
*  Did you watch the outsider?
*  No, it's great. I watched McMillions. That was fantastic. I didn't see that. Oh, that's the McDonald's one. Is that HBO as well?
*  It's HBO. Yeah good. My cousin made that it's great. Your cousin made it cousin made it no shit. Yeah, it's fantastic
*  It is such a cool fucking
*  story the whole scope of that scam is
*  It will fucking blow your mind. What is the scam? So was a lottery thing or something like that from
*  So you obviously remember the Monopoly game that you would play right?
*  Don't so make oh, yeah, you're kind of healthy but back back shit
*  So but it was humongous. So what happened was
*  they would do it like
*  Maybe like twice a year where they would go
*  The Monopoly McDonald's game what happened is you go to McDonald's and you would buy a
*  Happy meal or Big Mac and on like the fries and the drink would be like a peel-off thing and you could win prizes
*  So you pull off a thing and you like you could win it could be it's something as small as like you want free fries
*  So you could be like I got you know
*  I won another order of fries or a Coke or a jet ski or a car and then there were cash prizes million dollar prizes
*  So by by playing the game which was essentially
*  Buy something buy a meal and it would drive up sales obviously, right?
*  Like sales would go way up because people were wanting to win these prizes. Well, everybody that won
*  For this I want to say I forget now but like 15 year period or something. They were all in
*  on a scam
*  They were all fake winners a guy
*  was
*  Stealing pieces and giving them to people
*  Connected to him it was all a lie. Nobody was legitimately. How did he do that? That's the whole that's the series man
*  It's fucking fascinating
*  fascinating because
*  at one point there's this the this guy's giving it to
*  you know people he knows and
*  They're talking about it in the series like people connected to him. They're like after a while
*  It's like it's weird that you know ten winners of our have won in like this 300 mile radius and eight of them are Italian
*  We're like we got to branch out a little bit because no one's like tipped off yet because the guy was you know Italian
*  He was going like friends and family
*  Yeah, it was it was really fucking crazy and then amazing they kept their mouth shut
*  They kept their mouth shut and they would have gotten away with it. I mean they were getting away with it. It was just
*  it was
*  They got tipped off FBI got tipped off and then this whole investigation. That's what the series it's a six-part series
*  That's what it reveals is just the scale and the scope of this incredible scam. It was a scam, man
*  Did this guy work for McDonald's? No
*  There's all these different characters in it, but
*  basically McDonald's had to hire a
*  Company that would oversee the game like the security of the game and they would also have to hire another company to print
*  You know like the game pieces and all that and within those companies the corruption lied McDonald's didn't know
*  Wow, and it it it but the story is fascinating the characters are outrageous, too
*  I mean the Colombo family is part of it
*  You know the crime family. I gotta watch it. It's good man. It's really good
*  There's so many of those multi series or multi show documentaries now that are fascinating
*  Oh, yeah, like wild wild country like that kind of shit
*  We're you just like what and when they and when these networks get behind something like that like this Tiger King to think to you're like
*  Man, you know, that's why you need that platform, right?
*  Like an HBO or Netflix to be like tell us the whole story. It's fucking awesome
*  Yeah, or wild country country. You need something that's gonna play out for five or six episodes
*  We're three episodes in you like what how the fuck did I not know? Yeah
*  What was that one? Do you remember the one a couple years ago? Was it the staircase?
*  Something like that about yeah, I never saw that one. That was fucking good to someone killed his ex-wife or yes
*  Yes, dude and and you just cannot believe some of the twists and turns of something like this
*  It's just and then there was like that part of that
*  I mean I'm jumping around and the owl theory where they're like maybe an owl came an attactor and that's what yes
*  Yes, an owl. Yes, and they were like there were owls in that area
*  It could have happened like people have all these conspiracy theories about it's amazing
*  How many people got away with crimes before like DNA evidence?
*  Do you ever think about how like how easy it probably was for people?
*  25 years ago your sociopath. Oh, yeah. Yeah
*  Just travel around whacking people no cameras. No DNA
*  Yeah, I mean the what's the big one that we just the Golden State killer
*  Well, that was the one that Patton Oswald's wife was working. Yes. She was writing that book. What are you playing over there?
*  Yeah
*  What is that?
*  Looking at the video that Robert Durst guy. He's on trial right now. That was the other one the that fucking series was
*  No, but what was the show called?
*  That's where I got that song. Yeah, dad blood. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that
*  I was in a we were doing a gig and I was like check out the song
*  Except that's where I got that song the bad blood. Yeah, the jinx the jinx. Did you watch it? Nope fucking excellent
*  Yeah, I read the story, but I didn't watch it. It's really good and it's super creepy
*  But like you're following along and then in the final episode and he's doing his weird fucking and he has black eyes
*  you know like there's no color they're black and
*  He gets up to use the restroom and the mic still hot and he's talking to himself in the restroom
*  You see like the cameras like locked off filming a wall. Mm-hmm. He's like, yeah, I killed them all
*  You don't realize I killed them all it's a fucking weird moment. Why does he have such black eyes? What's that about?
*  I fucking I don't know man. This is this trials going on right now
*  Might be on hold because of the oh, right. But yeah, just started earlier this month like two weeks ago
*  That's another really cool series
*  How crazy is that Harvey Weinstein?
*  That's the only one now that's gonna kill him right? I think so. I mean, we don't know but
*  He really looked like I mean he always looked like shit, but he looked like particularly a hot bag of shit
*  Like what trial oh my god and for the sentencing when he came in with the walker and everything like what the fuck
*  Do you think that that was a scam that he was trying to pretend that he was more hurt than he was probably?
*  Probably, I mean he was a movie producer. So he knows right how to play it up
*  Yeah, but he did look like shit
*  He really did in a way that you can't fake like his face was hanging off
*  Look fat and he did look like he was like, I don't know like needing that support
*  Yeah of that, you know, I mean the guy was walking upright a few months ago. It seemed like I know
*  well also the stress of that life of having the the weight of his past come tumbling down on him and
*  Imagine going up to Harvey Weinstein four years ago and go dude
*  I want to show you what the future looks like for you. He'd be like fuck out of here
*  That's never gonna happen never never man. Yeah, I mean imagine going later
*  Imagine going up to Cosby and telling him that I know like you're the most beloved
*  Father figure in this country. Yeah, I mean just before that like just before things went sideways
*  You know, he wouldn't have fucking been like, what are you talking about?
*  Yeah, I almost think that his story is
*  Less
*  Shocking the the result
*  Mmm, it's like the Harvey Weinstein thing. I guess I didn't know he was a piece of shit
*  I had never no idea but I knew that Cosby was right
*  We had all kind of heard that Cosby was a piece of shit. We all knew that no anything about Harvey Weinstein
*  I just knew he made movies. I know yeah, I guess I mean with Cosby always knew he was a womanizer
*  I didn't know there was like
*  You know date rape any though. I had heard that you heard that I didn't know that on the set of news radio
*  Wow in the 90s. I had heard that he was drugging women
*  Well, that's when he was probably pretty active with it
*  You know, it was I think that one was the Cosby show on the air in the late 80s early 90s
*  I think so was probably just getting done
*  Yeah, I was on news radio was 94 and I remember like what he drugs people like so I think candy Alexander's one
*  So they were talking me you I mean, there's probably people on set that had experienced it. Maybe yeah
*  Yeah, could be but I hardly I didn't know anything about I just
*  The Harvey thing I just thought he I mean he was just a big fat ugly movie producer
*  I didn't yeah and also I think when that story
*  First broke there was some ID like it was kind of implied this guy was a gross
*  You know like show me your tits kind of guy. I didn't write as the story details came out
*  You're like no this dude is like a full-blown
*  like right like rapist that you would
*  read about in the
*  Newspaper, you know, I mean like he actually pushed women down held them down. Yeah, he's a real fucking animal
*  And then he was like what what's the problem? I mean he fully shameless completely disassociates with what he did
*  I think he was living this crazy life
*  Where he could get away with anything like a king?
*  I mean we've talked about this before that like that behavior of Kings like
*  gluttonous power
*  Behavior where they just yell at everyone and off with their head and yeah bring her over here just like that
*  Yeah, that kind of shit. Well when you also that his story revealed the like the scope of
*  payroll he had like
*  photo journalists
*  Editors, I think long for like all types of people on like what mafia kind of shit does
*  You know like I pay you to fucking watch out for my bad deeds. Yes, so he really was doing well even more
*  Disgusting it was in his contract
*  Like if you have one sexual harassment claim it'll cost you this much if you have to you have to pay us this much
*  Like it was written into his contract
*  So they knew they knew they knew maybe how come nobody else gets in trouble for that
*  Yeah, I don't know
*  Yeah, I mean, how do you what do you what do they know? That's the question, you know
*  Jail hospital, he's a Riker son, but in the in their medic unit. I think so
*  You think that's top-tier quality here top of the food god damn they have a bunch of Corona cases right now at Rikers
*  It's like it's a big issue. Of course you have no windows
*  They're letting a bunch of people out right now that I have like probation violations or something. Oh, let them spread it good move
*  That's the next thought hilarious. Yeah, let him out. Yeah, unless you're letting him out into a furnace
*  I
*  Mean that shit if it did that to that Olympic swimmer that 31 year old guy
*  Yeah wrecked him was gonna do to Harvey Weinstein. Oh my god. No, he's oh, this is what I want to talk to you about
*  The fucking comments of people mad at you because you're doing shows in Spanish are hilarious
*  I get a bunch of emails
*  Hilarious how mad people get well the funny thing is like so for people that don't know like I just
*  I got a deal
*  With Netflix where they were like do an English special and then a Spanish special and they actually offered me to dig
*  Like you can just translate that special and shoot it. I was like, that's kind of boring
*  So I'll try to you know work on some new stuff for the Latin audience and translate like a few bits and then
*  In order to shoot it. I just go I just need a bunch of reps like you would in English
*  Yeah, I just need shows in Spanish so I started doing that, you know and started doing is are you fully fluent?
*  Like you could have conversations with people. There's no hitch. Yeah, you'd have a conversation with me
*  Yeah, I can have a conversation with anybody in Spanish and you've been like that your whole life
*  there's like times where the the level of
*  Fluency goes higher like especially if I'm immersed like living right and then like who do you practice with? Yeah
*  I mean there's there's definitely I have my hiccups in that like I might grammatically say something incorrectly
*  Mm-hmm, they'll definitely know what I'm saying
*  And then that's one of the things I work on is that I record these I send them to a Spanish tutor
*  I go really yeah
*  I go did I say anything incorrect in this is a special is like what the fuck is wrong? She goes. I'm not going to
*  She goes I'm not going to comment on your
*  material she goes it's not what I'm used to but I'll help you with the
*  Grammatical thing so she you know, she'll be like you should have said la mano instead of it. Okay, so we work on things like that
*  you know like
*  Make sure you say it correct because the main thing is I don't want someone to be distracted because they're like that sounded
*  Right, of course so broken English. I guess you know, I don't know fluency level is probably like eight or nine or something
*  Wow, but I mean, you know, it gets better the more I I work on it and it gets worse the longer
*  I leave it. So that's why I started doing the podcast in Spanish. That's why I've been doing these shows
*  and all I did was I would announce hey, I'm gonna do a
*  Spanish show I did one in Oxnard. I did one in Ontario
*  I had these Texas ones booked for April where one night in each of this in Houston Dallas
*  Austin to San Antonio and when I posted them, they're like people are like hey these shows are in Spanish
*  I go that's what it says in the fucking on the marquee on the ticket on the like
*  This show is in Spanish and they're like, yeah, I can't fucking understand it though because I don't speak Spanish
*  I'm like, I know this is for somebody else and they're like
*  They're like, but why don't you add a show in English and I'm you know, you're trying to like go like well, I
*  Will do that show in English later
*  Like when the English hour is ready because I'm just releasing a special so I got to build a new hour
*  Before I come to Houston and show it, you know, and they're like, yeah, but you should just do it
*  You should just do it while you're here. I'm like, yeah, but that's not you know, and then I don't I just but people have been
*  Like you're a fucking idiot for doing this Spanish
*  Why
*  Put it on your Instagram, right? I put screen grabs of yeah, I left their their handles out
*  Oh, yeah, I read a few of them. Yeah, I got more I got more. I bet you do
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, and people are like and then I have the ones they're like I bought the ticket and
*  I didn't realize that this was Spanish and I would like a refund and I'm like don't talk to me about it
*  You know, first of all on the site
*  It's it's called Tom Segura in a spaniel and that's what it says and then it's like if you speak English
*  This is not the show for you
*  And they're like I didn't look at it. I'm like what do you want me to do man?
*  Sell your tickets on Craigslist. Yeah, so yeah people
*  Yeah got fired up at me for not adding the English imagine if you were responsible for returning all your tickets like you'd
*  Never be able to do anything do you get messages like that?
*  And they're like hey, I think I want to exchange this ticket. I don't know what kind of messages I get. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know
*  I got I'm so much happier. It's like don't know. Yeah. Oh my god. I'll tell you this my special came out today
*  I have not gone to look at I
*  Read some good reviews. Yeah. Yeah of your shit. Yeah, okay. I haven't even checked it out
*  Yeah, I read I read a couple good reviews and some I think one of them was Washington Post. Oh, it's great. That's cool
*  Yeah, I'm happy but yeah, don't read it. I don't get into it
*  I do remember lat on the last tour, you know, especially on the bus
*  You just sit there you read everything reading three people were like I bought
*  tickets Friday show I'd rather come to Saturday show and
*  At the Chicago theater
*  Okay, like dude. Yeah, hit them up. What am I gonna do?
*  Like you can figure this out for me like, okay
*  Yeah, like you have plenty of time to be come on these 20-minute phone calls to reroute
*  You take this Steve to get the Saturday tickets
*  Yeah, no it is but do you do you post and walk away right? Yes. Yeah, I don't read shit
*  It's the way to do it. I've been doing that for a long time now. It's amazing
*  Yeah changes everything if you have discipline, but you have to have a discipline and not read your comments
*  Yeah
*  You know
*  Cuz I know people that read them and they go crazy and they respond to them and argue with them like that's the
*  That's the problem too is that you not only have to avoid reading if you are reading
*  You have to not engage in the back and forth
*  No, you can't you can't because a lot of people are just trying to get your attention and then a lot of people are also
*  Crazy. Yeah, if you're writing to me you're talking to the void. Yeah, I'm not reading anything. It's just better that way man
*  Yeah, it's better for you mentally for sure for sure. Yeah. Yeah, it's just you only have so much time
*  You know and you can get trapped reading stuff about you and go what who said that?
*  Why are they saying that like, you know if you fucked up, you know, if you said something stupid
*  You can do just try to do your best. Yeah, you know, especially like what we do
*  And especially if we're doing shows or a podcast or anything like that where you're getting high and you're talking crazy
*  Oh, yeah, you try to be funny and sometimes you swing and miss and sometimes you sometimes you hit a home run
*  Yeah, you never know
*  but if you delve into the comments and start reading all the things that people say about you and tailoring your your act towards
*  your your tailoring your
*  Podcasts or your the way or where you're talking based on the kind of people that are willing to leave comments in the first place, right?
*  And you're also catering it to the loudest voice. You're just saying like oh you're loud exactly. Oh, okay
*  Oh, that is the number one problem with social media
*  that's what I've tried to explain to people that like read social media and talk about Twitter and
*  Instagram and like well, there's so many right-wing Trump supporters that this there's so many left-wing
*  Bernie supporters to do that and the Bernie bro and then this and that and no, that's not true
*  What's true is on the fringes of the left and the right you have losers that spend all their time
*  Calling people out and talking shit online and I've studied these people
*  I've studied these people for years because I've been
*  Fascinated by people that engage in these Twitter beefs with people and so I have a few of them
*  Bookmarked and I go to check them and some of them I would bookmark and I'm like this guy has done nothing
*  Yeah, but talk shit online for like 12 hours. It's crazy and there's a lot of them like that
*  Yeah, there's a lot in the most virtuous
*  The ones who are trying to get the most reactions and they're calling out celebrities for this calling out people for that
*  It's just so much of that online
*  It reminds me of something, you know some some things someone says just stick with you sometimes
*  Yes, you know like and you just I don't know that you can't explain why but you go like it just sticks with me
*  I remember one time talking to a guy who goes
*  You know, there's a lot of unstable people out there and I hear his voice all the time
*  Like about this type of oh, yeah
*  There's a lot of unstable people a lot of unstable people that also have access to a phone
*  Yeah, and then they just start running off to the races going crazy with it. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of that but there's also
*  You know, it's a lot of nonsense on both sides just the social media
*  Just the the wanting people to like you like did you see that imagine song?
*  All those knuckleheads got together and saying imagine there's no heaven
*  This is not the time when everyone's Grammys dying you fucking idiot to sing imagine there's no heaven and there's this
*  Sense of you feel like they've that they feel like they did something. Yeah, I'm if it can't she's so happy
*  Gal Gadot whatever fucks wonder woman. She's got this beautiful smile on her face and so happy to sing that. Thank you
*  just like like she's
*  Seducing you. Yeah, I lost my job at the meatpacking plant, but Gal Gadot saying imagine it's a terrible version
*  You guys suck at singing. Yeah, why are you even singing publicly? I didn't even post but I I tried to do one
*  Right. First of all, I tried to do that where I go imagine I just started laughing hysterically
*  So then I did one where I go I want to connect with all you guys so let's just jerk off together
*  Reach in there then I go I'm not used to this hand this hand just try to connect with all my fans
*  But it's such a dumb move to I don't know
*  I can't believe how many people I mean
*  I guess that she must have reached out to them send me a you singing out and they want to be like tight where they're
*  Like sure Wonder Woman. Yeah, I'll do it
*  Imagine
*  Yeah, like okay
*  Okay, I couldn't keep it I tried to stay off fuck stay offline you fuck I tried to get off your phone
*  Video you made yeah, I tried to do it because I wanted I wanted all of us to
*  To mock it. I think I have it. I think the some comics did something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they did
*  I couldn't even say
*  Well, yeah, like I saw Eric Andre and then like slap on my slab on my knob that's what they did right there's a
*  Exactly. Yeah
*  Yeah, they did like a parody of it was great
*  What's the weird thing is, you know people are sitting around going? Oh people think I'm cool. Yeah, if I do this
*  Yeah, yeah, you know instead of like just capturing a genuine moment in your life
*  Which is really hard to do on social media anyway, because you feel like a fucking dork
*  You know, what's a weird feeling though is like let imagine you had
*  Worked with gal right? I thought about this too. Like you did something you were in a movie or something
*  And then she hits you up. Hey, I'm trying to do this
*  You have that moment of pause especially as a comic because you have like so much self-awareness
*  Where you're like, oh, that's gonna be lame as shit and then you have to like figure out attack
*  I would go stir just just don't respond 100%
*  100% first of all, I could give two fucks whether or not I'm ever in a movie again
*  Two fucks whether or not I talked to her
*  She's like will you sing imagine a line from imagine and if I'm friends with her like if I've had conversations
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I would have to say listen
*  You're awesome. I think you're great. Yeah, but that is that is a ridiculous idea
*  Yeah, it's so lacking in self-awareness and so ridiculous
*  I let me tell you what I would do if I was even if I wasn't a comic if I saw
*  Someone do that I'd be like what in the fuck do you think you're accomplishing with this?
*  I felt so much better today seeing celebrities sing imagine. It made it better
*  I made the world was not really yeah
*  I mean Grammy died choking on her own vomit
*  But I feel like the world's better because gal Gadot is so pretty gal Gadot and she started it off
*  Imagine there's no
*  And then at the end big smile she did a like a really like
*  Sincere look into the camera like look what I did for you. Did she I mean, yeah
*  I didn't get to it. She's like hmm. I feel connected to you. Yeah, there's some people man. They get real
*  Self-indulgent and self-righteous with that fucking social media. It's exposed a lot of celebrities for being real dorks
*  Yeah, yeah, of course, you know, they should be exposed for that
*  But they never got a chance to be exposed before they would go on a tonight show
*  They do these things they do these interviews. Everything was real fluff
*  Yeah, you just leave them alone with a phone or you get great stuff
*  Did you see Tom Hanks wife singing along to naughty by nature? I was really surprised
*  Yeah, it was good though. It was fun. No makeup
*  Exceptionally. Yeah, no makeup. She's having fun hip-hop. Hooray
*  Here's the thing that that cadence and like that that rhyme pattern of yes, it's not easy to mimic no
*  It's not easy to mimic. No, she did a good job, but it's also so
*  Obvious that she wasn't trying to be anything other than have fun. Yeah
*  Well when you're drinking children's blood every night for dinner you have fun, you know, well, I think so
*  I don't know. I just read the comments. I thought they just fuck those kids
*  Sure, it helps you keep your rhythm going. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, no
*  She was just having fun that's revealed that she's super cool. Yeah with no makeup, right?
*  Yeah, she's not trying to get dolled up
*  No, like there's these people that some people are doing these like quarantined like day five here
*  We are day five and it's like so contrived and super contrived
*  I guess they want to connect to people and they want to talk to people but oh
*  I mean, what are we doing? Yeah, I mean are we doing that? What are we doing? Yeah, we are
*  We are
*  But we're having a conversation we would have this conversation if there was no microphone
*  Yeah, we probably talk a lot more shit about people. Yeah, I mean
*  That's always a big component of a good time
*  It's fun. Who's talking shit's fun. I keep thinking about that meat we had
*  Fucking Vegas. Oh so good. Yeah, we're bizarre meat meats. Yeah
*  Fantastic, but it used to be the SLS and now what is it?
*  Forget they changed the name though. Remember that? Yeah
*  Sands or something it's just back to what it was. Yeah, was it Sahara Sahara? I think it's the Sahara
*  Whatever it is the fucking that bizarre meats place. God damn is that good?
*  Yeah, you gotta you gotta have mine I would love to fucking dope. Yeah, I've seen him on Bourdain show
*  Yeah, yeah, he's that that place was phenomenal
*  I love how they cook over wood to you walk by and you see the the hardwood coals and
*  The grill grates and they know what the fuck they're doing. They told us it would take an hour to cook the steak
*  Yeah, yeah, we're like an hour. Yeah, like yeah an hour and
*  The steaks are huge. So just order one steak. I was like really yeah one three pound steak like, okay
*  It was amazing dude. We are to two though amazing. God damn was good. Yeah, what a fun weekend
*  Just randomly we happen to be in Vegas at the same time. So cool. Yeah, that's cool and something like that
*  Yeah, yeah, I was bummed
*  We had to leave before the the last three fights dude, you missed the way Lee's young
*  Joanne you and J check fight which is one of the greatest fights in the history of the sport
*  I saw you saying you keep thinking about it dude all day. I'd just be for days for days
*  I'd be like car like
*  As close as a fight could ever get a lot of people thought you want to one a lot of people thought way Lee one
*  But it was amazing. It was amazing. It was a fucking war really came down like you could judge it either way
*  Yeah, yeah, you could have yeah. Yeah, it wasn't I mean they gave it to way Lee was a split decision
*  But it was you on his head. It was so close her forehead ridiculous and never never even

*  He's really good guy, too. I like hanging out with him. Yeah, man Buffalo's finest
*  I love watching new comics new comics new comedy. Yeah, I love watching a new comic that I've never seen their act before
*  Yeah, and you get to see them like and he seems like a guy has been doing about ten years
*  Uh-huh is about ten years. Yeah. Yeah, that's a fully formed comedian
*  It is he's a fully formed comedian great guy great guy and he's he's a headlining now he's starting to head that's great
*  So he deserves it. He's really good. I was impressed. Yeah, I've been I've been
*  Taking on the road for a few years now and he just gets better and better and he yeah, man
*  He is a couple bits that really floor me
*  He's really good. I got you can't even give away the premises. No, you can't
*  I do love I'm out say the one thing is like the way he wants to die
*  No, he's really good and it was cool to hang with him too, you know, it's just
*  Hey with comics is the best dude the best the best the most fun
*  I mean if you if we hadn't seen you guys we would have just hung out with each other all weekend
*  And then you're like, oh, there's more comics here. Let's hang out with them. Yeah, so it's always and they get to eat chill
*  Yeah, but it was the beginning of the coronavirus thing. We're a little weirded out, bro. I also think about
*  So what my manager was in town he had friends in town so after one of the shows I want to say it was the
*  Second night. We also went to a cigar bar and you start thinking about like all of us all the contact and yeah in casinos
*  Too casinos are just fucking that's another thing dude. Las Vegas is shut down
*  So it's so wild to think about how those you know, those casinos are just active people and now how about all those people that count on that?
*  Yeah, the dealers
*  The place waitresses, yeah
*  Everyone everyone everything shut down for how long how long they plan on shutting Vegas down for they announced like last week
*  They said they would reopen casinos May 16th
*  Then today
*  Earlier today Trump was like there's no way this is going past Easter
*  So like he was ripping and roaring again, but he's not basing anything that he's saying though on science
*  No, we're not on science
*  Science no or on viruses. No, of course not. Yeah
*  Yeah, he should shut the fuck up. He's going on a hunch
*  Well, he wants everything to bounce back because he wants the economy to bounce back the governor of Texas had a take on it, too
*  He's like I would rather put myself in danger and I'm in a high-risk group of catching this disease and have the economy come back
*  Okay
*  Yeah, I don't know man. I don't know. I don't know when I you know
*  It's like I had a take on it before
*  When I see Idris Elba, I'm like, he looks great. Those NBA players. They look great
*  All these people look good Tom Hanks is recovering. Maybe it's just like the flu
*  But then you read that 31 year old Olympic swimmer and you know, and you go that guy's 31 and he's a stud
*  He's an Olympian. Yes, literally an Olympian a gold medalist, by the way
*  He's a fucking stud right and he said it was the worst virus he ever experienced in his life. And then Michael Yeoh
*  Michael Yeoh getting really sick. And there was two college basketball players who died they died
*  Yeah, yeah, not college basketball players now, but they played college in the 90s
*  And they died and they both died. Yeah
*  It was on my my Apple News feed this morning
*  I think about this virus too is that there's there's this uncertainty about you know
*  When things will change when the curve will flatten when the economy but we also don't understand the virus yet, right?
*  Exactly, that's the part that's really alarming
*  that's the weird thing is like some people just experience no symptoms and it just goes through their system and they they don't ever get it and
*  Then the other thing was someone was telling me I forget who it was. I attributed to dr
*  Peter at EA yesterday, but I think I'm wrong
*  Someone was saying one of the odd things seems to might be Sam Harris
*  Someone's saying one of the odd things seems to be that the more contact people have with the virus the worse it gets
*  Hmm, so
*  Some oh like medical professional. Yeah medical professionals. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's very strange. You see the NBA player today said he lost his sense of smell. Yeah, that's another thing
*  That's one things that Peter Atiyah said smell and taste are going away. Yeah, it's very weird
*  People lose their their sense of smell very weird. It's it's uh, it's spooky
*  Yeah, cuz it's a it's like a well
*  Also, there's these crazy conspiracy theories that Wuhan is like someplace where they have some
*  weaponized virus lab and so that they're worried that one of the things that
*  This that makes this so scary is that it could have snuck out of this fucking lab. Hmm
*  But apparently they they've traced it to a very specific type of animal
*  I thought that this thing always transfers motion told me this that that birds
*  Need a pig the pig is the perfect conduit of
*  Transferring like the bird disease won't come from like straight to a person
*  It needs to go to a pig and the pig can infect what about avian flu?
*  I don't know avian flu came from birds. This is a bats and then I think bats gave it to pangolins
*  Do you know where the fucking pangolin is?
*  Whitney was telling me this that a pangolin is like the most
*  The most what is the word you would use where someone is a
*  Transferring animals, I'm fucking slow today, man. My brain's slow today. Yeah going on. Yeah
*  That the most exploited most exploited animal in the world, you know what a pangolin is
*  Some weird fucking pangolin pangolin. I think it is never heard of that. Yeah
*  Um
*  There it is that fucking thing look it up there the screen look
*  That that thing that's called a pangolin pangolin
*  Yeah, that is the most exploited animal in the world and they eat them in China. And so this fucking thing is where
*  China has laws to stop pangolin trafficking. Yeah, I think it looks freaky man
*  Yeah, they have laws that they're they're imposing now to stop the sale of wild animals
*  You can't sell wild animals in the United States, but you can sell well, you can sell wild fish
*  But you can't sell wild animals in the United States. That's one of the weird things about fish
*  What about those like exotic people in like that documentary, you know, like buying aren't those wild animals? I mean for food
*  Oh, okay. Okay. I mean for food. Okay, you can't like even in this country like most trafficked animal. Yeah
*  Adorable pangolin is the most trafficked animal in the world. How is that possible? Ask Whitney Cummings. She's the one who told me it seems to be true
*  Yeah, it's in the New York Post as well. There it is the rainforest of the Congo Cameroon and Central African Republic
*  Lives an elusive mammal that looks like a cross between an anteater and armadillo and a pine cone and thanks to poachers
*  The pangolin is the most trafficked animal on earth in
*  April of 2019 Singapore seized a world record
*  25.6 tons of pangolin scales worth
*  76.5 million from an estimated 38,000 of the creatures in
*  December the scales from some 50,000 African pangolins were seized by Chinese authorities. This is why what do they do for it?
*  I don't know
*  It's because of this scale this unique feature that makes them a target said Tessa Allman a volunteer for the Sanga
*  Pangolin project a preservation society the pangolin buries burrow to create holes
*  So the scales are associated with circulation. It's used as an ingredient in traditional Asian medicines
*  They used to help mothers for lactation and for blood pressure, but none of this has been clinically proven. So it's like tiger
*  teeth and
*  Horn shit tusks. Yeah, there's so much of that shit. I was talking to a Chinese guy about that
*  Yeah, and I was saying well, why do they know that rhino horn doesn't work and that they could get Viagra?
*  Like if it's to get make your dick hard Viagra definitely works. Oh, it's not even that he goes
*  A lot of it is a status thing
*  It's like so if you are a really wealthy Chinese businessman and you're into this kind of stuff
*  Like you want to show that you skirt the laws of right animal track shark fin soup
*  Right, like isn't that apparently that tastes good, but I'm saying that's isn't that something where there's like some type of probe
*  It's restriction against it and then they're like, yeah, but I'm a yeah, I'm the man. So yeah
*  Yeah, I think I don't know what kind of restrictions they have about that in China, but across the world rhinos
*  But they want that tea that they make out of rhino horn because it just makes me like come
*  Let's discuss business over a rhino tea. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I get why that happens, but I don't want any
*  China's so weird right because it's a weird combination of capitalism and
*  Communism yeah, and not just comment but a military
*  communist dictatorship, it's interesting, you know speaking of like the virus the way
*  The way China locked down Wuhan. Yeah when they decided to
*  There's no fucking around. Yeah, no fucking around 11 million people in that city went through the streets spraying
*  Some distant sent it
*  40,000 workers to Wuhan to be like handle this lock it down clean it up
*  Yeah, just boom in one city and they what's it like now?
*  There it's there. Well, here's the thing you can never trust
*  Yeah, what the state government, you know, the state media says but they were saying that all their new cases are inbound
*  So it's travelers coming in. Oh how convenient it's all these fucking Italians. Yeah coming over here
*  For sharks fin soup and rhino tea fucking pasta virus cunts. Yeah, it's the rigatoni virus now
*  It is you guys did it. Well, they're saying that America could be the next epicenter
*  Yeah, well New York is has more than 5% of the world's cases right now. Does it really? Yeah, it's growing too
*  Well, New York has 25,000 cases as of this morning. That's 5% of the world's cases
*  That's what that's what the news was last night
*  They say that for every one person to test positive 10 of them have not even been tested that have it
*  Yeah, there's there's for sure way more cases. Yeah, because it's impossible to get a test. I can't test them
*  Yeah, yeah, try try getting a test right now in LA
*  LA had they started a website yesterday with all the information how to get a test and they're like first of all meet this criteria
*  Are you over 65? I mean is that really yeah part of it? Yeah, Jesus
*  Do you have these symptoms? You can't even order one online
*  If you could get a test going right now, you could be a great business. It would be Jeff Bezos
*  And it would be a great way to like, you know figure out
*  Who needs to really be staying home?
*  Did you see the story of the senators that were in a closed-door meeting in January about coronavirus?
*  They just dumped all their stock. Yeah. Yeah, fur
*  Luffler whatever name is yeah
*  Like that's not what happened dude. You had that is the definition of insider trading. That's what they prosecute
*  But what's happening to them? Nothing?
*  nothing
*  Yeah, what's up, Jamie?
*  Stuff's happening. I guess just isn't happening immediately. Yeah, what is happening?
*  I see you said that there might be looking into it. Oh, they might well, I'm trying to get I might be looking into that murder
*  Mmm, I might be he's the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Yeah, yeah and dumped all stock. Yep
*  Oh, they issued a sharp warning. Oh a sharp one sharp warning. Stop don't do that again
*  What are you supposed to do if you know that you're gonna lose all that money? It's a good question
*  I think if you have that type of Intel you you're not allowed to profit
*  Not allowed to use that intelligence. That's not open to the public
*  So I think you have to wait till the it goes public
*  You know, I mean like once that goes public then you can act on it
*  otherwise, you know the virus is already public the virus is public, but I think the the
*  Scale. Yeah, the magnitude of the impact. Yeah
*  Estimate what's gonna happen when a closed-door meeting is like hey, it's about to go down and then you go call my broker
*  Hey, man, it really is a movie. Yeah, you really have some kind of crazy virus thrillers
*  It is dude. This is I mean like I was said it to you
*  We don't have anybody we can call him be like you remember when this happened in your life. No, nobody does nobody does. Yeah
*  Nobody does Bert was saying that he thinks that in 2009 he had h1n1
*  Made sense. He said he said he was so sick. Yeah, he said he's never been more sick in his life
*  He said he couldn't get comfortable. Oh, and somebody knew had actually verified the deal. Yeah. Yeah, and
*  That killed a lot of fucking people much more lethal. Yeah much more. Isn't it interesting? Like how'd they lock that down?
*  I don't know it never spread really. I think it's because you got it and if you're contagious, you knew it
*  Yeah, this is a highly contagious. Yeah, and
*  Again, the big problem is we don't know how many people have it and then you have these asymptomatic people
*  How many people died from h1n1 in 2009?
*  50,000 in America people that's not that much. No, but I believe it or not known about right
*  But well the thing about
*  The flu every year can kill as many as 90,000 people in America a lot. Yeah
*  Yeah, and we never talked about it ever. No, this says 2009
*  Flu pandemic killed 18,000 people. Hmm
*  18,000 people
*  Go ahead good be yeah, I think the the biggest
*  That I remember reading was 91,000 one year one year 91,000 people died from the flu. I'm not sure if that's
*  the United States or North America
*  The whole thing is kind of crazy it's it's interesting that Ron Paul was calling this a hoax before you've seen, you know
*  Just a hundred people have died in America and they're using this to take away your civil liberties and then his son got it
*  Did get it his son did get it afterwards and then Nancy Pelosi's
*  daughter
*  tweeted
*  That ran Paul's neighbor was right
*  The neighbor that attacked him like what he has also what does it mean you from that attack?
*  Yeah, he's got a piece of his lung removed right
*  the guy tackled him broke five of his ribs and they had to remove a piece of his lung and
*  So Nancy Pelosi's daughter says that the neighbor was right. Like what does it mean? The neighbors, right?
*  Look, so because he the guy got sick the neighbor's right to attack him like two days ago
*  His Twitter account for probably his team tweeted out that he was feeling fine was asymptomatic
*  And was not aware of any direct contact with anyone that had it
*  They don't know how he got it so he hasn't he's just
*  How do they test these people they're testing these people?
*  You know when you hear about these people getting tested and they don't even have any symptoms
*  Like how are they getting tested and why are they getting tested when some people are really sick?
*  So I've been a question that too
*  I think there's a way up you can get a private doctor that maybe you can get access to a test a private
*  You can pay extra money to get a hold of the test really I think I don't know and I don't know if that's the difference
*  Between people just showing up at a doctor and just saying hey, I think I'm sick. Can you please find a test for me?
*  They're like, I don't know where you want us to find one. We don't have access to that. We have we're busy
*  Versus I don't know. I'm just guessing the weirdest thing about it to me is the asymptomatic
*  Aspect of it that some people don't experience anything and other people get really fucking sick
*  It's almost like if you wanted a disease it spreads
*  You have it I mean have that have one where like
*  50% of the people don't even feel anything and they just spread it to 50 more people or a hundred more people or thousands more people
*  It's weird man. It just doesn't make sense like a normal thing makes sense, you know
*  Because we haven't experienced this one particular virus before we don't really don't know
*  Anything about how it's gonna end where it's gonna go and then there's the possibility that it could morph
*  And that it could you know be more contagious or more deadly or more this or more that
*  apparently some people who have
*  Tested positive for though are contributing and they're they're extracting antibodies from these people people that have gotten over it
*  But it's still gonna be the estimations are six months to a year before they come up with a vaccine
*  I've seen rumblings of the false positives online
*  Bubble up too much, but I think that happens all the time false positives with all kinds of diseases
*  What do you got there fella hand sanitizer? Of course. Yes
*  Everything spray it spray it baby pharmacist told me the other day that I don't know
*  This is bullshit. The pharmacist told me that it's not effective unless you have it actually dry
*  On your hand like when people go like that. He's like you got to actually
*  Have really alcohol dry pharmacist told you this. Mm-hmm
*  People I mean, I don't know, you know, I don't know if he's some fucking lunatic, but that's what he said makes sense
*  Yeah, he's like, it's not he goes people like put it on and then just he's like no
*  No, you got to actually rub it all the way in
*  What is life gonna be like when this is done? That's just gonna be weird
*  What is life gonna be like we're gonna be paranoid now. I'm someone weird Al Yankovic tweeted. Everyone is Howie Mandel now. I
*  mean, that's not there's this is gonna I do think it's gonna spur this whole generation of
*  Super germophobes like oh, yeah, especially like a kid. It was thinking about you know
*  I said my kids are too young to recognize what's going on. They don't know what's going on. But any kid that's you know
*  their grandma dies, yeah, or just is like I would say between ages 6 and
*  13 that child like, you know growing up age and you go like schools. I'm not going to school anymore. Things are shut down
*  We can't go to restaurants. Don't go to the movies. Everything's different
*  Lot of those kids are gonna grow up super anxious. Yeah and weirded out by this. Yeah scared to travel
*  Yeah, yeah like traveling. I think I personally never hesitate about any germ stuff
*  I'm not built like that, but I have thought about getting back on fucking planes. Oh, my god, we circulated air
*  Nothing to do about it. Nothing you can do man. Yeah
*  Anti-vax people gonna do
*  What are they gonna do was they don't even want to take a vaccine?
*  What if they come up with a vaccine for this shit? You have to ask people are the dumbest of all
*  They're so fucking stupid. Do you have Eddie's number? Do you want me to text him? Is he one of those two?
*  I know he's like it's so stupid. I mean, that's really it. It's moronic
*  Yeah, people get mad at you. I know they're suggesting that there's something wrong with being an anti-vaxxer
*  Stupid you dumb you don't I mean just look at them the research
*  The evidence is all there it saves lives research is all brought to you by the mainstream media
*  Don't you understand how it works? Sorry. Yeah, why don't you go call Tom Hanks? Yeah, you show up one of those meetings
*  I bet he believes in vaccinations
*  mmm
*  Betty does now
*  What do they do what did what does an anti-vax person do about coronavirus if they prove if they come out and they go we have
*  The vaccination now. Yeah, I mean, I don't know pin them down fucking jab it in their neck
*  I
*  Totalitarian
*  big fan well one of the things that
*  Putin is doing go to Roy Jones jr. Is Instagram page because Roy Jones jr. Is a I don't know if you know this
*  We're just a big Putin fan and does not know that actually has a Russia passport. What? Yes
*  He's a Russian citizen. Roy Jones jr. Roy Jones jr. Must've gone someone else sweet sweet sweet
*  Russian
*  I bet it's the best I bet what they honeypot you with is just the best. I bet it's like a fist
*  Jesus
*  Am I looking for he isn't right Jones jr. Instagram page
*  No Instagram and his Instagram page has a coal of Florida one of the greatest boxes of all time, but
*  Not really well read in terms of totalitarian governments and
*  Consequences of this oh
*  They're threatening to lock people here goes you have to choose between staying home for 15 days or prison for five years
*  And then Roy Jones writes simple crisp and clear and that's how you fix stuff give options a or b simple gotta love it
*  um I
*  Don't know if you gotta love that that's
*  Yeah
*  Is that how they're handling it there, I don't know it might be bullshit might just be a meme
*  Yeah, but I think he's just pro Putin. Yeah, Putin hooks him up. Yeah, it's all mean pictures of him hanging out with Putin
*  Putin comes to his fights like signal fighting over there. It's the gals. He likes to go all over there, too
*  Oh, yeah, right their buddies all that whole region loves to go. He loves them back
*  I think he's got a I think he's got a Russian citizenship as well. He does too. Yeah
*  He had an SEC violation
*  recently for insider trading
*  He didn't disclose that somebody that he was a bit coursing
*  But yeah, he was didn't disclose that they were compensating him and I guess that's an SEC
*  So let me ask you this while you're on this where we're all on this hiatus
*  How are you practicing your Spanish? Are you just practicing it by doing your podcasts?
*  Yeah doing the podcast talking to people the best thing you can do
*  I mean I try to do it the podcast I try to do it once every couple weeks
*  but it's by the best thing to do if you're ever trying to like get better at any language is
*  Immersion and it's forcing yourself to have conversations
*  You have to talk you have to actually even if doesn't even matter if you're new at it or you're pretty fluent at it
*  You have to talk and have you call your mom have conversations with my mom my cousins the the tutor
*  Friends Richard via is a comedian
*  Friend of mine speaks fluent Spanish
*  Francisco Ramos
*  Yeah
*  Fabricio Copano, yeah Francisco Ramos Jesus. Yeah, those guys all fluent
*  Speakers. Yeah any conversation you can have is gonna help you, you know
*  Maintain it or get better at it
*  So when the when you get back on the road is the number one priority the Spanish special
*  Get you get the Spanish special rolling or is it just get your feet back on do you I think it's good
*  Yeah, because I mean I was at
*  That last show I did March 11th was 20 minutes of new English material for like, you know
*  My stand-up right and so I was like feeling pretty good about that that I had like 20 new, you know
*  And you and so I was gonna go into like a bunch of work. I feel like I would have had
*  Ten more by now by now. Yeah, ten a month is doable. It's doable if you're working
*  So, yeah, I mean I I've been balancing both
*  I did that 20 new while I was working on the Spanish some stuff
*  so it's gonna be to go try to get back to both men just doing the Spanish stuff and
*  Getting my my regular English set isn't it be weird to do set the first time. It's gonna be real weird strange
*  It's also it seems to me that we we have this
*  Idea that things can't change so we have to go back to the way they were right we have to it's gonna
*  It's gonna be that way again
*  We're we're all
*  We're all comedy junkies. Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's a I mean I've said this many times before but it's true
*  I feel bad for people who've never killed they don't know what that feels like right?
*  I don't know what it feels. I thought for a second like you meant killed a person. No, I was like
*  No, I know I was like I feel bad for someone who's never rocked a house
*  Yeah, you don't know what that's like to crush. I think too, you know what the perspective changes for them. You ever have a friend
*  Watch from the wings. Yes, so they they then they always it always feels different. They're like that's what you right feel up there
*  Yeah, cuz they they get to actually sense that yeah, you know now I'm remembering
*  When I came to see you I was so
*  Exhausted I remember that I fell asleep in your dressing room. I'm like man. I'm not doing so good
*  And then I was thinking about this coronavirus shit. I'm like I better get back to the hotel
*  Yeah, and I crashed so hard I slept for like 10 hours that night, which is that's not normal for you, right?
*  It's so weird. Yeah, I was watching I was like goddamn
*  I gotta sit down and I went to your your dressing room for a second
*  I took a leak sat down on the couch and I was not now I was hanging out with Jamie and I was like
*  I think I need to go back to the room. Yeah, like I'm hurting
*  Maybe I was fighting something off. Maybe man
*  Maybe but that's gonna be everybody from now to the end
*  I think I might have had it for a day or two. Yeah, but my immune system is amazing and I shook it off. Yeah
*  This it's so weird that some people get it and some people don't there's nothing like this. There's nothing like this man
*  Well, um, so I guess we just keep doing this we just keep doing podcasts
*  I'm really pumping them out as long as we can our social distancing and wash our hands and stuff
*  And I'm not touching my face at all. No, I
*  Don't think
*  it's one of those things that you just
*  Start doing you don't even realize you're doing it even on those announcements
*  The doctor lady licked her finger like your finger and the other guy scratched his face
*  I mean, they're all touching their face, but when she licked her finger right after she said it's like what are you doing maniac?
*  Yeah, of course. What you what what when was that when she licked her finger? It was about 10 days ago
*  Yeah, it was only 10 days ago when she did that. Yeah, that was about 10 days today the 24th
*  Yeah
*  What's that three weeks ago when she did that yeah Wow
*  Time is moving fast. Yeah, you can go the other thing is strange is that
*  You consume the media, you know, like the news of it and oh my god what's going on
*  And then you can walk down a street or drive down the street forget that you know
*  I mean like there's this sense of yeah
*  Well, so I talked to another
*  cousin of mine's a doctor and she's like, oh I
*  Yeah, I don't I don't turn any of it on I just
*  Get it out of I already know
*  Like what's happening? So I just choose not to have be bombarded by it. Yeah, you can be bombarded
*  Yeah, you know and it also shifts your your view of the world
*  So it can heighten your anxiety and your paranoia like people were anxious already people already have anxiety issues
*  They must be a fucking wreck right now. Absolutely because they they're like, oh my god, I was right. The world is ending
*  There's a mandatory lockdown across the entire country. So Montana
*  It's weird to to have this going on honestly and promote
*  You know, I'm special like I'd like there but there's so many people at home. There's so many people at home
*  I mean, I look I understand the whole marketing of and how that works
*  But you're just like, you know, you're on these calls and they're like tell us by getting special
*  Isn't it crazy? There's a pandemic. So why don't you guys shoot it? Yeah, what do you mean by ball hog?
*  And why do you have all those porn hub girls? They're saying ball hog. Yeah, did you get those girls to say that?
*  Are they already saying ball? They're already saying it the you're talking about my stories. Yeah. Yeah, they were ready
*  That that's where I got the title
*  I was on the road. I was J and my D. Whoo, and I saw I saw a nice lady
*  Doing
*  Really extensive stuff to this guy's balls, right?
*  And I was like, I wonder if there's a whole sub genre dedicated to this, you know
*  So I typed it in and they're like you might enjoy ball hogs
*  So in that
*  Feature these ladies they introduced themselves and they go and I'm a ball hog
*  So they all do it and they really work on guys balls like hardcore really intense. And so in the special I
*  at one point just reference I
*  Not that film but I just tell people that that their mothers are ball hogs and then
*  And then I think I think though you're really good at this by the way picking titles
*  I think it's one of the hardest things, you know
*  You're like you're doing your edit and you just want your show together and then we're gonna call it
*  I don't fucking know live from here. It's just the worst but yeah, you've had good ones
*  But anyways, I was going back and forth with different titles and it was suggested actually Josh my manager
*  And I just smiled ear to ear and I was like, yes
*  It was settled at that point. What was your tour named take it down? Oh, yeah, you can't call it take it down
*  You can't call it take it down. No, I mean you could but no no you can't
*  Ball hogs better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny when you call it tour one thing and then you call the special
*  I know and people were like you should call it take it down
*  I'm like, yeah, but they they don't want it to be called take it down
*  Yeah, they don't Netflix isn't like do you it'd be great if you call this take it down
*  Boggs perfect. Yeah. Yeah, and plus it has that other meaning too. Yeah selfish sharing. Yeah. Yeah
*  Has a couple layers to it
*  Yeah naming it and then what don't you get that feeling too when it's over?
*  That's just like I just needed another couple months always always dude
*  So we shot at the at Austin City Limits great place beautiful amazing venue
*  The next day I had to move venues because we would have shot the next day as well
*  The next day we had to we stayed in Austin and we did two more shows at the Paramount
*  So if if we had had the opportunity
*  I just would have stayed and done because you guys started doing I love it the four-show. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, I would have done it. I would have done it. You just didn't have the venue
*  I'm like we can't we can't do it
*  So you just did one night two shows one night two shows and the next night switched
*  Yeah, but but the next night you feel even looser. That's what I'm saying. Yes. I forgot my train of thought the next night
*  You have the relief of like I shot it and then like this joke taking it here fun
*  Mm-hmm. You're like I wish there was a way you could make yourself do that
*  I know well the way you can is by doing four shows
*  Yeah, that's that changed everything for me when I started doing four shows
*  It made all shows be like a show mm-hmm and like when I did Boston a lot when I did Strange Times
*  The first show was where most of this shit came from
*  I only had a couple of bits that I didn't do earlier that I did that I had a sandwich in there
*  But most of the set was from the first show because I was so loose through the next night. I added a line
*  To one of the kind of like table setting jokes
*  Yeah, and it just fucking crushed so hard that
*  That I take I took it out of special I took the joke I go I got it I got a keep this joke so
*  I was like I'm I'll sell it I can use it again. Well, that's good that you can do that. Yeah, that's good
*  I had to trim down to
*  Fucking haunt you it makes you hate yourself
*  You should almost tape twice tape and then tape again in four months. I know it would change everything
*  Yeah, tape tape again in a month a month a month enough time. Yes
*  Yeah film and then film again and then watch that in between
*  Yeah, like just be such a gangster that you're gonna pay double double taping money
*  Especially today with all this fucking quarantine money. Oh my god
*  If Netflix paid you per view, oh my you can't cash it in right now son
*  I know and then what'll happen is I'll go to negotiate next time and I'll be like these views were pretty
*  They'll be like that wasn't real was quarantine views. You're a corona comic
*  Yeah, there's a they're throttling internet now, yeah, cuz so many people are online
*  That's that's what they're really concerned about New York City because like New York City hasn't even hit its peak yet
*  I think the peak is within two to three weeks. Mm-hmm
*  So the cases you're experiencing now, that's not even peak
*  So in two to three weeks, there's gonna be even more people at home
*  Taxing these the structure of you know, all the services whether it's electricity or there it's internet everything
*  All the underlying things that you use you take for granted
*  Because they don't never max capacity at this right never well never that's what's up with cell phones
*  Whenever there's an emergency and you can't make a phone call because everyone's on their phone
*  Yeah, and then you realize like what are you selling?
*  You're selling phones where everybody can use the phone, but you can't all use the phone at once
*  You're planning your your whole the way your structure is set up
*  It's only set up for a certain amount of people use it at the same time even though you sold
*  300 million cell phones. Yeah, you can't really use them all at once. Well, it's busy right now infrastructure sucks. Yeah, that's true
*  That's true. They sell whack-ass fucking half-baked infrastructure. Yeah
*  Yeah, and you don't realize it until something like this happens. You're like, oh
*  There's not room for all of us. Yeah
*  Well the last apocalypse you and I experienced we went to a nice hotel
*  That's right during the fire and we stayed in the same hotel. No, let's leave together
*  I'll leave together with you where you want to go. We got to go somewhere Colorado
*  Get a ranch Colorado be dope. What about some more really hot hot hot?
*  Is that better? I think so Arizona. I've told I was told I know there's like a theory in it
*  But like that the viruses thrive more in the cold setting
*  Yeah, that is a theory. I don't know if it's factual
*  Hmm, I think the virus just needs hosts. What about like Fiji?
*  You know, I mean to he has been they fucking steal your money
*  Do you mean go to some weird whack-ass foreign government? You can't keep your money over there that there's no corona in Papua New Guinea
*  Right now you don't think so because they're all eating brains
*  They're eating cannibals. They were telling that one of the guys told me he had a when I was in Australia like a month ago
*  He's or two months ago. He goes
*  I was working there on some construction thing and he goes you don't leave
*  The area that they tell you because you know things get crazy and lawless if you venture out
*  Somebody you know could fuck you up. No one will ever know have you ever heard the semen warriors from Papua New Guinea? Mm-hmm
*  Prepare yourself for this story
*  There's a tribe
*  Where when boys are young they take them out of the tribe and they they teach them that in order for them to fully grow
*  They must ingest semen
*  Anally and through the mouth and so they they fuck these boys make these boys suck dick
*  all all their life
*  Until they grow full, you know full size and then they they turn around and do it to young boys
*  The semen warriors of Papua New Guinea see like semen come
*  Yeah, and they have these names like anal father and an anal son and yeah, and the way they refer to it
*  It's like it but it's a like some petto
*  Like at one point in time started this sounds like in order for you to grow you gotta suck my cock
*  I'm like, well, I want to be big and strong when I grow. Yeah, literally
*  There's a there's a whole tribe that operates under that principle
*  All right, and people have visited them I think they're cannibals as well
*  There's a lot of cannibalism going on down there. It's a nice ribbon on the day, you know that
*  What is it called?
*  Krutzfeldt-Jakob disease same thing as mad cow except for me. It's a pro. It's a prion disease the same
*  prions are
*  it's it's a type of
*  Encephalitis, I think it's a type of
*  Encephalopathy it's I forget it's not like a virus and it's not bacteria
*  it's in its own category, but it is a it's a disease that
*  affects cannibals and
*  The way they got it to cows is and I might be if you're a biologist. I'm so sorry
*  I'm fucking this up. I know I am
*  Cows got it from them serving cows cow brains
*  So mad cow disease the origin of that was they would grind up these cows and the parts they didn't use and feed it to cows
*  Because it's protein. Well, you would give these cows as cannibal disease that also exists in Papua New Guinea in these cannibals
*  oh my god cannibals get this disease and
*  These prions they they can survive like thousands of degrees in temperature for hours
*  they've
*  done
*  experiments on people human beings that had mad cow disease and the
*  Instruments they used to operate on them
*  They ran them through these sterilization cycles two three times and the the prions were still alive. What? Yeah
*  Yeah
*  They're literally almost impossible to kill and there's a version of it that it's making its way through deer populations right now
*  It's called chronic wasting disease
*  Chronic wasting disease is also a prion disease and it has not made the jump yet
*  That's from deer eating deer or
*  No, they don't know what caused that pre on disease, but it is a prion disease
*  They don't think it's necessarily from deer eating deer
*  What was the tribe that was in the news like I want to say in the last 12 16 months where they have no
*  Contact, you know what the ice no sentinel island. Yes, that's I have a whole bit about that
*  You see my bit no and this is like the guy who was like I'm here
*  Save you
*  Them up and then the Indian is it the Indian government's like we don't fuck with yes
*  It's like the middle of the Indian Ocean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a few places like that real
*  uncontacted tribes and another one is there's a couple of them still left in the Amazon and
*  The problem the ones the Amazon is these people have land and they try to protect these people because you know, the land is valuable
*  Yeah, and so then they you know people from these
*  Either mining companies or oil companies they'll go in and kill these people fuck
*  Yeah, cuz they're like fuck you we're taking your land. This is a real issue with that in the Amazon where they'll go and assassinate
*  What's the Sentinel? What's it called the North Sentinel Island North Sentinel?
*  Yeah, middle the Indian Ocean direct descendants of people left Africa 60,000 years ago. Holy shit. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's one of the most
*  Uncontacted places but they've all been contacted everyone's been slightly contacted at least historically
*  But that one is a particularly weird one. I don't think they're cannibals, but they might be
*  But the the ones in New Guinea are yeah, you should Google semen warriors of Papua New Guinea
*  That's gonna be what I read about tonight. Yeah. All right
*  Ball-hawg, it's on Netflix right now. Go get it. It's fucking awesome
*  I didn't see the special but I definitely saw you murder with that material. Thanks, man. It was great to say
