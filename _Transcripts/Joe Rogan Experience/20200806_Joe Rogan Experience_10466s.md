# Joe Rogan Experience #1521 - Josh Dubin & Jason Flom
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trh7YWo2Bmo)
*  Do
*  Josh Jason, thank you. Thanks for being here. Try to keep this sucker like a fist from your face
*  Gentlemen, what's happening? How are you? Thanks for having us. Happy to be here. My pleasure my pleasure
*  Let's let's just start this off. Just tell everybody what you guys are here for and what you do. Okay. Well
*  We do a lot of things you do a lot. Yeah, I do
*  Shout out to Andre ward for introducing us. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely
*  one of my one of my best friends and actually personal heroes, but
*  So Jason I both work at the innocence project
*  I'm the I'm the ambassador the innocence ambassador of the innocence project in New York and
*  We're here to get the word out about wrongful convictions
*  We have a podcast Jason has had a long successful podcast called wrongful conviction with Jason Flom
*  I'm the host of a new spin-off of that called wrongful conviction junk science
*  Which examines all of these disciplines of forensic sciences that have been proven
*  To be total bullshit total junk is the name would suggest. Let's get to that. I want to hear what those are but
*  Jason can you just tell everybody what you're originally in the record business? Yeah. Thanks for bringing that up
*  I've been in music business since I was 18 years old. So I've signed acts over the years
*  I said record business because I'm old. Yeah
*  Yeah, I still call it that too. You've been in the a track game for a while. It sounds nostalgic a little bit
*  Miss those vinyl discs a little bit
*  Yeah, they used to be able to clean your weed on and everything else on the album covers
*  But yeah, I've been in the music business
*  I was 18 so I've signed acts over the years everybody from Stone Temple Pilots and skid Row all the way tori Amos and Katy Perry
*  and Kid Rock and more recently Greta Van Fleet and
*  Lord and you know, it's been an amazing run at various times
*  I was chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records Virgin Records Capital Records, but my calling in life has been
*  Eliminating mandatory sentencing
*  Decriminalizing drugs
*  Basically getting people out of prison that don't belong there and reversing mass incarceration
*  Which I believe to be the worst failed social policy disaster since slavery and it's really just an extension of slavery
*  So I really appreciate you having us here and I can't wait to tell you the story of how we first met
*  But I love that you're doing this I just before before we even get started
*  This makes me excited when when successful people go out of their way to do something like this where it's just good
*  You know, you're just trying to right wrongs and I couldn't agree with you more
*  I mean the the war on drugs is one of the most disgusting and in confusing aspects of our enlightened culture
*  It's just it's it's infuriating that we have a gigantic percentage of people that are in prison for
*  Nonviolent drug offense offenses and then a lot of them are wrongly in prison. There's that and Joe
*  Do you know how many people are still?
*  Annually locked up for possession of marijuana in this country how many almost seven hundred thousand last year like that's
*  For possession of pot is legal people making tons of money on it. I mean I have to tell you you know
*  Yeah, you don't tell me I'm a pothead. Yeah, it's it's it's outrageous
*  It's it doesn't make any sense and it's the slowest battleship to turn
*  You know in terms of the way our culture deals with it and handles it
*  We all we all know that it doesn't kill anybody
*  We all know that look I got a fucking bottle of whiskey right here. This isn't illegal
*  How come I could drink this and die like this in my hand if I drank that I'd be dead
*  Right or close to it. Yeah, you know what you know, what's crazy is that when you said?
*  Thank you, and you like when successful people do this when you said that I almost felt like I
*  Don't know the right way to articulate it
*  I never feel like I'm doing enough because there's so much bad shit happening to people and
*  You know, I remember reading this book called inside Rikers
*  I forget the author's name Jennifer when but she did this study of of the population of
*  Incarcerated people at Rikers Island and
*  How such a large percentage of them were in there for petty drug crimes and the recidivism was all about
*  People that had drug and alcohol problems and makes up over 90% of the population at Rikers Island and she had a revolutionary idea
*  Right. She said what if we start a program?
*  And give them vocational training and put them in jobs and the recidivism rate and her program called fresh start
*  dropped to almost zero point three percent and it just shows you that the you know, I'm the first episode of my my podcast
*  There was a great quote and I'm a sucker for quotes from the guy that I interviewed
*  He's an attorney at the innocence project named Chris Faber Connie said that the justice system is an efficient
*  Eating and killing machine for poor people of color and Rikers Island is the best example of that
*  I mean right that that sentence chills down your spine to hear it put that way but that that's exactly what it is
*  What's so succinct?
*  Yeah, and that and my calling and Jason's calling sort of collided
*  We both work at the innocence project and we have sort of I don't know
*  We've merged embryos and we have been we've we've been trying to be modern-day Robin Hood
*  So thank you so much for my pleasure
*  This is one of my favorite kind of podcast a podcast where I think we could actually do some good
*  And we can we can get the word out about this stuff Jason. How did you get started doing this? Oh, thanks for asking
*  I um, it's it's kind of crazy serendipitous occurrence that happened in the early 90s
*  I was on my way to play tennis
*  I just played tennis and I wanted a newspaper to read in the in the taxi ride
*  And usually I would buy the Times but it was sold out. So I happen to pick up the post and there was a story
*  Cuomo bid I sorry Ferraro bid for
*  Cocaine kid, right? So the story of course I read this I was fascinated by you know drugs and stuff and
*  The story was about a kid named Stephen Lennon who had been
*  Sentenced to 15 years of life for a nonviolent first defense cocaine possession charge in New York State and just in case people think they might
*  Be that might be misstating that that was a nonviolent first defense cocaine possession charge in New York State 15 to life
*  15 to life, right? So what year was this? This was 92 or three
*  And well, no he was sentenced in the 80s
*  So he had been in for eight years already and the reason it was in the newspaper was because his mother
*  Shirley Lennon was her name had been trying to get clemency from Governor Mario Cuomo Andrew Cuomo's father, of course
*  and for you New Yorkers out there remember that and
*  She had gotten letters from the sentencing judge from the warden and even Geraldine
*  Ferraro had written a letter on behalf of this kid, you know
*  Who had a you know good record in prison and everything else and it had been turned down
*  So that's why I made the newspaper and I've had this and my whole sense of fairness and equity and everything just got thrown
*  Completely out of whack. I was like, I don't understand
*  Like I kept rereading it and going this doesn't make any sense
*  Nonviolent first offense like that could be anybody right wrong place wrong time kind of thing and
*  I decided I wanted to do something about it
*  So I only knew one criminal defense lawyer back in those days and there's a guy named Bob Kalina
*  He represented Stone Temple pilots and skid row who both were artists that I had signed and so I had him on speed dial
*  Cuz you know, they were getting arrested a lot in those days and like weekly
*  So Bob agreed to take the case pro bono and long story short, even though he said it was hopeless
*  six months later, we ended up in a courtroom in Malone, New York and
*  I sat there holding mrs
*  Lennon's hand the woman I originally spoke to Shirley Lennon who was in the story her husband Stan was on the other side of her
*  And they brought the kid in in shackles like he was Manson or something right leg irons
*  I was like, this is all new to me. I'm just like what the hell and
*  You know skinny guy with glasses whatever and the judge looked like Ted Forsythe. I thought we're screwed, right?
*  There's no way this guy's gonna he's an old guy with white hair and
*  The arguments went back and forth. I knew nothing about what was going on. And finally judge says
*  Blah blah blah blah, whatever he said he goes the motion is granted
*  He bangs the gavel down and Bob comes running over. I go Bob, which has happened. He goes we won
*  I go we won get the fuck out of here. We won. He's like we won. I was like, holy shit
*  That's incredible. And it was the best feeling I'd ever had and they sent the kid home
*  He had served nine years, but he had six to go before his
*  parole his first eligible parole and
*  And that's I was hooked, you know, so I did a little research just to make it just bring it to a close
*  I found about an organization called families against mandatory minimums
*  FAA mm org which had just started and I joined their board and then soon after that
*  I found out about the work of the innocence project and I marched in and just offered my services for whatever they needed and
*  And that's how it started. I started in a similar. I got hooked in a similar way. I
*  Mean, I didn't want to cut you off. No, no, no, no, I mean I
*  So I'm trying to remember the year but it was so it was about 18 years ago my my
*  I got a phone call and
*  I was only 27 28. I'm only 45 only that makes me feel good
*  But I got a phone call and it was like hey Josh, this is Barry Shack
*  I need your help on something and you give me a call back now. I thought it was my brother
*  Pranking me because when I was in college, we used to watch the OJ Simpson trial and
*  We used to think he was fucking great. He was hysterical. He was like this
*  Dynamo like this this tornado of action that you know, it's just like everybody was watching them. I'm trying to remember Barry Shack
*  He's a he's the thing. He's the the little Jewish guy that said how about that?
*  Mr. Fung at the OJ trial was like the big moment at the OJ trial where he was undermining all of the DNA
*  And he found the innocence project
*  That guy yes, he and Peter Newfeld founded it. Yeah, they founded it together. Yeah, I almost got myself into trouble
*  So that's Barry Shack. So I didn't return the call because I thought it was my brother fucking with me
*  So I then got a call from a real famous civil rights lawyer named Jerry left court who said he said what the fuck is wrong
*  With you, I refer you to Barry Shack and you don't return his phone call
*  so I said, oh my god, so I called him and at the time I was
*  you know a
*  Alleged expert in jury selection
*  so I was getting passed around this circle of criminal defense lawyers and I had to lie about my age a lot because I was
*  2728 and I was you know regarded as an expert in jury selection and people would see me and be like
*  Fuck am I gonna take advice from this young kid? So I went and met with Barry Shack and he had this case
*  where this guy was
*  Like literally brutalized
*  He is named Christopher Ochoa in Austin, Texas
*  And he gets implicated in this murder at a Pizza Hut and he's accused of
*  raping and his friend is accused of raping and murdering this
*  employee at a Pizza Hut
*  He had nothing to do with it
*  his friend had nothing to do with it and he was a vulnerable kid and they took him in an interrogation room and they
*  beat a confession out of him and
*  I was so horrified. I was so perplexed that this could happen in our country and what happened to him was
*  They threw things at him. They threatened him with prison rape
*  They did everything that you hear about happening in an interrogation room to him until he finally just said
*  what a lot of people say which is okay, I'll tell you what you want to hear just to get out of the room and
*  He spent you know 13 plus years in prison for a rape and murder he didn't commit
*  He implicated his friend his life was ruined and I said, you know what?
*  I can't do anything else with my life if I don't commit it to this and that was it. I was hooked Wow
*  Yeah, I mean I hate injustice in any form
*  It just have a visceral reaction to it and I hate it and when it's in a form of bullying even more
*  You know as a kid my brother was a victim of terrible bullying
*  I think we all have been at some stage, but he was really and that really affected me a lot
*  And maybe that informed me. I think I learned a lot from my dad, too
*  My dad always taught me, you know about doing the right thing and I try to do that in my life
*  You know, but this is my way of giving back and it's extremely rewarding
*  I think anyone that's in this work with us would say the same thing that it's
*  The feeling that you get when you're able to have that impact on someone who's in a position through no fault of their own
*  That is the most dire circumstance anyone can find themselves in like some of Josh's clients or our clients sentenced to death
*  Julius Jones is one we're working on now, of course James Daly in Florida innocent on death row
*  It's like those words should never be in the same sentence together
*  Let's let's talk about how you know, they're innocent like with these these individual cases you're talking about here
*  How are you sure?
*  Like how do you know?
*  Well, so you know we could pick on any particular one and on my podcast wrongful conviction
*  We've covered a number of death penalty cases
*  and
*  You know this one Julius Jones for instance and Josh can speak about James Daly who we also just did a podcast on recently
*  Josh and I did it together
*  Which I thought was really powerful. I mean and again, he'll speak about that, but but Julius Jones
*  In this case the actual killer has confessed to note to numerous people the to numerous people like in law enforcement
*  No in prison
*  Who are strangers who came forward and admitted it? Okay who talked about it the description didn't match Julius the man
*  I'm sorry to cut you out, but the guy who's in prison who confessed is he in prison for life?
*  Does he have he's out he got out? Yeah
*  He did 15 years and Julius has been on death row for 21 and he's facing execution unless we're able to
*  Okay, so he confessed to people so you have an account that he confessed to other inmates
*  So other inmates have said that he confessed we have multiple accounts and we have Julius had alibis
*  He also was a student at Oklahoma
*  University he had you know, he had his whole life in front of him. He was a phenomenal athlete as well and
*  This was a kid who he had befriended in high school
*  Because the basketball coach asked him to because it was a troubled kid his friend and
*  This kid ended up, you know, as Julie says when you're a kid, you don't you know the company you keep you're not so careful
*  And he you know hung around them. The kid would stay at Julius's house sometimes and ultimately we know exactly what happened
*  There was a carjacking this this other young man went and carjacked a local prominent member of the community white guy
*  I think he was a church deacon as well as a businessman
*  And you know those cases get a lot of attention Oklahoma white victim
*  Killed in a carjacking black perpetrator, you know shit goes crazy and
*  He implicated Julius to get the attention off of him
*  He actually hid the gun in Julius's house and then brought the cops who went in it was hidden in the attic
*  And the cops went in came out with the gun like 30 45 seconds later
*  So they just magically had like radar to figure out where it was
*  No, the kid had told them where it was because he put it there and it gets worse from there this particular case
*  Joe was an all-white jury
*  Julius had a defense lawyer who basically mounted no defense on his behalf in a capital murder case and
*  The only was an all-white jury, but one of the jurors
*  This is probably gonna blow some people's minds
*  but
*  one of the jurors sent a note to the judge during jury deliberations and said that the other juror had used the n-word and
*  Said why don't we just take this?
*  I won't say the word out behind the courthouse shoot him and bury him back there and quit wasting our time with this stupid trial
*  Well, whatever I'm paraphrasing, but he used those words
*  So the other juror reported it to the judge and the judge allowed the juror to continue to stay on I mean
*  It gets worse from there. So the whole concept of a fair trial in this country, unfortunately
*  Is kind of a myth but I have a different answer to the question though
*  Go for it the question was how do you know they're innocent? Yeah, and well in this case it seems like you have a lot of evidence
*  Yeah, a lot of in see we it's interesting
*  we have a different perspective slightly different perspective because I'm an attorney that represents these guys and he's a justice advocate and
*  But he does get to know the facts of the case. But for me, you know, I have three young kids and
*  You know a lot of the crimes are rapes and murders that these guys are accused of which is why they get long prison sentences
*  At least the cases that I deal with for the innocence project and that I take on pro bono and
*  I'll give you two examples because I take it, you know, a lot of criminal defense lawyers say well
*  You're not supposed to ever ask the question as the person innocent to me. It does matter
*  and
*  I I had two cases where I demanded of myself and of the client that I really was convinced they were innocent and
*  What blows my mind is that science?
*  Is the truth to me good science DNA is the truth
*  So here we had a case and and this was one where I said well, I want to be convinced that he's innocent
*  So it's the case of this guy named Clemente Aguirre
*  And if I tell you this story you'll say you got to be making this shit up
*  It can't be true because the story from start to finish is is just mind-bending. He's a Honduran immigrant
*  he is escaping MS 13 in Honduras and
*  He wins like what it was like the Honduran version of the voice
*  Right American Idol American Idol
*  Honduran Idol, right Honduran Idol when he's young when he's in grade school
*  So the gang leaves him alone because he's kind of a novelty and he's nicknamed shorty
*  Because he's only 4 foot 11 as a grown person. He's in his early 20s and the violence is getting so bad
*  He said I gotta get the fuck out of here
*  They kill his front friend they kill his best friend and dump him in the street in front of him
*  So he flees to America and he does the whole circuitous route through Mexico or he gets tries to get a Mexican accent
*  He finds a coyote and he swims across the Rio Grande almost drowns
*  And then he's taken
*  I mean that whole story I could spend a half hour on he's put in a in an escape hatch of a car and driven around
*  the country till he finally lands in Sanford, Florida, right and
*  Sanford, Florida is where the Trayvon Martin trial happened and I end up in front of the same judge
*  That presided originally over the Trayvon Martin trial. So Clemente is accused. He gets to Sanford, Florida on a Saturday
*  He begins working at a golf course on a Monday
*  climbing trees and cutting down branches
*  one of the golf
*  Members says I like this kid's work ethic you want to come work at my restaurant
*  He goes and begins working at the restaurant. He lives in a trailer in the back of a trailer
*  no shit on vagabond way and
*  He's got neighbors who are three generations of poor white trash
*  It's a grandmother a mother and a daughter and he's like a novelty. They call him little Mexico. He's not even from Mexico
*  He can't speak English and he used to go and do coke with the daughter
*  Smoke weed drink and it was like a outdoor dorm, you know, they would go to his
*  Trailer he would go to hers. It was like their doors were always unlocked
*  He's out one day partying with his friends. He does coke he comes home and it's like five in the morning and
*  He wants a beer because he wants to try to come down
*  So he waits till the Sun comes up and he goes to knock on their door and he sees a bloody shoulder
*  blocking the door and he goes to push it open and the mother has stabbed 129 times and
*  He bends down
*  He was no stranger to seeing violence
*  he bends down to check her and the dog starts barking and hears noise and he picks up he sees a butcher knife
*  Bloody butcher knife sitting on a on a box and he picks it up and he screams in Spanish is anyone here
*  He then walks into the other room and he sees the grandmother
*  slumped over in her wheelchair and
*  He
*  Freaks out he goes he's about to call the police and he says wait a second. I'm a legal they'll never believe me
*  Can you imagine this shit on a cocaine bender?
*  So he leaves the trailer he runs back to his throws the knife in the grass
*  Takes his bloody clothes off his clothes are bloody because he picked up the mother and to check her pulse
*  Takes off his clothes throws him in a garbage bag puts him on top of his trailer
*  The boyfriend and the daughter slept out that night. All right, so the mother and the grandmother are dead
*  The daughter slept out that night
*  He and bear with me because this will this is like worth waiting for he
*  The police show up a couple of hours later because the boyfriend is sent by the daughter
*  The daughter says I have a weird feeling about my mother and grandmother
*  Can you go check on them and get my work clothes because she worked at the subway the sandwich shop?
*  So the boyfriend of the daughter discovers the dead bodies calls 9-1-1
*  The police come they come next door to Clementi's trailer and say did you hear anything last night? You know anything about this?
*  He says no, he's freaked out
*  He then goes to a friend's house and tells his friend what happened
*  He said I'm just gonna go back and tell the cops what happened. This is America, right?
*  And the friend says you don't know America. You need to get the fuck out of town
*  He says no, I'm going back. I'm gonna tell them he goes back walks over there and says tells him exactly what happened
*  They put him in handcuffs and they sit him down and they say listen, we know how you Latin guys are
*  You wanted sex from them, right?
*  He says are you out of your fucking mind?
*  No, I had nothing to do with this
*  PS long story short he gets tried
*  convicted and put on death row in Florida
*  The crime scene analysts sat on their hands and knees for days in the stinking Florida heat and
*  scraping blood swabs in the trailer, okay
*  151 blood swabs and what they're swabbing for is not the victim's blood. They know it's the victim's blood
*  This woman has been butchered a hundred and twenty nine times
*  The crime scene analysts in his case testified that we were swabbing for evidence of who the perpetrator was because in a knife fight
*  The perpetrator often gets nicked and cut especially when you're stabbing someone that many times
*  so
*  When the innocence project got the case, they said well, what were the results of that blood test?
*  You know how many drops of blood they tested?
*  Not a single drop of blood
*  They never tested a single drop of blood because they thought that he was guilty
*  we had the blood tested and right in the and within inches of the mother's body and
*  in a bathroom where the state argued the killer cleaned up is
*  the daughter's blood a
*  Trail of the daughter's blood going to the bathroom and then the mother's blood on the outside of the daughter's window
*  We did a just a minimal investigation into the daughter and it turns out that she had a history of
*  crazy violence she had a condition called
*  Intermittent explosive disorder where you would snap and just go off the rails
*  That's a condition. It's a condition a psychiatric condition. We look at her medical file
*  When she's diagnosed with intermittent express explosive disorder, they they put her in four points restraints
*  That's your arms and legs and there's in the doctor's notes a few years before this happened where she says to her mother
*  I'm gonna fucking kill you if I ever get out of here
*  I'll fucking kill all of you then we find out that she is confessed all over town
*  We had people coming in all over the place
*  Testifying affidavits that she said I killed my fucking mother and my grandmother
*  I'll do it to you and I got her on the witness
*  So watch this the state still retries him his conviction gets overturned the Florida Supreme Court throws it out
*  Says that he is obviously there's obviously a real problem here and the state instead of saying you know what we screwed up here
*  They double down and it happens in all of our cases very rare
*  Not all of them most of them where the state comes up with a new theory
*  they said well that must have been old blood from her cutting herself and
*  They had no explanation for why her mother's blood is mixed with her blood in her bedroom
*  Why her mother's blood is outside of her window I demanded proof there and there was
*  Incontrovertible proof so watch what happens
*  There's a blood swipe on her mother's ass
*  her mother is struggling to get out of the house and the
*  killer grabbed at her and pulled her pants down and there's a four-fingered blood swipe and
*  I always thought it was weird or three-fingered blood swipe. Excuse me
*  And I always thought it was weird that there was only three fingers and blood at someone trying to grab at her
*  so when I had her on the stand I said I
*  Got a court order to take pictures of her hands because I wanted to see if there were
*  Scars on her hand and she lifts up her hand and her pinky is bent down like this
*  And I said what happened to your pinky?
*  she said
*  Cut my finger off when I was 14 because I'm a cutter and I severed my tendon. That's exactly right
*  I said was your hand like that on the night that your mother and grandmother were killed? She said yes
*  And I looked at the prosecutor and I said have you have you seen enough?
*  They don't quit I had they just want to win. They just want to win
*  They just want to win and he I'm I'm happy to report that after her
*  Examination and then an amazing examination by my co-counsel Mari Palmer
*  Which explodes a bunch of other lies the ex-boyfriend?
*  the ex-boyfriend's current wife came in and testified that
*  He told her that the daughter killed her and that she snuck out of her house that night
*  His house that night climbed out of the window and then returned later in the night
*  They dropped the charges in the middle of his retrial and I got to walk him out
*  Off of death row and in Trump's America
*  they would not they put an immigration hold on him and
*  It was like out of a movie. He got walked out of the prison to
*  immigration and there's like a mounting crowd outside of immigration on
*  We still don't know how it happened
*  I got him an immigration bond and walked him out of the immigration center that night and
*  To Jason's point I have never other than the birth of my kids marrying my wife hitting a home run in Little League
*  I've never had I've never floated like that
*  fighters winning world titles that you
*  Know better feeling than to restore someone's life you hit a home run in Little League one
*  So it's so hard to hear these stories man, because you just imagine yourself
*  Did I get to you on that?
*  Yeah, yeah, he's a beautiful guy too Joe, I mean sure need some guy who comes to America
*  you know, and you know, you meet you get me going you meet this guy and
*  Here's the crazy part I was called
*  Fucking crazy
*  So I'll tell you what I had to go through to get it. I'm not patting myself on the back. Watch this
*  I've skipped one retrial the first retrial I was in front of a judge
*  The same judge that denied him post-conviction relief
*  Said I don't care that the daughter's blood is there that she confessed. I don't care watch this
*  she denied him post-conviction relief and
*  She he then gets his case overturned in the Supreme Court
*  Her credentials to serve as a judge in a death penalty case had lapsed
*  After his case gets reversed she files for special dispensation
*  To become a death penalty judge and says even though I don't still have my credentials
*  I want to be the judge on his case seeks out his case
*  They're seeking the death penalty and she denied him the constitutional protections that the US Constitution said that when you death
*  qualify a jury if you violate these rules the case is going back on appeal and I would say to her your honor and
*  You don't understand. We're gonna be back here again. You can't not tell the jury don't research the case in the hallway
*  They're gonna research the case in the hallway
*  And she was she wanted to kill him and at one point I stood up and I said I'll tell you something
*  I had to go at her so hard
*  I find out that she was the judge in the Trayvon Martin case
*  Whose husband represented George Zimmerman and wouldn't recuse herself
*  so all of a sudden the papers start picking up that I'm clashing with her in courts and
*  I one point had such a run-in with her that I sat down and Clemente was crying and
*  I said, I'm sorry
*  I thought he was gonna fire me because I went at it with her so hard and I said I said I
*  Understand and he put his arm on me and he said
*  She's gonna kill me he said please keep doing
*  So I kept I just kept going at her and she finally had to declare a mistrial
*  Because a juror came in and said that they were all researching the case in the hallway and
*  That they thought that he was listening to music because he was listening to the translation on the headphones
*  So to get these exonerations it is such a grueling feeling
*  So to get these exonerations it is such a grueling fight and if you meet Clemente
*  he's the most gentle kind human being and
*  Is still an immigration limbo and to tell you what a great man this guy is I'm in there in Florida
*  like
*  Fighting like I'm thinking there's no fucking way. I'm gonna get him off and he's calling me going listen when we get him out
*  I'm gonna get we'll get him up in an apartment and we'll pay for this and pay for that
*  I thought he was crazy. I said this guy has no fucking clue and I'm up against and
*  to
*  you know, I'm such a I'm it so in his debt and I
*  I'm so in awe of him, even though he's my friend that to this day
*  He and I have jointly supported Clemente financially
*  but he pays for his
*  room and board and to be able to be in a position to help these guys and just help them start a life again and
*  You know this guy still believes in America
*  After all that's happened to him. He still believes it's the best place to be
*  What happens to a judge like that? How does a judge not go to jail?
*  How does someone I mean how does someone get away with that?
*  She's violating the law, you know and clearly he's innocent, right?
*  So she's trying to kill a man who's innocent
*  I know the judge that took over the case
*  She had to recuse herself in a fit of embarrassment and the judge that took over the case was such a beautiful guy
*  His name is judge Galuzzo and all he did was uphold the law and he
*  Prosecutors would come in and try to get rid of jurors that said I believe that you know
*  I'll listen to the facts and I will only get rid of
*  You know, I will consider life instead of death and he was just so and you know
*  They have immunity is the short answer these judges and prosecutors one of the many flaws of our system
*  Right Jason is that they all have immunity. So what about these cops? We were talking about the cop beat the guy in the confession
*  How does a cop like that not go to jail? How does if you know that?
*  What where is that cop now?
*  One of them got promoted
*  One of them got promoted one of them got
*  Does the cop know that the kid was innocent and that they did this many times?
*  They do Joe and you know
*  We can't say make a blanket statement that they all do and none of us believe that all of them are bad
*  But there are a lot of really bad actors throughout the system and they don't face repercussions
*  And as a result of that and it's so important for people to know this
*  I talk about it on my podcast all the time and Clemente's episode is so wonderful because in in that episode you really feel his humanity
*  He still has a great sense of humor
*  He still has a joy of life and all the exonerees I find have this sort of incredible
*  So I can only describe it as grace right after literally being to hell like death row on, Florida
*  It doesn't get closer to hell than that right and he was there for 14 years
*  And he talks about on the comment he was on death row for 14 years. Yeah, listen
*  There's a lot a lot worse than that too, you know, don't get me started on Anthony a pan of it
*  Which is a current case in Ohio you your fucking head will explode. Yeah, I got him off after he
*  Had he was actually 10 of the 14 years. He was on Florida's death row
*  The other four years were in jails not to be technical, but yeah, he was on death row
*  But he he's funny Joe because we had to inject a little humor into this right so in in on the podcast
*  I'm wrongful conviction
*  He talks about how when he went to prison he didn't speak English and he figured he need remember this Josh
*  And he said he needed to learn how to speak English
*  I figured I'm never gonna get out of here if I can't you know help in my own defense
*  So he asked the guard for a Bible and the by the guard said there's no no Bible to this he goes
*  This is hell. There's no Bibles here
*  So he gave him instead a letter of a book of penthouse letters like porn gave him porn
*  And so Clemente says he read this thing
*  17 times and he says the 17th time he finally got a heart on he says but not because of the board
*  Because I realized I could speak English right and then you hear him say this and you just you want to hug the motherfucker
*  He's such a good and decent guy, and he just loves life, and he appreciates everything but imagine that
*  It took Josh Dubin right one of the great lawyers in our country him right there. Yeah, that's that's
*  That was right after I that was that's me on the right that was right. That was the moment
*  That was the moment that he got exonerated Wow
*  My co-counsel Lindsey boney and Dylan black southern gentleman who this case changed their lives
*  And that's Mari Palmer who I mentioned before and when and so where is he now? He's so listen to this how about this?
*  He would go into court when he was that guy in the white and he would throw a fit
*  I'm fucking innocent who the fuck are you to do this to me early in his court appearances when I knew him
*  He was very docile so he acted exactly how I would expect someone to act so watch this
*  Three days after he gets out I always told him I'm gonna get you out of here in jail
*  I would say and I'm gonna take you to the beach and we're gonna have a beer and I would say to Jason I'm
*  I'm starting to think that I'm not you know gonna be able to live up to it and
*  I get a call like two days after he's out. We're in a hotel
*  And I said you know he got located at this place called the the sunny center in Tampa
*  It's this property where they have like efficiency apartments for death rogues honorees
*  And Jason goes to me. That's my place. I bought the property
*  Didn't even know it. I mean he's like this guy's like fucking Robin Hood
*  Like literally from death row to the front row right it's incredible
*  And I actually it's funny joke as you mentioned the music business before I actually had that experience about a year ago
*  This is off-topic, but I can't help saying this is on my mind
*  About a year ago. I was visiting an innocent guy well
*  A year and a half ago now because it was early late January. I was visiting an innocent guy on death row in Texas named Rob
*  Will and I left there and flew to LA that was on a Monday was down there and then
*  Flew to LA and ended up going to the Grammys on Sunday
*  And ended up you know moving around some seats whatever sit in the front row, and I had that feeling I was like holy shit
*  What a week I literally went from death row to the front row. It's a it's a strange life
*  It's a double life, but it's you know it really is it gives a lot of meaning to to our days
*  you know and
*  It's important. You know I can't help talking about the death penalty when we talk about shorty Clemente because
*  In this country a lot of people still believe in death penalty, and I don't
*  And what I say to people believe in the death penalty is I respect your view
*  But what percentage of innocent people are you okay with executing right because the system is
*  Fundamentally flawed and even if the system was reformed in all the ways that we could sit here and think of right now
*  I have some ideas on that
*  There's still going to be errors. There's always going to be there always going to be errors made and
*  So you have to accept that there are going to be mistakes
*  We know that like in Florida where Josh represents James Daly and again
*  We did a podcast episode about his case as well
*  James is either going to be the hundredth guy executed by the state of Florida or the thirtieth guy
*  Exonerated from death row Clemente was the 29th, and I'm representing who should be the 30th
*  So they're not even if all the people they executed were guilty and we know they weren't right
*  We know certain people like Jesse Taffaro who was absolutely innocent executed by the state of Florida in that gruesome execution where the
*  Electric chair quote-unquote malfunction and his head caught on fire and had to
*  Electrocute him three times, but even if they got those right they aren't even batting 700, right?
*  And then in Louisiana, you know to your point before Joe a guy named John Thompson rest in peace was a good friend of mine
*  He came within a month of being executed by the state of Louisiana
*  when an attorney
*  Investigator
*  staring into a microscope and saw the DNA evidence that proved that he was not guilty of this murder and he was ultimately
*  exonerated and he wrote an opinion piece in New York Times where he said I don't understand why
*  The prosecutor who prosecute because he proved that they knew he was innocent before they prosecuted him, right?
*  He knew it and it was absolutely proven that was not in question. So
*  He said I don't understand why that prosecutor is not being charged with attempted murder
*  They tried to kill me and they knew I was innocent and I've proven that but and what happens to the prosecutor nothing nothing nothing
*  This is I've been saying this for a long time that there's a real problem with human beings when it comes to
*  anything where there's a game and the problem with
*  policing and prosecuting people and convicting people and
*  It's a game and meaning that there's winners and losers and when when there's winners and losers people cheat
*  There's a lot of people with poor character and they just want to win and they get caught up in this game
*  I mean you can call it a game. You can call it a pursuit whatever you want to call it
*  There's a there's an end that you want to achieve if you're successful and if you if you don't achieve that end you are
*  Unsuccessful so when people are trying to achieve this end
*  They will do all kinds of things and it's just inherently a part of human beings that are weak people of weak character
*  People that are morally flawed they do things like that. They'll they'll
*  They they'll know they're wrong and they do it anyway
*  They they know that someone is innocent and they pursue it anyway because they want that W
*  It's a real problem with people. I've seen it with we've all seen it playing games with people kids do it
*  You know adults do it like when you see a grown adult cheating at cards, but just a game of cards
*  It's a fucking it's a embarrassing thing. Like who are you?
*  Like you you really you hit it on the head so much, but that's right. It's a game. Listen
*  It is so even in the prosecutor in Clemente's case and and this is not this is not some one-off
*  Circumstance Joe you could not have articulated it better. I mean it is you ever been in an argument with someone and
*  It's like with my wife. Sometimes she'll be like no you left the keys here and I'll be like no
*  I know I gave them back to you and then as you're in the argument you remember, you know what?
*  Right, I actually right but then and you have a you have a decision to make am I gonna be the bigger person and say
*  I fucked up or am I gonna am I gonna continue down this course, right?
*  Unfortunately, you know and I think I think Joe like hit on the fundamental psych psych
*  The psychology is almost like you're right. It's so binary. It's either win or lose. Yes, and I was begging
*  I mean, you know, I'm an emotional dude. I'm mushy and
*  I'm I had to weep to this prosecutor in Clemente's case
*  I had the real murderer on the stand and I got my first question to her was how many times have you threatened to murder?
*  Someone watch how dug in they get she said never I had a dashcam video of her saying to a cop
*  Blasting her head against the partition. I'm gonna fucking murder you you motherfucker
*  So I played the video for her and I said what about that?
*  She said I didn't listen. I didn't watch
*  so that was you that was your voice, right and
*  You know, I got her and then she says well I black out I say things and do things and I black out and block
*  Them out. I finally got her to admit I said isn't it true that you may have murdered your mother and your grandmother and blocked it out
*  she said yes, and I I had to sit in a room with this prosecutor and
*  I don't know if it was just like, you know, like an angry cry because I'm angry that he won't just say I fucked up
*  Here we fucked up and we got the wrong person and I'm weeping to him saying can't you just admit that you made a mistake?
*  And and you're right. It is that that I have seen it so many times with prosecutors
*  It's all about getting the W and they just won't admit that they're wrong
*  And I think that there's something deeper about human psychology working there where the powers that be
*  Won't admit I mean I hate to say but Kamala Harris was no different here in California, right?
*  I mean she fiercely defended, you know wrongful convictions. Why I mean this isn't like made up
*  There's like a huge investigative piece in The New York Times about it. It's not something that's germane to Florida
*  It's in California. It's in New York and God forbid you're in the south
*  You know and it's it's a real problem
*  I don't know how to solve it
*  It's not like they're gonna completely overhaul the system and stop the whole
*  The way it's set up now with a judge and prosecutors and attorneys and they're not gonna change it
*  I mean the system is in place. There's too many cases, right? There's constantly
*  They're constantly hearing new cases to completely overhaul and change this method of
*  Policing and convicting people it would require a massive
*  Undertaking and that's why we're so appreciative that you give us this forum because there are so many amazing people
*  That you know or that it really literally takes being in in the bowels
*  if you will of the system and getting it beneath your fingernails and
*  Standing up to and speaking truth to power
*  It's gotta be terrifying to be there to to know that someone is
*  Willing to convict someone that they know is innocent because they want to win and there's more
*  There's so many factors that go into wrongful convictions Joe we see them again and again tunnel vision is one right they lock in on you
*  They decide you're the guy and then more new evidence comes in and says he did it. They don't want to hear it
*  They just it's a psychological thing. It's also blind ambition
*  And there are so many factors that I think some of them are preventable and when when we set out to do these podcasts
*  Whether it's the wrongful conviction one or junk science that Josh is the host of that just came out or even the false confession series
*  That we did
*  our goal is to educate the public because
*  Your listeners are gonna you and me everyone Jamie over here the engineers gonna end up on
*  On a jury at some point right and it may be having you may be holding somebody's life in your hands
*  And it's important for you to understand that the people that you hope
*  That are gonna be telling you the truth that you respect because they're authority figures, right?
*  Respecting uniforms and and everything else and I still do but the fact is
*  They may not be telling the truth and the just because somebody says they're an expert
*  That's what Josh talks about on his podcast doesn't mean they're really an expert
*  they may be talking about things that are actually junk science and
*  Furthermore, they're allowed to lie in the interrogation room. And this is something if we get nothing else across today
*  I always tell people when I do talks and on my show
*  Talk about the fact that if you get picked up and brought in for questioning
*  And you know people who are innocent waived their Miranda rights 85% of people waive their Miranda rights
*  Anyway, people were innocent almost always do because they don't think they have anything to hide they think I'll just go in
*  I'll tell them what what you know, like I was an arrow
*  I was with my mom or whatever was and I'd go home and they may not say that you're a suspect at all
*  They may say we just want to ask you a few questions. So the answer is if that happens to you
*  The only thing you should say is this is my I'm Joe Rogan and I want a lawyer or whatever
*  Your name is whoever's listening those the only words you should say because they're not your friends and you can get talked in that
*  Interrogation room crazy shit happens. They don't always beat people up. They don't need to they can use coercive
*  Psychological tactics that can get people to confess to crimes that they didn't commit and once you start talking and you're in that little
*  Heirless room you've seen it on TV, right and they start the good cop bad cop and they intimidate you and they threaten you with
*  The death penalty and they're allowed to lie now. Why are they allowed to lie? That's a great question, Joe
*  I mean other Western countries they're not but here they are so they can sit there especially and you know the people that are most
*  Likely to falsely confess are people adolescents, right?
*  Anyone whose brain is not fully formed and we know that your brains not fully formed here 25 and military veterans
*  Interestingly enough and they're disproportionately affected by this because they're used to obeying authority figures, right and following orders
*  And so the Norfolk for a classic case of that for four guys confessed to a crime that didn't commit
*  and
*  None of them did it and the fact of Central Park five is another good example, right?
*  Those were just kids
*  They were just young teenage kids and you know
*  They they can sit there and they could threaten you with the death and they can sit there and go Joe listen
*  We got your buddy in the next room. He's not even there and he says he saw you do it
*  We got your fingerprints on the on the knife Joe
*  What are you talking about?
*  The best thing for you is to confess and Joe asked you asked the the critical question
*  Which is why are they allowed to do it?
*  Because there's not a law
*  No one has the balls all these blowhard politicians have the balls to introduce let because you know
*  They're afraid to piss off the police union because they'll lose that vote right to introduce
*  Damn, but the police union should be the ones who are clamoring right that that introduced let you see now, right?
*  Introduce legislation right especially now introduce legislation that makes it a crime
*  right to lie to a suspect think about the mind fuck that's going on here and
*  Remember the psychology is we're gonna deprive you of sleep. We're gonna deprive you of food
*  We're gonna scare the living shit out of you and we're gonna lie to you
*  We're gonna lie to you and make you you ever see that Chris Rock bit where he's like
*  Cop pulled me over and after a while my dad. Maybe I fucking did do it
*  It's like that shit is going on and it's like, you know, you're like
*  Maybe I did something and didn't remember it
*  That's what they start getting you to believe because if they're telling me they're saying Joe listen
*  We have how the fuck do you explain how your DNA is on the victim?
*  How do you explain that and you're thinking yourself? I can't fucking explain that a I didn't do it
*  But maybe I don't know maybe I did something you don't remember it and then there's there's this
*  which is you'll hear from a lot of people that are victims of
*  coercive
*  interrogations is I
*  Figured I would just tell them what they wanted to hear get out of the room and then sort it out
*  Right and they and they'll say to you. Listen, you're just a kid
*  No one's gonna believe that you committed this gruesome murder, right? You just got a my partner's crazy
*  I don't know what he's gonna do to you
*  but while he's out of the room, let me tell you kid the best thing for you to do is just sign the piece of
*  Paper and you know, we'll sort this out later. You'll be fine
*  But now you've just signed your own death warrant because juries can't understand when you ask people
*  Would you ever confess to a crime you can commit?
*  First hundred people you see they all say no. No, I'm smart. I would never do that. But the thing is they don't realize
*  25% of the DNA exonerations approximately 25%
*  Involve false confessions. So just process that right? That's how many people confess because because they're good at and some of them are
*  Yeah, that's right. Some of them are great at it. Some of them may be mentally challenged, right? The cops and it's also a game
*  It's a game to get you game. It's the same kind of game
*  It's a game to get you to confess and it goes on even after the conviction has been overturned like in
*  Clementi's case like in my own adopted daughter Nora Jackson's case where the Tennessee Supreme Court
*  Unanimously overturned her conviction for murdering her own mother and in their in their ruling they
*  excoriated the prosecutors for having played so loose with the rules right to say the least and
*  Yet they came back in and said listen
*  We're gonna try you again unless you take unless you take a plea
*  And most people say to me well, but they can't try you again for the same thing
*  But they can because the higher court when they overturn your conviction
*  The indictment still stands the original thing and most prosecutors say well, you know what?
*  It's a long time ago and we've been proven wrong and you know that we're gonna let it go
*  But if they really are vindictive they may say, you know what?
*  I want to protect this this conviction and let's not forget that every time we convict an innocent person
*  The real the real perpetrator remains free and that even if you're someone who may be you know
*  Pretty hardcore on you know, law and order whatever you allow your listeners come from different, you know walks of life different viewpoints
*  But everybody can agree that we want the person especially these vicious violent crimes these brutal crimes
*  We we should all want the real perpetrator off the street and not for the convenient
*  Target to just get you know, you know manhandled and and and and brutalized by the system
*  And then that other perpetrator oftentimes goes on to commit more terrible crimes and creates more innocent victims Josh you you
*  You were talking about Kamala Harris and I think this might be a good time to talk about this because she might be the vice presidential
*  nominee
*  What what specifically did she do where there was someone who was?
*  Innocent or someone who was wrongfully convicted
*  Let me give a caveat
*  Okay
*  caveat is that I know I'll catch shit from some people that say you have to do everything you can to make sure that
*  Trump is not elected
*  And I will say that even even she's an improvement as vice president
*  If he does pick our anything's an improvement in my mind
*  So with that caveat we it would take this podcast and four more to go through
*  she
*  fiercely fought wrongful convictions and
*  Was shamed by judges when she was district attorney in San Francisco
*  What was the case the gate the gauge case George Gage the George Gage case where her prosecutors?
*  hit evidence
*  and
*  They tried to protect once she knew that there was
*  evidence that
*  Was withheld from defense attorneys
*  Once she should have known in my opinion that people were innocent she tried to protect those convictions
*  Why because she wanted to continue winning?
*  she blocked DNA she
*  went
*  To great lengths to try to block access to DNA
*  For people that were accused of or convicted of felonies think about it
*  We're talking about a $12 DNA test to see if the biological material from a crime
*  That has been preserved is actually the defendants right she blocked access to that
*  I mean, what do you block access to something like that? That seems like that should be a right?
*  Yeah, it seems like it should be a right but in a lot of states
*  There's legislation that says you cannot get access to it and the the rationale behind it
*  Is that it'll open up a floodgate of criminal defendants asking for the biological evidence in their case to be tested
*  I mean, oh, that's the last thing we want is more innocent people being freed
*  So what was her justification for this?
*  You know when she's asked for her justification of it
*  it's always been on a debate stage and she'll always default to I stand by my record as a prosecutor and
*  She's never had an explanation that I have ever seen
*  I don't know Jason there was Jason and I were talking about this before we came on today because there was a New York Times piece
*  Her name is escaping me Lara Bazelon Lara Bazelon
*  Which if if any of your listeners want to listen to it or she goes into
*  You know exhaustive detail about specific cases and things that Kamala Harris did and you know the sad part about it
*  Yeah, that's it right there New York Times Kamala Harris was not a progressive prosecutor
*  Yeah, she was often on the wrong side of history
*  I
*  Highlight the marijuana one that you saw she she she stood by criminalizing marijuana in this state
*  Now listen what we can hope is that she's certainly been saying all the right things lately
*  I don't know what to believe to be honest. Well, it's cuz she wants to be the president. Well, okay, fair enough
*  I mean, I like to believe that people can evolve and I hope that her viewpoints have evolved now she supports
*  Legalization I
*  Believe but the fact is it's it's impossible to ignore and I hope I hope I don't pick someone else personally
*  But you know, we'll see
*  And I don't even picking anything. I will they're doing it for him at this point
*  Well, I'll support him no matter what who he picks if he picks her so be it because I believe we're in an existential crisis
*  And we need to do you see the look look at this. This is crazy
*  She could have demanded DNA testing in Cooper's case now Kevin Cooper is on death row
*  All right, you think about this
*  Could if they had denied DNA testing in Clementi's case, he would have been either dead or still on death row
*  What are we talking about here? We're talking about a test
*  She has constantly in case after case issue after issue and look the people that she hurts the most
*  Or people of color in this country because they make up, you know
*  This big portion of this proportion and so it's it's it's kind of truant children thing made me fucking
*  Sick awful. She went after the parents of truant children and threatened them with jail time
*  Imagine you're a single mom. You're just doing your best to put food on the table
*  You have to work two jobs and your kids are
*  Understandably fucking up and not going to school because there's no father around
*  It's and the you know how you know how dead? Yeah, you know how devastating this is
*  Think about it this way because I can only think about it in real life examples
*  Okay, this is how there's enough of a shit show and a fight to get out even at look
*  I have a client in New York who is like and these people become like family to us
*  I mean, he's adopted one of the exonerees is his daughter now
*  You know John Restivo was convicted of raping and murdering someone with two of his friends two people that worked for him
*  He is framed by a cop
*  They take a hair from the victim and they plant it in his moving truck
*  Oh, Jesus Christ the way that they found out that it was planted is that when your hair
*  You're gonna love this right you when and the hair is attached to the human head when you die. There's a physiological
*  phenomenon that happens called post-mortem root banding where a band goes around the root of your hair and
*  Okay, and it happens after you've been dead the minimum four hours
*  Prosecutions theory is that he picks up this girl 16 year old girl walking home from the roller skating rink with his two buddies
*  Throws her in a van they rape her killer and dump her near a cemetery and it all happens in 45 minutes
*  the way that they finally find out that he was framed is
*  It's a moving truck. They search his moving truck and they find hundreds of hairs
*  Because you should we all shed hair they find one hair from the victim and it's pristine
*  It's the only pristine hair in the truck. No kinks on it. No dirt
*  No debris and there's a post-mortem root band around it
*  Which means they had to have taken it from the autopsy after four after four hours
*  And we ended up finding out that the cop had access to the envelopes where the autopsy was in any event
*  John Restivo back to the DNA
*  The perpetrator ejaculated and they had a lot of semen a lot of biological material DNA
*  He fought for years to get access to the DNA
*  Finally gets access to it. They test the DNA and he's excluded and his two co-defendants are excluded. All right
*  What the prosecutor does is they say okay. Well, there must have been a fourth perpetrator
*  So they start testing and this is a process that took years they start five years
*  They start testing every single known male associate of John Restivo
*  Dennis Halstead and John Cogut and they can't and it's only after that that he gets out. He spent 18 years
*  For a rape and murder. He didn't commit. He's you know, I love him
*  He's like a like a brother to me now, but you know, he's destroyed you don't come back for what happens to someone like that
*  Do they have any recourse? Is there anything? Yeah. Well, there's a happy ending in that regard in John's story
*  I was one of his one of the lawyers that represented him in his civil rights trial
*  He
*  Was awarded 18 million dollars a million dollars for every year that he was incarcerated
*  And
*  You know to show you like what the lasting psychological damage
*  so we got to go to a civil jury for civil rights violations against Nassau County with which indemnified this cop that framed him and
*  he got some closure that way to the extent that you can get any closure and
*  We were outside waiting for the verdict outside of the courthouse
*  He's smoking a cigarette and he put out the cigarette and he took a paper bag
*  He took a plastic bag out of his pocket grab the butt and put it in the plastic bag and sealed it and put it
*  In his pocket. I said John what the fuck are you doing?
*  He said you think I'm gonna let someone take my DNA and frame me again
*  You know and I you know, that's how bad it is. So think about that in the context of Kamala Harris
*  To block access to DNA once you get the fucking DNA
*  You're still sometimes in a crazy uphill battle because there's prosecutors in my opinion just like Kamala Harris
*  They want that want to win and want to protect that conviction and we have so many cases joining last year
*  This year last year the Innocence Project was representing a guy in Arkansas named Ladell Lee
*  It was in Kansas or Arkansas. It was Arkansas and we were just just wanted the DNA tested
*  I mean we had a lot of evidence that he was innocent and the state refused to let us test it
*  And they went ahead and executed him. Anyway, we also have cases like the Sedley Alley case
*  Which ironically is the same prosecutor that prosecuted my adopted daughter Nora Nora Jackson
*  But in Sedley Alley's case, he was executed and the state denied him access to DNA
*  It was a horrible crime a young cadet girl was jogging and she was
*  brutally, I think raped and murdered and
*  He was executed for this crime asking for the DNA to be tested and the state refused and five years later
*  The higher court said oh you guys made a mistake
*  You should have allowed the DNA testing now his daughter has come forward and said I want to know I want my dad's
*  DNA tested I want to prove his innocence and we now have evidence of who we think it might have been because there was
*  Another guy who was a serial
*  You know murderer and rapist who was in that area at that time
*  We don't know that it was him
*  But until we test the DNA we can't know and the state has refused to let us let her test it even posthumously
*  So this goes on all over the country and it's crazy. Of course, we want the DNA tested
*  Everybody should want the DNA tested and but you know one thing I do want to point out is that it's it's gratifying to see
*  Attention being brought by by you and by others people who are so prominent in society and it's also become
*  Such a hot button issue that if you look at for instance, Amy Klobuchar, right?
*  I mean her campaign was derailed because people were going hey, what about Mayon Burel?
*  Which was a 16 year old kid that she prosecuted there was evidence of his innocence. She ignored all of it
*  He's still in prison 20 years later
*  And she touted this as as a you know, like she she bragged about it
*  It was like it was an accomplishment as an accomplishment, right?
*  And now she also part of the problem why Derek Chauvin was still out was still acting as a police officer
*  I'm not familiar with believe she was yeah, she means she's heard that tell us she's from Minneapolis. Yeah, right
*  Yeah, no, there's there's a connection because there's had something to do with him and his the prior
*  Cases where he had exhibited police brutality and that she they had done nothing about it
*  She was connected to that something
*  in many people's eyes was eliminating her as being a
*  Possible candidate for vice president because they thought it was gonna come up and I read that very briefly a few months ago
*  Jamie will find something if it's and she denied a charge that she didn't charge him, but I don't know she denied
*  They didn't charge him. What does that mean? Does that mean I reports that she failed to bring charges on?
*  2006 sounds like a double negative
*  She says flat-out live. She also doesn't know the president of Mexico is but maybe now Joe
*  Maybe now we will have an environment where
*  you know
*  Prosecutors we know are ambitious people generally speaking there, you know, everyone is and then everyone has the right to you know
*  Succeed to the level that they you know are capable of succeeding to but not by cheating right to go back to what you said before
*  But now there's finally even though there are no legal consequences
*  Except in the rarest rarest rarest of cases
*  But now at least there are real consequences in terms of running for higher office where these things can come back and bite you
*  In the ass and hopefully that will make people think twice and this is the case with Klobuchar
*  Yeah, and tell us of this the case one more time. What happened is a kidney my own barrel
*  My own barrel be you are ELL and he was a 16 or there was a I think was a young girl
*  11 year old girl was shot in her kitchen when she was doing her homework and
*  That you know a lot of pressure to solve that case right and they picked up this kid
*  I don't know why exactly don't remember all the details of the case because I have so many of them in my head at once
*  Amy Klobuchar helped jail teen for life, but case was flawed
*  And this is an AP news. Yeah, and this is a long last time ago
*  He's still in prison and and by the way, we're picking on on, you know certain people but they there
*  This is not a problem. That's exclusive to Democrats by any mean there means there are a ton of
*  You know the the Arkansas case of course was a Republican. So what is I'm sorry to interrupt people
*  What was the evidence that indicated that he was innocent? Do you know the cases? I remember that the actual
*  killer confessed in this case and
*  And this guy's still in jail. Yeah, he's still in jail. There's there's a lot of evidence of his innocence
*  We can go back through it
*  but it's a it's a disgusting case and he is
*  you know, but he's still there just like so many of these other people are and I
*  do want to talk about the compensation because you raised that earlier Joe because I think that's an important thing for us to talk about because
*  In the 27 years I've been doing this work
*  People ask me the question that you asked both questions that you asked actually most frequently people who are new to it
*  I'm talking to them on the golf course. I'm talking to them in anywhere we are and
*  Because I'm always you know out there talking about this stuff and they'll say to me
*  Did did the people who framed him did they did they have to face any consequences, right?
*  And the answer is almost always no and then they say well tell me that
*  That they got compensated like people like breathless, right?
*  I want to know like this is so horrible. They react the way you did this to cry with anything, right?
*  And the answer is usually not I mean this restivo case and John is such a beautiful beautiful guy
*  He also was on my pocket. What a guy man. He's incredible and he's helping other exonerees too as so many others are
*  But and then I want to shout him out for that but in the majority of cases there's no compensation
*  We at the innocence project and that's innocence project org for people want to learn more
*  We are working state by state Rebecca Brown runs our policy department
*  She's incredible and she's going state by state with exonerees to pass compensation statutes because 18 states have no
*  Compensation statute whatsoever for exonerees and some of them it's capped at
*  25,000 or like in Illinois, it's 200,000 no matter how long you're in for
*  Why is this the cop that planted the evidence? Is there consequences for him? None? What none?
*  You know the judge the judgment against him was covered by Nassau County
*  He died a horrible death of cancer and
*  You know John always says to me look I would never wish ill on anyone, but it seems like karma
*  played a part in that
*  You know and it's interesting you asked the question earlier
*  That I'm not so sure I know the answer to which is you know when they're in there interrogating someone
*  Are they beating a confession out of them because they think they did it or not?
*  And I don't know the answer. I think that there are some cops that
*  You know Barry Sheck taught me this once he said don't always demonize the cop
*  Because sometimes I think that they feel like
*  They have a hunt that their hunch is better than the lack of evidence in other words
*  They feel like because they feel it they think that the person did it that they'll let the the
*  Means justify the air the ends justify the means
*  So I don't know that they go in
*  Trying to frame someone but there's always a point at which like the story with my wife and the keys where you have a choice
*  You have to open your eyes and say you know are
*  Am I going to realize that there's no evidence here and get off this notion that this person committed the crime
*  The problem is with your wife and the keys. There's no consequences, right?
*  You just you're a man you say I fucked up
*  I'm sorry, right
*  but if you're a prosecutor and you realize that this person is innocent and you back off and you lose the case there's
*  Consequences for your career. You look like a fool. You look like you can't be trusted
*  Someone's gonna point that out when there's another case, right?
*  I mean listening it extends the compensation issue. Watch what happened to Clementi. There's a wrongful incarceration
*  Compensation statute in Florida. All right, and what it says is that
*  From the time
*  You were no longer incarcerated
*  You have 90 days to file
*  Clementi's case got overturned in I think
*  2013 the very day the Florida Supreme Court overturned his conviction the state of Florida said we're going to retry you
*  They announced it the same day
*  We filed for wrongful compensation wrongful
*  incarceration compensation and it got denied and what the state said was on
*  The day that they announced they were gonna retry him. He was no longer incarcerated
*  He was went from being incarcerated to being in custody and said wow, that's that's pretty fucking rich
*  So in other words what he should have thought
*  Was I'm gonna face the death penalty again for a crime. I didn't commit
*  No one came to his prison cell and said by the way, you're no longer incarcerated. You're just in custody
*  So they write these statutes in a way that they have a trapdoor to jump jump out of and tonight his compensation was denied
*  So I filed a federal civil rights complaint on his behalf we have a civil case going
*  But it's very rare that they get
*  Compensated and I think that that's where you know where I have been
*  Inspired so much by Jason because here's a guy that
*  Uses and it's made me poorer, but I'm happy to be poor as a result because we're he's made it his mission in life
*  I mean, it's like a modern-day Robin Hood. He really is he's made it his mission in life
*  to I'm sorry if I make you blush, but he's like a hero of mine because
*  He has made it his his life's calling that
*  you know
*  the people in need and that need it most are gonna get it as long as he can give it and
*  He's sort of brought me along on that ride. So we personally
*  Financially support as many exonerees as we can because we feel like it's it's the very least we can do to try to help
*  Whether it's buying someone a car
*  Helping them with their rent with school tuition, whatever it is
*  Because it's the very least we can do and most of them are denied compensation and until they can get back on their feet
*  In some way, I mean you think about it. They come out their life is ruined
*  You don't ever real I don't care what anybody says you never really recover from this. I mean look Clementi
*  Would send my daughter from his prison cell
*  exquisite
*  Drawings he taught himself to draw on death row and he told me the only reason I learned to draw was because I would have
*  I literally would have lost my mind
*  I was losing my mind and I had to figure out something to channel my anxiety
*  so when he got out
*  Jason has been having these art shows for death row
*  For death row inmates because so many of them
*  Become good artists because they have so much time on their hands and I said Clementi
*  Do you want maybe we could do some art and raise some money for you and he started a weep. I
*  Said what's wrong? He said Josh. I tried to draw and I had a panic attack
*  That brought me back into the cell
*  And
*  Let me just talk about Josh for a second too because
*  First of all, we're blowing each other
*  It's funny though cuz I was we were introduced by Nina Morrison who is the just super badass senior litigation
*  Council at the innocence project and when she put us together, which is several years ago
*  She I said to Josh. What do you what do you do? He goes? I'm a jury selection expert
*  He goes I can look in your eyes and see your soul
*  I was like, oh shit
*  But anyway, but he's more than that and the fact is that this case my son Michael Michael Flom
*  He he called us earlier when we were talking
*  He he brought me to my attention to a case of a guy named Albert Wilson who we believe is wrongfully convicted in Kansas
*  Josh is wearing the shirt free Albert Wilson and I brought it to Josh's attention
*  He looked at it and he said you know what? I'm gonna take this case pro bono. We flew out there
*  We visited Albert was funny because his lawyer forgot to tell him that his local or fat to tell him we were coming
*  It felt like the scene in Animal House for the kids leading a playboy and then the bunny flies in the window
*  I don't even know if we can say that anymore. But anyway, so we just showed up unexpected here
*  we are in like bumblefuck, Kansas and
*  And sitting down with Albert and but but we were like the fucking Jewish Beatles walking in there
*  He was like Avengers. He was like you guys are here from the instance project. We were like
*  Yes, we're here to save you sir, but Josh is the guy who actually like we we we've been
*  Supporting the local attorney very good local attorney named Mike Whelan in this case and Josh, you know
*  He's spending not only is he volunteering his services
*  He's spending his own money to finance the case the parts that he can't cover himself
*  And he gets mad at me like if we we alternate payments and if I take two in a row he gets mad at me
*  Dude, who are you? What the fuck is this? Some Mother Teresa shit? He's on whatever it doesn't matter
*  but the point is that
*  I'm really excited that he's now doing this new podcast junk science
*  And by the way, if anybody wants to learn more about this, I post about all the time on my Instagram, which is at its Jason Flom
*  There's another Jason fly was a schoolteacher in Tallahassee. He got there first, but now we know each other
*  But anyway, but yeah, it's Jason Flom is my Instagram and I'm always posting about these cases
*  But so Josh is now
*  Hosting a podcast called junk science. This is what we started talking about at the beginning and I made you stop and redirect it
*  So let's come back to it. So explain like what is the junk science? What are the issues with?
*  wrongful convictions and junk science, so the
*  All various disciplines of forensic science are used to convict people and in fact wrongfully convict people
*  It's poly does a polygraph work polygraphs not admissible
*  It's not so no, it doesn't work. It's not reliable
*  But is it because you could beat it if you're a psychopath? Yeah, you could beat it
*  There's all different factors that cause your blood pressure to rise, you know, you may just have a high blood pressure
*  You may your heart may beat faster and you get anxious in different situations
*  So it just doesn't work and it's not admissible in any courts
*  But I'm talking about things that you would probably think it just based on pop media
*  Even if you're very well read which you are you would say oh, well, that's reliable like bite mark evidence
*  All right. It's complete junk science. So the National Academy of Sciences is a
*  The gold standard it's got the finest scientists in the country
*  that did a review of all of the forensic disciplines that are used in courts and
*  Found that with the exception of DNA all of these are fraught with problems
*  Bite mark evidence blood spatter arson
*  coercion
*  In course confession. So what the podcast does is it examines all of these friends episode by episode?
*  It examines all these forensic disciplines and it goes through to explain
*  how and why a they're total bullshit and
*  B
*  they are
*  In the face of it being total bullshit still accepted
*  Now like the fact that you got emotional made me want to hug you because it was like I you know
*  That's like it takes a special person to be able to get there on that level
*  But now I want to try to make you angry because I think it's it's the anger that should drive people
*  I'm already take take back tape
*  About this and other things. Yeah, but about all this so bite mark evidence for okay
*  Give an example I have crooked teeth like the bottom my bottom teeth are crooked if I bite into a mouthpiece
*  Like if I get a mouthpiece formed you can clearly see I can see that's my teeth
*  You want to know the debt you want to know the difference between a mouthpiece and human skin?
*  everything
*  humans your skin is
*  different than my skin in thickness and
*  Consistency if you're flexing when I bite you if it's during a struggle or not and you have to follow the science
*  What the science tells us is that bite marks on human skin are not only unreliable
*  But there has been study after study that the so-called experts that they call odontologists
*  Can't tell the difference between a bite mark and an insect bite. They can't even agree
*  They were all shown the self-professed finest odontologist in the country are all shown pictures of
*  marks on human skin
*  They can't even agree as a threshold matter what's a bite mark and what isn't is that a that's a medical term
*  Odontologist so odontologist is as a forensic dentin dentist that fancies themselves an expert in bite marks
*  But it's bullshit. Not only is it bullshit
*  But the origin story of all these forensic scientists sciences you end up down a rabbit hole to some
*  Fucked up story that sounds like a wacky religion take bite marks for instance
*  There's a guy named George Burroughs who's a reverend in the late 1690s
*  he's accused of torturing young girls, okay, and one of the forms of torture is biting them and
*  He's tried and convicted and they take him around the courtroom and pull his mouth open and
*  They point to the crookedness of his teeth the ridges and his molars and they compare it to the bite mark and he's
*  hanged publicly and
*  He cites the Lord's Prayer at his hanging and you know everybody in the crowd is like that's kind of fucked up because
*  Witches
*  Aren't supposed to be able to cite the Lord's Prayer
*  Because this was a trial during the Salem witch trials
*  He's the first
*  posthumous
*  Exoneration I'm aware of 20 years after this they end up finding out that George Burroughs was in a different town altogether
*  Not only did him bite these people but that the marks weren't even bites
*  This is a part of the Salem witch trials
*  The Salem witch trials and they posthumously exonerate him
*  The colony of Massachusetts pays his family compensation
*  So watch this in the 1970s there's a guy named Walter Marx that is accused of biting a victim in a murder and
*  The court in that case says you know what there is no established science here. It can't be replicated
*  But bite marks are associated with you know identifying
*  accident victims burn victims and admits it and
*  It gets admitted into evidence the appellate court says well if the if the judge found it credible who are we to overturn it and
*  so Joe watch this it now infects and
*  It's probably an unpopular analogy to use now, but it spreads across the criminal justice system like a virus
*  Every court just starts citing this marks case and judges just start admitting it
*  The National Academy of Forensic Sciences found that there's no way to replicate it that it's unreliable
*  The there's this fucking crackpot named West who is an odontologist that claimed to use
*  3d pictures and ultraviolet he so they set him up they sent him
*  You know bite marks and
*  The mold of the teeth from someone other than the defendant and said we think this is the defendant
*  Can you match it to this bite mark? And he said yes, they had sent him the bite mark of someone other than the defendant
*  I mean it is that it is that bad of a junk science
*  so what what we're hoping to do is
*  Through the podcast to educate people because it you're right. It is how do you overhaul a system?
*  It's a monster and one of the ways that you can overhaul the system is you know, everybody says how do you they ask me?
*  a lot how I get out of jury service and I say, you know what?
*  You should want to be there because god forbid you were accused of something you didn't do wouldn't you want you on your jury?
*  So one of the ways we want to do it is to get people thinking you know what I can make a difference here
*  Because there's no presumption of innocence. We throw that around like it exists. It doesn't exist
*  There have been studies done my firm has done one where well over 90% of people
*  Feel like if you've been accused of a crime
*  You probably did it. Look I represented how I met Lennox. I
*  Represented Lennox in a case Lennox Lewis. We should tell people. Okay, so I managed Lennox Lewis and I
*  represented him how I met him was I represented him in a case and
*  It's interesting most people say to me when I say that what did he do?
*  Instead of what what was he accused of and he actually wasn't accused of anything
*  Lennox was suing a boxing manager and a promoter from ripping him off and for stealing from him
*  But if you ask people during jury selection
*  How many of you in a criminal case and when I was you know, a lot of jurors were asking what did he do?
*  He didn't do anything
*  But if you ask jurors in a criminal case if a judge will let you ask it, but you should be able to ask
*  How many of you think my client?
*  He was arrested indicted must have done something wrong
*  Hands go flying up and you know, it should be a basis to get rid of people
*  That's not the presumption of innocence. That's the assumption of guilt
*  It doesn't exist in this country and it takes more people to be conscientious
*  And one of the things that we're trying to do on the podcast is educate them about these junk
*  Sciences so that if you're ever on a jury and you hear well the trajectory of the blood mark on the wall shows you that
*  The person must have grabbed the knife from this angle. It's total bullshit
*  One more time. What's the name of the podcast? The name of the podcast is wrongful conviction junk science
*  Okay, so that blood splatter shit. I'd watched a whole thing online about how
*  These people figure out like how someone must have hit them this way and I've seen it in movies
*  That's all bullshit total bullshit. So the second episode of the podcast
*  I have a guest by the name of Pamela Koloff who's an award-winning writer. She just won every
*  Award you could win for writing an article about
*  An informant in a case of mine and I got to know her and she wrote an amazing
*  Investigative piece about blood spatter evidence for ProPublica or Texas Monthly or the New York Times one of those three I should know and
*  she went
*  Undercover deep and she became a certified blood spatter analyst as part of her research
*  This is a discipline that was born in the basement of some whack job up in New York
*  He called it the National Forensic Laboratory or some shit like that and it was his basement in his house and he would do things like
*  like recreate crimes by like, you know hitting cadavers and
*  Watching the blood spatter and and just like think about it
*  There's so many things wrong with that the way the blood travels out of the body from a static
*  You know a static body versus one where blood is
*  circulating already changes it the temperature of the blood is different if you're struggling and I hit you with a blunt force
*  Object a hammer a bat and your arm is coming up this way
*  Depends on the speed your arm is traveling. It is total and utter bullshit, but it's admissible. It's admissible
*  as is bite mark evidence even though in all 50 states as is even though
*  the highest court in Texas
*  Based in work of the Innocence Project. I mean the highest authority in Texas
*  Strongly admonish the courts not to consider blood to consider bite mark evidence
*  But they still do in spite of the fact that there's case after case
*  That proves that these guys who make themselves out to be these experts don't know anything about what they're talking about
*  I mean, it's it's we should all be
*  Embarrassed and ashamed that this is allowed to go on in our courts
*  Forensic odontology was created as a practice so that if there's a disaster if there's a plane crash right and bodies are obliterated
*  They can take a full set of teeth and they can compare it to your dental records
*  Now you take the idea that someone's gonna bite an imperfect surface right like a finger or a you know your neck or whatever
*  It is right and now you're gonna go with a couple of teeth on an imperfect surface
*  Days or weeks later and you're gonna go this must be Joe's teeth because they sometimes don't even know if you have teeth
*  Or not Joe check this out in the National Academy of Sciences
*  Report they were able they did a study and they cite to it in the report and you can get it online
*  It's they did a study where they would have people with no teeth bite human skin and the people with no
*  Missing their two front teeth the bite mark appears as if they have two front teeth
*  People that have two front teeth can bite down and if their insizers are too large
*  Bite down and if their insizers are too long it can make it appear that they're missing two front teeth
*  So it's just and you know and as far as blood spatter is concerned
*  There is a case. I think it's the Peterson case that my friend David Rudolph did you know the staircase that show on Netflix?
*  Yes, the guy was a show guy was accused of pushing down the stairs. I think it was in this case
*  Where they were trying to recreate the blood spatter analysts were trying to recreate the spatter in the staircase and
*  There's video of them doing it and they keep on hitting this
*  This receptacle full of blood and they can't recreate it and they keep on doing it and doing it and finally on the whatever
*  15th try they get it and they all start celebrating and high-fiving
*  You're supposed to be able to replicate this shit and the reason why DNA
*  Is is so?
*  Reliable is that it's going to be the same every time it is the gold standard
*  Now there are ways to manipulate it. There are certain people out there that are trying to fuck with it right now. So
*  you know like for instance, there's this guy who runs this computer algorithm and
*  He claims to be able to take a mixture of a bunch of different people's DNA and untangle it
*  right and basically be able to say whose DNA is what and you know, he won't give the
*  source code for his data and
*  You know, this shouldn't be a black box
*  So there's there's some things going on like that
*  But for the most part when it's done correctly and the right standards are applied you can bet on DNA
*  But a lot of these pattern matching disciplines blood spatter fingerprints in some instances
*  bite-mark evidence, you know, and it what are the other ones
*  Tread tracking on shoes arson arson arson
*  Arson so when they can figure out like where a fire was started. I always wondered about that. So no ours. Oh, sorry
*  No, please so arson. I thought you're done arson science is not science whatsoever arson
*  You can become a licensed arson investigator with a 40-hour
*  Correspondence course. I know it sounds like a joke, but it's true same thing with blood spatter
*  It's a 40-hour course at the end of the week
*  You can go into any court in the country and say I'm a blood spatter
*  I always wonder because I would see a house burnt to the ground then they would say oh they determined
*  It was started by a fire and this is how they determined it
*  I'm like, but everything's burnt out like how do you know there are countless people serving hard time in prisons in America
*  Joe in parks. I'm Christine bunch who I just interviewed on my progress
*  She brought me to tears who was convicted of setting a fire
*  I mean her her case in Indiana, how insane is this Joe?
*  We're about to release this episode, but she was a 21 year old mother of a three-year-old boy and her trailer caught fire
*  She was asleep. She woke up. She couldn't get into the son's room
*  it was to the fire was too out of control already and the little boy died and the fact is that
*  She they they went they arrested her six days later in charge of with arson and murder and the prosecutor said to the jury
*  We admit we don't have a motive. We don't have a motive
*  She was a loving mother with no mental issues with no person. I asked her you have any other history of law enforcement
*  she goes yeah once I got a warning for going five miles an hour over the speed limit and
*  She everybody said she was a doting loving mother. She was working and going to school and she lost everything
*  She owned she didn't have insurance
*  She didn't have a shirt to wear at the end of this right because she was in her pajamas
*  It's like I mean and it was an electrical fire was proved 17 years later by actual experts
*  What did they use as the arson evidence against her in the case?
*  They claimed that there was a certain type of accelerant which there wasn't
*  They withheld evidence that there was kerosene that had been present in the house from previous
*  Owners who had who had to come forward and said that there was you know, and that there was you know
*  There was a lot just decided that she was guilty and they were gonna try to win and it's the sick thing about it
*  Is that these arson cases there is no there was no crime. There was a tragedy but no crime nobody
*  And how long did she go away for?
*  She was in for 17 years and she's such a beautiful human. I mean you would you would meet her even and you just want to hug her
*  She's just a magnificent human who in prison did the most phenomenal things and now she's helping others
*  She has an organization maybe you could look it up Jamie. She has a wonderful organization
*  I'd like to shout out and she's making a real difference and she I think helped pass a compensation statute
*  Sorry, I'm gonna step on your words
*  I was just gonna say that what happens with a lot of these forensic sciences is they were they reverse engineer an outcome
*  So they decide that the person did it and there's all this this confirmation bias
*  I know that I've heard you talk about it. I think you're familiar with it, you know, you know the desired outcome
*  So you confirm that bias so, you know, they then start looking at a streak
*  from a smoke stain on the wall and
*  knowing that the theory is
*  That there was a match struck and placed against the wall, right?
*  They will say well, that's why you see it the pattern that you do of that stain on the wall of smoke
*  Where the reality is is that there are a lot of different explanations for how something can look the scientific analysis of
*  Charred remains not remains of people but remains of different things chemical compounds and things and if you're working to reverse engineer an outcome
*  You know, it's and it's easy to make this stuff sound reliable because if you don't have experience with it
*  I mean look, this is a big I hadn't done any bite mark cases in all of my cases
*  So I actually tried to approach it with an open mind
*  I'm literally stunned at what I'm finding out doing research for the episodes because it sounds like some wacky religion
*  You know that somebody invented in their house and people buy it
*  So it's all this stuff still in use because no one has exposed the fact that it's all junk science
*  Or is it because it's established as a part of what they accept in trials and they just haven't made the corrections yet
*  Because if they did then they would have to accept the fact that all these other convictions that were based on this junk science
*  Would be open to
*  Reinterpretation in the trailer for junk science Josh addresses exactly that and he does it very eloquently
*  Which is that along with Chris fabricant who is a the strategic litigation?
*  Director at the innocence project it was actually a post I created in honor of my dad who's not with us anymore
*  Why help to create I should say and he does an incredible job?
*  but basically they keep using it because the precedent is there right once it's and Josh talks about this and maybe we could even
*  play the trailer, but
*  Sure, he taught play the trailer. Yeah, can we sure you put up on?
*  On the podcast that yeah, Jamie will find it as soon as he finds it
*  That'll say it more eloquently tonight possibly
*  This is so fucking hard to listen to and then there's shaken baby syndrome, which we'll be covering on junk science
*  Which is which is like everyone's heard those words
*  It's a it's a ridiculous idea that you can shake a baby hard enough to rattle its brain without injuring it in any other way
*  Right, so we're supposed to believe that a woman who's a mother, right?
*  First of all, it's hard to believe that they would kill their kid. But okay, let's let's let's suspend that disbelief
*  How are you gonna shake a baby where you're this you're a strong guy? Okay
*  But let's say you don't have a big muscle mass and you have a baby. Sometimes they're toddlers
*  It could be a 15 20 pound kid. You're gonna hold it out at arms length and shake it
*  No, your arms aren't gonna do and by the way, unless I'm mistaken if people most people they get mad at something
*  They don't shake it. They hit it. They kick it or they throw it right and get mad at your golf club
*  Shake it. Yeah, they hit a bad shot. Whatever. I mean, it's you know, it's madness and yet it's accepted in courts and they're
*  Countless people serving time, you know, Melissa Kaluzinski is one I can't leave her out John Jones in Ohio
*  Innocent as could be just misdiagnosed. Oh
*  You know, it's it's interesting too Joe because you you know earlier I made this like
*  It seemed probably out of places this reference to Lennox Lewis
*  And the reason I made it is because it blew my mind at how many people walk into a court proceeding
*  with a misperception
*  And it opened my eyes in that case because people thought well, here's a big black dude. That's a boxer
*  He must not be that smart and he must have done something wrong
*  That was the the that was the default that people were at and whether or not that was some
*  Intrinsic bias or not, I'm not you know, you know opine about that. I think it's pretty obvious though, but
*  this the
*  preconceived notion that people walk into any criminal courtroom with is that the person must have done it
*  Most people think that if someone was arrested or accused they must have done it
*  So that was why I said earlier the presumption of so then when you hear this impressive sounding lingo
*  About something you don't know anything about and
*  There's someone who is qualified as a quote-unquote expert and they're sitting there using language
*  You don't know you can't really fault the jurors for falling victim to it
*  So that's what we're hoping to do is one mind at a time
*  Open up people's people's minds if you will and they're thinking about the way that they approach
*  the accused in this country
*  James gonna play the trailer
*  Hi, I'm Jason Flom founder of lava for good podcasts and host of wrongful conviction with Jason Flom
*  True scientific expertise is built through rigorous study and review and is absolutely vital in a court of law
*  When you trace any of these so-called
*  Forensic scientists back to their origins you get a curious origin story
*  But what happens when one claims to be an expert in a discipline that isn't based in science at all
*  They take a course 40 hours. You're an expert and they're testifying all over the country
*  This is attorney and Innocence Project ambassador Josh Dubin whose name you've heard from me and from some of the people he's helped free
*  We hear horror stories of innocent men and women robbed of their freedom
*  We will examine how science in fact junk science has played a role in wrongful convictions
*  He is the host of the brand new series from lava for good podcasts wrongful conviction junk science
*  whether it be bite marks or arson or blood spatter for
*  One court to accept a quote-unquote science as valid can lead to the spreading of that science much like a virus
*  Across the criminal justice system Josh interviews actual experts who can shed light on just how dark things can be in the American
*  Criminal legal system. How is it that you could have?
*  Multiple expert witnesses make that fundamental of a different finding with the same evidence
*  Why was it ever accepted as reliable because it worked?
*  You know, the criminal justice system is an efficient eating and killing machine of largely poor people of color
*  And whatever facilitates that process is going to be used as long as courts admit it wrongful conviction junk science
*  Coming to this feed August 3rd
*  Find it wherever you listen to podcasts. I knew this podcast doing it with you guys was gonna be disturbing but it's
*  It's more disturbing than I thought it was gonna be like I never would have imagined that all those things were bullshit
*  I never would have imagined that if you had asked me, but like you should have given me a pop quiz
*  Like what is bite science good? I'm like, yeah you bite the teeth. Yeah, it's all teeth are all fucked up
*  You could tell his blood splatter. Oh, yeah, I saw that thing you hit a guy with a hammer blood splatters
*  What about arson? I guess yeah, they figure out where it's lit somehow. They're fucking really good at it
*  40 hours you go to school for 40 hours a correspondence course
*  This is crazy and the fact that there's all these people in jail for all these different things
*  Yeah, Cameron Todd, Willingham rest in peace was executed by the state of Texas in an arson case where his three children all died
*  and you know and and the you know his
*  This woman a wonderful advocate who had befriended him was in prison got a hold of the top
*  Fire expert in the world a guy from England who has like over a hundred patents
*  invented everything and and he proved all 20 of the
*  prosecutions
*  Theses were wrong and that it had to be an electrical fire, which is what it was and nothing happens to those people
*  No, no, no and you know and governor Perry oversaw that he he actually you know, really
*  Rammed that through that execution. I mean, it's uh, it's awful
*  It's just it's gotta be that story that Cameron Todd, Willingham story kills me, you know, it's for me Joe it
*  It goes back to the same thing again. I hate
*  bullying I hate people who are in vulnerable positions being
*  Abused in any form or fashion. This is the most serious form obviously when they're literal their freedom and their life is at stake
*  And we hope we can touch I know we don't have forever. Well, I could talk to you forever
*  I'd love to but you know mass incarceration is keep going man. Long as you want to stay here
*  Okay, well, you know, I did want to if it's gonna get home for dinner
*  I
*  Do yeah, we can probably crying again, it's 238 as we speak
*  So we'll get you over there
*  but I did if I if you don't mind I would love to just
*  you know put a sort of a shameless plug out there because
*  This this bullying thing bothers me so much that I wrote a children's book about it with my my other daughter
*  Alice and it's called Lulu is a rhinoceros and it's about my bulldog Lulu who's actually not a bulldog at all
*  She's a rhinoceros trapped in a bulldog's body and it's about her struggle to find love and acceptance
*  Where a world in a world where she's judged by her physical appearance instead of what's in her heart
*  Just basically trying to teach kids that it's okay to be different
*  It's not okay and it's and it's you know in the end of the day, of course she prevails
*  But first she endures ridicule and bullying and I equally hate bullying but I have an alternative perspective on bullying
*  I think it's a natural part of animals. It's a natural part of
*  Finding weakness in systems and I think there's a way to fix it
*  I think the way to fix it is very counterintuitive
*  It's to teach people how to fight and to teach kids how to fight very young so they never even think about bullying
*  So these instincts to find weaknesses in in these systems is
*  societal system systems of friends and and systems of communities
*  Instead you you find them in yourself you find them through combat you find them through martial arts
*  Hey Jason, can we pause on mass incarceration for a minute because you just you just like
*  the my I got the chills just now because you know as a
*  As a guy that manages professional prize fighters, you know, I
*  Have been I have an eight-year-old son
*  And I told you he's got type 1 diabetes and I knew as soon as he got diagnosed
*  He was you know close to his seventh birthday. He's gonna get fucked with and picked on
*  Because he wears an insulin pump on his arm. But before that I
*  I had this idea that my wife's a gentle Canadian
*  So I took him to Lennox's boxing camp Lennox Lewis's boxing camp in Jamaica when he was six right before he got diagnosed
*  then my wife was like
*  Why I don't want him to learn to fight and I said no that's wrong because had I known to fight better
*  You know, I would have won some more fights
*  When I got picked on a little bit, but I I wasn't you know, like I eventually
*  Felt like I needed to teach myself to fight or else I was gonna get my ass kicked, right?
*  you know and so I've been teaching him and Lennox teaches him and Andre Ward teaches him and I always have this tension but I
*  Tell my wife like I think it's the right thing as long as it's taught the right way you use it to defend yourself
*  Yeah, because as soon as someone fucks with you and you fight back in a way where
*  You put that you put that fire out very quickly. You're not gonna get fucked. Well, that's one way
*  But I really think it should be universal. I think it prevents bullies it prevents them from being bullies
*  I think part of why people are bullies is because they're insecure and there's a natural inclination to find weakness
*  Find weakness in other people
*  It's also one of the reasons why you find weaknesses in other people is because you don't want to see weakness in yourself
*  And you see it in other people and you recognize it and you point it out and you pick on it
*  it's just a weird part of humans and I
*  recognized very early on that I hated being picked on and I moved around a lot when I was a kid and I wasn't a big
*  Kid and I realized when I went to high school to snoop listen
*  like I gotta learn how to fight and I started doing martial arts and
*  The first thing that I realized first of all, it changed me it became I became a much much easier going person
*  much easier to get along with my insecurities faded away because now
*  Instead of being constantly worried that someone's gonna pick on me and beat me up. I was fighting
*  So I was always worried about like trained opponents and like regular life stuff was nothing it all faded away
*  It's like all my anxiety about groups of people and dealing with other guys like it kind of went away
*  Because my my fear was really getting kicked in the face in Ohio in a tournament that I was gonna be in in two weeks
*  like that was my real it became a real thing and also like who I was like I
*  Calm down in this like radical way because all of my energy was being exerted in a gym or in a
*  In the martial arts school I changed and I realized like really early on like kids need to learn how to fight because
*  Fighting is a part of being a person. It's part
*  It's arguing is part of being a person physical confrontation is a part of being a person
*  It shouldn't be you shouldn't certainly shouldn't hit people but it's always happened from the beginning of time
*  The best way to prevent it is to let everyone know how to do it
*  Like martial artists trained martial artists are some of the kindest nicest people
*  They don't want to bully people they want to test themselves and challenge themselves
*  But the ones who want to bully people they get fucking weeded out man. Listen, man, I could every
*  People ask me all the time. Oh, what's Lennox like? What's on?
*  Nicest and actually not only the nicest guys the most deep-feeling
*  sensitive
*  Insecure in some ways healthy insecurities, you know, and if you you know, these are two bad motherfuckers
*  Yeah, but I I couldn't agree with you more like I think the MMA
*  Actually has helped with bullying and I'll tell you how I watched Sebastian Maniscalco's bit at Radio City musical
*  My wife took me I was a huge fan. It's good buddy, man
*  Fuck I fucking love love that dude. So he has this bit
*  I'm sure you've heard it where he's like man fighting is different now
*  You don't fuck someone will fucking these MMA guys will wrap you up and that'll be the end of it
*  And I think that that probably gives bullies like a second thought sure you find out that you can't fight
*  Right and they start fucking all right. That's the inverse problem is psychology
*  I really think that even them even the boys themselves like that's where it's counterintuitive
*  You should teach bullies how to fight you teach them how to fight. They wouldn't do it
*  They would get would get out of their system. There'd be better people. Wow, that's a reverse
*  But it's not really reverse psychology
*  Treating the issue Joe's right every fighter that I know that was a great successful
*  professional fighter is
*  A deep thinking not a tea. I want to go so far and idealize them, but they are warm
*  Sensitive sweet human being to be good. You have to address all things
*  You have to address your own insecurities your own problems your own flaws
*  You have to address everything
*  Well, you know the thing is there's a difference in strikers versus grapplers and the difference is in strikers
*  Physical attributes are considerably more important. They're there
*  It's physical attributes and speed and power
*  They're so significant because if you just teach someone how to throw punches correctly the people that have speed and power a lot of them
*  They're just born fast and powerful. They have great bodies when you have that you have a giant advantage guys with pillow fists
*  They only go so far
*  You know if you can't if you can hit a guy two or three times and all he has to do is hit you once
*  He can absorb those two or three times and hit you but in grappling it doesn't work that way and grappling is technical
*  It's almost entirely technical like even me as a black belt
*  I weigh 200 pounds if I grapple another black belt that's 150 pounds. They can tap me out regularly
*  I know a multiple friends that are much smaller than me that are better than me that can tap me out
*  Because it's technique is everything and so you could and also you gotta get you're gonna get humiliated and tapped
*  But you could do it over and over and over again when you get punched in the head
*  You can only get punched in the head a couple of times a month, you know, we're really rocked
*  Yeah, you can get tapped you can get stunned a little but I mean dropped and like you can only do that so often
*  Or you got fucking permanent brain damage where you can get arm barred multiple times a day
*  So you get humbled you you recognize what it's all about and then you learn these valuable lessons
*  You've learned learned valuable lessons as far as technique as far as martial arts
*  But also of who you are as a human you you learn that you can overcome you learn that you can get better
*  You learn that you can improve you learn all of the different pathways and where you went wrong and why you got caught and then
*  You find that same pathway again, you recognize it coming you stop it use the proper defense and you learn you get better
*  You feel better and it gives you a lesson that it improves your human potential
*  It makes you understand that through these struggles you can get better at everything. Yeah, you know what? You know what I gotta say
*  not to sound bro, you're douchey about it, but I gotta say
*  When I started lifting weights and getting physically stronger probably in college when I started to take it really seriously I
*  Don't think that I would have had this may sound dumb
*  But I know as a matter of fact that I would not have had the emotional strength
*  To stand up to judges and the powers that be
*  Like I do because I struggled because I struggled because it was a self-confidence thing
*  And when I got physically stronger, I thought I'm the most I know what you're saying
*  right when I got physically stronger a lot of my insecurities about
*  Getting fucked with emotionally and physically faded and for me to stand up
*  Not that I'm gonna fight a prosecutor but for me to know in a purely physical world. There's no match
*  I don't know it does something for you psychologically to be able to stand up and say, you know to be able to
*  Say look, you're not fucking doing anything
*  I mean in the Clemente's case at one point the cop every time me and the judge got loud
*  The cop would put it it's in the transcript
*  The cop would put his hand and rested on his gun and this was probably not the right move
*  But I said what is he doing right on the record?
*  You should do I said and what is he doing every time I make a forceful argument to your honor
*  You're grabbing your gun and he goes like this. I'm not doing anything
*  I said now your hands off your gun, but I don't know without
*  Getting myself like and I also felt that managing professional fighters the best professional fighters
*  I didn't want to be some some weak douchey lawyer, right?
*  I wanted them. So the first thing that I did was I got into a tournament an amateur tournament and Lennox trained me
*  The tournament it worked my corner and I made it all the way to the semifinals of this
*  it was like a pro-am tournament and
*  He's like you're doing great you're doing great I won four fights in a row
*  I was 29 and he said don't get cocky though
*  The second round of the semifinals I squared up dropped my hands and went like that
*  No, and I got hit
*  So hard in the sternum or in the right here that I cracked for it
*  How's the end and when I was in the corner Lennox is like go dance in the last round because you're not quit
*  stool with me in your corner
*  So I had to dance the last round and they and and it was crazy because from that point forward
*  You know, I brought I didn't even know how dumb I am that my ribs extended that far
*  And from that point on my relationship with him changed it really did he started relying on me for more stuff?
*  I mean I was like he knew he could count on you. Yeah, hold up
*  It really did change and just the post the postscript here, you know who the most the sweetest most sensitive guy is
*  Mike Tyson I
*  wanted to I wanted to throw something in as well because
*  Picking up on where what you said Joe the there's an exoneree based in New Orleans named Doug Delosa
*  Who have developed a tremendous friendship with over the years?
*  He was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to life in prison
*  Actually wrote his own pro se motion which means written by the by the
*  Incarcerated person himself and it was granted by the Fifth Circuit
*  he was the only person to ever do that and was freed after 14 years and
*  Couple years ago I was speaking to him because we talk all the time because he does a lot of work helping other
*  Exonerees get back on their feet and we work together on that
*  And he you know, he sounded really down and I was what's I was like, what's wrong man?
*  He goes man. My grandson is just gave his grandson Macy's getting brutally bullied at school
*  You know, he's they broke his glasses they threw him down the stairs and this and that and I was like have you thought about?
*  Taking him to martial arts
*  And he said no, I hadn't really thought about that and sure enough. He took his grands onto martial arts
*  And now he sends me pictures. He's got this belt. He's got that belt
*  He's got the other belt and just like you said joe
*  He's I mean I have never met the kid but I have a lot of respect for him because he's taking the initiative
*  And he's doing great and he's going to have a better life exactly as you said
*  specifically because of that and
*  you know, I
*  Just wanted to shout him out on the air because I encourage it so often they may not have a broken record
*  But I really encourage jujitsu because jujitsu you're not getting hit. I think that's one of the most important things
*  You know, you're not you don't have to worry about brain damage brain damage is real, you know, I
*  I've seen too many people that get it and when you're involved in striking
*  You only have so many holes that you can punch on that ticket, you know until and everybody's tickets different
*  Some people can go a long time like we were talking to Lennox on the phone today. He's great. He sounds amazing. He's got a he is
*  Clear-headed he plays chess. He speaks eloquently. He totally articulate
*  He has no issues whatsoever with his long career as a world championship heavyweight boxer
*  But that's not always the case and there's a lot of people that have like significant problems when they never go anywhere as an amateur
*  you know, it's I've seen too many I was real unpopular too with Lennox because
*  After he fought Vitaly Klitschko
*  You know, I was young I was the new guy on his team
*  I'd only been with him for a few fights because after that court case I ended up co-managing him and
*  After the Klitschko fight he just didn't he didn't have it in him anymore. I knew enough to know that he just was done with it
*  yeah, and
*  There was a lot of money on the table for a Klitschko rematch and I would say you don't need this shit anymore
*  And I because I saw him stumble one time walking around a corner in a hotel and I said man
*  I said I won't stay on your team until you get
*  an MRI and
*  I got threatened. I got fucked with by people
*  You know my
*  Became a dear friend of mine like a like an uncle Emanuel Stewart would call me privately and say come on Josh one more fight
*  I said it all takes is one more fight. I represented Shane Mosley
*  represented terrible Terry Norris against the King terrible example and you know
*  Shane to this day we have an icy relationship because after the Pacquiao fight
*  I said Shane you don't need this anymore
*  And if you just listen to his speech, I love the guys beautiful, but I think that he's been hurt Terry's
*  He's most certainly been hurt. Yeah, I remember I rented a Terry at a boxing event and
*  I didn't like physically run into him
*  I was there he was there and I was watching him talk to someone and I was stunned and this was a long time ago
*  This was a Felix Trinidad was fighting someone else who was in Vegas and Terry was in the audience
*  And I remember listening to him talk. It was awful
*  It was so bad. It was you know, I represented him against Don King it made it to a jury trial and
*  He was diagnosed with dementia pugilistica, which is just a fancy way to say brain damage and I got to tell you
*  He would hysterically weep when the doctor would get on the stand and explain the extent of his brain injury and
*  A few years after the trial, I mean he spent Thanksgiving at my house
*  We really took him in and became very very close. We won the case real big and he forgot
*  He forgot who I was at one point. It's just it's heartbreaking to watch it really is
*  Well, he has some brutal fights man some brutal brutal brutal fights. I remember when
*  He fought Julian Jackson. Oh man, Julian Jackson could crack
*  He had he was one of those guys with weird power right like they would look like normal punches
*  But people just does that happen in the MMA?
*  There's something about the torque of the punch some some it's it's a lot. There's a lot of factors. It's weird
*  It's it's so hard to figure out some guys you look at them and you go
*  Well, of course he can get hard look at the fucking build on like Tyson, right? You look at him. You go Jesus
*  What about Golovkin?
*  Well, you know first of all with him
*  It's not a one punch thing. It's an accumulation of punches and his technique is flawless, but I've heard I've heard pressure
*  I've heard from a lot of people that have been hit by him like Curtis Stevens, right? Mm-hmm. He said man. I
*  Said you look so surprised on the canvas. He looked up. He said man
*  I've never been hit with anything that hard in my fucking life. There's a lot of factors, you know
*  There's also physiological factors like we were talking about that
*  You can't change like like you've seen George Foreman's hands
*  The fucking hams it's like a bowling ball the end of a log he's got these crazy hands Lennox's
*  And that's enormous. Those guys have bigger power
*  There's just no if hands or butts about it guys with smaller hands. There's no way they're gonna be able to hit as hard
*  It's like having a sledgehammer versus having a carpentry finish hammer. You know, there's there's a
*  There's a
*  Some b-roll footage at the well
*  I don't feel at all bashful about plugging
*  I don't feel at all bashful about plugging something after you're like a you're like a professional plug machine. It's very effective
*  I don't blame you for it, but I was just gonna say so I don't feel bashful
*  So I have a documentary that is coming out about Lennox
*  Called tough love the untold story, right?
*  It was in the Tribeca Film Festival and at the end have this awesome footage of Tyson being asked by I
*  Think fat Joe was interviewing him
*  And fat Joe said he's got this I guess this web series. Yeah, he's doing a lot of stuff now
*  Yeah, I've seen him on Instagram. So fat Joe said who's the hardest you've ever been hit by and he went Lennox
*  He said man no contest just Lennox a guy would would fucking hit people and
*  They would like, you know, he had so many like lights out people just one of my favorite was the hacien rock man rematch
*  Because you knew the first fight had been stopped quickly in the second fight and he was on a different level
*  He was on a different level and he should have won the first fight
*  But for whatever reason he got caught and then the second fight man
*  You could tell he was out for blood and when he lands that knockout blow and you see a rockman on his back
*  You're like that was like the most textbook one to you'll ever see it was so sweet. He was sweet
*  Well, he's such a big guy too. You get that torque of the shoulders
*  There's something about those broad shoulders guys like those punchers like Tommy Hearns him when they get that full snap
*  But black and full extension and Lennox is fucking enormous. He's in he's um
*  He's a crazy athlete people don't realize like he could play basketball. He trips over his feet a little bit
*  I used to give more so big he's so big but he could play basketball, but you know you talk about bullying
*  I've never I mean the guy you would have to really really push him
*  But if you push him and you cross the line fucking run. Oh, yeah, that's a big mistake
*  Well, that's the problem with nice guys that are enormous, you know dickheads will fuck with them even Andre
*  He was a guy that would look to get his get back if you hit him in the ring
*  Oh, don't don't miss they are sure got a mean streak up in all for sure
*  We can't talk about boxing and wrongful convictions without mentioning Ruben Hurricane Carter, right because that's a long time ago
*  But yeah, but that one's slippery that one's slippery. A lot of people think he did it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I never heard that
*  Yeah, Dylan didn't yeah
*  But not only did Bob Dylan not think it but the movie that they made about him
*  With Denzel Washington left out a lot of shit not just left out a lot of shit added a lot of shit
*  They created a lot of like the cop that was chasing him though that bad cop that wasn't real
*  Yeah, they did that was that that was what they call a composite. Yeah, I actually don't know the whole story
*  So I'm learning from you. It's unfortunate. He I
*  Don't know what he did or what he didn't do. He's a fantastic fighter, but he was
*  Definitely hanging around with some bad people. He definitely was involved with some bad shit whether or not he committed murder
*  Like the movie left out for instance that he was two important things in my mind
*  That he was actually let out between his first and second trial and was put back in for beating up a girl
*  And then the other thing is that when they found when they pulled him over
*  They found either the same gun or bullet casings that were in the murder in his car
*  So there was a lot of shit that was left. It's hard. That's a hard one
*  You know when he got out he did do a lot of work helping other people in fact
*  I'm working now on the case of an innocent guy in Washington State named a thief for a fae who was convicted of murdering his
*  whole family and that was the last case that hurricane Carter actually worked on so
*  You know, I didn't want to leave that
*  Hanging well, I think it's wonderful that he did great things when he got out
*  I mean, I don't and I don't know if he was killed you or not, right?
*  We know we'll never know now right now, but I do know that the case there's two sides. It's not there's not a
*  It's not that clean I'll give you a better one a better boxing case is Dewey Bozella. Oh, yeah, Dewey Bozella
*  Incredible. Oh, this is like who I don't know who has the rights. I should ask Dewey
*  But Dewey was in jail for what 30 years? Yeah, you worked on that case. Yeah
*  Well, I helped him when he got out what happened was Dewey was a guy that was framed for a murder in Poughkeepsie and
*  He became a legend in prison in the prison boxing system
*  He was like the prison champion. They actually had a penal
*  Boxing league at Sing Sing at Sing Sing and he was just there he is. So when he when he got out
*  He did he did 26 years. So he got out he was 54 and he fought one pro fight
*  I saw that yeah, I remember that so what I would do Joe's I would try to get
*  So Barry Sheck called me and told me about him because he knew my connection to box. So he's 54 here
*  Yeah, he's 54. Look at him. That's insane
*  He actually someone who I don't have much respect for put him on his card out here in LA
*  I won't even mention his name and got it
*  At least he did that and they got him one fight
*  But when Dewey was about to get out Barry Sheck called me and said listen, do you have someone in New York?
*  A pro boxer that we could have a meet with it would really boost him
*  So it was the week that he got out I had actually had at the time I was managing Paulie Malanagi and
*  I had Paulie come meet with Dewey and
*  Paulie was real enamored with the work I was doing at the Innocence Project and Paulie actually took
*  Dewey under his wing and we flew him up to Paulie's rematch with Juan Diaz up in Chicago and
*  Really got him in the dressing room and got him behind the scenes and it really it really boosted him
*  He's a special dude and let's not forget that Dewey when he was in prison
*  Met the guy who was convicted of killing Dewey's own son
*  And obviously he could have destroyed the guy but he forgave him, right? I mean that's the time that goes back
*  I think to what you're talking about to an extent Joe, right?
*  Because here's a guy who's got all the power in the world inside the prison and could obliterate this guy and instead he chose to
*  you know
*  Keep it moving and I don't I don't even know where that kind of grace comes from
*  But I mean I want to kill the guy myself
*  But that's beside the point one thing I learned from Jay Prince who by the way is probably the smartest
*  negotiator business man
*  He would be a fascinating dude for you to speak to he's just set it up
*  Yeah, but he he he has taught me that these these trainers really know like like Virgil hunter for instance
*  Andre Ward he's like Yoda mm-hmm, you know, there's just he just knows Emmanuel Stewart who yeah
*  You know manual actually helped me get someone out of prison in Detroit
*  Really? Oh man, this is this is fucking crazy. Emmanuel was
*  You know man, Emmanuel was such a fascinating guy to me
*  He was like, you know, there was this quote about him when he died by this guy Mark Brudinelle and the Detroit Free Press
*  He said he loved the steak and he would never
*  He dined with with pretty women and cops with corrupt politicians and police chiefs
*  he never could
*  Deny someone with their handout and he used bad language, but not in front of women and children
*  manual was like this Detroit slickster and I never knew the full reach of of his
*  Star his bright shining star in Detroit and one night. I was at dinner with Barry Sheck
*  He's telling me about this case of this guy Walter Swift who was in jail for something
*  He didn't do and how he couldn't get the district attorney to pay attention to him
*  He like throws like a Hail Mary to me
*  I wrote a I wrote an article about it in Ring magazine great article that I'll send to you and he lobs this
*  He lobs this question to me. He's like, you know anyone big in Detroit. I said I know Emmanuel Stewart
*  He's like worth a shot. So I called the manual I sent him an article about the case
*  And Emmanuel was like he was like like it was his next pro fighter that he was gonna
*  Groom into a champion. He would not let go of this case
*  He wrote a letter to the parole board and I remember calling Emmanuel to tell the manual that Walter was getting out
*  And there were all sorts of theories floating around because Emmanuel knew the prosecutor
*  She had been a patron of his restaurant when he had a restaurant in Detroit
*  So he would not accept me not taking him to the exoneration hearing and I remember I got to Detroit in the middle of
*  the night and
*  Emmanuel insisted I stay at his house
*  and he goes to the exoneration hearing with me the next day and
*  it was like
*  Women and children and and the bailiffs and the court officers are all coming up to him
*  Hey, can I get a picture? Can I give you a hug? But we get into the courtroom
*  The judge takes the bench
*  hits the gavel and she looks out into the crowd and she says is that Emmanuel Stewart sitting in my courtroom very first thing she
*  Says and he stands up all all
*  dignified and you know, he's a handsome dude. He said yes, your honor and
*  He said Emmanuel he goes it is indeed Emmanuel Stewart and I'm here on behalf of Walter Swift and she said well
*  It is a pleasure to have you in my courtroom sir
*  And when he sat down I
*  Thought to myself
*  he really is all that you hear about him in Detroit and then Walter gets out and he's like
*  shell-shocked and
*  Emmanuel comes up and he grabs his garbage bag from him with all his belongings and we get into Emmanuel's
*  cherry red
*  Mercedes and
*  I'm thinking to myself. This is like the fucking Shawshank Redemption. I was and that's how it went down
*  They walked the swift got out of jail and rode away from the
*  Penitentiary in style with Emmanuel Stewart. I was like, this is this is something and I've always tried to get
*  Boxers and maybe you could help with MMA fighters involved
*  I always thought there was something synergistic about the innocence project and wrongful incarcerations because it's a fight to get them out
*  Well, I think there's a lot of people that know that people are wrongfully convicted
*  But they don't know exactly what to do and they don't know what if anything they can do to help
*  Yeah, you know and I think one of the things we could do with this podcast is provide some avenues that people can help and
*  I would love to be involved. I would love to help more. I'd love to
*  What whatever cases you have that you think are legitimate? Let's let's get people on let's talk about them
*  Let's let's see whatever the mean was brainstorm see what other ways we can help
*  Yeah, we'll give you some links to not only whether it's petitions signing up for the innocence project newsletter
*  You know keeping your voice up by writing your governor
*  parole boards politicians and you know, we can give you various ways that
*  People in their communities can help and I know you're chomping at the bit to talk wrongful incarceration. I mean mass incarceration
*  Yeah, and and I'm so glad you brought that up Joe because there are things that people can do just by making their voices heard
*  And we need everybody because this could happen to you. It could happen to somebody you love
*  I mean, you know one thinks it can until it does but it does and it happens all day every day in courtrooms around this country
*  And the prisons are filled with people, you know who are actually innocent of the crimes for which they were
*  Convicted in fact, even you know, it's interesting you brought that up because I can't leave out Christina Curl is a case
*  I'm working on in Vegas of a woman who's been wrongfully accused of shaking her baby to death and I had the top forensic
*  The top expert Barry Sheck actually referred me to a guy named Randy Pappetti who actually wrote the book on shaken baby syndrome
*  Who looked into this case for me and came back?
*  and and basically wrote an email saying it is a certainty that nothing was done to this child the poor child had a
*  Brain that was twice the normal size and then suffered from sickle cell as well
*  And those factors are what unfortunately led to his demise and now they want to you know
*  Lock her up for the rest of her life for something that she didn't do and still even with this evidence even with the well
*  I don't know they don't know that we know that now
*  I don't think but hopefully this is going to come out and I think now we have
*  Listen, we have the Arizona Innocence Project looks like they might get involved
*  There's she's gonna have a wonderful team and if they decide to take it to court
*  I am optimistic that justice will be done and hopefully we'll head this one off at the pass because she's a
*  I had you know thinking about you and the Vegas connection. I just had to bring that up
*  Before we get into the other part of the conversation about mass incarceration because at the end of the day
*  That's the underlying problem with all this and of course as Josh said we will put petitions
*  Maybe we can put the links in your bio
*  Maybe we can put them on your Instagram or whatever
*  There are a lot of ways for people to help and even if you want to talk about that Doug Delosa
*  Guy was talking about before the exoneree, you know this organization the first 72 plus if people want to go to the it's just first
*  Number 72 plus PL US org if you want to donate to help exonerees
*  Get back on their feet when they're coming out of the system. That's a great way to do it
*  It's a wonderful organization
*  They do great work and it's so important that we give these people because even the ones that do get compensation
*  Josh knows it's better than anyone because he's you know, he does civil law as well when the many hats he wears
*  But it takes years and they come out to nothing they come out to like a world
*  they don't know they don't know they haven't maybe been on the streets for 20 30 years or more and
*  It the the you know, the process of getting started again is so so daunting
*  And so if people, you know want to look into their hearts and help on that level
*  That's a simple thing you can do but you know go to innocence project org. That's for sure
*  I mean then there will be steps you can take there. Of course, we'll talk more about that, but I did want to touch on
*  mass incarceration as a whole because at the end of the day
*  We have a system where we lock people up at a higher rate per capita than any country in the history of the recorded world
*  It wasn't always like this in America
*  Our present population has gone up seven hundred percent in the last thirty five forty years with no benefit to public safety none
*  and
*  Every aspect of it is
*  Is is cruel every aspect of it is unusual, right?
*  And no other country does it this way and so when you look at inside the numbers, right?
*  We have four point four percent of the world's population, but we have twenty five percent of the world's prison population
*  So why is that like our Americans worse than other people?
*  No, do we have a higher crime rate than other countries? No, is there any benefit to this policy?
*  No, does it cost a fortune to keep this thing going us taxpayers? Everyone's paying for it. You're listening right now
*  You're paying for it. Everyone pays for this bloated
*  System I'm not gonna call it broken because it works the way it was designed which is an which is as a lever to control
*  people
*  Mostly poor people mostly people of color we lock
*  And this this statistic sounds crazy to me even when I say it
*  But I know it's true
*  We lock black people up in America at six times the rate of South Africa at the height of apartheid
*  so
*  We have 33% of the world's female prison population 33%
*  What in the world are we doing and it costs a zillion eighty billion dollars is the total?
*  Incarceration more or less budget in this country eighty billion
*  It's a huge business and a lot of it is really a tax on the poor and it
*  functions as a way to keep
*  Poor communities poor and desperate and that's what it does by over
*  Criminalizing these people by not investing in resources that could actually help those communities, but instead
*  Cycling them in out of prison, you know inside those numbers Joe
*  We talked about seven hundred thousand or pot arrests every year mostly again people of color
*  Even though they don't use drugs at a higher rate than white people do in fact
*  They did most studies show that they use a metal lower rate
*  If I tell you how many people are jailed in America every year we call this jail churn, right?
*  And it's important to talk about this now because of kovat because now a Harvard study came out yesterday
*  showing that this is a this is a real thing, right?
*  Eleven to twelve million people are arrested and jailed at least for you know, short period of time in America every year
*  Eleven to twelve million and those people forgetting all the other problems with it in this time of kovat
*  They go in and out and they bring the disease with them as do the people who work inside the jails and prisons, right?
*  I mean the the spread in the prisons is well known now, of course, it's spreading
*  there's nowhere to social distance in a prison cell or in a prison environment and
*  of course, there's all the workers that go in and out not just the guards, but the you know,
*  religious people the you know, the social workers the
*  People who work in all different aspects of the prison maintenance, whatever so
*  You know, there's I'll stop talking in a second
*  But the fact is there's a guy who I hope someday will get to be on your show named Alec Carrick
*  At Sanis who's the author of a book called usual cruelty, which is like my Bible now and
*  It is its usual cruelty by Alec alec
*  Carrick at Sanis, he's got an organization called Civil Rights Corps and he's been suing cities and counties all over the country to eliminate cash bail
*  Because cash bail is at the root of a lot of these problems. How so so money bail
*  Has existed since you know, I don't know
*  Thousand years since bail was invented whatever the hell was a long time ago, but bail
*  Historically was an unsecured
*  Was an unsecured bond right which meant that
*  They they figured out they wanted to charge people if they didn't show up for trial, right?
*  So but that what that meant is if you were arrested and you were supposed to show up in court
*  If you didn't show up, they would send you a bill
*  Right and then in 1899 it changed and people realized it actually started in San Francisco strangely enough
*  Which is now actually leading the charge in the other direction
*  But in 1899, they decided to start charging people up front
*  So you had to post bail money to be free until your trial
*  Now this obviously affected one group of people poor people, right?
*  Because and you know, we always see the mugshots of celebrities, right when they're arrested and they're smiling, right?
*  Because they their lawyers waiting outside to take them to a lobster dinner or whatever the hell they're gonna go do
*  and
*  What what happened is that soon enough and
*  Soon enough and
*  Alec taught me a lot of this stuff soon enough
*  It became clear that this could be an incredible profit center, right that charging people for their own freedom
*  It's a bill you can't afford not to pay but if you can't afford to pay it you go to jail
*  So then emerge this bail bonds industry, right?
*  Which is now a multi-billion dollar industry and how that works is if you're poor and you can't afford to post bail for yourself
*  Someone will come along and say if you give me ten percent of the money non refundable whether you're innocent guilty
*  Whether your charges are dropped in an hour. It doesn't matter. You give me that money. I keep it
*  I post the rest which usually they don't even do it's just an understanding they have
*  And you can go home now
*  If you don't do that think about the consequences, right?
*  So you're picked up for anything shoplifting could be mistaken identity could be any crime at all any or any minor thing
*  Misdemeanors that make up a huge percentage of the jail population most commonly it's just driving on a suspended license
*  That's the most common cause of arrest. I think in most places in America driving on a suspended license
*  And they're gonna put you in a jail cell
*  They're gonna deprive you of contact with your family of your ability to work of your ability to take a walk of your ability
*  To avoid violence that may occur to you when you're in that cell
*  of all different types and
*  You're very like your very life will be at risk and so
*  If you don't if you don't have the money to avoid that you're now going to be subjected to being in jail
*  We have about
*  450,000 people in jail in America right now as we're sitting here
*  We don't know if they're did anything or not
*  They haven't been tried 80% of people in jail have never had a trial yet and they could sit there for a week a month a year
*  several years awaiting trial and
*  That's why most of them will plead guilty within about three point two days is the average time
*  But some will plead guilty if they're in jail
*  Whereas if they're out and think about this too, right if you're out, you don't plead guilty you wait and you go have your day in court
*  And it also deprives you of the ability to defend yourself, right?
*  So let's say you're accused of attacking somebody right and beating somebody whatever
*  whatever it might be right and
*  You're in jail because you can't post bail you can't meet with your lawyer
*  They don't have time to come visit you in jail. You can't get them on the phone readily
*  You can't take your lawyer to the scene of the crime
*  To show that it couldn't you couldn't have been there because or whatever or the witness couldn't have seen you because the lights or whatever
*  That is you have no ability to mount an effective defense if you're in jail
*  Which is why?
*  96-97% of well now I'm talking felonies but 96% of felonies
*  conviction this country are a result of guilty pleas because people realize they can't fight it and they can't afford to sit in jail because
*  They could lose their job. They could lose their home
*  they could lose their family if they don't if they don't either either put up the money, which they don't have or
*  Or plead guilty. So this is this is a problem that is being addressed
*  Like I said Alec one has been winning lawsuits all over the country because it's a violation of the sixth and the 14th amendment
*  You can't call it equal protection if two different people are charged with the exact same thing
*  But the one with money goes home and the one without money goes to jail
*  That is such a beautiful way to put it and so so clear because I've been seeing people talk about
*  different progressives that want to get rid of cash bail and how ridiculous that is and
*  What you're saying makes total sense and I've never seen it laid out like that before
*  And I didn't know that there were that many people that are in jail for things
*  And they can't post bail because they don't have the money and so they just have to wait for trial and what percentage of them
*  Did you say what percentage of them are or what what percentage of people to get arrested can't post bail?
*  Oh, I don't actually know that percentage
*  But I think it's it's very high because most people don't have I mean look most Americans don't have more than $400
*  in free cash and watch out and watch how this works if you ever want to be if you ever really want to
*  See the inequities here and see how the system is so fucked up go sit you could do it
*  It's not obviously not now
*  But when when the world resumes to some sense of normal so you go to any
*  Criminal court and watch the arraignments
*  All right, and if you watch the arraignments you will see
*  they parade in all of the arrestees of the last 24 hours and
*  they read their charges and
*  They will then set bail. They will make a decision on bail. You'll notice two or three things
*  One you'll notice that the vast majority of people in any
*  Certainly in any urban
*  Jurisdiction in any big city or people of color and
*  I sat recently watching this happen in Tampa, Florida
*  Because I was working on the James Daly case and they did arraignments before my hearing and I sat with a bunch of public
*  Defenders and I listened to them wince
*  Every time someone of color young person of color was brought in
*  driving on a suspended license possession of marijuana possession of
*  Hydrocodone without a prescription and they set their bail a thousand ten thousand seven thousand and they would say well
*  That person's gonna get out or they say if you don't we're gonna let you out
*  But if you don't pay a fine of fifteen hundred dollars within 60 days, you're back in. Oh, he'll be back in
*  I'll be representing him again and you watch as Jason put it this churn machine and
*  you watch how
*  these people of color are
*  treated very differently from white defendants and
*  You you can just assess based on the fact that the judge will say do you currently have a job? No, where are you living?
*  Well, I don't know
*  I'm gonna stay on someone's couch and you start to quickly be able to do the computation in your mind
*  Where are they coming up with a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars?
*  And then they will reoffend and end up right back where they were and what will really be striking to you
*  Is that I would I would venture to say in the high 80s in terms of percentage
*  These people what they really need is help with an addiction and if we put a third of the money that we spend
*  incarcerating people keeping them incarcerated on
*  drug and alcohol
*  rehabilitation
*  the
*  Incarceration rate would plummet and the recidivism rate, you know people reoffending would plummet and not only
*  We don't have to
*  Hypothesize that's in fact what happens it happens in countries that you know
*  decriminalized drugs and it happens in countries where there's not such an emphasis on
*  Jailing people and there's more of an emphasis on getting them help and to answer your question
*  Joe I just looked it up because this is I'm gonna quote from the book usual cruelty again by Alec Harkin
*  Sonnets between 80 and 90 percent of the people charged with crimes are so poor that they cannot afford a lawyer
*  25 years into American incarceration boom black people were incarcerated at a rate six times that of South Africa during apartheid
*  the incarceration rate for black people in the nation's capital where I live is 19 times that of white people and
*  It's it still goes on every day and the net benefit to society
*  Well, there is no net benefit to society
*  In fact, it's been proven University of Pennsylvania the Quattrone Center did a study that showed that people they studied people who were
*  Jailed or freed for the exact same crime under the exact same circumstances, right?
*  And this one posted bail and that one couldn't and they found that the people who went to jail
*  Even if it for as little as a few days
*  We're 40% more likely to be arrested for another felony in an ensuing year
*  So because their lives fall apart while they're in jail and then you know, like I said, they lose their job
*  You can't just not show up for work for a few days and be like I was in jail
*  You know, so, you know and if I could I'm just gonna read the first paragraph of the book
*  Because this really I think puts it in stark contrast. Well tell people what the book is again
*  The book is called usual cruelty
*  by Alec Cara Katsanis, which is K. R. A. K. A. T
*  S. A. N. I. S. It's kind of a tongue twister. And so the book starts off on January 26
*  2014 Sharnell Mitchell was sitting on her couch with her one-year-old daughter on her lap and her four-year-old son to her side
*  Armed government agents entered her home put her in metal restraints took her from her children and bought her to the Moncada
*  County Montgomery City jail
*  jail staff
*  Sorry to turn the page
*  Jail staff told Sharnell that she owed the city money for old traffic tickets
*  The city had privatized the collection of her debts to a for-profit probation company, which had sought a warrant for her arrest
*  I
*  Happened to be sitting in the courtroom on the morning that Sharnell was brought to court along with dozens of other people who had been
*  Jailed because they owed the city money
*  The judge demanded that Sharnell pay or stay in jail if she could not pay she would be kept in a cage
*  until she quote sat out her debts at $50 per day or
*  $75 per day if she agreed to clean the courthouse bathrooms and the feces blood and mucus from the jail walls an hour later in a
*  windowless cell
*  Sharnell told me that a jail guard had given her a pencil and she showed me the crumpled court document on the back of which she
*  Had calculated how many more weeks of forced labor separated her from her children
*  That day she became my first client as a civil rights lawyer
*  So, you know, that's that's really it, you know
*  We have this mythology in America that the people in jails are bad people a lot of them were there just because they're poor
*  There's no other reason that Sharnell Mitchell or all these other people are there except they couldn't pay their traffic tickets. And what do you
*  You know, we talked about single parents, right?
*  What do you do your single pairing of a choice between feeding your kids or paying your traffic ticket or whatever?
*  These are not bad people and
*  the idea that we send
*  Like a more or less like a SWAT team to the home of this woman to pull her away from her kids
*  What kind of planet is is there where that's okay?
*  But it's it happens in darkness, right? It doesn't we don't see that right now. There's all this awareness being brought to
*  George Floyd and the rest of this stuff, which is really important
*  And I'm so glad that it's coming to light and people are starting to you know
*  Really rise up as one right as one group as humans not as black people or white people or or any other kind of people
*  But together but this stuff happens under under the shade of darkness where we don't see it
*  We don't see what happens in the jails and prisons
*  But what happens there in Harris County where Alec won this suit recently and now this did a wonderful piece on this but
*  About 20 people a year die in the Harris County jail awaiting trial, right? They're either murdered or something
*  Sandra Bland died in that jail, right? Yeah, and
*  You know, we have to just fucking stop. I mean this is this is
*  It's it's
*  Unconscionable to me. We have we have seven million people under the control of the criminal justice system, right?
*  We have more black people
*  Incarcerated right now or under control of the system than we ever had enslaved in any time in US history
*  Jesus Christ. What is that? That's crazy. The and the amount of human potential that's lost it boggles my mind
*  There's probably another Lennox Lewis that could have been right. There's another
*  Jay-z in there somewhere. I asked me Mill when he was on my podcast wrongful conviction
*  I said how many guys ever did you meet in jail who could have been another you and he said I can't even tell you
*  He goes there's so many talented people in there that just you know, yeah, I mean so
*  That's the and I think that that is part of the reason why wrongful convictions happen because the system is so overburdened
*  There's so many cases this the courts cannot possibly function
*  Correctly when there's this much churn and people just become processed people become numbers to be
*  Processed in and out of the system these cases in Texas were taking about five seconds the bail hearings five to six seconds
*  You weren't allowed a lawyer. You weren't allowed to say anything in your defense. Oh, and you got to watch the way it happens Joe
*  You'll watch a
*  Judge and it's all video. It's all recorded. So
*  We're at in fact, we were watching it before we came in where a judge will say here your charges
*  You're to answer me. Yes or no. Do you want to come a court-appointed lawyer?
*  Yeah
*  Again, you're gonna answer me. Yes or no. I just said yeah. No, I want a yes or no. I
*  Yes. Well when I asked you yes or no, what didn't you understand about that? Well, I said, yeah
*  Now your bail is doubled two thousand dollars, you know
*  They fuck with people these white judges are fucking with people of color like they don't matter and you know
*  It's interesting because you're probably sitting here thinking, you know, it's so overwhelming. You know, it is
*  It's overwhelming. What the fuck can be done about it?
*  What can we do about it?
*  But we have no choice but to fight back and mobilize and whether that means, you know
*  putting pressure on
*  Local politicians or you know, dare I say run for office yourself?
*  We need people that care we need people that will speak truth to power
*  By standing up for the the people that are being oppressed in this country as cliche as that sounds, you know
*  You're you're sitting here horrified by a few stories
*  You know each one is more heartbreaking than the next and when you actually see how it works in action and you live it with
*  these people
*  You know, it changes you it fundamentally changes you as a human being I could only imagine
*  I mean, I've never heard it laid out as well as you guys were laying it out
*  And I think most people listening this probably are gonna agree they they they knew but they didn't know, you know, and
*  It leaves you with this overwhelming
*  feeling of
*  Of helplessness like
*  Besides running for office what can be done? I mean we obviously need to change some laws
*  we obviously need to for first of all
*  the
*  Conviction and arrest of people for nonviolent drug offenses is fucking insane
*  It's insane and it's a giant part of the entire problem
*  The fact that you can arrest people for traffic tickets and leave them in a cage separate them from their children
*  That's fucking insane. All these things are immoral the fact that we're supposed to be the shining beacon of
*  Of
*  Democracy and civilization in this country. It's a joke when you look at our criminal justice system as you guys have laid it out
*  I don't want you to feel helpless though
*  And I don't want your listeners to feel helpless and here's why
*  The way that I when I start to feel that way and I do sometimes I start thinking of the
*  The strength that you have to have to survive an ordeal like John Restivo or Clementi Aguirre
*  Or Dewey Bezella or the countless other people that we have talked about
*  It is beyond belief to be accused of something you didn't do but to be accused of something
*  But to be able to survive in
*  Conditions that you know are popularized by movies
*  but the worst thing that could happen to you in jail often happen to these people and to have the resolve and
*  Not be helpless at some point you overcome that helplessness
*  Then I think it's in all of us to do something and that path is different for different people
*  Not everybody is going to go out and be a civil rights lawyer or a criminal justice reform advocate
*  But there is something that all of us can do politicians don't like to be embarrassed
*  So whether that is writing an op-ed
*  Writing to your local politician calling the newspapers like on the first episode of wrongful conviction junk science. I say look
*  Many of you are thinking what can you do? One thing you can do is
*  for instance just dealing with forensic science is
*  Write letters to your local criminal court judges find out who they are
*  You can look online and send them articles about the junk science of bite mark evidence
*  They're out there is their fear or their reluctance to change the fact that there are so many cases
*  Where that was how they got convicted?
*  That's part of this junk science that they would have to revisit these cases
*  That's part of it. Part of it is also our laziness in local elections as voters
*  In many states state court judges are elected. So a lot of them are not qualified and
*  You know
*  What is the answer to that? That's a bigger problem
*  But I think part of it is fear of bucking the system
*  But one thing we do know people act differently if they know that they're going to be embarrassed or exposed
*  The reason why the judge in Clemente's case that I told you about
*  That was the judge that wouldn't recuse herself in the Trayvon Martin case, even though her husband had represented George Zimmerman prior
*  She had to get outed and the press had to write about it and she got publicly embarrassed into being recused in my case with
*  Clemente the same thing the paper started covering it and picking it up and she finally had to give in so
*  It might be an uphill and a steep uphill climb, but we can either take it
*  Right we could either lay down and take it or get up and fight and
*  There's something that all of us can do and I and I can tell you Joe
*  I have seen and when I say that it transformed me as a human being
*  You know, I watched the pride of my ten-year-old daughter my eight-year-old son
*  My four-year-old doesn't get it yet and saying my dad stands up for people
*  You know my dad helped save his life and to watch them
*  You know these people become parts of our family. I'm telling you man
*  I you vibrate, you know to just to know that you you physically saved a life
*  There is no more gratifying thing in the world. No sporting event, you know
*  No cheap thrill at a club out with your friends drinking or you know, whatever
*  Whatever it is that get your rocks off
*  I can tell you that if you have warm blood in your body the reason why wrongful
*  Convictions and exonerations are so popular as a genre on
*  Podcasts or in movies is because it is that exhilarating to be able I think that it taps into
*  The best part of who we are as human beings
*  Really because I think that we are fundamentally good in many ways
*  even though we love to
*  We love to
*  We sort of celebrate people's downfall that's also intrinsic in human beings for some odd reason and we celebrate disasters
*  But we also intrinsically it's in all of us
*  To celebrate the triumph of the human soul
*  it really is and I and I feel like the reason it evokes that in us is because that is in us and
*  you know
*  you you will never find more gratification and being able to look in someone's eyes and
*  Say I help save his or her life and it forms a bond that is not
*  comparable to money or or
*  You know any kind of material gain
*  It is just it is it is the human experience on the most fundamental level and the best part of the human experience
*  So, you know your listeners who are thinking well, what can I do?
*  We could never list all of the ways
*  But we I think we've given some ideas and we would
*  Strongly encourage. I mean, you don't you never know what one letter will do
*  Clemente Aguirre wrote 74 letters when he was on death row to wild fucking people Oprah Oprah Sally
*  Jessie read defunct talk show host Maury povich Sally Jessie Raphael and only one person answered the Innocence Project
*  And that's not to pat us on the back
*  But you know you can write one letter and if it catches you the right person's attention you can change a life
*  I got another thing vote because voting you know in local races, especially local DA's races
*  local judges races
*  So few people vote that your vote literally could be the deciding factor
*  And it will have a ripple effect if they know that you're gonna vote for judges and for prosecutors who do the right thing
*  Who want actual justice and not just to win at all costs like you said before Joe
*  Then that is gonna make a huge difference
*  You know chase a buddhine just won in San Francisco by a very tiny Morgan less than less than 1%
*  He has decarcerated San Francisco by over 50% in less than six months with no
*  No spike in crime. No nothing, right? And so the fact is no other people needed to be in the first place
*  He's refusing to prosecute these low-level
*  Nudnik crimes that don't need to be prosecuted people that need help who need you know us as a society to give them a lift
*  Up not to brutalize them and put them through this this churn this miserable system
*  Go to go to F a mm.org families against mandatory violence
*  F a mm.org go to first 72 plus if you want to donate to that go to drug policy alliance org
*  It's an organization. I've been on the board of forever. That's fighting leading the what I call the war against the drug war and
*  And is doing such amazing work to help to to take away not only the the the legal penalties
*  But also the stigma associated with drugs and don't forget like in even in the presidential race, right?
*  over 20 percent of federal judges now have been appointed by Trump and
*  most of those judges the overwhelming majority of those judges are exactly the ones that we
*  You know sitting here talking about they're the ones we don't want on the bench because they could victimize so many more people
*  Many of them have been judged unanimously
*  Unqualified by the American Bar Association and they're appointing these Republicans are appointing these judges to lifetime tenures
*  in places where they're going to be
*  They're gonna see hundreds or thousands of cases
*  So if you don't think your vote matters in the presidential election if all you care about
*  You know if none of that other stuff interests you it should interest you and for the sake of your
*  Yourself your friends your loved ones your children
*  Those judges are gonna do a tremendous amount of damage. Hey Joe, I'll bring I'll bring this right
*  I'm gonna bring this full circle. Watch this. I
*  Remember seeing a comedy bit that you did it must have been like
*  2000 and you said
*  Two things were supposed to happen by now pot was supposed to be legal and we were all supposed to have jetpacks
*  I remember that bit really well
*  So my hope is that in ten years or five years or seven years that we come back and you say well
*  Another thing was supposed to happen by now and it's either happened or beginning to happen. We were supposed to decriminalize
*  You know low-level drug offenses or we were supposed to change this bullshit about prosecutors
*  Being and cops having immunity, right?
*  We're starting to see that with cops
*  I can guarantee you that if prosecutors knew that there were repercussions right that there were repercussions to hiding evidence
*  Okay, and not turning it over to the defense it happened in one of Kamala Harris's cases
*  Wasn't it one of her cases where the crime lab?
*  That wasn't her case where the crime lab had to send the DNA. I don't know if it was in California where the crime lab
*  Sees that the DNA doesn't match the defendant talking about Anthony a part of it
*  So I'm glad you brought this up
*  So where the crime you can tell him the story in a second
*  But the crime lab not the prosecutors a crime lab technician says, you know what?
*  this is wrong this DNA doesn't match the defendant and I'm sending it to the defense counsel and
*  What happens is that he gets put back first?
*  He gets out because they realize they have the wrong guy
*  But he gets put back on death row because he got he obtained the evidence illegally because it wasn't so so hold on
*  You can tell the story in a second
*  but my hope is that
*  We we start to beat back against the system so that we can come back on here
*  wherever you are whether it's on a podcast or it'll be your next bit or
*  Maybe you'll have a talk show at that point and so, you know what?
*  We
*  And you will let a match here today, yeah, I think we did I really do please tell the story
*  Oh, yeah real quick. So Anthony upon avish and again another thing. I'm gonna shamelessly plug my Instagram
*  It's it's Jason plumb because I post about this stuff all the time and I'll give people instructions
*  I'll put that for sure in my Instagram. So
*  Anthony upon avish this story is just even by my standards
*  Absolutely fucking mind-blowing right Anthony upon avish was wrongfully convicted in Ohio and sentenced to death
*  He's on death row in Ohio
*  I think was for 35 years when what happened happened right the state finally tested the DNA that they said didn't exist
*  So the test came back and showed that he did not commit this crime
*  So they withheld that from the defense. So there he is on death row the state knows he's innocent
*  They may have known all along I don't know but
*  Somebody I think it was a crime lab technician whoever it was some, you know
*  Whistleblower or whatever you want to call it sent that evidence to the defense. It's not the first time we've heard that kind of story
*  He gets out he's out for 17 months he's a grandfather he's a I mean the guy's terrific
*  they say if you talk to him, you'd fall in love with him you want to have him on the damn show and
*  He's sitting on the lawn with his grandchildren one day a SWAT team shows up and arrests him again
*  the state appealed his reversal saying
*  That
*  Only he technically only he was allowed to request his DNA
*  It's something in Ohio law, right?
*  The the person who's wrongfully or is who's appealing their conviction has to request the DNA themselves
*  So they said that since they requested the DNA he couldn't use it in his appeal
*  which technically was correct and so the
*  they're saying you should have requested the DNA that we told you doesn't exist and
*  Since you didn't we're taking it to the higher court and the higher court was left with no choice
*  But the father mean I guess they had no choice
*  They followed the letter of the law and sent him right back to death row
*  Which is where he is right now as we're sitting here Anthony upon a bitch
*  Un-fucking believable. Yeah, I mean and that's our that's our system at its worst
*  I mean, we're you know, Josh and are both involved in the case. We've got him Richard midgift down in Florida
*  Who is who's the the prosecutor? Who's the judge? Who are these people on the upon a bitch case?
*  I'll have to get you that information or maybe Jamie can find it, but it's Anthony upon a bitch a P a n o
*  V i t c h and I know it's Ohio, but I don't remember that is just sick. It's so sick
*  They know he's innocent. He's a hundred percent is science. It's DNA and it happened and it happened and it happens in a lot of cases
*  There we go
*  Could you how do you say that name I oh go Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Manson
*  Let's see. That looks sorry
*  That looks like the original process has confirmed through conclusive scientific evidence death row inmate Anthony upon a bitch brutally raped
*  And murdered Mary Ann Flynn in 1984. That's a 2006 article
*  Okay, so that is that's the article where they I got this because it's updated. Oh, it's updated July 26th
*  What is updated that's why I grabbed it because it said right here is July 26 2020 so confirms the guilt
*  DNA confirms the guilt. There it is
*  This is it's the top one July 24th. Yeah judge sends
*  Cleveland man
*  Okay, here goes common, please court judge on Tuesday rejected and imprisoned Cleveland man's challenge
*  There's 1984 conviction 1984 Jesus fucking Christ and death sentence in the raping and killing of a nurse judge Robert McClelland
*  Sent Anthony upon a bitch back to death row after Ohio Supreme Court last year reverses
*  2015 decision granting upon a bitch a new trial based on new DNA tests
*  Well, the Klauen in a five-page opinion expressed dismay that upon a bitch was sentenced to death based solely on
*  Circumstantial evidence presented during a trial that took place just 55 days after the crime and noted that the record of the case
*  Against upon a bitch was troubling. So what the fuck it's difficult to be the end of the line
*  Clown wrote he said legal precedent and prior court rulings leave this court with no option
*  Than to deny the motion for new trial on the basis that the defendant is unable to show a strong
*  Possibility that a new trial would end in a different result
*  Prosecutor Michael O'Malley said in a statement through a spokesperson that upon a bitch belongs on death row
*  The gamesmanship has gone for too long O'Malley said putting him back on death row ends the agony of years of
*  litigation that has tortured the victims family
*  Upon a bitch is appellate attorney Mark Devon
*  Did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday
*  fuck
*  It's a technicality that's what it is and if he can't use the DNA then he can't
*  He probably can't mount an effective defense Josh could speak to that better than I can yeah
*  I mean look there's all sorts of roadblocks that courts throw up
*  where you know you have to bring the new evidence within a certain time frame and
*  There's just these paralyzing. You know as hope was out. He was out
*  Yeah, Richard me. He's an old man. Oh my god. I mean he was in for 35 years. He's not a young guy
*  Jesus Christ so sick and he didn't do anything. It's um yeah, it's um
*  Listen because of this conversation we've had
*  Millions and millions and millions of people are gonna be aware of this that weren't aware of it before
*  What's the best place for them to start is it what is the innocence projects website?
*  innocence project org not the innocence project, but just innocence project org and
*  You know Jason, and I post about this all the time
*  At Dubin
*  Dubin dot Josh at Dubin dot Josh and Jason's at its Jason Flom
*  But innocence project org has great
*  Resources for how to get involved right we have like as you see we have purpose pains fight for innocence add your name to a petition
*  You can donate you can you know get yourself educated about what's going on in your community as Jason said our policy
*  Group headed by Rebecca Brown
*  That's just fantastic, so we would say this is a great starting point
*  Well, we're gonna send people to that starting point and we're gonna keep the word out and whatever you need if you need more
*  Podcasts like this if you need
*  Social media help if you need whatever you need all of it, and I'd love to actually I'm happy to help
*  Sorry, Josh. I would love to bring one of our clients on the show at some yes
*  So they can talk about the person's doing you know and I can't leave out one other person
*  I didn't mention, but who I I want to send love to is Michelle Murphy
*  Who was wrongfully convicted of murdering her own baby in?
*  In Oklahoma and served 20 years of a life sentence
*  the judge at her when her when her conviction was reversed
*  The judge said through tears that it was the worst miscarriage of justice he'd ever seen
*  another person we should mention by the way is
*  Whose case is still going on and people can make a difference as James Daly
*  James Daly has been on death row in Florida for 33 years for a murder
*  He didn't commit his co-defendant the real murder has confessed he confessed to me
*  He confessed to me that he did it. He told me why he implicated he implicated my client James Daly and
*  We we could really use people
*  I mean here's a situation where the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis
*  has the ability to call a clemency hearing and grant James Daly clemency at least to hear his case and
*  You know, they have basically communicated to me the governor's office that if he doesn't show contrition
*  That it's not gonna go well for him. So think about the catch-22
*  They put me in as his lawyer and him in
*  For a crime he didn't commit to which someone else has confessed to time and time again
*  2020 is airing a whole special about the case in my representation of him in October
*  We could use people writing letters to the governor
*  Ron DeSantis of Florida to grant James Daly a clemency hearing think about what I'm asking for right now
*  I'm asking for a governor
*  to exercise his power
*  To just listen
*  It's that difficult to just get a hearing just to listen this other man has
*  Confessed to
*  Inmates he's confessed to his you know friends. He's confessed to me
*  and then what he does is he goes into court and changes his mind and says I
*  Know long I want to talk about this because every time he confesses his family reads about it in the paper
*  They then call him. I have recorded prison calls where they're saying what did you do? Why did you confess?
*  We've been telling people you didn't do this now
*  We can never say that anymore
*  Your son will never come visit you again and then he changes it back
*  All of the evidence the physical evidence leads to him he's confessed yet
*  My client sits on death row for 33 years for a crime
*  He didn't commit the governor has the power to listen to his case the clemency scheme in Florida is is
*  Ron DeSantis has the the ability and the power to make it less of a joke than it's been
*  But they don't even hear cases of death row
*  Prisoners they don't even hear him
*  And the last word on Michelle Murphy
*  Because I know that you probably have
*  Exactly
*  I'm Michelle Murphy's case and this this touches on a number of things we talked about Michelle Murphy
*  Even at her original hearing the judge called all the lawyers into his chambers and said
*  There was a kid in the courtroom who was the witness against her
*  It was a next-door neighbor kid and the judge says how come the kid doesn't have a lawyer and the
*  Prosecutor says because he's not a suspect your honor is a witness and the judge says are you the only person here that doesn't know
*  He's the real killer and of course that was the case
*  But that kid killed himself before the trial and he was never able to be put on the stand
*  But Michelle more importantly to have 20 years of a life sentence. She was exonerated fully exonerated with DNA
*  And
*  Here it is five six years later
*  And she hasn't gotten a dollar from the state and they fought every tooth and nail any
*  Compensation for her and if not for people like you know the first 72 plus and other you know other good-hearted people
*  She would be on the streets. I mean, it's just it should shock everyone's conscience
*  The world needs more people like you guys. Thank you. This country needs more people like you guys. What you're doing is amazing
*  It's been an honor to have you on I appreciate you very very much and
*  Again, whatever I can do to help Joe. Thank you for having us. We're tapping you in I'm in I'm in thank you very much
*  Bye everybody
